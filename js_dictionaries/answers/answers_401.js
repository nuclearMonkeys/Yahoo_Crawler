	22054 : ["As others have said, both had some great episodes and both had some that were... not very good.  In both cases, there were reasons, as TOS was made for relatively little money and with very tight production time margins. TNG had more of both, but frankly, by 1987, Roddenberry had bought into his own myths, and he was never a good writer himself.
