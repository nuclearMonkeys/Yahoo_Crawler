As expected, Apple's attitude on environmental and sustainability issues was one of the main concerns of the stockholders present Thursday, followed closely by the company's immense pile of cash. But early harsh comments about former Vice President Al Gore's record set the tone. Al Gore speaks about the smart grid last November at a VentureBeat green-tech conference. (Credit: Josh Lowensohn/CNET) Gore was seated in the first row, along with his six fellow board members, in Apple's Town Hall auditorium as several stockholders took turns either bashing or praising his high-profile views on climate change. At the first opportunity for audience participation just several minutes into the proceeding, a longtime and well-known Apple shareholder--some would say gadfly--who introduced himself as Shelton Ehrlich, stood at the microphone and urged against Gore's re-election to the board. Gore \"has become a laughingstock. The glaciers have not melted,\" Ehrlich said, referring to Gore's views on global warming. \"If his advice he gives to Apple is as faulty as his views on the environment then he doesn't need to be re-elected.\" Another shareholder immediately got up to defend Gore and endorse his presence as an Apple director. And that wasn't the end of it. Two different proposals from shareholders were presented in regard to Apple's environmental impact. One was from the nonprofit As You Sow, which for the second straight year asked Apple to publicly commit to specific greenhouse gas reduction goals and publish a formal sustainability report; the second came from Herrington Investments, which proposed that Apple's board establish a sustainability committee, just like a compensation or personnel committee. As You Sow's representative, Conrad MacKerron, praised Gore, but also challenged him on not doing more to encourage the company to set specific public commitments. Forest Hill, Herrington Investment's senior portfolio manager also addressed some of his comments directly to Gore, saying making board members responsible for Apple's envronmental impact \"would make Apple a corporate leader.\" Neither Gore nor anyone else on Apple's board of directors responded directly. Both proposals were ultimately rejected by shareholders. Despite his apparently polarizing nature, Gore was re-elected with the rest of the slate in preliminary results. Proposals regarding changes to an employee stock plan, directors' stock options, an advisory vote on executive compensation, and selection of Ernst & Young as Apple's public accounting firm were all passed to complete the official business portion of the event....

Without the electoral college, states would accuse other states of stuffing the ballot boxes and having too strict or too loose voting eligibility rules, etc. The vote total was statistically tied in Florida.  (The founding fathers probably imagined that the electors, or people in the electoral college would be responsible pillars of their communities who would act in everyone's best interests, instead of being partisan cronies.

It's the total number of electoral votes that actually decides the president, not the popular vote. Why this system exists, is so that a high concentration of population in one state couldn't automatically override the desire of another state with low population.  This reduces the chance of one culture from overwhelming another culture, insuring as much representation as possible for the breadth of the country.   Of course, the system has certain flaws...for example, if you're a Republican in New York, or a Democrat in Texas, you might as well sleep in & watch the Game of Thrones marathon on TV rather than bother voting for the Presidential elections.
