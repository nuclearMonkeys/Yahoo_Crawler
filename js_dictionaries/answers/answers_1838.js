	97635 : ["It is because the cosmetics industry for black skin is about ten years more advanced in the US than it is here. The industry here caters mainly for white skin and the products just aren't available for black women. I know this from experience as a friend of mine has recently set up a business in London to cater for this niche in the market. She imports all her products from the US.

If the two of you love each other than age wouldn't matter and there should have been no reason to not be honest to your families. But I am sure that the families will be a little mad about not telling them, but you are still the same person that you were before.

You can't do this kind of thing for very long before you set your body to emergency starvation mode.  Then it will hoard every little bit of fat it gets, and you end up worse off than ever. The only effective way to lose weight and keep it off is to eat a well-balanced diet with sufficiently fewer calories than you burn off.  So you exercise as much as you can, and eat a moderate well-balanced diet with good protein and whole grains, fruits and vegetables.  Lose it slowly (no more than a pound or two a week) and you will keep it off longer.", 9625, "AA10235908", 0],

Me and my hubby are 11 yrs apart and though we are in different stages in our life we dont let age get in the way and my family accepts him for what he does for me not because of his age... Older men are more stable but be careful they get set in ways that we can not change.. dont worry if your family loves you they'll love him.

Most people's seam seals up by 17-19, but your x-rays will give your orthodontist an exact picture of how far developed your facial bones are. If the need isn't great, most orthos don't like to do this once it's sealed.  It's more effort than it's worth to have it heal as sturdy as it would have sealed naturally.
