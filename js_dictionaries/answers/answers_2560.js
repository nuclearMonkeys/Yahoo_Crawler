The congestion charge would rob me of Â£8 a day, the insurance would be too high and petrol prices are rising all the time. Home inprovements and holidays are out of the question at the moment as I am a single parent and every penny I have goes into clothing and feeding my kids, and keeping a roof over their heads. And a quick comment to Foo. Not everyone is broke because we're chucking away money on nights out. I have pretty much no social life to speak of. I don't drink alcohol at all, I don't go clubbing, I was dropped in the shite by my loser ex-husband.

Since the occupation of Palestine, Arab leaders have been promising the Palestinian refugees with help & money & political efforts to sent them back to their homeland, but it has always been empty words & promises.

	133831 : ["Yes I think they are. The Palestinian refugees are used as a political football to attack the state of Israel (the only truly democratic country in the Middle-East).   People like Yasser Arafat did nothing to help them. He and others like him just squandered and misappropriated funds given by the UN, US, EU etc. which should have gone to alleviate their plight. Most Palestinians are better off living under Israeli rule. Israel has an excellent health system, more than adequate social security and a progressive political sysytem.

As a Republican I would be all over allowing a free market capitalistic society to run full bore unregulated, And there is no doubt that would produce a tremendous amount of growth, But allowing that in light of the recent happenings is very unrealistic.

	133833 : ["Leaving bailout money out of the equation - hell no.  It is none of the government's business how much people make with their own companies' money.  That's up to the stockholders. To interfere in free enterprise and the ability of anyone to earn as much as they can is pure socialism.  Class warfare is initiated when government begins to dictate how much money is 'fair'.  In a free society, government must stay out! Now, if bailout money is involved, that is another story.  But in the first place, the government shouldn't be bailing out anyone!

	133839 : ["It depends really. I generally mix and match a bit of both, but buying supermarket brand can be a real gamble sometimes with food especially. The Tesco brand olive oil for example stinks up the whole house whenever I use it (except on salads and it isn't really good enough to be in a salad) so I actually wasted money rather than saving it. I'm trying to make my way through the bottle. So the key is really to try a bit of both and see. Things I never buy generic: Soda (have tried it... blech) hand/face soap (have tried it -- works fine but only in hot water otherwise it's like using a rock) clothes (except maybe very plain things and pjs, socks, slippers, accessories) shampoo make-up (I don't usually buy make up but when I do I buy brands because I'm not willing to experiment with my face/hair, etc.) chocolates/some biscuits (yuck) Things that I buy generic (unless the price diff. is only a few cents between them a brand name): flour/sugar/rice/pastas/tuna/milk/yogurt (things that are basically just the same) cereal (not from anywhere though) digestive biscuits bread canned food But with the recession and all a lot of brands are becoming as cheap as generic products and there are some incredible promotions (sometimes on things I can stock up on too :D)", 11194, "None", 0],

If a professional dog trainer is not an option at this time, or if you want to trt training your dog on your own (a great way to bond), I'd suggest you    A friend recommened it to me a few years ago, and I was amazed how quickly it worked, which is why I recommend it to others.

	133851 : ["Technically speaking, anyone COULD provided they have the knowledge, the resources, the right dog and the ability to properly handle a dog without being abusive or too soft. But how many people out there have all that? Most people don't even know how to get the right dog, let alone the knowledge and the dog handling skills. I know I could do it if I really wanted to. I know the right people to go to to help me find the right dog and develop the skills, but until I do those things then no, I can't do it.    So yes, anyone COULD but not just anyone WILL. That's the problem with saying \"anyone can\" is that the average person out there thinks \"That means ME!\" and will rush right out and do it without stopping to think that there are proper steps to take to training a personal protection dog. That's why most people end up with an aggressive mess instead of a well trained, reliable dog. So I'm with you, I don't say anyone can do it, I say if you plan on doing it then take the proper avenues and that's where it's going to cut 99% of people out of the running because they just don't have the motivation to do it the right way.", 11189, "9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa", 1],
	133852 : ["You're right a majority of dog owners who did the training their self would just make their dog aggressive, which is in no way protection. People do not realize there is a difference between aggression and protection. My very good friend has been training dogs for 15 years and has a protection trained German Shepherd, nicest dog you have ever met and is even a therapy dog...But if a command is given he will do what is told, he does not react on his own unless a real threat is encountered, just like a protection dog should..No protection dog should go around growling and trying to bite anything that moves, that is a poorly trained dog that should more than likely just be euthanized for it's safety and others.", 11189, "wUg7iYU1aa", 4],
	133853 : ["No I do not think that the average person should try to train their dog to attack or for personal protection. You should pay a professional for this & I also feel that only certain breeds can be trained in personal protection, such as the Doberman. I think people who need protection should go with a gun or alarm system, if an intruder breaks in my house, I'm CERTAINLY not going to count on my Chihuahua's to save me or any dog for that matter, I would rather have a gun to blow the head off the guy.  If a dog does protect his family in a sticky situation, then more power to that dog, because that dog, obviously knew the difference, but I still feel a dog should not be trained to do so by the average person. That's why there are certain breeds being trained correctly by professionals who know what they are doing. I do feel that anyone is capable of basic training & obedience, however when it comes to a dog being used for protection, people need to be aware that not all dogs can be trained to provide protection & certainly cannot be trained by just anybody. If I wanted a dog for personal protection, I would get the right dog from the right person. I would not want a potentially unstable dog around my family or child.", 11189, "s4dxFFPjaa", 3],
