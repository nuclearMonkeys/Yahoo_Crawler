	138891 : ["Hi, There is SO MUCH misinformation on both Shingles and Chickenpox out there. She won't give your child SHINGLES, BUT, she could very well give him the CHICKENPOX.  You are at risk of it too, as you can get chickenpox more than once. Not sure if your child had the VZV vaccine, but, that may give some immunity to it.  It can take up to 2 weeks for the virus to show up after exposure.  If she is on the antiviral now, she may be ok for   time.....I would have her wear clothing that covers the area that is covered in shingles if possible (if on the arms or legs or torso) not share cups or utensils with anybody (this time of year, it is a bad idea to do that anyway if it sounds like you have a possibility of chickenpox happening),  and, afterwards, (this is a good idea most times following a large gathering during flu/virus/cold season), spray lysol on door handles, bathroom surfaces,  sink fixtures, phones, remotes, steering wheels, and use paper towels for everyone. chickenpox can present with  a feeling of unwell, as well as a rash unlike most others (very distinct). Fever, vomiting are not uncommon. Good luck to you all.  I wish I had something to suggest for the pain....she should call her doc, and have them prescribe something.", 11405, "YoITtCbfaa", 1],
	138892 : ["I've had shingles before, and i agree that it was no picnic. However, my DR said that it was not contagious. The infection (or whatever you want to call it) follows along the nerve lines and that's how it's spread. It's brought on by severe stress (least that's what my DR told me... and I agreeed. b/c at the time I was working 2 full time jobs, and going to the gym everyday. This went on for about 3 -4 months, and I got Shingles sometime in that period.) As for stopping the pain, I just rode it out, as I had no idea what it was until I saw the DR, and by then - it was at the end of it's course. I had tried anti-bacterial soap, Cortizone-10, Calimime lotion.... So my DR gave me nothing.", 11405, "None", -1],
	138893 : ["The Ultimate Warrior while not a true wrestler, but a fighter in the ring would dominate most of the competition out there today in the ring.  He is a fierce and strong competitor while most of the so-called wrestlers today are more babyish and whiners.  His style while not what some people want to see matches what sells for the crowds today instead of the boring 1 hour wrestling matches.  Television roles need for their entertainers to perorm in slots of 10 mintues or less and the Ultimate Warriors style is typical for this.", 11409, "kqnjFd23aa", 0],
	138894 : ["When I sold the nicotine patch back in 1992 we learned a ton about smoking and nicotine addiction, as a respiratory therapist I knew a lot of information about the product but had now idea about the chemicals involved in quiting.  It takes the average smoker at least five successful attempts before the real one hit and not only is cold turkey not a good option, but a change in lifestyle is necessary.  Nicotine has a tremendously short half life making it one of the worlds most addictive drugs even worse than heroin nd crack but without guns and violence. however as soon as we want another.

	138914 : ["REPORT THAT TEACHER.  He has NO right to put his hands on a student.", 11406, "MeOOUhHkaa", 6],
	138915 : ["The teacher has no right to touch the kid when the kid is merely being an ***.  I'm not sure how I would handle that situation in his shoes, but schools have policies for students and teachers.  And I know for a fact that physical confrontation isn't an acceptable practice unless there is a real reason for it.  And a kid with an IPOD doesn't qualify.  Now if the teacher had walked up and snagged the IPOD away...I'm thinking he'd have been well within his right.  As a parent, I'd want the IPOD back because they aren't cheap.  But there's the other thing.  Jr. wouldn't be getting the IPOD back.  Either I'd be claiming it for my own to rub in the fact that Jr. doesn't deserve the toy because of his bad behavior in class, or I'd sell it to the highest bidder.  Teenagers can be such a pain.  How much you want to bet that the rules will change regarding your permission to use IPODs in the future.  You have your trouble making friend to blame.  They are both responsible for the altercation and should both be held accountable at the right level.  The kid should be suspended in the least for causing the problem.  The teacher should probably accept the fact that he isn't in control of his temper around nasty teenagers and should probably think about another line of work.  And depending on just how rough he was, he is probably looking at a assualt charge.  You cannot attack someone just because they aren't respecting the authority the school system has vested in you.  I wonder what the school's policy is if a kid just decides to totally disrupt class like that?  I'm willing to bet that the teachers would be permitted to remove him from the class room.  But if he gets physical in trying to avoid removal that would probably mean the police would have to be called in.  And then it gets really ugly for the teenager.  But it would be a better solution than what your teacher is described to have done.", 11406, "None", -1],
	138916 : ["A teacher, regardless of whether he has 4 students or 1,000 students, should NEVER lay a finger on a student! If the student refused to put the iPod away, he should have just sent him to the office for the principal to deal with! And in a headlock? Tell the principal! That is not right! A teacher has absolutely NO right to do that! Not only is it not right, but what would've happened if he had injured the student? I feel sorry for the student, although I do agree in that it was partially their fault for not listening to the teacher when asked kindly by the teacher.", 11406, "None", 0],
	138917 : ["They're still together and singing, and have a new album coming out in March.  They're actually pretty good now - - - been getting really good reviews and the like.  They're independent on their own label so they don't have any radio play, but apparently they tour a lot and pocket just about all the money from it.  I just read an article about them not too long ago that said that as an act they are one of the most profitable musical groups in the world -- I think mostly because all of their earnings go straight to their own pockets.  That pretty much blew my mind. Kinda interesting.  I'm not a huge fan or anything, but I did listen to their new song that's on iTunes and it was pretty good.", 11410, "db063898487ddeb1588583cb8d319980aa", 0],
