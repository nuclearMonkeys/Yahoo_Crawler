I think her being in the middle of the soccer field is because he likes soccer and she kinda became part of it too, by laying in the middle of it, so maybe he would like her too, by association. Also soccer being a team sport, he crawls under the blanket but his friends do too. The favorite blanket represents safety and a nice place to be. So that guy never liked her at all, knew about her feelings and just ignored them… your friend is just dealing with the feeling of rejection (a hard one to overcome) by becoming part of what he likes, part of the team, under the safety of the blanket, it's a nice place, a safe place, and then they all do something together…they eat.

The golden ball is meant for good players. and be objective, he is a GOOD PLAYER, isn't he?... On top, is verbal violence a better example? We always underline the visible violence  (on a tv screen, easy to see) but the other one, the verbal one is always ignored...
