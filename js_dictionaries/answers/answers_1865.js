	98985 : ["With all due respect, He DID accomplish EVERYTHING that He can here to do! Yes, He did indeed come to earth, and Jesus being a real historical figure- the evidence is so documented, NO historian would embarrass himself by making any claim that Jesus was a myth!!! The Jews see Him as a conquering King and not as a humble servant- but He is both! His first appearance was a humble servant giving His life to fulfill the law and to provide the PERFECT Blood sacrifice. The Old Testament said \"without the shedding of blood there is NO remission or forgiveness of sin\" Jesus came to be that perfect blood sacrifice by shedding His blood on the cross. He was crucified or sacrifices His Blood on the Passover just as they sprinkled the blood on the doorposts at the real Passover. They sprinkled the blood on the top which dripped down and on the two side posts making the sign of the Cross on the door. That is why Jesus called Himself \"The Door\" and if you study the Passover Meal, you can see Jesus all through the whole meal! Please watch the YouTube video for a complete explanation-    Jesus certainly IS the Messiah and He fulfilled 333 prophecies concerning the coming Messiah!", 9681, "Xxo2mNs3aa", 2],
	98986 : ["The Jews were waiting for a messiah to guide them out of captivity from the romans and to restore the tribes. Jesus followers didn't comply with him considering the fact that they inspiration he used to be a messiah. He was a healer first then a instructor of love peace and concord. To be a messiah he would have needed to be a warrior and leader of warriors, a killer of men. Plenty of what was written in the gospels chosen via the romans was once to serve there teachings, and now not all of it's the fact. His fellow Jews not ever inspiration of him as a messiah/warrior", 9681, "bDYtO57iaa", 0],

	98990 : ["Question: John Morrison or Randy Orton.. SO SO SO HARD.. Yes, I actually am kidding; the answer is easy: John Morrison.. Randy Orton is an overrated worthless piece of crap looked up by many as a f'n GOD.. Seriously, those people need to get a life.. Orton has no personality at all.. Neither does he have charisma, and his voice is so robotic.. His gimmick isn't believable anymore.. He is supposed to be \"The Viper\", a kick a*s heel that can beat anyone.. Well, without his bitchez, yes I am talking about Priceless, he wouldn't be nothing.. Heck, he begged Mark Henry to not beat him up, but at the end he was left in the ring helpless and looking like a coward.. Randy also has become very boring in the ring.. He does thousands of headlocks, some drop-kicks, and the RKO.. On the other hand, as much as I won't try to overrated John Morrison, his moveset is way better than Orton's.. He is a high flier combined with some technical moves, and that's huge. He is faster, and his gimmick is all right with me.. Also, in relation to Orton's gimmick, he isn't being a good heel.. As much as I hate it, he has many supporters.. Hell, he has more fans than Cena does.. I can always see tons of people cheering for him.. But yes, then it comes the thing that some people say on how, say Jericho, gets cheered even if he is a heel.. Well, I think the difference is that people RESPECT Jericho for the illustrious career that he has had over the last many years, and they know the legend that he is.. But then we have Orton.. Why do people cheer for him..?? He is no where near being a Legend, and if he was that good of a heel, he would be hated by many..  That's why I say his gimmick SUCKS.. LOL, they changed his gimmick from the \"Legend Killer\" that actually worked, to a joke as a \"Viper\".. Morrison has charisma, some mic skills [I think he sometimes talks to fast and his words get a little mixed together], and pure wrestling talent.. I hope he doesn't slow down that fast.. His style of wrestling is difficult to be kept up as years go by, but CURRENTLY, John Morrison is miles and miles better than Randy Orton.. BQ: Right now it's hard to tell.. He broke his achilles tendon and that's a serious injury.. BUT sometimes the wrestlers that come back after an injury get better in the ring while others just fail.. If Edge comes back good, maybe not better than how he currently was, but if he comes back DECENT, he could get 3-5 long World Titles reigns, or he could still be the Tag Team Champion too.. Any how, I think he'll do just fine.. I just hope next time he becomes a World Champion, he can keep it for more than 6 months..", 9677, "2UkdpGHFaa", 0],
	98991 : ["Morrison, he has far more charisma, he has a better character and can play the part better than Orton plays his, has a far better look, far better wrestling and wider moveset, funnier and way way more entertaining on the mic, and he is flashier (which if you look at people like Michaels, Jericho, Flair, Hogan, that really does make a difference) Orton Charisma is the only thing keeping him in the main events, his emotional wreck character sucks (I'm sorry, but it does and you know it), Orton has far too much oil and is really skinny for trunks. Orton's moveset is about as wide as Cena's (the only reason you don't notice it is because his moves are technical and could actually do damage, where as Cena's wouldn't even hurt). Orton's promos are always the same, with him making an excuse and saying he he's the greatest and he deserves better. And he's not flashy at all, and lets face it, the flashy guys are far more entertaining, unless you find HBk, Y2J, Flair, Hollywood Hogan, Bret Hart and a bunch of others boring. Sorry I don't think Orton is anything special anymore. I saw potential in him a few years ago, but I don't like his current persona. And Edge is currently at 9, HHH will get 15 if Vince does the right thing and doesn't let anyone get as much as Flair, and seeing as Edge is like the next generation HHH (title wise), I say he gets 5 more, but spread out over time until his retirement.", 9677, "8DIkez2uaa", -1],

Amazing!  We don't deserve it. If God didn't exist, then how do we?  And why would we let you die before having the chance to know God and live forever with him?  That is totally wrong of us! And you might not try to convince us that we are wrong (which we aren't by the way) but most atheists do, and won't listen when we defend what we believe.  And i know, God didn't say it would be easy, He said this would happen, so i am not surprised at it at all. When you are unwilling to hear then it does no good.  A comment here and there, yes, but mostly we should be praying for God to open your heart instead of trying to do it ourselves.  But when God provides opportunity, we have to try. Treat others the way you want to be treated.  Don't you want people to care about you?  To care about the decisions you make?  To keep you safe?  That's what is going on here. I do not dislike it when atheists try prove that God is wrong.  It helps me to grow in my relationship with God.  When people do that, i see how lost the world is, how much we all need Him.  What i hate is when you say we are wrong, and then don't let us tell you what we think.", 9683, "psWcGAfsaa", 0],
