	28702 : ["Strength and size are definitely factors. But they do matter less than training, reflexes, technique, and arguably \"functional\" strength. A bodybuilder might have large muscles. But the way they utilize them doesn't directly translate to martial arts. Not that it doesn't help of course. Size and strength definitely make up for a lack of techniques with huge disparities in size. Like +100 pounds advantages. But carrying weights is different than resisting a person. On the other hand a lot of martial artists (primarily the old school types) underrate the importance of athleticism in successful application of technique. So while many can execute techniques well they don't always have the speed/strength/agility/power/conditioning to cause the necessary damage or utilize it against much larger opponents. But it depends on a number of things.  Bob Sapp was always a joke in MMA and Kickboxing. Even though he's losing here to someone with better technique he had a few notable wins. He weighed about 340 pounds in his prime. Here he has an over 100 pound weight advantage. Slammed Nog around, and still got subbed. ", 4459, "lpU2dnqsaa", 1],
	28703 : ["Last resort, self defense HA!!! The traditional martial science i study and many similar systems have a very interesting take on it. The first actual techniques (there are 15 and these systems are (identical except for order and finish), are ALL OFFENSIVE techniques. Which makes for interesting conversation. Why? Well think this. Why would something that is suppose to be a defensive concept and promote at least 1 of these systems as a system that is used by bodyguards thru-out the world,including world leaders, WHY? And when you actually do look into traditional systems and see the actual technique, and those forms (which contain tons of info not taught directly) be applied it makes you wonder what does defense mean? In terms of techniques i always referred to it as a defensive move/block/trap, etc.turned n its head (offensive technique). And you figure it out that defense is nothing but offense after the block or what not. So what is the difference? Just who started the fight and who finished the fight. BTW running is perfectly fine. Your alive right? That all that matters. If you do not need to fight than do not fight. Run or walk away or talk your way out of it,whatever. Violence only causes more trouble. A good movie is The Legend of Billy Jack. Some real good lines as well. Some are still referenced in movies and not many even know or know who or why.", 4460, "None", 0],

	28705 : ["No. First, not everyone who knows how to fight and fight well are interested in competition or even notoriety. It may come as a shock to a mind of a child and the immature, but there are people who are very good at what they do because they love what they, and they don't care for fame, popularity, much less if anyone knows it.Second, MMS and UFC are not the only venues in the world for martial arts. There were such competitions long before MMA and UFC came into being and that is just counting the legit ones and not the underground tournaments.", 4461, "MgvdiWspaa", 0],
	28706 : ["It comes from the same mentality who think navy SEALs are the top elite in the world and they are not. FYI team 1 thru 4 are Spec Ops not SF. It also come from same mental cases who think SEALs can ot be beat in hand to hand. Ad that is last thing on their mind and training. You fight how you train. You train how you supposed to fight. It is cyclical that 1 part of the equation actually is part of the solution. There is why most MMA fighters are terrible at certain things. It goes to their training and what they lack. Personally i have beaten some of the best in the world at hand to hand (seriously not kidding) (it was down to him or me). And i had only my TMA and few things like this. And this was an individual trained in the military hand to hand. (L.I.N.E. training, initially he did have lot of TMA as well). It nothing  like what MMA fighters do. Fighters fight, warriors lay waste to the enemy. MMA is a fighter mentality. And that is their stumbling block and thought process.

	28710 : ["Size is definitely a factor, and at its extremes can make up for a lack of skill. But I don't think BW to small HW is enough of a disparity. Especially with someone untrained. Sean is a pretty tall BW at 5'10. He probably walks around at 155-160. Not sure how strong he really is. But I do know a lot of the elite MMA gyms intentionally have people train with people of varying sizes for experiences. There are lots of stories of people getting the job done with weight disparities. The Thais in particular are known for this in the earlier combat sports days. ", 4464, "lpU2dnqsaa", 1],
