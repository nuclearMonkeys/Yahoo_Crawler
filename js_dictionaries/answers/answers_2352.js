	123411 : ["The displayed Certification of Live Birth on Obama's \"Fight the Smears\" website has been proven a forgery by several experts in document forensics and computer graphics. His Kenyan grandmother, Sarah Obama, gave an interview that has been sworn by the interpreter to be her words where she emphatically insists she was in the delivery room when Obama was born in Mombasa, Kenya.  Another of her grandson's who was not yet born in 1961, argued with her and tried to get her to say Obama was born in Hawaii, but she insisited otherwise.  Then Obama was legally adopted by his mother's Indonesian husband. Any possible claim he ever had to US citizenship was lost when he renewed his Indonesian passport to get into Pakistan in 1981 at age 20.  In order to have regained any claim he had as an American citizen would have required he swear an Oath of Allegiance at age 18, which would have been nullified when he swore his Oath of Allegiance to Indonesia to renew his passport. By formally renewing his Indonesian passport, he committed an expatriating act against the USA.   It will create a Constitutional crisis if he is sworn into the presidency and he has not produced documents to prove his status as a natural born citizen eligible to take office. If he does not do this and he is sworn into office, no laws he signs, no treaties or trade agreements or other International documents will be valid. His orders to the military may be refused to obey as a non-citizen.  Foreign leaders of other countries may refuse to recognize his authority.  Because the Democratic majority in Congress will not Impeach him due to their complicity in covering up this series of crimes, most of the Congress will also be aiding and abetting a coverup to hide their own guilt.   If you want to read the actual court documents in the suit which is now before the SCOTUS, go to www.obamacrimes.com.  Apparently Justice Souter didn't think it frivilous as they gave Obama 30 days to respond to Phil Berg's suit.  And to prove to you the displayed COLB is a forgery.  The digital scan of the COLB shows the text editing when the layers are lifted and you can see his sister's name embedded in the digital imprint underneath Obama's name.  There is language on this COLB that is always used for foreign birth registries, which Hawaii allows.  His mother was too young to confer citizenship on him at 18 since he was born in Mombasa.  She had to be 19 ro make him a natural born US citizen.", 10748, "7ffb0rSaaa", -3],

U MAY find affordable housing if u make at least 100k a year, but certainly not by the beach or nice areas close to the great parts of LA. Housing that normal people can afford exists only in the Inland Empire. No offense 2 people who live there, but it isnt a desirable place to live according to most in LA. Sure it's built up now, but ppl in Los Angeles don't know anything past East LA & consider whatever is beyond it \"no mans land.\" If u work in LA and live in Inland Empire, plan on 3 hr commute - one way. Gasonline is insanely high. Registration/car ins. costs at least triple here. u can never own your own home in a good neighborhood. Which poses a problem if u have kids, because the good neighborhoods generally equal good school districts, so if u have children, its a nightmare.

We thought mass murder, war crimes, and crimes against humanity were a bigger priority to protest against. We seem to be really focussed on the past now, to WHOM? ?????? I guess you missed the news that Bush had to finally sign a withdrawl agreement with the Iraqis, making protest against that war silly, as its end had been agreed to. (You also seem to have missed the fact that, once that agreement was in place, Obama changed his campaign promise to \"I will abide by SOFA.\" There was hardly any protest over the Afghanistan War, since that country WAS involved in 9/11.) I guess you also never heard the several thousand times Obama said he would refocus attention on defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan -- which the Iraq war caused Bush to ignore, allowing the insurgents in Afghanistan regain strength and territory. It's not the left that's lying here. What we \"protested\" about Bush's deficit was his slashing taxes only for the rich, before causing spending to sky-rocket with his horrible policies and war of choice against Iraq. We don't think that rich people should pay a LOWER tax rate than their least-paid employees. We also oppose spending for the sole purpose of destruction of the lives of innocent people.

They have access to free health care through Medicaid but every year, there are dozens of kids at the local school who have not gotten their shots.  Free shots.

	123441 : ["The two are completely different.   When we ask government for a drivers license we voluntarily become a regulated enterprise, promise to obey all the terms and provisions of the vehicle code (which apply to us), which is a strange quasi-contract mixture of police powers regulations for safety (to which everyone is subject) and stuff you volunteer into, such as buying car insurance.  In a few years government mandates to buy health insurance will fall before the Supreme Court because government can not force you to sign a contract.  Your right to contract is unlimited, you own it.   Here's a bit of dicta from the US Supreme Court in a 5th amendment case, in which they explain that your legal status affects what government can make you do. Hale vs Henkel 201US74 Year 1905. \"Conceding that the witness was an officer of the corporation under investigation, and that he was entitled to assert the rights of the corporation with respect to the production of its books and papers, we are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation, and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the State. The individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the State or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to criminate him. He owes no such duty to the State, since he receives nothing therefrom beyond the protection of his life and property. His rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the State, and can only be taken from him by due process of law, and in accordance with the Constitution. Among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law. He owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights. Upon the other hand, the corporation is a creature of the State.  It is presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public.  It receives certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them subject to the laws of the State and the limitations of its charter.  Its powers are limited by law.  It can make no contract not authorized by its charter.  Its rights to act as a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obeys the laws of its creation.  There is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers.  It would be a strange anomaly to hold that a State, having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises, could not in the exercise of its sovereignty inquire how these franchises had been employed, and whether they had been abused, and demand the production of the corporate books and papers for that purpose.\"  …………", 10753, "AA10294213", 3],
	123442 : ["Since drivers' licenses are state-issued, this is a state matter, although the Federal Government can influence the states by threatening to withhold Federal Highway Funds (the way they did to get every state to raise the drinking age to 21). In short, there is a philosophical difference here. Driving is a priviledge granted by the State and when driving, one has a responsibility not only to himself, but to others on the road. Making auto insurance mandatory can be seen as a cost of enjoying this priviledge, part of a citizens obligations for th overall safety of others. Health care is a personal issue. Requiring a person to purchase a product for his own personal use seems to many like requiring all citizens to buy auto insurance....whether they drive or not. Somewill argue that the requirement will bring down the costs associated with the uninsured getting care in emergency rooms and so on, but the same could be said for mandatory auto insurance. Imagine how premiums would go down if all non-drivers were forced to buy policies as well.
