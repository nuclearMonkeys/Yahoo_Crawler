I prefer to deal with things up front and accept people regardless of how angry they make me.

It's this ... when 2 people break up, no matter what the reason, it is because the two of them are NOT a combination that works.  If they could have solved the problem, they would have, and they wouldn't have broken up. The surest indicator of incompatibility is breaking up.  So even if the two of them had someone managed to patch it together and limp along, it never would have been a happy relationship. Love is not what makes relationships work.  All love does is make us want it to work. Don't waste time regretting your decisions.  You did the absolute best you could at the time, given who you were and what you knew and whatever issues inside yourself you have brewing there. Spend only enough time to understand what errors you made.  Then try to see that you don't repeat them in the future.  If you don't learn from your mistakes and correct them, you are bound to repeat them. But aside from that ... no one is perfect, and that includes you too. So don't waste time kicking yourself because you weren't perfect. You pain in the chest is mostly the blow to your self-esteem.  It's about you, not about him. It is very very difficult to live with the fact that someone could love us and know us for so long ... and now hates us.  It kicks us in our self-esteem.  So admit it and face your pain and allow it to be there ... the largest amount of our pain is always caused by our resisting it.  So if you can allow it and relax with it, it won't hurt nearly so much. Good luck, sweetheart.", 10008, "None", 0],

	107637 : ["I hope you really read and understand my answer. It is in two parts. The first is, how do you teach proper manners & assertiveness? What I did was start at a very young age, basically drilling it into her head, saying things over & over. Plus, I did not tolerate any disrespect what so ever. You need to be consistent. One of the examples are, before we stepped foot into a food store or out to eat, I demanded that both of my kids were to behave. We would rehearse it. I would tell them, you are going to sit down & be little adults. Period. If they didn't, then there were consequences. However, usually just simply talking to them, telling them what I expect from them, 99.9% out of the time worked.  Another thing I did was make learning fun but to the point. When my daughter became interested in boys, I went through all the scenarios with her. If a boy says, if you love me, then you would have sex. I would tell her, wrong! If the boy loved you, he would wait. We also would sing, take the key and lock 'her' up (to the sound of London Bridges) .. meaning her virginity is something very important. So much so that she will never forget her first time. What is boils down to is talking. Talking about anything & everything. Also letting your children know that they can come to you with anything & everything. Out of all my friends, I was the only one that could take my children everywhere and they were well behaved. Confidence came into play by reinforcing good behavior. Now .. with the birthday party. Let me see if I understand you correctly. You really didn't want to go because you knew there was going to be a pinata there and you only allow one treat per day but went because it was your niece. I hope that is what you are saying. You are the Mom, you are allowed to make any rule  ... with that being said, perhaps your child should have been allowed   1) only have the pinata candy  or 2) because that was a special day, you could break the rule.  If you choose # 2, explain to her that yes, your rule is still in effect but today is a special occasion (nieces party). It wouldn't occur everyday unless you allowed it. Besides, being assertive would mean diving in there with all the other kids & grabbing the candy. Isn't that what you want? The only way to avoid occurrences is again, either make an exception for (say) a friends birthday party or tell her she is only allowed to have a treat at the birthday party, but that is her one choice for the day. Again, talk to her, explain things, but you have to be rational as well. Again, be consistent. If you say, you are punished for xxx amount of time, stick to it. She must understand what she did wrong and how she will in the future correct herself. Talk, talk, talk... (and have patience) One more bit of advice which I found very helpful. Keep your kids active. Whether it is sports, reading, dance .. whatever .. as they grow up, if they are busy, it keeps them away from drugs and/or other bad influences. It also gives them a sense of pride, respect & self-esteem.", 10010, "RBUEWneXaa", 2],
	107638 : ["You bring up a good point about balancing assertiveness and manners. My husband was raised to be exceedingly well mannered, but anytime assertiveness is called for, I have to step in since he simply cannot stand being assertive. He'll also sometimes be exceedingly polite to others while greatly inconveniencing me. I think you're probably guiding her well though. If you see her being very timid, you can gently encourage her (don't make her feel bad) to be more assertive. Perhaps give her a polite way of phrasing what she needs. Kids learn by example though, so if you model the proper behavior, she will follow.  Your second point is about only having one treat per day as being an unbreakable rule. I think that there can be some exceptions to rules on rare occasions. I think there should be some flexibility in parenting, as there needs to be flexibility in how we deal with the world. But it should be made clear that it's a special exception, and then going back to reinforcing the rule. So yeah, having a single bonus piece of candy from a pinata is not going to ruin the \"rule.\" Be cautioned that extreme rigidity with everything may, in time, make you seem too strict and she may rebel.", 10010, "8bbfa431101641e2d4bbc6cd3aae3f1eaa", 0],
