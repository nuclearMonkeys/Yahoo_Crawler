The 80GB and 160GB models in stores currently do not have the capability of playing PS2 games. The NTSC 20GB plays PS2 games via Hardware (Emotion Engine). The Emotion Engine is a CPU developed and manufactured by Sony Computer Entertainment and Toshiba for use in the Sony PlayStation 2 video game console. It was released in Japan and North America. It has been discontinued. The NTSC 60GB (best model) plays PS2 games via Hardware (Emotion Engine). This model of the PS3 was also released in Japan and North America and has been discontinued. The PAL 60GB model plays PS2 games via Software (Emulation) hence the level of compatibility was reduced. It was released in the Europe/PAL region. This model has been discontinued. It excludes the PlayStation 2 \"Emotion Engine\" CPU chip. However, it still keeps the \"Graphics Synthesizer\" GPU. The latest PS3 to provide PS2 compatibility was the old 80GB model via Software (Emulation). It was released in North America and Korea. Like the previous three models, it was discontinued.

Nascar and EA Sports are currently working on a new contract to let EA Sports continue the Nascar video game franchise but if a contract can't be reached, Nascar could let other game developers make the next game. One rumor has Codemasters making the next Nascar game. If you own a PS3 you can play a Nascar game but it will not be just Nascar by itself.

You can make the hard drive bigger up to 500gbs for like $90 (but how are you going to use up all that space? it a lot I barely used 30gbs on my upgraded 160gb motorstorm ps3..)
