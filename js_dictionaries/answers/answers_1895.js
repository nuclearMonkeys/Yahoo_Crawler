Not only do cats have very nasty claws and hunting instincts, but they could be in danger with a ferret because ferret's play extremely rough and have a very strong bite (even if they don't mean to bite hard it's possible that they can really do damage to your kitty).", 9735, "3f5370be7b5c563cb2a83926751e513daa", 0],
	100488 : ["Yes, ferrets and cats can be just fine in the same household. First of all, ferrets don't kill cobras; that's mongoose, which is a totally separate species.  Both ferrets and cats will kill mice.  In general, I would say that ferrets are more in danger from cats than cats are from ferrets, but that's only because cats are bigger and have sharper claws.  Ferrets' teeth are no sharper than a cat's.  (I've been bitten by both ferrets and cats, and I can tell you, the cat did a lot more damage; cats are much bigger, after all.) We have four cats and one ferret now, although we used to have two ferrets.  Once the two species establish that neither one is \"prey\", they will either play together or ignore each other. In our house, the ferret is more likely to pick on the cats.  (Actually, usually, our ferret just wants to cuddle up on a cat belly to go to sleep.)  Still, in the beginning, one of our cats was somewhat mischievous, and would pick on one of the ferrets (who was especially gentle.)  This consisted of the cat trying to wrestle with the ferret, and the ferret chattering and getting away under a piece of furniture or in a ferret tube.  (It's always a good idea to have cat-only and ferret-only hiding spaces.) Nowadays, none of the cats mess with the ferret because he will nip their bellies in response.  They know better! If you get  ferrets and kittens when they are both young, they should be able to get used to each other and play together.  They should have separate food bowls and food areas, just to make sure everyone is getting enough to eat.  (We actually feed our ferret cooked chicken, under supervision, and just let our cats eat kibble and the chicken leftoevers.)    Animals tend to play easily together when everyone has a full belly!   Even the nicest pets get grumpy when they're hungry. All of our pets sleep on the bed with us, and we have no problems.  Ferrets truly love to sleep with other creatures, whether that means people or cats or other ferrets!  Ferrets and cats are just fine together.  Just supervise them closely in the beginning to make sure there are no \"bullies.\"", 9735, "2faffcfbdb625c125cab4428f17fbbd5aa", 1],
