However, this is never going to work.  My sister went to a private, all-girls high school in Pennsylvania, despite living in South Jersey. She had a dress code, which required her to wear either her spring/summer uniform (during warm weather) or fall/winter uniform (during cold weather). She also had to wear a formal pair of shoes, although she was allowed to wear sneakers during the spring. However, during the summer after her junior year of high school/before her senior year of high school, she bought a nice pair of size 8 Adidas Falcon W cleats. Of course, during her senior year of high school, she changed from her school shoes to her sneakers once her school day was over.

Also your score isn't bad, and it's not like it decreased by 100 or even 50 points.  It's possible you even got the same amount of questions wrong as last year, or even did slightly better.  In my book, it's pretty much the same score.  :)", 6451, "OHT3IxA8aa", 2],

	44821 : ["I prefer 'Anonymous's' answer to the next two, for accuracy, even if it's less grammatical. But it overlooks the fact that degrees are broadly taken as a measure of current worth, and the grey area between plagiarism and the orthodox research techniques expected of students.The answer pointing out you can be removed from a professional body is interesting, but incongruous given the relative degree of time and effort involved in acquiring each, and the relative esteem in which they're held. Anonymous's answer begs another question: What percentage of graduates do institutions themselves think have been inappropriately awarded degrees? Bottom line: the question is not answered satisfactorily by current practice, degrees having status over and beyond memberships of professional organisations. Yahoo!

	44826 : ["This sounds like kids being kids. It's not that serious. They're 9. You should ask what punishment the other child got. I'm assuming he was given detention or something similar. Hopefully his parents were notified as well. If the other kid wasn't punished at all, then you should meet with the principal. Elementary schools don't usually suspend kids unless they do something very serious. It's not that unusual for little kids to get in fights. If your daughter did the same thing to another kid, I'm guessing you wouldn't think it's that serious.

IMO, schools should be teaching more \"life skills\"...like personal finance (how banks work, how credit cards work, checking & savings account, etc.). For over 40 years they've been teaching Home Ec (learning to shop for the best groceries deals on a tight budget, cooking,etc.). I think it's not different from them teaching personal finances. FWIW, it's actually the parents responsibility for it, but many of them don't know themselves.  Anyone who's dropped out of high school barely knows how to read.  That's why they are in minimum wage jobs and broke all the time.", 6441, "NO1hpAMiaa", -1],
