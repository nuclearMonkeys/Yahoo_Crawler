For example, it is tough to find job for me in my area. People seem to smile and pretend to be friendly when they want to gather some information about you or smth like that but then they gossip about you and even can \"put a knife into your back\" when you don't expect. But I have noticed no matter what Filipino or Chinese people do, they are always welcomed. For example, 40 Filipinos were brought on working visas to USA and were provided with jobs as teachers when many Americans and residents can't find a job in the same field. Before they were brought here I was subbing 4 days a week, now only half of the day a week. There are alot of things that I can't explain about the negative attitude to people from former USSR. I hope and I truly wish to meet sincere American people who are open-minded and kind-hearted. For now, I have mixed feelings.", 9730, "None", 1],
