What is his crime for simply being ill? and not being able to comprehend his surroundings and clearly not sound of mind which makes him not as aware. Which makes him unfit to fast. Obviously some Muslims users and user Capitalgentleman have told you the correct answer while other users were being very rude and very disgusting. People who are ill, Ar-Rahman has permitted them to be exempted from fasting and charity can be given on their behalf. Ar-Rahman Almighty is very merciful towards His servants and never burdens anyone on the things they can't do. Your poor ill father deserves to be treated with kindness and make sure to have someone pay for charity on his behalf.

Second, if you accidentally and unknowingly drank water, Ar-Rahman has given you the water to drink and your fasting is still valid. So, be thankful. User truthseeker is correct. Also, just don't do things that can break your fasting, be nice to others, don't cause fights, don't insult or gossip about others, etc. These kinds of things you should watch out for and refrain from doing to protect your fasting for God.", 7375, "NX7SgWWcaa", 1],

The Illuminati was formed by a group of successful, highly learned, progressive men in Bavaria who tried to educate the populace and gain women equal rights while at the same time exposing the corruption and dominance of the Catholic Church and the King.

Also, those garbage books you mention are full of slanderous, malicious lies and full of garbage nonsense and clearly the authors of whatever books you are mentioning, have done nothing except slander the noble, pure, innocent Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and attempting to tarnish his good name. I assure you, the garbage you've just mentioned will never define the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and the beloved Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, will never be defined by the likes of slanderers. Furthermore, the Book of Allah honors the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, describing  his many cherished, beloved characteristics that makes him the perfect exemplary for mankind and many authentic hadiths honor the Prophet in every way as well regarding his personality, his beautiful appearance, and his perfect qualities that God Almighty bestowed upon him. “There is certainly a good exemplar for you in the Apostle of Allah.” {33:21}{The Benevolent and Kind Apostle}. “There has certainly come to you an apostle from among yourselves. Grievous to him is your distress; he has a deep concern for you, and is most kind and merciful to the faithful.” {9:128}. “And indeed you possess a great character ” {68:4} “You are liable to risk your life out of grief for their sake.” {18:6}  “Allah has sent down to you the Book and wisdom, and He has taught you what you did not know, and great is Allah's grace upon you.” {4:113} “But Allah will not punish them while you are in their midst.” {8:33} “Nor does he speak out of {his own} desire; it is just a revelation that is revealed {to him}” {53:3,4} What you just told in your question does NOT reflect the Holy, Generous, Truthful, Living Quran and does NOT reflect the true Prophet of Allah and it will never represent the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.
