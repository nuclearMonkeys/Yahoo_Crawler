As with any choice a person has to make, especially when it comes to terms to religion, regardless of the religion, I always say to think carefully about your choice. So pray about the matter again and give it careful consideration. Somewhere I said, that becoming a Witness is a lifestyle. You are a Witness 24/7 no matter what. You cannot change things to suit yourself. So make you sure are ready for it all. 1. Start a study: You're a woman, so a sister should be the one conducting your study. She will be your study conductor and basically be the one you'll feel most comfortable with. She'll bring along someone else on your study. If anything happens to her and she is unable to fulfill her duties, someone else will take her place. I'll also suggest you make note of who she brings, see who you feel most comfortable with and so forth. 2. Attending meetings. 3. Join the Theocratic Ministry School. Here is where you receive what we call 'talks'. Your study conductor will tell you more about this. 4. Become an unbaptized publisher. This is where you go house to house. I know most people said they were scared and so forth. 5. Make a private declaration that you want to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses. 6. Get baptized. This is basically the final step - once you are baptized you have made a public declaration that you are one of Jehovah's Witnesses. WARNING: Please note, and don't say no one told you:- *IF* you commit a serious wrong and you are unrepentant, then you are disfellowshipped in the case of baptism, and removed as an unbaptized publisher if you are not baptized. Disfellowshipping is a serious matter - 7 million Witnesses automatically turn their backs on you. Removal as an unbaptized publisher - less repercussions though some may be particular in their contact with you. If you commit a serious wrong and you are repentant, you'll be reproofed - publicly or privately. Publicly; an announcement is made to the congregation saying XY is on public reproof. Privately; no one knows. So there you have it. EDIT: Forgot to mention. From when you study to the point of baptism you need to make sure that your lifestyle is a clean one. No immorality, no birthday celebrations, no holiday celebrations, no drugs, no smoking, etc etc etc.", 10680, "None", 0],
	121916 : ["My question - why is it going \"very slow\"? Whats holding YOU back? If your studying and making even some progress, you have not been \"rejected\". That does not happen unless you are argumentative or are refusing to give up some addiction like smoking, drugs, alcohol, unmarried sex, other things. Maybe your \"living\" with someone to whom your not married. Maybe your employed doing something you know Jehovah doesn't like. Things like masturbation can prevent progress.   I don't know your situation, and I am definitely not making any accusations. From 30 years experience studying with people, and my own experiences, I know these things can get in your way, they WILL hold you back.  The problems need to be fixed, and your life needs to be cleaned up, before any real progress is made. If the above isn't the problem, have you asked the person you study with to study more often, or for longer periods. Usually they are glad to accommodate. If that persons schedule won't allow it, because they need to work or something strange like that, ask if someone else is available. You will need to go through the entire study program. You cannot decide that you only need chapter 3, 8, and 11, and then your ready for baptism. It doesn't work that way. Be patient, go with it, take in as much knowledge as you can. When you qualify(ask your study person) start in the preaching work, the ministry. Stick with it, be patient, eventually you will qualify for baptism.  Always remember, Jehovah knows your heart, and you cannot hide anything from him. If you desire to serve him, he will provide the strength do do so.", 10680, "6oAlBJUIaa", 2],

	121920 : ["The Patriots and the Saints, barring injuries, with the Pats coming out on top. Good offense doesn't do it anymore; you need a great offense to make headway anymore, and Sean Payton not only installed a great offensive plan in New Orleans, but he has an arsenal of top-notch talent to pull it off: Brees at QB, McAllister (inside) and Bush (outside) running the ball, Bush, Colston, Henderson and Copper catching it, and an underrated blocking back (Karney) who sure made himself known that Sunday night in the Dallas game. Payton might have revolutionized offensive play in the NFL with the way he used his two star running backs -- allowing him to mix his play selections lot more effectively and dangerously -- and spread the wealth among his receivers, who were all dangerous. Plus, toss in his love of the element of surprise -- maybe a trick play here, relying on a lightly regarded player there -- and the Saints could be one of the best offenses the league has ever seen. The Patriots, meanwhile, took a page from Payton's playbook in the offseason. Not having a game-breaking receiver was what kept them from the Super Bowl last year, so Belichick and Pioli went out and brought in an entire squad of them for Brady to play with (Moss, Welker, ex-Saint Donte Stallworth). The fact that they got as far as they did without one last year should tell you just how good this team is. They reloaded in the offseason and the Colts suffered a few big losses, as did the Chargers (especially on the coaching side), so the Pats will be back in the big game in February. Plus, if anyone can find ways to stop a multi-faceted offense, it's Belichick. So the Pats will prevail over my Saints.", 10671, "i2TLvGDKaa", 0],
	121921 : ["The Eagles will not play in the Superbowl next year.  While both their offense and defense are above average, there are better teams.  The Eagles offense lacks a real receiving threat which substantially affects their ability to bring a balanced attack.  The Cowboys can bring a better, more balanced offensive scheme each week.  WIth Tony Romo, Marian Barber, and T.O. the Cowboys have legitimate scoring weapons in all aspects of the offensive game.  Defensively, the Cowboys are bringing in a new 3-4 system which should frustrate many of their opponents because the 3-4 defense isn't seen as frequently as the more standard 4-3, especially in the NFC.  Therefore, their defense could bring a new headache to their opponents as they prepare a gameplan.  As much as it hurts to say, the Cowboys, on paper, probably stand the best shot of making the Superbowl for the NFC.", 10671, "AA10681626", -2],

There is a good reason for Floyd's behavior.  He's scared.  I realize his game is to get under the opponent's skin.  However, thus far, Pacquiao has been a very cool headed man and fighter, regardless of the magnitude of the fight.  Floyd feels he needs this edge and it's the only way to gain it, by attacking Pacquiao's character.   His little game is become more and more pathetic.  He sounds like the mouthy schoolyard punk who picked on the wrong kid, only to find out that, not only is this kid not afraid of him but is willing to fight him back.   The mouthy kid runs home and continues to talk trash from the safety of his front porch.  I've seen many like him.  This whole thing about the testing is just an excuse because he knows it's unreasonable and Pacquiao would be unwise to give in.  Also, the 6 vs 65 million is just an exaggeration and pointless.  If Floyd were a True champion, there would be NO reason not to accept the challenge.  The only thing I find more unsettling about this whole drama is that Team-Pacquiao seems to be playing right into Floyd's hands.  The long layoffs certainly benefit Floyd more than the busy schedule, against the welterweight division's best, benefits Pacquiao.  Floyd is CLEARLY waiting for Manny to ruin himself.  The Margarito fight is NOT a good fight for Pacquiao.  W,L or D, he will lose a bit of himself in the ring.  Add to that, his growing political responsibilities.  Manny will be ripe for Floyd in about a year.   I see what Floyd is doing.  But, as a boxing fan, I have lost ALL respect for him.   Be a man Floyd.

	121930 : ["I was on one of our US Military National Shooting team competiting with a Match 1911 issued to me.  I have Gold EIC badges in Pistol.  However - I totally dreaded the yearly qualification with the 92F - because I never could shoot it anywhere near as good as the 1911.  I actually had to buy a 92F on my own and constantly practice to keep proficient with it. Buying a 1911 today is only OK if you are shooting in matches.  I used to carry a 1911 for CCW - but - today I carry the Springfield Armory XD in 45acp - it gives me 13 rounds - and has a ton of other features the 1911 totally lacks - like a loaded chamber indicator, and indicator in the back the hammer is ready, and best of all - no stupid slide safety to get in the way.   But - this is not my only CCW pistol - my other is the 20rd FN FiveSeveN.  Loaded it weights exactly half what my XD in 45acp does - and best of all - I can hit fox and coyote sized target to 200 yards with it easily.  Lots of farmers and ranchers have stopped keeping a 22 Hornet in the truck - and carry these.  I live in Alaska - so - this is very sensible pistol to use when the cirtters pelts are in the prime. If you must carry a 1911 - Look at the Kimbers with 8 rd mags.  They have a totally re-designed grip safety that interrupts the firing pin in the slide - it is 1,000% more safe than any other 1911's on the market I have seen.  That - and they shoot like a dream.  Our police station received a pair of top end Grand Raptor II from a drug raid - I was totally blown away by how nice they are - much better than my Gold Cup. Bottom line.  The XD and Sigs are the 45acp to carry today.  But if you want to be cutting edge - the FN is allot more firepower.  I put over 2500 rds through my FN and carryit all over Alaska gold panning, fishing, hunting, atv and snowmaching to -55F over the past 2 years.  Heck - I bought it 2nd hand at that.  I developed a little hitch in the slide when pulling back - I sent it to FN.  Three weeks later UPS delivers to my door step a brand new gun, case, 3 new mags - the whole kit.  If this is how FN does business - they have my business. That - and I have the aftermarket Jarvis threaded barrel and the SWR 'Spector' suppressor they make for it - this is an over the top awesome combo.   Good Luck", 10679, "cR7Sf4cjaa", 2],

There is no 'hard and fast' rule about how long someone associates before he or she is ready. You should complete the book you are studying, just to have a well-rounded and informed basis for your dedication, not just an emotional need to belong to Jehovah. I know that learning about him IS emotional, what with all the truths that you never knew before-but it needs to be more. Satan can elicit emotion in people, and you want to be sure your decision is based on more than just that.  You sound as if you're anxious to make the truth your own, and that's wonderful, but Jehovah is a God of order, and we need to do things according to his order. Churches in christendom will baptize you first, and THEN teach you, (possibly), but that's not what Jesus said for us to do. He said for us to 'go therefore, TEACHING and baptizing\" not the other way around.  Don't rush yourself, but don't be discouraged, either. Just keep studying, perhaps ask your study conductor for the Insight volumes-they will aid your study, and help you understand deeper things, so you won't feel that your study is so slow. Absorb the things you are learning, and meditate on them. Above all, pray to Jehovah to guide you in your choice.  Once you have made the commitment, expect those who know you, but who do not appreciate your new found love for God-to become VERY interested in your religious inclination. Even those who have no religion themselves will become experts in what witnesses believe and don't believe-as evidenced by some of the responses you have already gotten here. If you needed more proof that you are on Jehovah's side, you don't need to look any further than that. Satan will try anything to discourage you-he is like a lion, who picks out the young and inexperienced for his meal. He did it with Eve, and he will try it with you-but you can do better than perfect Adam and Eve did; you can maintain your faithfulness, and prove Satan a liar.  Your zeal is one weapon you have against Satan in this time. Your new love for God can protect you if you rely on prayer and your brotherhood. You are not alone-we all have gone thru what you will face from the world, and from Satan, and if we truly belonged to Jehovah, we are still here. Those who did not truly belong to Jehovah have fallen away, and some have answered you today. Be careful of them. Satan will NOT forget that you used to belong to him, and he won;t stop trying to make you compromise your faith until Jehovah stops him. But you can do it. Many millions have in the past, and many millions are currently remaining faithful.  Soon you will be making your dedication to Jehovah public, and the angels will be rejoicing, along with your brothers and sisters. Agape, Leslie", 10680, "DapNp1Kxaa", 6],

Surely you would ask, \"How well do you REALLY know about this person?\" It is a similar thing with Jehovah.
