	115560 : ["Exactly, to say that God had different (down right vile) laws for people 2000 years ago is a HUGE cop out of an irreconcilable problem. These rules depict a barbaric ancient culture, plain and simple. It completely baffles me that so many people think a loving God would EVER have such vile laws. I read crap like that in the Bible and I immediately throw it out as garbage and realize it is nothing more than writings from savages. It amazes me why people (especially women) would want to cling to such primitive times when a person would be stoned to death for something as stupid as gathering sticks on the sabbath. The irony is many Christians think the world is becoming more evil, if only they could go back to the barbaric times from which their religion was spawned. Edit: Maars, what part of a loving God would give such vile laws at ANY time. We have come a long way, but according to the cop out, I mean old covenant the people were just following GODS laws.

Neither party is married, so the offense is to the girl's father, as she doesn't have a husband. The man is forced to marry her and pay her father to satisfy the dishonor brought upon the family by the girl. This was a traditional practice in primitive cultures, where the sexual acts of women didn't only bring individual condemnation, but shame to her male relatives as well.

It is not like they are an 'official' list that was determined by some world body or universal vote or other measurement (heck, who even says there has to be seven?  why not 5 or 10?).   The oldest of the Seven Wonders lists is the 'Seven Wonders of the Ancient World' which has been around in some form since before the time of Christ and was essentially a tourist must-see checklist of man-made items around the Mediterrian Ocean put together by Greek historians and travelers.  It generally includes the following (all of which are gone now, except the pyramid):   - Great Pyramid at Giza - Gardens of Babylon - Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (Turkey) - Statue of Zeus - Mausoleum of Maussollos - Colossus of Rhodes - Lighthouse at Alexandria Probably the second most popular and well-known list is the Seven Wonders of the Natural World.  It generally includes the following: - Grand Canyon - Great Barrier Reef - Harbor at Rio de Janeiro - Mount Everst - The Northern Lights - Paricutin Volcano - Victoria Falls There are many more 'Seven Wonders' lists that are more recent and whose exact members are somewhat under debate.  These include: Seven Underwater Wonders of the World, Seven Engineering Wonders of the Modern World, and the Seven Tourist Travel Wonders of the World (which usually includes a mix of man-made and natural features including the Grand Canyon). As to why it is probably on the various lists...  it really is one of the most amazing natural features on the planet and not like any place else.  A few other canyons may be as wide or as deep, but none have the combination of width, depth, length and variety (or number) of rock formations and spires.
