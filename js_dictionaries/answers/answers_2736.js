I believe that no one has the right to take a life except the Lord, as He died for us all. I would never condone what a killer did, but in the end, I am not his judge, Jesus is. I pray that you never have to experience anything bad with your job and thanks for even doing that job. God Bless you. + The convict will someday get his punishment in Hell . Edit: Vin....that was the OT and the old Covenant and the NT replaced many of the barbaric things that were from the OT. In the NT, which is the time of Jesus, the OT replaced many things but still kept the 10 Commandments. \"Thou shalt not kill.\"", 11549, "None", 1],
