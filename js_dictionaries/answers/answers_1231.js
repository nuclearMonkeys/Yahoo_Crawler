You can continue to guess, and spend more money and most likely not get it repaired or you can spend some money for a proper diagnosis by a properly trained, experienced, skilled, and equipped professional and save your self the frustration, the time and the money. Now IF the person, damian shaw who states he is an auto technician at UTI which is a training school is willing to do that for free as he states, then let him do it and hopefully he can get it right on the first try, but I would not personally trust someone that thinks so little about their value as to do that work for free...especially on a vehicle that has between 130 and 200 thousand miles and obviously needs a very skilled mechanic testing it. . Similarly I would not trust any professional's judgement that he is so willing to give it away for free.The expenses to become a mechanic are no less than many other professions and in many cases far exceed them.
