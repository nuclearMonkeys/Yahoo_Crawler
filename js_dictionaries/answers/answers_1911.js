	101306 : ["looking at Obama's positions: his domestic policies of eliminating outsourcing to help the American lower-to-middle class will somehow affect PGMA's plans of expanding our country's booming BPO industry. limiting call centers from mushrooming might be better for us since it makes our government rethink their unemployment and underemployment solutions. it's interesting what Obama meant by \"recruiting an army of teachers\"... we already have experienced teachers, Special Education teachers, and Early Childhood Education teachers applying their craft in the US. but what happens to our teachers here? it's the dilemma of letting our teachers go to sustain our economy with dollar remittances and sacrificing the standards of our education. as for 30,000+ Filipino World War II veterans in America who weren't given a cent and continue to lobby for it... i don't think it's the President's job to give that. but being the man that Obama is, he just might support a senate/congress bill to finally grant that. as a whole, this hardly changes anything about US-Philippine relations. the US has always been an ally that never mettles with our domestic affairs and always support the Philippine President. infact, i really don't get the hype regarding Obama's effect on the Philippines.

	101313 : ["No, the relationship of the U.S. and the Philippines is too intertwined to really drastically change because of the election of Barack Obama. Many of the officer core of the Philippine Armed Forces have been trained by the United States. Also a lot of the decision makers on the part of the Philippine Government or on the part of the opposition have links with the United States. One only has too look at the number of times Philippine Officials or the Opposition and their immediate family members visit the United States; in order assess the ties between the two countries.  However, the Barack Obama presidency will not drastically affect the Philippines. Mr. Obama is inheriting an economic catastrophe; he will turn inward for the better part of his first three years as president. United States participation in world affairs will decrease and this will mean decreased aid to the Philippines. The United States will pull out from the major trouble spots of the world as it reassess its role as world policeman.  This situation will be worse for the Philippines because the Armed Forces will definitely experience decreased support from its U.S. benefactor. The Philippines is fighting a two front insurgency; the first with the communist NPA and the second with the islamic MILF; without continuous U.S. support and intensified fighting the insurgency will eat precious resources needed for development. So in terms of the decreased U.S. support which an Obama presidency will surely push; the Philippines will be worse off.  ", 9772, "nvWttmg5aa", 1],

It is what they call \"United States Interest\" and it comes in many forms. It may be economics, business, etc. Yes to those whose personal/business interest has benefited, No to those who has not. Example our military was given aid by the US, BUT with materials/hardware that was no longer used even by their National Guard, so where the money go? It is more wiser that we look outside the box and we can see that we can purchase hardware other than the AID. Many countries offered brand new military hardware with better terms BUT what we got are US made 2nd hand from other countries. Even other ASEAN countries has better front line jet fighters such Mig 29 or Sukhoi 27 or F-16 while we had to content with S211.

	101325 : ["Broken Social Scene's \"You Forgot It In People\" is a great album to be listening to for the first time while having a personal epiphany. When I was a teenager, all I wanted more than anything in the world was to become a rock star. I announced to the world, my plans, despite the fact that I didn't have much talent. My parents scoffed, positive that if I tried to persue any sort of career in music that I would surely starve to death. (In their black and white thinking, a career in arts or entertainment meant either millions or starvation, no in-between.)  Then I got sick. My illness prevented me from persuing my dreams. Well, long story short, my illness was entirely psychological. I made myself ill so I wouldn't have to do the thing I feared, persue musical success. I just realized this while listening to \"You Forgot It In People.\" So now I have to do two things: 1) Join Toastmasters (public speaking/performing is a huge part of my \"illness,\" 2) Set goals for myself so I can incorporate music into my life, without needing to be \"successful.\" Spiritually, I feel better than I have in about decade.", 9775, "PTO467M7aa", 2],

These, of course, would include call center companies. Media-based: not so much better - There is a sense of exclusivity in most of Obama's statements telling us that the U.S. is better off just being the U.S. This means third world countries and developed countries will always have a fine line distinguishing them.

	101336 : ["Wishing someone well after they sneeze probably originated thousands of years ago. The Romans would say \"Jupiter preserve you\" or \"Salve,\" which meant \"good health to you,\" and the Greeks would wish each other \"long life.\" The phrase \"God bless you\" is attributed to Pope Gregory the Great, who uttered it in the sixth century during a bubonic plague epidemic (sneezing is an obvious symptom of one form of the plague). The exchangeable term \"gesundheit\" comes from Germany, and it literally means \"health.\" The idea is that a sneeze typically precedes illness. Virtually every country around the globe has its own way of wishing sneezers well.  For the most part, the various sneeze responses originated from ancient superstitions. Some people believed that a sneeze causes the soul to escape the body through the nose. Saying \"bless you\" would stop the devil from claiming the person's freed soul. Others believed the opposite: that evil spirits use the sneeze as an opportunity to enter a person's body. There was also the misconception that the heart momentarily stops during a sneeze (it doesn't), and that saying \"bless you\" was a way of welcoming the person back to life. We persist in the custom of saying \"bless you\" or \"gesundheit,\" mainly out of habit and common courtesy.", 9777, "None", 1],

They think that will give them brownie points with God. What they don't realize is that the church is a business. A money-making business. Of course they want to recruit as many donating members as possible. And the best way to do it is to convince Christians that there will be dire consequences if they don't help (and that it is their duty, as good Christians, to \"save the heathens from the burning pits of hell\").
