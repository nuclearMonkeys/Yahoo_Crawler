	99843 : ["absolutely asinine!!  there is a reason microsoft had to extend their waranty, because a 70 percent lemon rate is rediculous. All the 360 has going is Halo and i fear that will even be too short because 8 gigs of space just isn't enough. The PS 3 without question is the more powerful system and has a ginormous advantage using the Blu-ray. See final fantasy 13, Haze, Metal Gear Solid, Heavenly Sword (currently out)  and Soul Caliber 4 on the upcoming titles for PS3 not to mention eventually God of War 3 and Resistance (the best release title in recent memory). Microsoft cannot survive on one game especially when the system is completely unreliable. Microsoft was an idiot when they decided that normal DVDs would suffice for the new generation of systems and if you don't believe there is a need for more disk space see the specs on Heavenly Sword, there is more space used for the audio on that game than there is on an entire DVD. There is a reason that all dual platform games are designed for Sony and ported to the 360. Lastly, see the backward compatibility lists for both systems, the xbox is in the hundreds and there are thousands of PS2 titles that are playable on the PS3. if you are an every now and then gamer, the 360 will do i suppose (although the Wii would probably suit you just fine), but if you are a true gamer then the choice is obvious, the PS3 is simply the superior system considering you are not only getting an incredible system but a Blu-ray player as well.", 9710, "L25xWGPOaa", -1],

Also options are quite expensive, but they have a lot to choose from. Toshiba: A bit more expensive then a Dell, but they last. They have great power, but options tend to be a bit limited on most models. HP: Most expensive, and you might have to go in for repair.

Sony's not perfect anyone remember the PS2 disk read error or the laser getting so close it tore a hole in the disk. but again 360,PS3, and wii are all good systems with good games none is better than the rest they are all better in different areas like 360 has better/bigger game library right now. PS3 has better technology/free Internet play. and wii is getting people to play games who have never pick up a game controller in there life (supermom anyone?) so cut this stupid *** fanboyism out OK? otherwise you'll be just another corporately brainwashed cash bag", 9710, "807c75362df274d8b3a3b48b8e123e5aaa", 2],
	99855 : ["Blame the Fanboys, I easily have the two consoles and that i like the two one among them. I already knew that i grow to be going to purchase a PS3 even with listening to human beings say that it sucks, yet i did no longer care, the PS3 has extra unique video games that i like to play. each console has their titles that I liked, I merely like the PS3's extra. The 360 and PS3 fanboys make me ashamed of being an proprietor of the two,the worst are the 360 fanboys who in user-friendly terms play the FPS video games, telling human beings to get a 360 merely because of the fact of Halo and the Gears Of conflict video games, no longer worrying if that guy or woman like FPS video games or no longer, they are going to fail to point different super video games like Alan Wake, Forza sequence, lost Odyssey and others because of the fact they are no longer a FPS interest. If i'm gonna tell somebody to in user-friendly terms purchase FPS video games ( as nicely the 360 or PS3 exclusives ),i'm going to tell them merely get it for the laptop in the event that they might run it. i do no longer very own any FPS video games on the 360 or PS3. All in all, i like the two consoles, they each have stable video games to play and that i've got a much wider decision to compliment between. As for the Wii, i do no longer very own one, yet how am i able to assert that the Wii sucks...It has offered extra platforms than the 360 and PS3.", 9710, "q0TUFQ4Yaa", 0],

	99881 : ["Sector 9 is a good brand, one of the boards I own is made by them (Off the wall 2 model). Trucks really depend on what kind of ride you're looking for. I'm a fan of the sidewinders just because those trucks give me the same feel of being on a surfboard and pumping for a wave, with the ability to rip sharp turns. However they can be a bit dangerous for crazy downhill rides. I recommend their charger trucks for their versatility, though sidewinders have a surfy feel to em (which is popular with surfers for obvious reasons, though hardcore skater types don't like em much. to each his own.). As far as bearings goes, Bones is tried and true, I swear by em. Bones reds are good bearings without having to break the bank. Not much of a difference at all from the Bones Swiss performance wise, but the swiss are more durable as time goes on. Either are worth the money for sure though. The sector 9 brand wheels are pretty good out of the box. orangatang makes some of the best longboard wheels i've used, which i recommend if you want to get away from the stock wheels. As far as durometer goes I personally like the mid range for cruising (my orangatang 80a's are perfect for that). They're soft enough to give good grip and a smooth ride, and when you break them in they also can powerslide pretty good. have fun :)", 9716, "8ywIgWOcaa", 0],
