	2858 : ["For the last 70 years I have always thought of Cyprus as a Mediterranean island, both when it was a British possession and later after it had become an independent nation. The fact that Cyprus is a member of the European Union (EU) should surely tell you that it is European.  At no time could I have thought of Cyprus as Asiatic. For that matter, I don't really think of nations in the Middle East as Asiatic. For me, Asia starts somewhere around Iran and Kazakhstan.  Yes, I know that Turkey is mostly in Asia, but that is an exception.", 464, "None", 0],

I can't even count how many some of the smaller ones have. With so many neighbors, so many opportunities to cross borders (easier for EU countries), so many wars and threats of and realized invasions, ignorance of geography might be fatal.  The USA has not had an invasion across its borders for many years.  Three (War of 1812, Mexico/US border in 1913, Alaska and Guam after 1941) in its history were serious, but not extensive. It was more productive before 1970 (advent of cheap cross ocean air travel, globalization of economies) to teach local geography.  For the USA, just a smattering of Canadian (so similar to US) and Mexican geography and cultures was taught in schools.  There was more than enough diversity in the 50 states, from Alaska to Florida, from Hawaii to Maine, and a few US possessions overseas, to fill the hours devoted to geography teaching.   Was not until foreign wars in Europe and Asia did there arise some need to teach World Geography to US students.  And then it was sporadic quality.  Buying a world map or globe, textbooks, field trips are more expense than some school systems can afford. Also in Europe, most school systems are funded by either the central government or are by religious institutions.  In the USA, almost all funding is from local property taxes and bonds that were seldom passed by voters.  Religious preparatory school fees were too much for many families.  So education of many students left them unaware of the rest of the world.", 465, "2yFSkim8aa", 0],
	2861 : ["There are differences in population all over the world. We could point to countless examples. There are approximately 330 million people in the United States while Canada has fewer than 40 million people... There are nearly 1.4 billion people in China while Mongolia barely has 3 million people. In some cases this is due to geography - much of Canada lies in the extreme northern tip of North America and the climate is harsh - but a lot of it has to do with history as well. The history of Canada is strikingly different from the history of the United States, so many factors contributed to the disparity in the populations of the two countries. The same is true for China and Mongolia. There are over 100 cities in China that boast a population of 1 million or more whereas Mongolia has one of the lowest population densities of any country on the planet. Australia and Brazil are not too different in terms of land area, but the difference in population is immense - there are over 200 million people living in Brazil and under 25 million in Australia. Why? Because Brazil is much more fertile and can support a much larger population whereas Australia is extremely arid and even with modern agricultural methods it's not possible to sustain a population of 200 million on what Australia can produce on its own. Obviously that inhibited population growth. The population of Russia is half that of the US but Russia is twice as large. Anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of basic geography and a passing knowledge of world history would be able to understand why some countries are more populous than others. ", 459, "None", 1],
