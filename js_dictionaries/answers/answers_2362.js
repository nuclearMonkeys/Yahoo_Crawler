	123913 : ["As  per  Einstein Special relativity theory there is no  absolute frame of Reference in the Universe. As every volume structure of mass is in continual motion Hence there is no frame of  reference at rest in the visible Universe. The Lorentz transformation equations were Used by Einstein to prove His theory of relativity concerning measurements of  mass, time ,and travel distance of mass structures. In reality the faster one travels, both the travel time and the distance toward the destination is shortened, as compared to the motion of a turtle. At the speed of a turtle travel time is very dilated and the distance toward the destination gets shorter very very slow. There were others before Lorentz which formulated transformation equations. Presently in 21st century Physics,transformation equation  corrections were made as indicated by Miles Mathis in His recent Papers. Basically nothing is really absolute in the world of Physics. Never the less Truth ,in Time,will eventually  prevail and come out to light.", 10760, "AA10274801", -1],

	123918 : ["Although it is very easy to answer, I have not seen an accurate answer for your Q, well  Kazuza  is the name of soft drinks   from the Geek word  Gazoza ..  In Greece, the term Gazoza is used to refer to clear lemon-lime Carbonated soft drinks Of course in Egypt  they used K instead of G in the  non Arabic word.. Why  do they say Roht fel Kasosa ?? , there are two theories 1) The price of it was so cheap , (you are done cheap like the price of a soft drink)  2) As the carbonated drink becomes in gaseous state  ( disappear )  or consumed very fast ... that indicates how easy some one  is gone like the drink  (that is more likely) Lots of Greeks used to live in Egypt  , they brought the carbonated soft drink to the Egyptians among others like the tomato  ...etc", 10768, "AA10255236", 1],
