I'd be aware that he probably needs me a lot and that he is probably scared, embarrassed, angry, and confused. I'd talk about this. I might want to sit down and talk to the girlfriend's parents too. Are the kids older teens (18 or 19?) or are they very young (14 or 15?). It all depends on their age and their relationship. If this was a one night stand or casual sex then they probably aren't going to want to stay together. If they are very young and this was just a casual thing then the parents of your son and the girlfriend are going to have to work together for the baby. Even though I'd be angry at my son, I'd try to visualize the baby. This isn't the baby's fault and the child should never be treated as though they were a mistake. In the end, I'd support my son, I'd make him get a job, and I'd start buying baby stuff. If this was someone else, I'd encourage adoption but if it were my own son I would not want my grandchild to be raised by a stranger.

I agree with PFLAG; I'm sure that there are a lot of people in that group who have dealt with the same situation, and could probably point you in the right direction for starting your new life if your husband decides to remain an animal. I would try and let your son know that you love him as much as you can, because he's probably very suicidal at the moment. Try and organise some therapy for the two of you, which could probably be organised through PFLAG as well (God, I love that group).

The best thing would have been to just close the door and make it 'known' that you were home, with a view to discussing his sexuality in private later on. However, the situation being as it is, I would advise you to seriously take stock of the situation. Your son has done absolutely nothing that requires your husband's 'forgiveness'. Your first and absolute duty is to your child, he has done nothing wrong, he is legally allowed to be intimate with his partner at 16 and in any case, your husband's violent reaction was simply wrong. I urge you as strongly as possible to take your son's side here. Your husband punched your child? I would think that your marriage may well be over...I'm very sorry to have to say this but it is true. You are his mother, and the one person above all he should be able to rely on to take his side. This means to put him first and to protect him from harm. He shouldn't have to live elsewhere because he's gay and his father has no self-control.

	136266 : ["You need to be more specific on where it's leaking from but I will give you the most common cases.  Also, is this a steam boiler or a hot water boiler? Starting with the easiest: 1.  If its leaking from the temperature and pressure relief valve its either because the boiler has too much water pressure in it or the boiler is heating the water too much.  Check the temperature and pressure gauge on the boiler.  The pressure should be around 18-21 psi and the temperature should be anywhere from 180-240 degrees.  If the pressure in the boiler is up near 28-30 psi the relief valve is designed to discharge the water in the boiler as a safety measure.  If the pressure is too high in the boiler the cause is the water feed regulator.  Its a small brass device on the water line that supplies fresh water to the boiler.  If the boiler is discharging from the relief valve do to high temperature, try turning the temperature dial on the boiler itself (not your thermostat) down, if that doesn't resolve it then the temperature probe that goes into the boiler is bad. 2.  Another cause of a leak could be a crack in one of the boiler's cast iron (or aluminium) sections.  This is a major (and expensive fix) where sometimes the better alternative is to replace the boiler depending on how old it is. 3.  It could be your boiler pump leaking from the seals, if this is the case you need to replace the pump send me a message if you need more advice on it or if you care to elaborate more on the situation.", 11317, "7N1EwtEOaa", 1],

	136270 : ["The answer is really quite simple.   The people that make and enforce the laws are the ones that are practicing that SAME bigotry.   As a pagan in the Central Valley of California I have first hand experience with that, and it extends far FAR beyond the local level.   It extends all the way up to every level of Govenrment, law enforcement and judicial systems. It is the same phenomenon that took place in the Southern US where it took a few generations to weed out MOST of those that upheld the ideals of racial bigorty from influencial positions (although there are still a few pockets where it is still a problem).   That is what they were taught for generations and it wasn't until it became to difficult to pass on that it lessened. UNFORTUNATELY, because of the nature and influence of the religions that practice religious bigotry, the same will not be possible for this problem, and any effort to challenge that agenda will only land the person in MORE trouble than they may bargain for.", 11313, "d9efdf7798d88585a6410e391e94b9bcaa", 0],
