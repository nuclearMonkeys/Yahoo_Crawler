When you run on an extreme-right platform, you can't win outside of red states. If Romney was too liberal, then why did people vote for barely liberal, yet more liberal than Romney Democrat Barack Obama? The GOP needs to take a huge leap to the center, embrace gay marriage and abortion rights and run on the economy if it wants to win. Key strategy: dump the religious right.", 8295, "6zbNrgRfaa", 0],

The bible is an extremely intense well-known of habit yet is likewise a option to settle for it. The liberals are no longer commonly giving a individual their suited to decide for. once you MANDATE issues into regulation you commonly do away with the proper of a citizen to maintain their values, their ideals and their money. Take the liberal view on abortion and delivery administration they do no longer look to be asking just to have the proper to do it they're inquiring for somebody different than themselves to pay for it. A suited to a services or products isn't a constitutionality risk-free suited. Rick Santorum has the proper to his ideals and his recommendations even though it does no longer propose he can or could stress you to stay his existence-form.
