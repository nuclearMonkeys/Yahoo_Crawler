In this day - the parent (usually the father) is being held more accountable for child support. In past years - the father who abandoned their children got away without paying support -- so it was not as noticeable - and the man didn't mind and was silent ... however, the women carried the whole burdon of child support while rearing their children. So .. it wasn't that big of a deal to the run-away dads. Now - the laws are being enforced on a greater scale - which does not allow the child support to go without being paid -- and the dads are making a fuss because of it.

To insist that political correctness is feminization of society, you must assume that it was in some way inherently masculine to degrade all the minority groups of the world, which include as many men as women.  That would make the sexist implication that men are naturally unfeeling cads, who uncontrollably insult everyone.   Political correctness is the height of logic because it educates with awareness.  Emotion would dictate that any word out of one's mouth would emanate uncontrollably in whatever state of correctness or incorrectness that suits the emotion of the speaker at the time, in much the same way that a child speaks out without thinking.  Are children more logical than adults because they are naturally \"politically incorrect.\"   I political incorrectness is logic over emotion then children are more logical than adults.

Obama is learning second hand from Pasor Wright. of course it has to be America's fault, they went to Iraq not to stop terrorists but to get better gas prices.  America should not save its gas reserves, because when the terrorists take over Iraq we will have no other way than to pay in 9/11s and whatever they decide to charge us for the only available amounts of gas we can get over South America's dwindeling supplies. \"Ask any terrorist, dont vote for McCain.\"  that is the best reason to vote for McCain. asked who is the greatest hero and villan if we are talking about the living Jesus =hero the devil =villian Politics at the moment  according to the muslim terrorist and their ultra liberal american supporters ... Hero =they  consider both Hillery and Obama  the terrorists have a #3 too= Ben Laden (Pastor Wright prefers Kadaffi of Libya=the man with for years open door policy to let all terrorists against the USA to train protected in his country) their greatest hero's of the moment Villan would be any infadel Bible believer in  the USA  (Ironic the USA is its worst enemy as spiritual leader Wright stands with the terrorists and their leaders \"9/11 was an act of God against the USA & God 'd' the USA\"). Jesus is my best friend so hehe i have peace in the midst of storm, and it will be coming when the terrorists take over Iraq and have the oil money to sponsor them.  Yesterday said if Iran nuclear attacks Israel (Hillery and Obama said then they will take action) ---Nuke Israel a country the size of New Jersey... and nothing is left to take action for but burry the dead.  Has America mostly gone brain or heart dead or both? sort it out and there are spiritual and political and other related JEWELS here=spiritually right helps too= its important to be good and believe Jesus!  extreme liberalism happened because as is testified to 'communist' people arosed others and used government issues like protecting the communists=Vietnam where 2 1/2 million along with Cambodians were slaughtered when we walked away, or now in support of the terrorists to let them take over Iraq and its oil wealth. it is in part inspired by the ACLU a group headed by Jewish and non Jewish secularists, to remove the Bible, God, prayer, and whatever it stands for from public school and the public. We for the most part didnt learn in the past the need for faith yet before world war II many did learn=Jewish and all peoples, in Krakow Poland a Jewish reviival for the Messiah had been experienced and many Jewish people came to faith and the promise of heaven in the Messiah. Happy day & please pray as I help Jewish people to Jesus, they as predicted would reject their Messiah \"He is despised and rejected of man, and we would as it were hide our faces from him.\" these claims were made to me  that'Jewish sources' claim that there is no concept of a second coming to fulfill prophecy. Yet,Scriptures say; \"When we shall see him whom we have pierced we shall mourn as one mourneth for her only son which is gone.\" Zecariah 12:10 Jewish writers wrote of 2 messiah's one to suffer & one to reign why not the same one coming twice? Prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets -- Zechariah and Malachi ( \"the one of righteousness shall come\" last chapter of the prophets)  The prophecy still had to be fulfilled! \"Unto us a child is born, a son is given, and he will be the wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father and the prince of peace.\" Isaiah 9:6 70 years before the destruction of the temple messiah Yeshua/Jesus came, if he had not come then as the Messiah we would be left with no fulfillment as predicted by Isaiah and commanded by Moses of the blood sacrifice Leviticus 17:11 \"The blood makes atonement for the soul.\" Isaiah 53 \"All we like sheep have gone astray, and the Lord will make to light on him, the iniquity of us all.\" \"He will lay down his life to make atonement for our soul\" the Jewish people could not die innocent/with no sin for their own sins! DESCENDENT OF DAVID  The Messiah must be descended from King David (see Genesis 49:10= Messiah will come before the king's line is destroyed, and Isaiah 11:1& 10 \"To him will the gentiles seek\").  Mary was in the line of the root of Jessie and David=Matthew chapter 1 gives the exact perfect geneology  Jewish people today do not know if they are in the line of David so it would be impossible to know today. TORAH OBSERVANCE The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. Jesus stated \"I did not come to do away with the law, but to fulfill it.\" John  John 9:14 records that Jesus made a clay paste to heal a blind man's who he met begging to be healed, in violation of Shabbat, which caused the Pharisees to say (verse 16), \"He does not observe Shabbat!\" Fact is they added to the Torah (the Talmud)their own laws and rules.  Jesus asked if your animal child falls into a ditch on the Sabbath do you rescue it? or put medicine on your child's eyes to keep from going blind on the Sabbath?  If you say no youre uncaring, if you say yes but reject the Messiah for doing the same youre a hypocrite. MISTRANSLATED VERSES \"REFERRING\" TO JESUS? VIRGIN BIRTH  The virgin birth is derived from the verse in Isaiah 7:14 describing an \"alma\" as giving birth. The word \"alma\" has always meant a young woman. I already explained this and I agree with the 70 rabbis that translated it as 'virgin' to have a miracle birth of 'God with us/emanuel' what miracle would it be for a woman to have a normal birth? and how could God be concieved from two people in birth? SUFFERING SERVANT  Christianity claims that Isaiah chapter 53 refers to Jesus, as the \"suffering servant.\"  In actuality, Isaiah 52 & 53 describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. I explained this above, what is ironic is those that claim that people with sin, could die innocent for their own sins and make atonement for themselves as well as all be born in Bethlehem= The Messiah = \"Out of Bethlehem shall come this one from eternity.\" Micah 5:1&2 hehe today Bethlehem is entirely Arab, meaning if not Yeshua/Jesus, the Messiah will be an Arab the way i came to know him was the prayer he asks us to say; \"Help me Jesus, I am sorry for my sins, even one lie, come into my heart and be my friend, amen\" this he promises to do Revelation 1:1 chapter 1 verse 1 and 3:19&20 \"I love you, and ask you to repent of sin quickly. Behold I stand at your heart door and knock, if you ask me in I will come in and be your friend. \" (sup/have fellowship) The Messiah is my best friend I have one and his atonement too, what do you have? Shalom/peace David My mom who hates Jesus was an average like for the most part blacks and Jewish they are strong liberals demanding in Government  the Democratic line to ban 1. the bible,  2 teaching of marriage instead of homosexuality and fornication, and  3God from public schools and the public too,,  yet in recent times she has changed and is even voting for McCain maybe, because he stands against letting the terrorists take over Iran and its oil wealth to make 9/11 look like kindergarden play in the world and the USA,, Obama's spiritual leader..., against saying God 'd' America (It should go to hell weeping forever for rejecting the salvation of Jesus/Matthew 24), or against having 30 million dollars while starting poor in Arkansaw investing 300 dollars, making hundreds of thousands (White water scandal where those inviolved with the Clintons went to prison yet they stayed around to disgrace America to the whole world, but Bill never inhaled or 'told a lie') well may we stand for the Messiah no matter what or else we mall fall for just about anything,  and dont forget to laugh hehe, David have a day care free  and just food for thought as someone shared this=Paedophilia is disgusting and it still goes on. Eight-year-old wins divorce in Yemen?  A YEMENI court has granted a divorce to an eight-year-old girl whose unemployed father forced her into an arranged marriage.(To a 28 year old man) In response to a question from Judge Mohammed al-Qadhi, he acknowledged that the \"marriage was consummated, but I did not beat her\". Unbelievable it still carries on from Mohammed's time to this day. Isn't it time Islam put an end to this immoral perversion? Mohamed as the Haddith says married a 9 year old Aisha, thank God in civilized countries we have prison for these types. The issue in Islam is not abuse of little girls, because that men make the rules, when we reject Jesus love and care for all mankind and salvation.... As Muslim leaders the problem ... it is the major 2 groups Sunni and Shiite's = Sunni moslems the majority of Islam; blowing up each others Mosques and shrines and killing the religious leaders, since the Golden mosque bombing in Jan 2006. please pray for peace in the middle east Psalm 126 :6  and in our hearts peace ;) happy day!", 9184, "None", -2],

Achievers are penalized in that system in order to give to those who prefer not have, or prefer not to earn rather. Any platform she runs on is in some way trying to buy a vote. It's all about what she can give you if you vote for her. That way of thinking is not good for the country, and I hope Americans do not fall for her tricks. Further, the Bush tax cuts benefit everyone, not only the wealthy. And get real, the wealthy are really the only people in America who pay taxes. I'm talking true income tax, not your medicare and social security which is for your own benefit, I mean actual income tax.

	85008 : ["No, you will have serious conflict with the use of two antivirus programs.  You can run more then one antispyware without conflict.   I hope that you are able to remove Nortons from your system.  My past experience twice with Nortons, is it pure junk, find nothing and does not even know a trojan or virus of any type when you scan.   What is even worse is that when you remove Nortons you will have atleast 300 fragments of this program attached to all of your files and hidden in your system.     If you go to start, click on run, type: c://program files, click browser, and program files, look for \"Symantec\" and try and delete the file.  I will be shocked if it allows you to delete.  More likely it will say, unable to delete this file, being used by other program. Then when you go to start, search, search for program files and type in Symantec, your system scans and the majority of the files will not allow you to remove them.  I had to use from www.rosecitysoftware.com --their Registry First Aid to remove all of these norton fragments.  This is not a free program, but you can use it during the test period to try and get the majority of fragments out.  Because they cause conflict. If you want a really good program that you only pay a one time fee for life including signature updates, new versions, excellent support an is used by the Government of China  try the program purchase the program I use below for $29.99.  (One time fee for life). Being a clinical psychiatrist I have a moral and legal obligation to keep my pc 100% clean from all virus/spyware/malware. I tested every free and purchase antivirus system known. An I found only one that actually works 100%. Never had a virus or spyware in my system in nine years.  Go to, www.filseclab.com and download thier Twister AntiTrojan Virus program. (You will have to pay a small one time fee). You will never have to pay an annual fee for updates, support or new versions. The one time fee is for life.  The software company is located in Beijing, China. They have excellent support, frequent large signature updates an as always all new versions are free. No annual fee for anything.  Comes with a real time scanner that really works. Actually I am quite amazed over the nine years how well it works.  Scans memory on startup. Real time scanning in the background. Open any webpage with an embedded trojan/spyware or malware and scanner will clean on the spot. An It is really removed from your system.  Download any kind of program from zips, compressed files software files, music, etc,etc, an if there is a hidden embedded trojan,spyware,malware, this program will stop the download and clean. An will advise you to end the download.  Will even find a virus in the installer wizard, like \"Wise Installer\". And will stop the installation while it is being installed and clean. Plus this program always will trace back who installed the trojan.  I had a trojan in and wizard installer. Twister caught the trojan and stopped the installation. I wrote the origianl company and told them the wizard installer had an embedded trojan to steal your data. The company now uses thier own installer. You can't beat this software for a one time purchase fee only. Actually I don't know of any antivirus progam that even comes close to this state of the art technology.  All I can say it is worth the one time fee. Your pc cost alot of money and you don't want it destroyed. Plus your privacy is protected at all times.  There is nothing in it for me to praise this program. I tell it like it is. If it is garbage then I will say so.  Three months ago I switched platforms from Windows 2000 Server to Windows XP Prof.  An I had Twister antivirus.  My engineer did not pay attention when I told him I will install my own antivirus system.. He installed Nortons antivirus suite.  It took me 3 months to clean out the mess Nortons left behind.   Also you can use www.ccleaner.com (crap cleaner) which is free an excellent.  But Registry First Aid is the way to go to rid yourself of all the fragments left behind.   Norton's know the are garbage, so when you remove them it is like punishment, they leave you with 300 plus fragments to deal with.   How I knew is my twister scans 139,000 files I have an I noticed that \"Symantec\", was still being scanned as a file even though I removed the program.
