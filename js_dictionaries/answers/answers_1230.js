In fact it is encouraged I don't know in exactly what context Muhammad ibn-al Wahab said against grave worshipping since I haven't read any of his works.  You know, when I was on holiday in my home country (Bangladesh), I visited this remote village in Chittagong to visit a shrine of my two forefathers (brothers) who migrated from Iran hundreds of years ago to preach Islam. The village is very poor as well as its people. What surprised me was that the materials with which the shrine were built with were extremely expensive. The graves were also elaborately decorated. In one of the buildings (1/4th the size of a football field) over the grave of one of them, there is a huge crystal lamp covering 3/4 of the ceiling. Even a small crystal lamp is very expensive. Even the inner walls of the buildings were made of marble (something of a luxury in the impoverished nation). A decade back, it wasn't like that, but rather simple (which it should be). They get the money from people who give money to the mosque and that comes from the many people that visit the place.  Rather than all the decorations, they could have used that money to improve people's lives. That village has severe electricity and clean water shortages. I just felt that those decision makers (relatives of my mother) just aren't thinking right. Its kind of like grave worshipping.  I vowed never to return to that place again for I do not respect the hypocrisy of the organizers of that place. I will always offer my Duas to those men who started Islam in my community so long ago from anywhere around the world.

I am personally experienced sleep paralysis. A pillow under your neck pressing on your jugular vein while you're sleeping can give you paralysis it can knock you out and keep you knocked out.

Then in 1959, the U.S. made this the legal definition; the old definition would be called the \"survey foot\" (to keep the accuracy of old land surveys).
