About ten or twelve years ago, it became \"most\" people cheat. If you asked my last class if people would be willing to cheat, I think you would be astonished at how many people were willing to say \"Everybody cheats.\" The truth is that not everyone cheats, but if someone is cheating himself, he's more likely to overestimate how many people actually do cheat.

	62380 : ["Have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed in Jesus? The PROMISE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IS FOR EVERY BELIEVER who has accepted Jesus as Lord, who has repented and who has been baptized in water. WITHOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO OVERCOME AND YOU HAVE NO GUIDANCE. You have no help, you are on your own, you are unequipped. Having a Bible does not equip you to follow Jesus, you need the Holy Spirit. That is what Jesus promised. He promised us the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth and that is for EVERY PERSON who follows Jesus Christ. THE HOLY SPIRIT BAPTISM WITH SPEAKING IN TONGUES IS FOR EVERY BELIEVER. The Holy Spirit GIFTS ONLY COME AFTER RECEIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT. You first receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues and thereafter the other gifts IF you serve in the Kingdom of God because Jesus equips you with the gifts to serve in the Kingdom of Heaven. But, your ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT, what you need to follow Jesus, is the Baptism in the Holy Spirit. It is promised to everybody as we read in Acts 2:38,39: \"Peter said to them, \"Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39\"For THE PROMISE IS FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND FOR ALL WHO ARE FAR OFF, AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR GOD WILL CALL TO HIMSELF.\"  You see, when Jesus ascended to heaven He told His disciples to go to Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Spirit so that they could receive power to go out and be His witnesses and also everyone who follows Jesus, needs the Holy Spirit TO HAVE THE POWER, to have the GUIDANCE. WITHOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU HAVE NO GUIDANCE, YOU HAVE NO POWER. We read in Acts 1:8 Jesus said to them:\"but you shall receive POWER when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.\" WITHOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER and that is why most believers don't have POWER. They cannot overcome sin, they cannot follow Jesus, they've got no direction, they've got no guidance. They are not following Jesus because they don't have the Holy Spirit -- you need the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: (John 14:26) \"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will TEACH YOU ALL THINGS, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.\" The Holy spirit will teach you all things, He is your Teacher, not the pastor, not another person, Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to teach you all things. In John 16:13 Jesus said:\"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and HE WILL DISCLOSE TO YOU WHAT IS TO COME. 14\"He shall glorify Me, for He shall take of Mine and shall disclose it to you.\"  Without the Holy Spirit we have no direction, we have no power. If we do not have the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, then we do not belong to Him (Romans 8:9) Then we are not equipped, not connected, we need the Holy Spirit. Now, HOW DO WE RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT? That is the big question! They were praying and waiting on the day of Pentecost. They (the disciples) were all together in the upper room and they were praying and then the Holy Spirit came on them. IF YOU WANT THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU NEED TO SEEK! YOU NEED TO BE IN PRAYER! And when you pray with all that is in you and when your mind runs out of words to say to Jesus to praise Him, to give Him glory then the Holy Spirit will give you the words to say! You must SEEK the Holy Spirit, you must ASK Jesus for the Holy Spirit! YOU MUST GO AFTER THE HOLY SPIRIT! But you must first REPENT, repent of sin, be serious about following Jesus. Be serious about following Jesus, obey Him, be baptized in water then GO AFTER THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT! SEEK IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART! Spend time in prayer, set yourself aside and GO AND PRAY! PRAY WITH ALL YOUR HEART! CRY OUT TO THE LORD, say:\"Lord, fill me with your Spirit, fill me with Your POWER! So that I can go out and be a witness!\" If you don't have the desire for the Holy Spirit and you don't have the DESIRE for Jesus then you have no desire for the Kingdom of Heaven. You need that POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT to be able to withstand and to follow Jesus Christ. WITHOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT YOU CANNOT MAKE IT.  The Holy Spirit with FIRE and with tongues is promised to YOU, my friend, to everybody who wants to follow Jesus Christ because WITHOUT the POWER you cannot follow Jesus, without the guidance of the Holy Spirit, you are LOST!
