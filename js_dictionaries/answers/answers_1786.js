For one thing you said that you stopped abruptly to pick up a toy when he hit you.  Well he wasn't expecting you to stop... that's all.  We've all done that when someone walking in front of us stops without us realizing they're going to. The other things, I think, is that the dogs just get so focused on playing.. on chasing squirrels or birds or their toys that they forget to stop... lol... that's all... My dog does it and a bunch of people, when I asked, told me that their dogs were doing the same thing once in awhile so I wouldn't worry about it.  It had nothing to do with their eyesight. Unless your dog is walking into walls all day during the day, I wouldn't worry about it and this only happens when he's so caught up during play time, then it's just a normal thing.... at least for some dogs.

Modern liberals do not believe in markets that are free of regulations. They support Keynesian economics and believe capitalism has inherent flaws that need to be corrected with intervention. They are concerned about the gap between the wealth and the rich, because they believe it is a threat to any democratic society.  They are also concerned about the environment and discrimination. There is no consensus on foreign policy. They generally believe in a larger government than classic liberals do as well.

Additionally they would, if they could, replace the government of the people with one that suits their minority viewpoint.   And when you see endless postings about armed insurrection from the more extreme right wingers, some would do so by force and ironically enough, call it 'liberty'.  So how is to be 'classically liberal' to replace a government of, by and for the people with one you would choose for them and impose by force?  That is actual tyranny.  Being in the minority and not happy with the choices of the majority is not tyranny - it is sour grapes.   Now today's liberals do not have it all right.  Many would, if they could, impose all kinds of mandates and requirements on the people through government by rule of law.  But the thing is they try to do so through the democratic process of government.  In the end it is still the people that decide what to do and no version of 'liberalism' enjoins the people from implementing their will via their government - with the exceptions being that the majority may not strip the minority of enumerated rights or any rights they reserve for themselves.   When the people decide - that is classic liberalism.  When the minority imposes their will on the majority that is not.  So in a Republic with a government of, by and for the people, those that are not getting their way are simply the minority - not representatives of classic liberalism fighting tyranny.  If their message resonates with a majority of their fellow citizens, then they will prevail. But that is the only permissible path to the change they desire.", 9533, "R7Hexutqaa", -1],
