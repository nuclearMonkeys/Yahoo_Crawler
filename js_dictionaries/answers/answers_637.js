I can see Fury trying to bully him and rough him against the ropes with Ali evading some serious shots and countering with some of his own. I'd see this fight going the distance and Ali winning on points or it being a draw. Fury is one of the best heavyweight boxers in recent memory, hes got to be taken seriously in the 'elite' list of greatest heavyweights imo. has  to,  look at his performances against Wilder in both fights ( both of which he won imo) and also how he dealth with Klitchko. if he fought Joshua he'd cause him big problems imo. One boxer that I think is dangerous, and a dark horse in the heavyweight division is Dylian White though.

	35701 : ["At 135Lbs? Duran beats Floyd inside-out.  Floyd was a fighter that was carefully moved at certain points versus certain types of fighters (especially after coming back as Money Mayweather).  Not saying Floyd wasn't a defensive genius.  He was. But Duran was too much at 135Lbs for any fighter not capable of stunning him & negating his in-fighting, while controlling him from the outside. At 135Lbs, (even as young as 21 years old) Duran had constant head movement (off neutral & offense), constant hand movement, constant shoulder loading, would side parry and catch outside jabs, would change levels to feint, would Fitzsimmons shift off 2's (taking his head off center), would jab off lateral circling + level changing, would use 6's to the left ribs off of outside slips & extending his left to grapple, and then would inside-fight with hand tactics (elbow controls & pseudo wrestling) - while using tight uppercuts & hooks with proper head slot switching. Slipping (outside & inside), leaning away, and ducking were second nature to Duran - but always with loading the shoulder to shoot a power counter.     In the 2nd Jose Luis Castillo fight, Mayweather outboxed and outmaneuvered a fighter that had ZERO head movement in the neutral (only bobbing / weaving going forward) and who forgot defensive responsibility after throwing punches.  And yet...Mayweather was still hit enough in spots to force to hold on until the Ref broke them up (pot-shoting & clinching).  Mayweather's MO was to use a great jab to the body off the low level (one of his best career weapons), pendulum step & pull counter, and back step with a check left hook.  These strategies worked great against flat footed, 1-2 dimensional fighters that didn't feint much & didn't move their head off-center (think Castillo, Corrales, Hatton, Maidana, Mosley - a trend develops).  His shoulder roll and ability to smother (down and in) + his great athleticism and reach wouldn't have been enough to stop tight punches on the inside to his arms, biceps, sternum, ribs, and hips.  If your name isn't Benny Leonard, Joe Gans, Henry Armstrong, Ike Williams, and possibly Tony Canzoneri & Barney Ross, then you got very little shot to beat a 135Lb version of Duran.", 5376, "MN9vTUExaa", 0],
