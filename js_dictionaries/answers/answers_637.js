	31872 : ["Didn't you hear Black people can't be racist? Besides that racists are not jailed for being and saying racist things. They never have been. The fact that Muhammad Ali has been dead for just over 4 years now has simply made this nothing more than an obviou", 5350, "None"],
	31873 : ["I got Fury because he has height and reach, Deontay Wilder couldn't stop him in 2 attempts and he is the consensus hardest hitter in the division, his boxing IQ is higher and is stamina is better. I don't think he'll knock AJ out but I got Fury on points.", 5351, "psOmJErtaa"],
	31874 : ["Joshua would knock Wilder out.", 5368, "None"],
	31875 : ["Joshua would be under so much pressure he wouldn't be able to do what he did in the Ruiz rematch, he'd have to fight and his punch resistance isn't good enough to take the kind of power Wilder posesses and so I got Bombzsquad by massacre.", 5368, "psOmJErtaa"],
	31876 : ["Turns out neither were as good as the were hyped up to be and have gotten stopped badly in recent fights.  But I'd say it's 50/50. Both are pretty technically flawed but I think it boils down to who lands the biggest punch first. I'd likely say AJ wins. ", 5368, "None"],
