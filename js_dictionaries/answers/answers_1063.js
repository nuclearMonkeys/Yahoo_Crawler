If you shop online for a decent price and stop sales tax, the United States is almost always the cheapest country to purchase branded electronics. In most other countries, sales tax is a significant factor, and similar laptops are often equipped with lower configurations or are older models. China is a different story; their prices are much lower. China is a different story; while Chinese products are cheaper, the vast majority are poorly produced and fail quickly. I will never buy a Chinese laptop in my life. Yes, a smartphone from a well-known Chinese manufacturer. In my life, I've purchased about 4–5 china tablets, and none of them have lasted longer than a few months. And the ones who were supposed to succeed failed in a variety of ways. Even the ones with very appealing specs, such as a nice screen that would have cost far more from a brand name in the US, struggled in different ways.", 8140, "dpR8aG5Caa", 0],

	58661 : ["Often a bit of debris gets under a hey and gets into the scissor (or butterfly) mechanism . Keyboards are notoriously just gross about trapping all kinds of crap. I hated cleaning them out when I worked on them. If it is just a key or several that has become unresponsive and it is this, then a can of compressed air can usually free this debris and all will be fine. If it is something else like the dome cap switch it actually is contacting on the board then is could be collapsed. Sometimes I have fixed this with freeze spray (used for searching a thermal short on a circuit board. It could also be in the board itself as the keys may be in a daisy chain type setup and several are connected together. This can sometimes be fixed, at least temporarily, but usually it is better to discard it and get a new keyboard. On many keyboards it is just a pad that make contact with another pad on the bottom of the key itself. Sometimes a contaminant creates resistance and a cleaning with isopropyl alcohol on the contacts will cure it. It all depends on the type of keyboard you have. Sometimes it can also be from a faulty driver (rare but it has happened on special keyboards).", 8126, "OjxV81hSaa", 0],

Your computer is woefully inadequate (even after your upgrade) for almost everything, even internet browsing on most websites and is slow when compared to even the cheapest smart phones, sad to say. If you insist on keeping it, I would recommend trying various Linux based operating systems that are open source and free to find one to your liking, but even with user friendly interfaces, it will take some adjusting for inexperienced users.  If not, then buying a new computer would be your best bet as even the cheapest newer models are by far better than your current one.", 8128, "bGvUgacMaa", 0],

A dead pixel won't turn on, whereas a stuck pixel is permanently on. Since it's permanently on, it typically appears as a bright, persistent dot on the screen, and is either red, green, blue, or white. You can try running a program such as Undead Pixel which will TRY to get that stuck pixel to activate again. Another one, JScreenFix doesn't even require you to download anything.  You simply run it in your browser and move the box over where your stuck pixel is. Hopefully, one of these \"solutions\" will work for you.", 8142, "AA11434633", 2],
