In the end they're both important but you already made plans with your boyfriend, so stick with it. Especially if you know you really want to be with him. One day he could be one of the most important things in your life. If you're in a serious relationship that's something she will have to learn to deal with. And if she can't support you and be happy for you than is she really a true friend? That's what it came down to for me. So tell her how you feel.", 8535, "dlLfMK4aaa", 2],

	70055 : ["Hospitality is the relationship between guest and host, or the act or practice of being hospitable. Specifically, this includes the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers, resorts, membership clubs, conventions, attractions, special events, and other services for travelers and tourists.  In the West today hospitality is rarely a matter of protection and survival, and is more associated with etiquette and entertainment. However, it still involves showing respect for one's guests, providing for their needs, and treating them as equals. Cultures and subcultures vary in the extent to which one is expected to show hospitality to strangers, as opposed to personal friends or members of one's in-group. The hospitality service industry includes hotels, casinos, and resorts, which offer comfort and guidance to strangers, whether it be commercial (for monetary gain) or non-commercial (not for profit). The terms hospital, hospice, and hostel also derive from \"hospitality,\" and these institutions preserve more of the connotation of personal care. Hospitality ethics is a discipline that studies this usage of hospitality.", 8538, "None", 0],
	70056 : ["Are our boyfriends related?? My boyfriend and I have been together for five years and the only difference is, we have a son together.  He's been married before and told me the week that I told him I was pregnant that it ruined things because he was \"fixin' to propose to me\" but now he was afraid that my family would just think it's because I was pregnant. I said ok, whatever.. He got the rings and took me to get them professionally sized AND paid a lot of money to have them sized only to bring them back home and set them in the closet in the box. He went thru the whole thing of askin' my dad's permission and all that.. For a split second, he made me think he was bein' genuine.   After his attitude and the way he treated me, I told him I did not want to marry him anymore and to not even ask. We since pawned the rings so even if we got back to the place where we could be ready to be married - he'd have to start back all over again.. Your boyfriend knew you wanted to get married and now he isn't giving you a choice. He didn't talk about the change of heart to you - he simply just came to you and said nah, I don't think I wanna get married - but you can have my babies.  Don't waste your life waiting on a maybe. MAYBE one day he'll change his mind when you're x years old. MAYBE he'll see things right and you won't feel so unreasonable.  Just take some time and evaluate the situation and just go from there. If you feel in your heart that you need a husband to have a family, yes - leave him. Do what you feel in your heart to do. Just don't wait for him.

Here's what I liked, what especially worked for me: You made an interesting setting this land of \"inbetween\" this \"misfit place\". This place of no light, no sound, no feeling that is very interesting. I could see it very easily. This was the biggest strength of your poem. The areas you need to watch: Forced rhyme: which you can see in your again (pronounced gain), but it is also elsewhere in the poem. It pops the reader out of the poem and limits it's effectiveness. I would recommend going back and working to clean that up. When I read something and come to \"and it was a dream\" I feel that it's a cop out You are a better writer than that. If you want the narrator to feel regret fine. Show us what that looks like, don't tell us. The in heaven I will fly, in hell I will fry can be written better. Convey the same things in a non-trite way. The last two lines are good because they emphasize the strength of the piece which is being lost in the inbetween place (I think there is a hypen between in-between, you may want to check). That's it. This would also make a very good short story. As, it stands though I like it. Please don't take these comments as harsh--they're not. Thanks for writing.", 8540, "NxhO7DTfaa", 0],
	70062 : ["No there is no companies that treat animals they use in a good manner at all. At their best level they are slaves and slavery is never a good thing. The only reason we think of things being \"humane\" is because we want to think that because we want to continue using animals. We will believe or say anything in order to continue our exploitation of animals. Plus animal products aren't healthy for us at all they don't provide us with anything that is truly in all forms good for us. There is always a catch in a lot of cases it can be cancer, osteoporosis, high cholesterol, heart disease, liver problems, bone problems...the list goes on. In all reality we weren't meant to consume the stuff. Milk has always been for babies of the mother producing the milk, nobody and I mean nobody, seriously not a soul on this planet needs any mothers breast milk after being a baby once they are weaned off it they don't need it anymore. It is only meant for the first little stage of life, that is why the mom stops producing it (and why they literally have to rape cows and take away their babies in order to get milk) I have seen tons of videos and it is always the same: Exploitation and the only way to end it is too stop using animals completely in all forms in all walks of life and live vegan. You cannot exploit somebody in a good way and any way we use animals always ends bad for the animals. We can make excuses all we want but in the end animals are being used and abused and many are being murdered for food, clothing, \"research\", entertainment and other such things. We have the power in our hands to stop all of this but every time we intentionally support them even if it is just in the teeny tiniest of ways we are continuing some of the most pure evil we have seen. This should give you the info to help start off veganism a lot easier: Here is a list of animal ingredients to avoid: More things to avoid: Animals as clothes: Leather, skins, furs, wool, silk, down, feathers... Animals as entertainment: Circuses, rodeos, zoos, aquariums, animal fights, animal races, hunting... Companies that DO NOT test on animals(however CHECK INGREDIENTS they only verify testing not ingredients): Vegan products:  (I know them well and they aren't doing as well in this economy but they are a great source for awesome hard to find stuff and they are very friendly and giving even if they really don't have much if anything to give) Vegan recipes:  More info on veganism:  (I get the honey question a lot) \"The word 'veganism' denotes a philosophy and way of living which seeks to end the idea of animals as property and exclude all forms of intentional exploitation of, use of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing, research or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, including people and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.\" Edit: telling someone to eat meat or do anything that would go against the definition is not vegan at all.

	70063 : ["If the milk comes from a commercial farm, chances are the animals have not been treated well, organic or not. Intensive farming is just too hard on the animals, even if they are being raised without antibiotics, growth hormones, etc. Your best bet would be to try to find a source of organic milk, preferably raw, from a local dairy or farmer, where you can see how the animals are treated. Also keep in mind that \"cage free\" does not mean the chickens are well cared for-it often means they are packed into a shared living space, where they still have no room to behave naturally-over crowding, debeaking, illness, medications, etc. are still common practices even where the chickens are \"cage free\", which really means nothing more than they are not in cages-it still doesnt mean they are treated any better. Again, a local farm or supplier is a better option. Unfortunately, there are a lot of deceptive marketing tactics being used in the food industry.

Athena was a Daddy's Precious Little Girl. One could say she was almost the embodiment of the Oldest Child.

If you are at the point where your spouse has asked for a divorce, what can you do? You must realize first that, you do have a choice. Often, when confronted by a crisis, we find ourselves backed into a corner thinking we have no choice in the matter. How can we change the situation when it involves another person's feelings or decisions? While we cannot, must not and in no way manipulate, blackmail or threaten our partner into changing their mind, we can actually control how we react to the situation. If anything, you must realize that you still have control over yourself.

Despite what people will tell you, there are certainly places that treat animals well, and some that even kill them \"humanely\" (even though I think humane slaughter is an absolute oxymoron). But the thing is, you don't know which is which, you don't know how each cow is treated, you don't know if that chicken is happy, the odds are it isn't, given the general way humans raise animals for nothing more than profit. I suppose you could research local farms near you that are humane. But also there's another factor, which to me at least, is just a convincing reason to go vegan or even just vegetarian. There's the environmental factor and I'll give you just one point to ponder on. Think about how much animals eat. With all the water, land, man power, fuel for transport, it's a ridiculous amount of resources to feed animals, then they feed us. If you're don't consume animal products it's like cutting out the middleman, and it's just a more efficient way of living. Good luck with whatever decision you make!", 8539, "N7nPmFw3aa", 0],

A \"free range\" chicken doesn't mean it's let to roam free outside and given proper chicken food, it nay never even see sunlight actually. All it means is that it can run free in an extremely over crowded room of chickens, or it's already tiny cage has a little more space. As for milk, check the brands your store carries and do research on them as well.I'm not trying judge your beliefs or diet in saying this, but please do hear me out: Cow milk isn't meant for human consumption, it's meant for calfs to be drinking. Yes cows can get sick if not milked, but if their calfs were being given the milk it wouldn't matter. Humans aren't supposed to be lactose tolerant. It is a mutation to be lactose tolerant believe it or not.  I decided to become vegan a week ago. I gave up all animal products cold turkey. At first it was a health thing, then I started watching some videos on you tube and the documentary \"Food Inc\" and I'm never eating meat again.
