In the early 1900's, the Jews started immigrating to that land and LEGALLY bought land from the arabs, and when the jews started building more settlements, the arabs started rioting and attacking the Jews.   During WW1, when it was the Ottomon empire, the British offered Israel their own state in that land if they helped overthrow the Turks, which they did... When the British was given the palestine mandate from the League of Nations, Britian was told to \"encourage the close settlement of the Jews\", and immediately following that, the British gave 75% of Palestine to the Arabs, which eventually became Jordan, and the British broke their promise to the Jews. The Arabs kept attacking the Jews, and to make the Arabs happy, the British made the White Papers, limiting the Jewish immigration to Palestine to next to nothing, and eventually banned all immigration, because the British wanted cheap oil.   The Jews kept immigrating however, kept building settlements peacefully, and kept growing their Jewish population.   The British finally decided to let the UN deal with Palestine, and the Un made the Partition plan 181, which would create two states.  The UN decided on who to give which land to by who had the MAJORITY POPULATION in each area.   The Jews accepted, but the arabs refused, and kept killing Jews.

Hannaka is a victory celebration over the people that Herod 3 was descended from, Arab Syrians, involved in an inter generational feud originating between Esau and Jacob.    Hanaka glorified the organizers of an army from dirt poor peasants who, with G-d's help, fought off Syrian occupying.forces!   The act of celebrating Chanuka would have infuriated  Herod 3, who condemned a man named Rabbi Yeshua to death for threatening the peace and thereby his position, as governor of Judea under Rome..     Its unlikely Rome would permit Judean subjects to celebrate a victory over occupying forces, either.  Remember,at that time Israel was occupied by Rome.  The Caesar at that time (the New Testament contradicts on who exactly that was but it may have been Nero or  Caligula, Nero played the fiddle after he set Rome on fire, and watched it burn so he could rebuild it his way.   Caligula was a sadistic psychotic who enjoyed torturing people as dinner entertainment.    Anyway, it is unlikely that Herod, with his Syrian ancestry, or Nero, or Caligula would have permitted the celebration of subduing Syrian occupying forces by freedom fighters.    It is fairy tale myth that a passive Jesus advised everyone to turn the other cheek, submit to Rome, love your enemies who occupy you, pay them outrageous taxes. If that brilliant embellishment were true, he'd not have been killed.    The so called \"Jewish historian\" whose pen name was Josephus Flavius wasn't the father  of Jesus.  He was the human creator and therefore the father of the Jesus myth.    Josephus was the grandson of the man who did murder the actual real rabbi Yeshua, living and breathing rebel freedom fighter, killed by Herod to prevent rebel followers from organizing an overthrow of Judea's cruel occupiers.        Rabbi Yeshua WAS stoned to death by decree under King Herod 3, (Syrian Arab descendant of Herod 1 who murdered the last king of Judea after marrying the lonly heir, whose name was Miriamne. He killed her too; after she refused sex with him after he killed her father he claimed she was unfaithful for confiding he had murdered her father to a male confidante. He had her stoned to death and killed two of their three sons, for siding with Miriamne.   Miriamne's was descended from freedom fighter, Judah Maccabee, the hero of the Chanakah story.  Her family benevolently ruled Judah after successfully winning freedom against Syrian occupation until her father, hoping to make peace between Syria and Judea, made the mistake of marrying her to an insanely cruel enemy who was probably quite handsome and charming,.    Josephus Flavius embellished historical fact with fict. In this case, Yeshua, venerated as a  courageous messenger, he transformed from freedom fighter to a model of passive submission. He drew on popular dying god myths of Tammuz and Adonis, half man  half gods.   Zeus,king of the gods, couldn't keep it in his pants to the chagrin of jealous goddess wife Hera, who lived with him above the clouds.      Joseph is the name given to the non biological father of 1/2 man 1/2 god by Josephus Flavius, pen name of Arius Calpurnius Piso. He twisted the character of Yeshua from brave freedom fighter to a broken, submissive half god of Israel.  Martyred in statue form, he warns via missionizing priests, to submit and be saved from annihilation. enjoy eternal life.    Temple records indicate a Rabbi Yeshua was stoned to death around the time that the Jesus story is supposed to have taken place. A hundred years later, when Josephus lived, crucifixion was a punishment to strike fear into the hearts of would be tax evading theives and rebels.  Thus, the story that Jesus was crucified with a thief.     Miriam is the Judean form of the name Maria, .  Ria was the virgin mother goddess of Rome, songs were sung to her calling her Ma Ria.    Josephus flavius, descendant of the Herods who tyrranized Judean subjects, is often called a \"Jewish  Historian.\" He embellished history to make his family look innocent of crimes they blamed on victims.  Not only did he turn the martyred Rabbi Yeshua into a half god instead of a messenger the meaning of messiah in Hebrew) he claimed the people of Masada  committed suicide,  not allowed under Jewish law. He cited clay lots as evidence for suicide; he invented a trembling survivor to serve as witness that heroes who fought for life for ten years in a desert fortress committed suicide out of cowardice.      Is it a surprise that a direct descendant of the actual murderer of Rabbi Yeshua, who had appointed his brother in law to replace the traditional Levite High Priest and expedite assassinations of dissenting Judeans such as Rabbi Yeshua, twisted the story of the death of Rabbi Yeshua? Feared rebel transformed into passive loser. Blame for his death he placed on his freedom loving countrymen to rationalize persecuting them.", 8772, "Aqwzr7ikaa", 0],
