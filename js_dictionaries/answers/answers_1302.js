I will take the $100,000 contract in the IPL since I am not a hard worker especially when it comes to playing Test cricket.... Who can be exposed to sunlight for 5 consecutive days for one match? I don't even want to be an umpire in a test cricket match... and I will play in 3/4 IPL matches... I will be pretty lazy so I will not work hard. I will play floppy cricket!

	70706 : ["Its hard to predict, since the Aussies are pretty inconsistent these days, but I think they will do well. Its going to be a huge challenge and the current Australia must change if they want to win the upcoming series and end the summer on a positive note. Batting is not a huge problem as much as bowling is. I say that because they have an inconsistent Mitchell Johnson on the side. Johnson does well in 1 match and disappears after that. Australia cannot afford this, especially since he is now the leader of the bowling attack. If Johnson takes 4-7 wickets every test match, than that will really boost up Australia. Lyon did well in the first match, but his future is still unpredictable and his presence and good form is a major booster for Australia. At the end of year, i predict Australia's rank to be 3rd or 4th. Q:2- I hope the youngster Usman Khwaja and Shaun Marsh perform well, as well as Mitch Johnson.", 8597, "nTsi8Z4Iaa", 3],
	70707 : ["I think South Africa are just a bit out of Australia's reach at the moment. Australia are improving but SA have a better batting and bowling lineup. Hopefully the Ozzies will put up a good fight and at least draw a match but I think SA will win the series. The Aussies will probably whitewash the Indian side again. I just don't see enough class or fight in the Indian test side so will probably be a walkover. If Oz win every single test they play from now on and whitewash India (and Sri Lanka lose bad) you will leapfrog them in the ratings to no4. Otherwise Australia will be sitting pretty at no5 for a while longer. EDIT: Actually it's impossible for Australia to move up from no5 even if they win every test and Sri Lanka lose every test.

	70717 : ["That was cute. As far as finding my perfect partner, I really thought I had, until he got into his senior years. Now he tends to get mad quickly and yells alot. I think it's mainly from a  collision he had many years ago, that he might not have fully recovered from. It caused a brain aneurism and his memory hasn't been the same since either. But he's the driver of the car,and I hope he can maintain his facilties for many years yet, as I rely on him to grocery shop and take care of things. And I also still need a companion and sometimes a care giver in general. I know he'd rather be in a quiet village some- where in Mexico, selling paintings, but he can't go there for awhile. So he might be blaming me for not completing his dream for retirement. As I told him, these are the \"for worse\" years, and he took vows for them as well as the good.", 8596, "XEbrGfZuaa", 2],
	70718 : ["It depends on lot of things. I would decide after considering many factors like my body's comfort level & fitness, my talent, competitiveness in my national test squad, my family's financial position, my age, my board's resources etc etc. Looks like all patriots have joined YA, which cant be true. Can it be? If you want to get real opinions just look at the the real cricketers, how many have refused to play IPL for test cricket and compare them with the number of cricketers who have accepted. Even watch out that, whether the cricketers who selected to be with test cricket were free to take decision OR was there any pressure form their respective Boards? It would be a perfect unbiased source of reliable opinion, for which you are looking, mate.

	70719 : ["You can divide the cricketers into two categories here.One is money driven and other is not.If a Cricketer is ready to play for his country in longer formats with lesser wages than he will go for the second option but sometimes the lure of money makes the players to take the decisions of playing against the country.
