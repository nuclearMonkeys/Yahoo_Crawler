	16314 : ["What are your options? You can either pay it, try to negotiate a settlement for less, or wait until they sue you and ruin your credit with a judgement. Mold is rarely hazardous, and can be cleaned with bleach water or a number of other disinfectants. Cleaning the home is generally the tenant's responsibility. If the mold is occurring due to taking hot showers or just general humidity then its your job to clean the home to keep the mold under control. It may cause minor irritation but that can be addressed by wearing an N95 mask and making sure you have good ventilation while you work. Cleanup only becomes the landlord's job if its caused by a faulty system such as a leaky roof, leaky plumbing, or a dryer that isn't properly vented. Even if the landlord was responsible for the issue there is a legal process for breaking a lease due to an unresolved maintenance problem. You need to notify the landlord in writing of the problem, give them reasonable time to correct the problem, and then get a court order allowing  you to break the lease if they still haven't fixed it. You cannot just unilaterally decide that your landlord's efforts were inadequate. Did you even do a mold test to prove that there was airborne mold? The bottom line is that if they sue you, they will win and you'll have a judgement and trashed credit. I suggest you negotiate a settlement. Maybe they'll accept half the money. Maybe not, but its a starting point for negotiation. Next time either honor your lease, pay the penalty or follow the proper legal process to break it.", 2822, "Jvx658HFaa", 4],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 2824, "None", -1],

They ALL use AISIN WARNER trannies, and the SAME brake makers, and the SAME interior materials and the SAME seat suppliers! >>SUBARO owners RARELY give them up! They LAST very very well and use engines copied from PORSCHE, TOYOTA had One FAILIURE the YARIS! I do NOT care for the CVT tranny in the NISSAN but OLDER ones were BETTER to me! PEOPL that have MAZDAS swear by them and FORD FUSIO uses the MAZDA power train an they get 33 MPG all day long! The FUSION is a GREAT CAR< btw, and FORD EDGE uses HALF FORD and HALF AUDI in it! I have RESTORED at least THIRTY older BMW to SHOWROOM RUNNING and they are EXCELLENT as well! SUZUKI had some VERY BAD jeep like b vehicles and GM bought them and put their GM logo on them along with DAEWOO and HOLDEN of AUSTRALIA and even TURBO OPEL engines in the CRUZE! >>HONDA had issues with TIMING BELTS that cause VALVES to BEND if they BROKE! TOYOTA never had that issue I don't think! I would get the MAZDA first, then the TOYOTA but I LIKE OLDER CARS ANYWAYS, then the older NISSAN as they NOW use CVT trannies and I do NOT like them as much. The ones with a ZF trans are the BEST ones. I LOVE the STRENGTH of AUDI, BENZ and BMW cars the most! MOST auto technology CAME FROM THEM!

	16349 : ["The suggestions to think of a snappy comeback or otherwise engage in the mudwrestling match are ridiculous. That's how people without a clue deal with unfavorable social media posts. Your best advice is to hire a good internet reputation firm. The first thing you need in order to build an effective response is to understand exactly what, if any, damage has been done. Only then can you take effective steps to mitigate. The thing you don't want to do is to start running crap up your own flagpole to remind or inform everyone of the competitor's charges.
