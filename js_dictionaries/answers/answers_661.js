	36874 : ["I would contact an expert on this, not people on here. On one hand she should not go and should be supervised when she does just in case her mother is unsafe to be around. On the other hand you refusing could be what makes your mother commit suicide and you don't want that for her or for your daughter as the suicide of her grandmother would do incredible damage to her. As a result a doctor or crisis counselor can help advise you and you can share what I mentioned here of not wanting to push the mother to suicide by keeping the daughter back.      It might be best for you to go with her and you to stay there with them. For a minute I thought you meant the child's mother but I see it is your mother so all the more reason for you to go with her. My grandmother was an alcoholic and my Dad always went with me when I'd go see her. That was the PERFECT way to handle it. My aunt would drop her kids off alone with the grandmother and I can see that being awkward for the kids and scary when they were little. Meanwhile I have an uncle who barred his kids from ever seeing her again and that was unfair and punishing the kids for Granny's drinking. I guess he thought he was being protective but it did terrible damage to his special-needs son who blamed himself and that uncle's kids all have had far more problems then my aunt's kids or myself (only child).    So don't restrict your daughter but absolutely contact a crisis number on how to handle protecting your mother. Also if the experts agree then consider supervising. ", 5515, "None", 0],

A decent parent would have arranged for these supervised visits to continue somewhere else even after Grandma said her house couldn't be that venue anymore. You're not even trying to be a good dad.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death.

	36886 : ["So my mother with a passion hated my father. My mother was raped by my father and he continues to use that to his advantage. he would tease her and it would bring back all of those painful memories. He's done countless acts to hurt my mom. Even though my father caused my mom all this pain she never spoke of it because she knew seeing my father made me happy. she put back all those memories to see her child happy. I eventually saw all of this and I knew my father used me to get to my mom so I emancipated myself and he stopped talking to me so often.
