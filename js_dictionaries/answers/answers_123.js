	6169 : ["Add another zero onto that figure and that's the minimum my father was making in the late 80s.  I know this now, I've seen the bank records.  If you ask me to describe my childhood I'd say I grew up dirt poor because we never had new things except for underwear and usually my mom would have to cry and plead to get money for anything.  There was never quite enough food to last the whole week and we were always a little bit hungry.  Some rooms in the house didn't ever have furniture.  We were the house with the hip high weeds and the sagging roof.  My mom had to walk everywhere because we had a barely running old car she wasn't allowed to use and if she spent money on the bus there was less for food, so she walked miles and miles to get to a grocery store and dragged it all back in an old baby carriage.   It was only when I left home and met genuinely poor people that I noticed little hints that there was money around but we weren't allowed to have the benefit of it.  For a long time I thought we maybe had a lower middle class income but my dad was too tight.  I can't express how incandescently angry I was to find out that he's loaded despite blowing lots on coke and hookers.  It wasn't even about not having stuff and not being invited to birthday parties because we didn't bring presents or host good ones, or the vacations we never went on, the raggedly third hand clothes, and the no after school clubs.  It was all the constant worry.  My brother and I we constantly worried we'd be made homeless and be split up in foster care.  My mom had to surrender my sister because she needed medical treatment our dad wouldn't consent because of insurance deductibles or something.  Do you know what it's like to have a sick sibling suddenly disappear and you've overheard your mom telling her friend that your dad said it wasn't up to him if she died? (We got her back eventually when my mom finally plucked up the courage to leave, but it really messed my sis up.) I don't know if my dad is dead or alive.  I've been disowned for a looooong time.  He hates me because I testified against him in court.  I left home as soon as I could.  When my mom fled she never got a cent and neither did us kids.   How has it affected me?  I have a weird relationship with money.  It was such a poisonous thing at home, all fights were ultimately about money, like getting money for overdue bills.  My dad enjoyed seeing my mom suffer by letting the utilities get cut more than he ever worried about his reputation.  It made me very reluctant to accrue savings because it somehow something tainted and corrupting.  I was almost driven to buying \"stuff\" that nobody could take away from me.  Luckily it was sensible, useful stuff mostly, but I shouldn't have been prioritizing a tables aw or high end kitchen towels over long term investments.  I had to get that out of my system though, so it's not like I can complain.    These days I have a sensible relationship to money in the sense that I plan for the long term and how to use it to grow my business.  It's finally just a tool.  I don't aim to be rich, just comfortable.  It's much more important to me to not be stingy or controlling.  I like spending it on other people, especially children.  I fund after school activities at the local school because there will be kids there who couldn't take part otherwise and I hated knowing everyone else was doing fun stuff after school and I couldn't.  What's life for if you forget to live it while we're too busy just making money?  I don't dwell too much on the past unless someone brings it up, but I'll always resent that my growth was stunted due to chronic malnutrition during a particularly tyrannical phase, even poor parents do their best to feed their kids!  Truly he was/is? some sort of psychopath.", 1000, "None", 0],

	6174 : ["It doesn't unless it's printed at a rate greater than the rate of economic expansion. However, if you increase the money supply without corresponding economic expansion, in the very short run, people will have more money, more buying power, but in the not very long run, prices go up because you're adding to the money supply without any corresponding increase in the amount of product to be demanded, thus the excess money supply results in decreased money value the same way it does when the amount of any resource increases without a corresponding increase in demand: the value decreases. When the value of money decreases, you need more money to buy the same things as before, which needing more money to buy the same things is what inflation is, prices going up. Again, that isn't the case when the economy correspondingly expands because when the economy correspondingly expands, you see a corresponding increase in the supply side, so when money supply of demanders and the product of suppliers being demanded within the economy go up together, prices remain at an equilibrium. In the US, by the way, money is generally added to the economy by way of the federal reserves interest rates. If a bank lends $100,000 at a non-compounding 5% annual percentage rate of interest for a year, an interest rate that's linked to the federal reserve's prime interest rate, at the end of the year, the bank has $105,000. That $5,000 came out of nowhere. One day it didn't exist in the economy. The next day it did. There was no product made, no service provided, just a $100,000 asset of the bank, that loan it gave, suddenly became a $105,000 asset of the bank, $105,000 someone has to pay back. That's how the federal reserve generally \"prints\" money, inventing it out of thin air-- with interest rates. And it controls how much money is invented out of thin air to ensure that too much isn't created corresponding to the rate of economic growth by controlling interest rates, so if too much money is being invented out of thin air corresponding to economic growth, the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and so undercuts what banks are lending at, forcing them to lower their interest rates accordingly or otherwise not be able to compete with the Federal Reserve and other banks who respond in kind. That's how the US government and the Federal Reserve control inflation and economic growth. Sometimes, however, the US government, like it did last year with the first economic recovery payments given out, simply change the amount of money it has in its US Treasury bank account to be able to cover the government checks that banks across America cash and then turn in to the Federal Reserve for reimbursement from the US Treasury. A country doing that too much can create massive inflation, but a country that is otherwise economically strong can get away with it because it just needs to ensure that it offsets that action by making sure that interest rates are low enough that the added money to the economy won't outpace economic growth and cause inflation, or undesired inflation. That, however, CAN be problematic in the valuing of currency abroad, but what happened last year, since every economy in the world did pretty much the same thing, the World Bank ended up just calling it a wash and not letting it affect international currency exchange valuations. It happening everywhere created a unique phenomenon that didn't cause currencies to lose valuation overseas because it was like how a rising tide raises all ships.  ", 991, "None", 1],
