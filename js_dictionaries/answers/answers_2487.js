Be sure you clear any large trees from around the site, the roots will eventually push it up and crack it. You can call the local fire department and have them fill it for a fee, that way you don't have to fill it from your water supply and spend big $$$. Do not go for a sand filter they really don't work, go with a diatomatious earth filter. They are a bit more expensive, but they really work. You might want to find out the water table for your area. Believe it or not if the water table is too high, it will push your pool up every time it rains heavy. Invest in a good cover or enclosure to keep the leaves and critters out.

He had neurological problems and his prior owners never addressed his behavioral issues.  Thus, I acquired a problem dog, but due to poor breeding and poor socialization and care.  I now have a dobe-mix and a pit-mix; both are absolute babies.  Responsible dog owners -- regardless of the breed they have -- will make sure their dogs are trained and socialized.  My pit-mix (a rescue) was encouraged to jump and to play roughly.  I am working with her to correct this bad behavior, but I can also tell she is confused when I correct her and try to redirect her.  She is basically a sweet dog that has had the misfortune of being raised by problem owners, then being tossed aside for becoming the product of their poor handling. So I say the problem is with the owners, not the dog, and certainly NOT the breed.  JMO", 11060, "VIYb2PTZaa", -1],

However, most people get Pits, Dobies, and Rotts because they like the breed. We sometimes have minor issues with Dobies that want to be left alone... but they tend to hide behind their owners, rather than growl.  On the other hand, we find that Labs have a vicious tail that waps anyone within reach... And the Pits and Rott will sometimes step on people on knock into them.... as they go about their rough, but non-aggressive, play. On the other hand, I am ambivalent about any dog that bites for any reason. If a child runs up to a dog from behind and hugs a dog, then I only hope that the owner has really socialized the poor startled dog not to snap.

The second being depending on where you are business owners are already getting bent over by the local government and taxing them further is going to drive more people out of business. In this economy that is NOT what we need. And how would that affect rescues/shelters? Technically that is a SERVICE. Vets? Trainers? Do I believe a good portion of the dog population should probably be put down? Yes. Do I think its going to happen with the current \"all dogs can be fixed/saved\" mentality of some people? Not any time soon. Come on we can't even get people to agree totally with a permanent fix to CURRENT feral dog packs in the us. ETA: Notice you have already gotten the \"look at the human population\" comparison.  God forbid someone remind that that the majority of pregnancies are PLANNED, WANTED and not affecting the system. That is HARDER to get a child adopted thanks to the system and ****** up laws that prevent singles and/or same sex couples from adopting.  Or the fact we as humans have full control over whether we reproduce or not and are not simply acting out of instinct. Not to mention in some areas to over population issue is OVERSTATED. Check your local rescue groups and see how many bring up animals from high kills down south. ETA: \" Despite the old wives' tale about “training” your pet not to breed, this is not possible. \" Sharon and what \"old wives\" tale would that be since I never heard it. I DO know simple responsibility and an understanding of dog reproduction prevents mating all the time. Otherwise how do you think GOOD breeders can go without having a litter on every heat? Some of us are able to understand how to keep our dogs on our property, an in season ***** properly secured and dogs of opposite sex in the same home from mating.  Is everyone like that? No. Doesn't mean I should have to fix my dogs because someone else is irresponsible. anne: I was referring to Sharon's comment of how many children are born in the US every day. Leaving third world countries aside where they even know what SEX leads to - there majority of children in this country are wanted- whether for a GOOD reason or religious guilt. We have birth control options to fit EVERYONE We have the morning after pill we have the right to abortions.  Pregnant teens still have the option of not carrying to term. And again we as humans still make the choice about sex and pregnancy.

	130217 : ["The answer to this question is speculative at the moment but current thought in physics is that the universe has the shape of something called a 3-sphere, which is hard to imagine without an analogy. A 2-sphere, for comparison, would be like the outside surface of a balloon -- the INSIDE of the balloon isn't considered at all, you have to imagine that only the SURFACE of the balloon exists. If you imagine dots drawn on the balloon and consider those to be galaxies, that is what it's thought the universe is like at this time -- as the balloon expands, the dots (galaxies) move further and further apart, and there is no \"center\" or \"edge\" of this shape. Also note that travelling far enough in one direction will bring you back to your original position. However, the surface of a balloon is only two dimensional whereas the universe is at least three dimensional, so the curvature is in a direction we can't observe. This sounds strange, but if you think about it, if a dot on a balloon (on a 2-sphere) could think it ALSO couldn't see the third dimension through which its universe curved through, so the idea of our universe curving in an unseen dimension isn't so outlandish after all, and in fact this concept is exactly what we work with when we consider that in relativistic physics we interpret \"gravity\" as mass distorting the geometry of space in an unseen dimension.
