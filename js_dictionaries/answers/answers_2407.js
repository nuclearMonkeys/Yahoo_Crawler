And NO ONE, male or female, wants to sign up for selective service (although I think we should have to, to make things fair) but, YOU be fair, why would we want to do what men don't want to do, themselves? It's a violation of human rights, in my opinion, and Selective Service should be abolished all together. Men and women should be able to serve if they want to. Also, women ARE fighting for the right to be on the front lines in battle (they currently are not allowed) and THAT'S why women are not required to sign up for selective service...if women get the right to fight on the front lines, I'm sure  Selective Service would follow.

Too much emotional energy (and public's money) has been drained on those two.  They will just play it up even more in the media if they are charged, and unfortunately I think some people will always support them.
