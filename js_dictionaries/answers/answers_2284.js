Anyway, maybe \"New World Symphony\" by Anton Dvorak as it mixes in Native American influence (that is technically still Western, but it's not really part of \"Western music\" and how that is defined) or perhaps \"Within You Without You\" by The Beatles (credited to George Harrison). It's the best example I can think of as far as a Western Pop song with Eastern music influences.
