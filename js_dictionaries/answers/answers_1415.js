The Football World Cup (Soccer) and The Rugby (both codes) World Cups are all open to countries throughout the world that play the game - sorry to be a 'party poo-per' but this smacks of 'If we can't win something, we won't let anybody else muscle in' !

	76374 : ["An amazing movie.  It critiques so much about consumerism (love the Ikea Nesting Syndrome...oddly enough, there is a new furniture commercial that utilizes the same structure) and men's roles in contemporary culture.  One of my all time favourite lines is from that movie:  \"Martha Stewart's polishing the brass on the Titanic, and it's all goin down, man.\"  So...the futility of prettying up what is essentially going to implode; the waste that we in North America consider essential; the inability to be an individual unless it's in an extreme form (\"self-perfection, that's masturbation:  now self-destruction....\"); how little we can feel without being kicked in the teeth; how easily people follow; how medicalized and therapeutically-oriented we are because of these issues; how we have absolutely no idea who we are until we're defined by others (\"Hello.  My Name is...\" and he's never named...naming is a whole other issue in this film), and of course, the existential crisis of reality...what is real and how do we know?  Then there's Marla.  Marla of the old bridesmaid's dress that someone must have loved once; Marla the tourist, the faker, the drama queen, the philosopher of the meaning of condoms.  She doesn't know whether to live or die and doesn't care either way.  She is the aimless wanderer, the potential voice of reason who really can't be bothered.  Probably one of the most intriguing films in recent memory...David Fincher is brilliant (Seven is also in my top 5) and this movie will forever be a cult favourite.  Thank you for this question...film is a passion of mine, this one is a particular interest.  I hope you will share your views as well. Now...slide.....", 8843, "iNVfC8wXaa", 2],

	76384 : ["Yes I do. Not only because I HATE the RedSux. (I'm a diehard Yankees fan.) But because the Rockies have a pact amongst themselves that is really nice. Earlier this year, someone who works for the Rockies was hit in the head by a line drive in a freak accident. The Rockies decided that if they won the WS, they'd \"deal in\" this guy's kids on their money. While it can't replace their dad, $200K a child can go a long way to caring for them.
