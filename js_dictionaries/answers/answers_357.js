The Constitution gives the Legislature the power over voting. Not a political party, not the governor & certainly not the state  attorney general. Get the facts before you make a statement.", 3126, "None", 1],
	18562 : ["Of course! People do more harm voting than they can with a gun The left may be trying make the USA a dictatorship.  Real Americans have to prepare for war.

They don't fear any backlash because the rest of us throughout the world agree with them. Losing a bunch of users who refused to accept reality and recruit haters would be a plus for joining.  Besides Trump is going to start his own platform with the money he bilked from his “adoring fans” which would give you idiots a place to swap the crap you spew and leave the rest of us alone.

	18585 : ["The 'President' was installed into power surrounded by a standing army that had to be 'cleared' first by a clandestine police force like Castro in 1959.  That's why I call him 'lord Biden.' He and his Antifa plant running mate just rammed through $2 trillion in expenditures without a single Republican vote, and now he is exploiting Muslim mental illness to justify robbing Americans of one of their most cherished and important Constitutionally protected liberties. Had those rights been exercised in the simplest way by our well armed citizens, Muslim whackjobs wouldn't be able to kill anyone in public places, armed or  not. That's why we have gun rights in the first place, to meet evil wherever and whenever it emerges. The irony of this is staggering.  It is also truly sick to try to link this all to racial hatred and exploit it to build their new Democratic 'coalition' formed based on this racial hatred and divisiveness, trying to slander Republicans as people who 'hate Asians' or other members of their growing political movement.", 3110, "fp8i8udTaa", -1],

	18587 : ["For several elections now, a goodly majority of Americans have voted Democratic for Senate and House, but the Senate and House were Republican.  Partly because of gerrymandering, and partly because all the smaller-population states are red states. The Republicans realize they are a numerical minority--always have been--so their best chance to win is to manipulate the vote.  They have no real platform these days.  So they spend all their time/effort/money coming up with ways to cheat.  Trump even tried to shut down the Post Office so people couldn't vote by mail!  (But he did himself!)", 3124, "55XWsWHsaa", 2],

	18627 : ["Well, you kind of totally forgot to say who 'they' are.  Because there are very few people who believe the 2020 US election was stolen.  There's The Don himself, a few hundred of his devout followers, and... well that's actually the whole list.  And Donald was claiming the election was stolen before he even knew who his opponent would be, which should really tell you something.
