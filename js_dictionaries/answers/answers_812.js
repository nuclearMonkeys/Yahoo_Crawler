That leaves us with ground stations  and a few bubbles floating around random places in the water.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism.

	45221 : ["It's hard to meet and really get to know a strong man online. It's just too easy for someone to pretend that they're someone they're not. Use dating to find out what he is really like. Pay special attention to how he reacts when he doesn't get his way or something goes wrong. May I suggest that the first question to ask yourself when considering whether or not to date someone is, “Is this person a strong person?” If they're not, no matter how much you like them, how much they like you, or how “cute” or “hot” they are, - please don't date them. A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money). My suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you're not already), forget about this guy unless he's a strong person, and eventually look for this type of guy (otherwise you're setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately this type of man is difficult to find – but save yourself the heartache and don't settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps! PS Here are \"21 tips that could help you to attract a strong person\" from the book True Love Lasts: 1. Take the time and put in the effort to become a strong person yourself (this is the most important tip) 2. Put yourself in as many situations as possible that will allow you to potentially come in contact with other strong people - community service organizations, the library, high school or college clubs, the “Y” or other workout facilities, religious book studies, coffee shops, non-alcoholic parties, bookstores, concerts (wear a good pair of earplugs to protect your ears from permanent hearing loss), co-ed recreational athletic teams, community service projects, mission trips, volunteer service, etc. Try to get to know other people as much as possible without dating 3. Be cheerful, approachable, and friendly - smile regularly to put others at ease (let people see your positive attitude) 4. Take a real interest in getting to know others. Ask people an open-ended question about themselves in order to get them talking. Share things related to what's been said as needed to keep the conversation going. Then ask them another question 5. Be polite and kind to everyone - even to people who you don't like or enjoy being around 6. If you decide to not accept a request for a date, do it in a kind way (being rude isn't a good choice and it doesn't help you - word about it will get out and you'll become less approachable) 7. Be confident about yourself - if you're trying to become a stronger person each day, you already have a lot going for you 8. Be humble - don't act like you're Miss Charming or you're Mr. Wonderful 9. Don't be concerned about whether or not someone likes you 10. Have the attitude that if someone doesn't like you - they don't really know you 11. Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep (at least nine hours for teens, at least seven hours for adults according to the experts), exercising regularly (if approved by your doctor), and eating a healthy diet 12. Develop a good sense of humor - including the ability to laugh at your own mistakes 13. Be known as a hard worker 14. Dress well and dress modestly at the same time (wearing seductive clothing doesn't attract another strong person) 15. Pay attention to your appearance, but don't obsess over it (remember that strong people are attracted to other strong people, they're not too concerned about looks - because they realize that looks fade with age). If you use makeup, make sure it's not excessive. Use perfumes and colognes sparingly - if at all 16. Truly care about other people 17. Stay in close communication with real friends who can help you through the ups and downs of life and hold you accountable 18. Be patient - real friends can help you with this 19. Persevere - please remember that almost nothing worthwhile is quick and easy. Please don't settle for dating a weak person 20. Don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to date you 21. Don't act desperate for a date", 6480, "U4o8Bs4xaa", 0],

With undercooked chicken/chicken wings and all other poultry the risk comes mostly from salmonella contamination: poultry (also amphibians and reptiles) can live perfectly well whilst their flesh is riddled with salmonella.
