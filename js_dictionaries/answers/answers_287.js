	14368 : ["As far as I am aware no link between having one of the COVID-19 vaccines and subsequently having a blood clot has been established. The number of people who have had a vaccine and subsequently a blood clot is miniscule; far less than you would anticipate if the vaccine were causing them. Secondly, the number of people who have had a COVID-19 vaccine and then a blood clot is a lower proprtion of the population than the number of blood clots that generally occur in a year. That is another clue they are probably not linked. Thirdly, there seems to be no biological reason why a COVID-19 vaccine would cause a blood clot. Vaccines are designed to work straightaway. They stimulate your immune system to produce a response to the disease against which you are being vaccinated. Consequently, if you were to develop some sort of undesired response to the vaccine it is going to be shortly after the vaccine was administered or after a booster dose. There should be no serious side-effects developing a long time after the vaccine.", 2420, "kz04oBhsaa", 0],

	14381 : ["You're asking for the equivalent of multiple textbooks'-worth of information from various fields--physics, chemistry, biochemistry, paleontology, molecular biology, genetics, physiology, plus more recent results in the current scientific literature that won't be in the textbooks for another 20-50 years.  You're not going to get any of that here, and I won't even start, because from the tone of your question, you wouldn't understand any of it.  Instead, I have to take you back to the very basics-- Four hundred years of experience has demonstrated that the only proven, reliable tool we have for investigating questions about the world around us and our place in it is science.  Science is strictly dependent upon methodological naturalism--meaning that it was devised--invented--by humans to address specific questions about the natural world.  As such, it can ONLY address natural causation, because natural causation is the only kind of causation that can be observed/tested/experimented upon and evaluated using either our own physical senses or via amplification of those senses through the use of improved technology.  Inferences about the world are then made based on the results of those findings, and hypotheses arising from those inferences can then be further tested.  So science is limited to examining natural causation, because the only means we have available to us are physical, natural ones. There's a huge difference between the respective approaches of methodological naturalism (described above) versus philosophical naturalism--the latter assumes that the natural is all that exists, and that the supernatural does not exist.  Science makes no such assumption, and takes no position on the existence of the supernatural.  Instead, it restricts its effort to questions that it CAN address--natural causation. So, the ONLY evidence available to us from science suggests that whatever the precise mechanism was (and that's not known yet), as far as we can tell, natural means were, are, and have always been sufficient to explain our origins.  And the evidence from science is the only evidence we have.  Evidence of supernatural origins have never been presented.  There are stories, but stories are not evidence--they're just stories. The only practical tool we have available to us is science.  And science can only address questions of natural causation. If evidence for supernatural causation is ever found, it's not going to be through the use of science, since by definition, if it's supernatural, then it's not natural, and so science can't touch it.  Again, by definition, if science ever did \"find evidence\" of something that was supposedly supernatural, then that would automatically mean it wasn't supernatural in the first place, and was natural after all.  So you go develop a means of specifically and unequivocally testing supernatural causation, then get back to us. We'll wait.", 2416, "5183e4343a3b662ae1a4d68f375ccc5aaa", 3],

	14384 : ["I'm in agreement with “A Hunch” in this one. If you are the one setting the standards for the level of clean in your house, then it becomes your responsibility to meet your own high standards. I do not agree that bathrooms must be deep cleaned AT LEAST twice a week unless the people using them are so disgusting with every use that they are completely missing the toilet with each use and not rinsing down the sink after brushing teeth, etc. And if that's the case, what needs to be changed are those behaviors, not how often you deep clean the bathroom. If the two of you made an agreement that you wouldn't wake him up before noon on his days off (because he works nights) and you choose to do all the housework before he gets up, again, that's on you. You can just as easily wait until he is up to tackle the housework together, but if you choose to do it without him you don't then get to be upset he didn't help you. Chore division is rarely 50/50 in households. If you are unhappy with the current division in your household, you need to renegotiate your agreement with your husband. But you also should be well aware of your own part in the current situation. If you want him to do more housework, you may have to relax your standards of clean.", 2403, "KESlvKqQaa", 1],

	14389 : ["Whether the first humans were black or not, the way you think of evolution isn't correct. While white people evolved later, them being more 'evolved' in the sense that they are more advanced is incorrect thinking. The lighter skin and different features they evolved simply means that it helped them survive and reproduce. These traits evolved because humans migrated away from the equator, thus the different environment (necessary for evolution) caused White people to have the traits they have. ", 2418, "9x1YZvg0aa", 0],
	14390 : ["The claim isn't entirely correct.  The first members of our species had various skin tones and albinos were probably quite common among them.  However, no it doesn't mean that because evolution is not progress and has no direction.  Also, if you do believe in a ladder of evolution, wouldn't that mean Black people are more evolved because they've been round longer?", 2418, "0GPMDJYKaa", 1],

	14396 : ["One such claim I have heard, this was back at Texas A & M back in the late 70s is, Islam has given women the right to keep their own names and their money. Another explanation might be women have been owning and running their own businesses since before Islam itself. However; when you combine this with the fact women are known to obey their husbands you start to think how. One of the main rules of Islam is a man cannot tell his wife to give him her money, even if; she makes more money than he.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodoxchurches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death.
