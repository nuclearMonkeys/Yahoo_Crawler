	14436 : ["For many people, writing a book has been a lifelong dream, yet one that's always seemed just out of reach. Indeed, as we reveal in our publishing podcast Bestseller, roughly 80% of Americans have wanted to write and publish a book at some point — but fewer than 0.1% have actually done it. So what's the secret formula that will unlock your creativity and show you how to write a book that will make your dreams come true? Some authors would tell you that there is no single path to authorship, as every writer's journey is unique. We'd counter with this: almost every bestselling author will have highly effective writing patterns and habits that help them reach their goals. If you want to write a book of your very own, all you have to do is emulate them! To help you achieve just that, we've put together this 15-step guide to how to write a book, chock full of information and advice from the most prolific, successful writers in the business. Whether you've been an aspiring author since childhood or since five minutes ago, this article will give you all the knowledge you need to write a book and do it well. 1. Find your “big idea” The one thing you absolutely need to write a book is, of course, an idea. If you don't have that, you'll never get past the first page of your draft. You may already know what you want to write about, or you may be at a total loss. Either way, you can settle on a “big book idea” by asking yourself a few simple questions: • What do I want to write about? • What do I feel is important to write about? • Who will want to read about this story/subject? • Will I be able to carry out this idea effectively? Your answers to these questions will help you narrow it down to your best options. For example, if you have several different ideas for a book, but only one that you're truly passionate about and feel you can pull off, then voilà — there's your premise! On the other hand, if you lack ideas, these questions should steer you in a firmer direction. Think about the kinds of books you love to read, as well as books that have made a significant impact on you. In all likelihood, you'll want to write a book in a similar vein. Tools to help you find an idea If you're really grasping at straws, consider using creative writing prompts or even a plot generator to get the ball rolling! You might stumble upon an interesting concept or story element that sparks a “big idea” for your book. (And if you're still uninspired even after trying these tools, you may want to reconsider whether you really want to write a book after all.) 2. Research your genre Once you've found your big idea, the next step is to research your genre. Again, if you're writing the sort of book you like to read, you already have a leg up! Reading books in your genre is by far the best way to learn how to write in that genre yourself. But if not, you'll want to select a couple of representative titles and analyze them. How long are they and how many chapters do they have? What does the story structure look like? What are the major themes? Perhaps most importantly, do you think you can produce a book with similar elements? 3. Create an outline If you want to write a great book, you need to outline it first. This is especially important if it's your first book since you need a solid blueprint to rely on when you get stuck! (Because believe us, you will get stuck.) So how do you go about creating that outline for your book? We actually have a whole other post on the subject, but here are the essentials: • Pick a format that works for you. There are so many different types of outlines: the free-flowing mind map, the rigorous chapter-and-scene outline, the character-based outline, and so on. If one approach doesn't work for you, try another! Any kind of plan is better than none. • Have a beginning, middle, and end. Way too many authors go into writing a book with a strong notion of how their story should start... yet their middle is murky and their ending, nonexistent. Take this time to flesh them out and connect them to one another. Remember: the best books have endings that feel “earned,” so you should try to be building toward it from the start! • Consider your conflict points. Conflict is at the heart of any good book — it draws in the reader, conjures tension and emotion, and ultimately reflects the themes and/or message you want to convey. You don't have to know exactly where your conflict will manifest, but you should have a pretty good grasp of how it works throughout your book. • Get to know your characters. If you haven't done much character development yet, your outline is the perfect opportunity to do so. How will your characters interact in the story, and how will these interactions demonstrate who they are and what matters to them? 4. Start off strong Let's get into the actual writing and make a dent in your first draft. One of the most important parts of writing a book is starting the story! It's no exaggeration to say your first few pages can make or break your book — if these pages aren't good enough, many readers will lose interest, possibly never returning to your book again. 5. Focus on substance Many writers believe that the key to writing an amazing book is style: impressive vocabulary, elaborate sentences, figurative language that would make Shakespeare swoon. We're here to dissuade you of that notion. While style is great (as long as your prose doesn't start to become purple), the substance is far more important when writing a book — hence why you should focus primarily on your plot, characters, conflict(s), and themes. Make sure your book is all killer, no filler Of course, that's easier said than done, especially once you've already started writing. When you get to a patchily outlined section, it's tempting to keep writing and fill out the page with literary gymnastics. But that's exactly what this content is: filler. And if you have too much of it, readers will become frustrated and start to think you're pretentious. This is another reason why outlining is so important. You need to KNOW your story in order to stay on track with it! But besides outlining, here are a few more tips for making substance a priority: • Every sentence must do one of two things — reveal character or advance the action. This advice comes straight from Kurt Vonnegut, and it's 100% true: if a sentence doesn't accomplish one or both of those things, try removing it. If the passage still makes sense, leave it out. • Be conscious of your pacing. Slow pacing is a symptom of excess description. If the events of your book seem to move like molasses, you're probably using too much style and not enough substance. • Use a writing tool to reduce flowery language. Speaking of great American novelists, Hemingway is a fantastic tool to help you write like the man himself! Simply paste your writing into the app and Hemingway will suggest ways to make your prose more concise and effective. 6. Write “reader-first” Want to write a book that people will really enjoy (and buy)? Well, this is pretty much the cardinal rule: you should always be thinking about your audience and trying to write “reader-first.” For example, sometimes you'll have to write scenes that aren't very exciting, but that serve the overall story arc. Don't rush through these scenes just to get them over with! Even if they don't seem interesting to you, they contribute to the reader's experience by building tension and preserving the pacing — and the reader deserves to relish those things. Create 'fake' people who will want to read your book When considering your readership, you should also keep a proto-persona in mind for marketing purposes. These are constructed personalities that marketers use to better understand their target customers. The more your book can cater to this hypothetical reader, the easier it will be to sell! Maybe you're writing a true-crime account for zealous true crime readers. Such readers will have pored over countless criminal cases before, so you need to include unique details to make your case stand out, and craft an extra-compelling narrative to engage them.", 2434, "Pwqi7n4uaa", 0],

My father wouldn't encourage me to pursue it however. He had money but he wouldn't pay for me to take courses in music and languages and other things that I enjoyed.  He paid for me to go to college but he and my mother wanted me to study what they wanted me to study. When I was away at college they had a music school and all I did was practice the piano and listen to music instead of going to my regular classes. And then I auditioned for the dean of the school of music and he said I really wasn't up to their standards but he would give me a shot. And work with me. But I was terrified to do it because I knew if I transferred to the school of music my father would strangle me to death. So I never did. I never took the opportunity.  And after that I tried to commit suicide so I had to leave college anyway and go back home.My father wanted to force me to become a businessman. I couldn't. He was a businessman and he wanted me to be like him.  But ironically he had also been very talented in music and painting and writing and I was also talented in music and writing if not painting. So basically I genetically  inherited at least two of these gifts from him but instead of letting me pursue them he was trying to force me into a field that I had no talent or willingness to go into. Business. And the only reason he went into business was because when he became a father (accidentally) he had to give up his own dream of being a musician.  So I always thought that subconsciously, or maybe even consciously, he didn't want me to be a musician because then I would've been successful doing something that he had always wanted to do but wasn't able to because of ME. Because he became a father after he had my sister and me. And my sister was an “accident”. An unplanned pregnancy that happened with my mother when they were dating and then he felt like he was forced to marry her and start a family after she told him she was pregnant with my sister.  And then after they had my sister they decided to have me for some reason.So because he got ‘trapped' into being a father, he felt like he had to be responsible and go into the business world and give up the dream he had once had of being a pianist in a jazz swing band.I've always been bitter about all of this. That he blocked my ambitions and frustrated my ambitions to become something he had wanted to be but wasn't able to because of my sister and I. Or so he thought.   I probably could've been a pretty decent musician and/or writer. But my father put every roadblock he could in my way so I wasn't able to do these things. And then he started sending me to a psychiatrist to put me on psychiatric drugs when I was younger because I was so unhappy. So he basically ruined my life.  Instead of becoming something that I would've enjoyed doing with my life, like becoming a musician or going into the music field in some capacity, the psychiatric drugs they gave me basically started ruining my body and brain and I just ended up going on disability and never making anything of my life. It's the worst feeling in the world. To have wasted your life. It makes you feel terrible about yourself and can destroy your self-esteem. Don't end up like me. Go after your dreams and don't ever let anybody tell you that you shouldn't. Because even if you don't achieve them, at least you will know you tried and the worst thing is knowing what MIGHT have been but never was ....because you were not even allowed to try it.  Because people didn't have faith in you and wouldn't give you the support you needed. So sometimes I guess you just have to give it to yourself.  And try to stay away from people who put you down and are negative about your talents. That's a slow poison that you do not need. Just keep going after your dreams and your passions. You never know what will happen.", 2425, "None", -1],
