	70324 : ["Which ever way you decide to go at least hang fire till the end of January when an updated iPad is rumored to be launched. Most iPhone apps work on the iPad some of the older ones are simply enlarged so can look a bit pixelated.  However if you are simply using this as an entertainment device then the iPad's larger screen seems to be a good idea. Browsing websites, watching films and playing games on an iPhone is good, but on an iPad is great.  The disadvantage of an iPad is no phone, no camera (although thats supposed to change soon), and its bigger and heavier so less portable. I have both and can honestly say i use them for different things. My iphone is with me 24-7 and is essentially for communication and wasting time on games whilst waiting for appointments and the like. The iPad I use for writing and researching projects, watching tv and films when I am away from home. The iPad stays mostly at home unless I am traveling with work. So... If it's just for entertainment... iPad would be my choice, but wait for the next generation.  If your going to carry it around a lot then iPhone 4 is by far more portable.", 8548, "aMtbFIGaaa", 1],
	70325 : ["An iPad is not worth it, trust me. Between, an iPad and iPod Touch 2G, maybe. But iPhone 4, well, iPad is WAY off. For using the best games, some of them you need to move your device.

I'm not sure if the doctor would have to tell your parents or not. You should probably check with the laws of your province/state. If you're in school, you could ask to speak with a the counsellor - he or she probably has to keep things confidential unless s/he thinks you might hurt yourself or someone else (but you could double check that beforehand).  It definitely sounds like you're in a dark place. You have a lot of stressful things going on in your life, but there is hope. You deserve to be in a better place.", 8551, "ewRfxFaNaa", 0],
