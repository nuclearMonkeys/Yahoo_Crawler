	52452 : ["The celebration of Easter is not based on the Bible. If you look into its history, though, you will see the true meaning of Easter—it is a tradition based on ancient fertility rites. Consider the following: Name: The Encyclopædia Britannica says: “The English name Easter is of uncertain origin; the Anglo-Saxon priest Venerable Bede in the 8th century derived it from the Anglo-Saxon spring goddess Eostre.” Others link it to Astarte, the Phoenician fertility goddess who had the Babylonian counterpart Ishtar. Hares, rabbits: These are symbols of fertility “handed down from the ancient ceremonial and symbolism of European and Middle Eastern pagan spring festivals.”​—Encyclopædia Britannica. Eggs: According to Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend, the hunt for Easter eggs, supposedly brought by the Easter rabbit, “is not mere child's play, but the vestige of a fertility rite.” Some cultures believed that the decorated Easter egg “could magically bring happiness, prosperity, health, and protection.”—Traditional Festivals. The American Book of Days well describes the origin of Easter: “There is no doubt that the Church in its early days adopted the old pagan customs and gave a Christian meaning to them.”The Bible warns against worshipping God by following traditions or customs that displease him. (Mark 7:6-8) Second Corinthians 6:17 states: “‘Separate yourselves,' says Jehovah, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing.'” Easter is a pagan holiday that those who want to please God will avoid. Jesus said to celebrate the day of His death, not resurrection: \"Also, he took a loaf, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means my body, which is to be given in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”(Luke 22:19, NWT). More information about it you can find in the website jw.org", 7315, "w8Md9MdOaa", 0],

	52460 : ["Yes, of course. This is the babylonian system of people who were later the Roman empire, which became the Roman Catholic church - believing themselves as part gods, and therefore \"illuminated\" from within as their own gods, self-powered.  These so-called elites were the overlords of Europe in the Dark Ages, and they caused the dark ages. Today we see the same type as like Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Newsom, etc who believe they are elite, \"illuminated\" of extra-specialness.

	52461 : ["No there really isn't.  It's just a fun schoolyard myth, not a real thing.  Not only would it be impossible for them to exist, but in many countries it doesn't need to exist. We've all heard of them and their essential characteristics:  They're the secret shadow-government that makes all the big decisions (from election results to how long the limited time is on \"limited time only\" menu items at McD's or Taco Bell), they're growing in power and almost (key word, almost) ready to take over and enslave us all, and they definitely don't like you.   A lot of people will tell you all about the illuminati, in fact most of them won't even wait for you to ask.  But if you notice how every believer 'knows' who they really are, you'll start seeing cracks in the foundation.  One person knows it's the elitist left like Bernie Sanders or Nancy Pelosi, and they'll spend hours proving it.  Someone else knows it's the Vatican, and they have all the proof you need with them.  Yet someone else knows it's Israel (Israel is almost always involved with any conspiracy theory), and as always they have tons of proof if you need convincing.  See the pattern here?  If you ask 100 believers who is running (or at least a member of) the Illuminati, you'll get 100 different answers.  It makes you wonder if any group isn't an Illuminati member. Then there's their timeline, which busts the myth wide open.  These guys, under one name or another (they used to be the NWO until (no really) Hulk Hogan copyrighted the name for his wrestling group, they were also called Big Brother for a while), have been stuck in the planning & development stage for at least 65 years.  When Genghis Khan gathered enough support to start conquering other nations, he started conquering.  Same deal with the likes of Alexander The Great, Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, and just about everyone else in that line of work.  They didn't spend years (never mind decades) planning and debating the process, they just did it.  There's no excuse for spending 65 years in the planning stage, it's just plain ridiculous. The Illuminati would also only work in the western civilized world (North America, most of Europe, etc), because that's where the myth originated.  If you went to China, North Korea, Cuba or almost anywhere in Africa and told them about this Illuminati and their planned enslavement of the world, they'd say \"welcome to my world\".  And they would look over their shoulders first, to make sure nobody else was listening.  In most of those countries, even asking questions about the government is grounds for imprisonment, torture and execution.", 7362, "M0akEw8Vaa", -1],

It varies by more than a month over the years and so it simply cannot represent the date of anyone's death!!! It is in fact a combination of several pagan festivals most notably the spring festival. The name Easter comes from “Eastre” an Anglo-Saxon pagan goddess. Also the Norse goddess,Ostara who took her name from the Teutonic lunar goddess Eostre Even the Chinese have the festival of Ching Ming where flowers and sweets are put on their ancestors graves!! The egg and the rabbit are symbols of springtime and rebirth along with the custom of giving flowers etc!! The Venerable Bede, an early Christian writer pointed out that the Christian church absorbed Pagan practices when it found the population unwilling to give up the festivals. Thus a lot of what Christians now see as Christians practices are in fact pagan!!! The Pope said last year that Easter should now have a set date to make it Christian! Fun to watch the Christians worshiping a pagan festival though - makes it just like   when they do the same thing!!!", 7315, "vgUmdXoOaa", 0],

This is a pretty common phase with boys around this age.  They seem to develop a real horror of not being clean and accidentally touching poop.  Are you mom or dad?  Best would be for dad to have a talk about wiping technique because boys are starting to become hyperaware that it's different for them and they really want to grow up into dad.  If there's just mom available the talk has to be had.  Likewise a refresher talk on proper butt washing at bath time.  If your household doesn't use a squirt gun or bidet having flushable wet wipes available/and or a dedicated, lidded wipe trashcan as applicable, along with a talk about using ONE wet wipe for a final clean up can alleviate anxiety about leaving anything behind.  Finally, how is your boy's diet?  Boys are more prone to bowel complaints than girls for some reason.  Are his motions comfortable?  Using excessive toilet paper can sometimes be a symptom of trying to alleviate the feeling of \"not done yet\" caused by constipation.  Less sitting, more fiber, a lot more water, and learning \"good elimination posture\" (you can google for this, it'll be safe for work) will go a long way to solve this.", 7369, "None", 0],

It's annoying. :P Enjoy it though, because when you reach 51, like me, you'll miss those times. You can do cosplay and play video games and that sort of thing, but over 30 you're expected to act really mature and not do stuff like that. Also, I know you didn't ask this but it's rather important advice....save as much money as you can for retirement! You don't want to be the 78% of the American population with no retirement savings. When you're old, often times you don't just have a heart attack and keel over. You can get cancer, heart disease, and a bunch of other things. Things that can require lengthy hospital stays. Half of what you'll get from retirement will be going for household bills. This means you may only have a couple hundred for savings. A night in a hospital can cost $1,000 or more, depending on the location. Find a savings system that works for you. It can be a jar system, an envelope system or anything that works for you as long as you save, save, save!

	52479 : ["Most people feel uneasy about aging and death, but it's not really a problem unless you are excessively afraid, or when it interferes with your life choices and decisions.  Getting old is no picnic, but because it happens so gradually, minute by minute, over several decades, you just go with the flow.. it's a natural progression. It's also a trade-off.. At 68, I miss my smooth skin, shiny hair, and attractive body. I miss putting on makeup and cute clothes and feeling desirable. I would love to be slender again, to do cartwheels down the street on my way home from school, and for my body to feel vibrant and strong.  On the other hand, I'm wiser and calmer; I wouldn't want to be my younger (naive, confused, anxiety-ridden) self again for anything. In my teens, 20's, and 30's, life was filled with one drama after another. If a relationship ended I thought I would die. Some heartaches took years to get over. Even friendships were proverbial rollercoasters that had periods of hurt, or not speaking (and usually over minor grievances). Misunderstandings with friends, lovers, teachers, family members, bosses, etc., were common because I had not yet learned how to understand others' viewpoints, and to empathize.  Marriage was another merry-go-round. It starts out good, but then you discover that it isn't easy trying to compromise with someone you have to live with. You really have to work at it because it's real life — it's not the romantic thrill that dating is. But if you do it right — respect and support each other — it can be very rewarding to have someone to lean on during the down periods, and to love you and to share the responsibilities. When I was young, it was an ego trip to have guys whistle and fuss over me, yet, it made me very uncomfortable to go anywhere, and I hated having to try and come up with ways to turn them down without hurting their feelings. But when I got fatter and older, it was a huge relief to be able to walk out of the house in my comfy clothes with my stringy hair tossed up in a clip, and no makeup except for a little lipstick. What freedom! My work life was challenging too. I had many menial jobs where I wanted to just jump out of my skin. At the end, I had a rather brief career that I loved.. but life is full of beginnings and endings, and my working life ended.  Today, I kind of like the way my gray hair softens my face. I love having all the time in the world to read my books and try new crafts, like making jewelry and handmade books. I volunteer at a cat shelter and I fall in love with every cat that comes my way. I go out for coffee or to book stores and arts festivals with my sisters and my friends. I have learned a lot about who I am and who I was — and I like who I am so much more than I did at 22.  Sometimes I notice the changes, such as drier skin and age spots.. but it doesn't bother me like a single little zit did when I was 16. A zit used to send me into a panic. Today, I see another new mole and I'm like \"whatever\". The trade off is that.. you just.. don't.. care! You don't have anything to prove to anyone. You don't have to worry about what you're \"gonna be when you grow up\".  You don't have to impress a man or wear stilettos or thongs. Every day of every age that you are, will feel normal. You will always feel like you. For example, my body is 68, but I can close my eyes and imagine being back in high school, and I am that same consciousness that I was. I can imagine and truly feel like I'm 10 or 15 or 25 years old. It's because you are your soul, not your body. No matter what the body does on the outside, you will always be you! As for death, there is nothing to fear there. You have Spirit Guides and angels who will help you pop out or float out when the time comes. It's easier than getting out of a car. One second you're in your body, and the next second you're looking at your body. You will not feel connected to your body; nobody ever has the desire to get back into the body; they just feel so good to be out of it. Your vision will be acutely clear. Colors will be brighter. You will just \"know\" things, without effort. You will feel lighter than air, and you will be as happy as a puppy at the beach. People that transitioned before you will be there to welcome and congratulate you .. such as parents and grandparents. You will be accompanied back to your spiritual home base, and your memories of your entire past existence, all the way to the beginning of your soul, will come back to you. You will remember the Divine Source we like to call God.. and you will remember who you are.  So, don't worry, be Happy! Enjoy all of the stages of life, for each one has something valuable to offer, especially if you live right and follow your heart and your instincts. You will come to realize that, in virtually every case, the things you feared turned out to be nothing worth worrying about. You were okay. And you will continue to be okay. ", 7372, "ZNM3j6xgaa", 0],

God establishes His Holy days, and they are in the Scriptures. Man does not establish what is holy, but God does. Easter (Ishtar) is a Babylonian fertility goddess, and she is represented by eggs and bunnies, symbols of fertility. God gives instructions to His people in the book of Jeremiah not to learn the ways and customs of the heathen, and gives the Christ-mass tree as a prime example (see Jeremiah 10:1-4). The Bible explains that cakes would be baked to the so-called Queen of Heaven, and it provoked God to anger, as His people who had a Covenant of faithfulness/loyalty to Him, went back on their promise and served false gods/idols. Note the hot cross buns that are baked on Easter, and who is doing this practice that God condemns. There is no Queen of Heaven. Mary is not the Queen of Heaven. Also Lent, the practice that condemns consumption of meat is not something that God installed (see 1 Timothy 4:1-3). It is interesting to me that the Bible gives us the identifying markers for the great wicked entity in the book of Revelation known as the Whore of Babylon, but people who call themselves Christians do not look into it. The only entity which fully matches the Bible's description, which is given in the book of Revelation regarding the identity of the Whore of Babylon is Vatican city, and the blood of God's people have been on her hands for years. The greatest persecutor of God's people is the Vatican.
