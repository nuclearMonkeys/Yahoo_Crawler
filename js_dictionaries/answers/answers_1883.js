Be careful with live plants I think there are a hassle. but that's just me I have a 125gal fresh water tank and I think dollar for dollar plastic plants are the way to go. side note IF you want you fish to mate raising the PH in the tank for certain species will make them want to mate", 9719, "None", -1],
	99914 : ["You don't need to soak your snails in liquid calcium.  That won't be good for their overall health.  It would be like soaking your whole body in a giant vat of liquid nail hardener just to help your finger and toe nails!  It might be great for your nails, but the rest of your skin would not do so well!  Adding a drop or two of liquid calcium to the tank water will raise the overall hardness of the water and help the snails make thicker shell growth and repair damage, but it won't really help much with the shells they've already grown.  Just keep up the treatment and feed them foods rich in calcium and be patient.  You won't see any instant changes, but over time you may see a little line or ridge where thicker shell growth has begun.   Most leafy green vegetables are good calcium sources as is broccoli, green zucchini and cucumber.  The snails love these foods, too. The number one source of calcium in greens is (believe it or not) dill weed.  Add a little bit of fresh (or dried) dill weed to your tank water and let your snails eat it as it softens and floats and clings to the sides of the tank.  Not only does it help them grow nice thick shells, but it makes your fish tank smell nice, too!", 9718, "8xIobS9Yaa", 1],
	99915 : ["Pleeeeeeeeeeeeease dont soak them in calcium!!!  Their skin is sensitive! You can definately try more nutritious foods(look into snail cookies....  www.thesnailstore.com)  or veggies like kale or collard greens. You could also try upping your PH a little.  Works wonders for keeping shells strong and healthy!  If you do this, do it slowly...dont want to shock anything in your tank.", 9718, "1c3t8S6Kaa", 1],
	99916 : ["What are you feeding them and how old are they? Very young snails naturally have thin shells. You can feed calcium rich foods.  Romaine lettuce, Broccoli and kale will get them the calcium they need.   Don't soak them in it, it will irritate their skin. Also, snails are survivors.  There's nothing \"fragile\" about them, really, chances are, they're fine and will get all the calcium they need.", 9718, "None", 2],

	99925 : ["I would not put copper pennies in a fish tank, it does not seem to be the right thing to do. As a penny corrodes, it might give off other things that not only kill the snail it will contaminate your tank too.  Ask at the pet store, how to rid your tank of snails.  It may be you will have to take the whole tank apart, clean, throw away any plants, live or artificial. Clean the ornamental with a salt solution, and rinse well, no bleach.

	99929 : ["I have been experimenting successfully with apple anails in my goldfish tank for the past one year, and here are some facts and info that you may like: Apple snails eat a much broader selection of menu items than mystery snails eat.  Mystery snails ignore most plants.  Apple snails love all plants except plastic and silk.   Apple snails eat day and night.  They will eat algae (after they eat all the other plants in your aquarium).  They greedily consume sponge filters if they can reach them.  Cover your sponge filters with gravel.  Their huge appetites cause them to grow quite large. Favorite Foods.  Apple snails are voracious plant eaters.  Their speed at devouring your skillful aquascaping will amaze and astound you.  Economical vegetable foods include zucchini, squash, green beans, and peas.  They much prefer fish food -- sinking and/or floating foods.  Apple snails quickly learn to harvest fish food from the surface. Dont give them sinking pellets if you do not want to dirty your tank water. Algae Eaters?  Sure, apple snails will eat algae.  They're just not very good at it -- like Mr. Magoo mowing your lawn.  You can see where they passed thru, but they'll never polish your glass, so do not be disappointed. Better Water: If you find your apple snails closed up or semi-closed for a couple days, you should move them to a different tank or give them a water change.  These big eaters can pollute their quarters fairly fast.  Organic wastes will stunt their growth and possibly even kill them.  They prefer harder water to keep their shells from getting pitted. Threats: Betta and Platties are very safe with them and vice versa.  Clown loaches and cichlids will kill your apple snails.  Some livebearers will pester them as they love to nip their tentacles.  They will crawl out of their tank if the top is open.  They do not necessarily remember their way home.  They can stand a couple of weeks on the dry carpet, but their survival rate starts dropping after that.  Do not use any medications with copper in them.
