BUt they might be masking them in some creative of change of words..such as global warming to climate change.....watch for them. It will increase other areas to cover it too..but they won't tell you that.  IT HAS TO....the government does not have money..it comes from US!  China has stopped giving us 1 billion a day as of   eve...so we are on our own. With businesses leaving everyday...job losses gaining .....etc....TAXES HAVE TO GO UP.  There is no way it can't.   CBO says it will increase debt..not decrease it.   The House-approved healthcare overhaul would raise the costs of healthcare by $289 billion over the next 10 years, according to an analysis by the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  CBO SAYS   In 2009, health care spending nationwide will make up 17 percent of the gross domestic product, or $2.6 trillion. But by 2017, health spending will make up 20 percent of GDP, and spending per person will rise from $8,300 to $13,000. Meanwhile, federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will nearly double by 2019, to $1.4 trillion. Most of the increase, according to the CBO, is not from changing demographics but rather from the rising per capita cost of medical care. ALL this for LESS care and access..no hip replacements...no heart valves....no breast cancer treatment...YEP...pay that much for WHAT?   If you need these things YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT and HOPE the medical CZAR will approve you using their hospitals and doctors on THEIR SCHEDULE. you are also paying for illegals and abortions....when millions are not covered by it. In the first nine months of 2009, $422 million was spent on healthcare lobbyists, 10 percent more than in the same period of 2008. That doesn't include the $122 million that health insurers lavished on lobbyists, or other amounts spent by groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which opposes healthcare reform and has historically spent more on lobbying than any other organization. The total cost of lobbying Congress and other branches of the federal government is on track to break last year's record of $3.3 billion   WE HAVE TO PAY THAT...GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE MONEY..IT IS OUR MONEY! We will also pay for attorneys and higher medical costs because there is no tort reform and with such poor care...law suits will be coming left and right! HERE IS ANOTHER LIE BY BOZO....Senate health care bill would reduce the number of uninsured people by 31 million. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has stated that under current law, 54 million people will be uninsured by the end of 2019 and that under the Senate bill, 23 million people would be uninsured -- a difference of 31 million people. Someone has to pay for it..no matter what name they give TAXES!  AND it will be US..not the rich.  They have BILLIONS in offshore accounts.... This is what you are paying for....and it is sad....very sad.....

	64442 : ["the sleight of hand performed by 0baMao and his politburo goes like this: collect the money to pay for the plan for 4 years before the plan is implemented, and 6 years after that, you've still got a little money left-10 years of paying for 6 years of universal intergalactic health'care'-it had BETTER not be in deficit at year 10...after that, OF COURSE there will be higher deficits AND higher taxes-they're democrats, they never met a tax they didn't like look at it like this:  tell your granny that she has to buy a new car-never mind that the car she has now is running okay, she has repeatedly said she doesn't WANT a new car, and she's able to keep up with the payments. tell her she has to start making the monthly payments NOW, but she can take delivery on the car in 4 years, and oh, btw, part of her car payment is going to help cover the car payment of someone else, too let me know what grandma sez let me know how she likes the idea", 8255, "25ff3871078732b22945836ac848d623aa", 0],
	64443 : ["Both... The problem with the health bill is that they have made a lot of assumptions on the costs.  So, when those assumptions fail and the bill comes in higher than expected they'll start a trickle-down tax meaning they'll tax people from the higher brackets down until they health bill is balanced.  However, they are still deficit spending on everything else so the deficit will still increase.", 8255, "ttNa7fVhaa", 7],
	64444 : ["Basic common sense should tell you that unless America enters into a decades-long DEFLATIONARY period where folks wages go down every year and prices do the same, then (measured in raw dollars) the deficit will ALWAYS get bigger on average as time keeps passing! Does it matter? Is it relevant to ANYTHING? Of course not, unless you think the economy is going to \"stop\"!!!! Think about it this way; you take your first job out of school at $15,000 a year, and over a period of 30 years your salary increases to $200,000 a year; if you had $20,000 in debt when you started, that MIGHT be an issue (but a very manageable one assuming basic math skills)....but it would be meaningless to you once your salary was $200,000! Even the mortgage companies will lend a $200,000 earner $600,000 to buy a house (Debt of three times their earnings! Horrors!) because they KNOW they will get their money back! The nation's \"Debt to earnings ratio\" has been lower than it is today (under Carter, for example) but has also been FAR higher... The \"dollar number\" of the deficit is not relevant without comparing it to what it is being taken out of! (Folks on neither side of the aisle are pointing this out, which leads me to believe NONE of them actually know how to count!) We will have higher taxes AND a higher deficit if you measure them in raw dollars, but it DOES NOT MATTER! If you personally pay more in taxes than you'd like, then you need to get a better accountant!", 8255, "None", 1],

Any thing you need as far as medical supplies , you crutches , wheel chairs all that kind of stuff, yep they are putting additional tax on all that too.  They will start collecting these taxes and they go into the general fund for three years before anyone gets any of the so called health care !

	64447 : ["My understanding was the increased taxes would pay for the program however the taxes would be less than what it would cost the taxpayer should the plan not be implemented. Personally, anything that reduces my paycheck in the form of another tax...is not going to make me a happy camper. I remember a movie about a boy who turned his dads business of raising horses in to a fertilizer business for himself. The boys competition took him to court for tax evasion because the kid was actually doing a better job than his competition. Long story short...the competition took the kid to court. The kid won his case saying the government had already taxed the food for the horse feed therefore what came out of the other end of the horse was being taxed twice. It seems an appropriate story for reality in that government taxes everything. We've already paid taxes on our income yet the government taxes any refund we get. Didn't we already pay our taxes on that money?! It's time for responsible government instead of all this wasteful taxation.", 8255, "0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa", 3],
	64448 : ["My answer is the same as last week. Democrats have stated that it took forty five or sixty years to get health care passed over the objections of the American people. As I said    that is a telling statement. They have finally been able to cram down our throats something that we do not want.   Their will be done. Most Americans have spoken we do not want a national or Government  Health care SYSTEM,m Our government is there to work for us not us for them. With Government health care they will tell you that your child will be covered by your health plan until age twenty six. Well, what id you do not choose to supplement your adult child's income so they have more to spend on IPod, clubbing, vacations. dating services etc. They need to pay their own bills. We need to pay ours. When will a bill pass that says due to the number of foreclosures, young people eighteen to twenty six will pay a tx that will supplement Grandpa's Real Estate taxes and mortgage payments? Government is over stepping and seizing control of our lives as well as the economy. Will another Civil War in the Future be necessary to give us back our individual sovereignty?", 8255, "Vh9CbtLUaa", 3],
	64449 : ["Don't believe either one. The Obama crowd started raising taxes the day he took office. The democrats never paid for anything, and sure ain't in the future, except for the bribes it took to get them in office, and to pass bills that line their cronies pockets. When we hear something, we need to separate the facts from the crap, and assume that if a democrat said it, let it go in one ear and out the other one. Hold on to your pocket book cause the crooks are on the loose.", 8255, "weXgmSnkaa", 3],
	64450 : ["I wouldn't believe any of them. They will all lie to you to gain your trust and then do exactly the opposite of what they said. Look at all the false promises Obama made during his campaign. Look at what congress is doing now even though their constituents are writing and calling and obviously against what they are doing. I think congress approval rating is somewhere around 35%. They are acting as if there will be no more elections. They don't care about getting re elected.", 8255, "8JPyP46Saa", 4],
	64451 : ["I don't see how either Obama or 'Congress' has earned our trust. I do trust Ron Paul, though, and a few others to at least tell us the truth as they see it.

	64452 : ["They are entitled to their opinion. I had hoped for a credible replacement of the Affordable Care Act. They have no credible plan to deal with health care reform. Where is the proof that Republicans will allow a replacement? Republican have alternative bills, not good ones. When in the current Congress will they offer those bills a vote? No one such bill is coming up for a vote. If it does, I will have some respect but repealing without a replacement will make everything worse. They know the Affordable Care Act is safe because the Senate will not repeal the law and President Obama will not overturn the law. So instead, they engage in partisan ploys, instead of finding bipartisan ways to improve the law or craft a better law. Their options are to defund only $100 million in the new law. The rest is mandatory so Republicans have no control over it. They can hold meetings and hold up agency nominations to slow down the implementation. Pass symbolic bills that have no chance of passing. That is it.  They are bending the own rules and principles to pass repeal to satisfy their base. Read the link below. Without a replacement, the repeal will increase the deficit. Without a replacement, the repeal would raise taxes on small businesses right now who use the tax credits to buy health insurance for their employees. Without a replacement, it would re-open the dough hole that people in Medicare pay for their drugs. EDIT See the link for how the Affordable Care Act is paid for from the right leaning think tank. Also, the exchanges are state based. The law gives each state leeway on how to design it and what is covered. There is minimum level of coverage only and there are no price controls on the insurance so there is no complete control of insurance.", 8255, "mBt5VgtHaa", -1],

Already paid for?  Guess again.  Congress still has to fork over money for most of it, and that's where the House will say \"No.\"  So all these admin people who need to get money to implement this socialism won't get paid. It's like that fence Congress \"paid for\" years ago.  See it yet? Addition: <<i mean paid for as in any spending has been already approved and repeal of aproval would still face the veto pen.>> Wow.

	64454 : ["The bill is already paid for??? No it isn't. We understand that the repeal bill is symbolic in nature. But it does two things. It tells the people that voted them into office that they understand. And it forces Democrats to defend Obamacare and vote against the repeal bill, which will likely harm them in November 2012.  The problem with amending ObamaCare is that the biggest issue is that it gives the federal government complete oversight and regulatory control over health insurance, with the power to decide coverages and costs. That is what we dislike the most about it. Hard to compromise on it when the issue is that basic. The only way to make it \"better\" is to defund the federal administration of ObamaCare and to pass bills giving state back the power to regulate it, as well as opening up the interstate market for insurance - basically the antithesis of ObamaCare.", 8255, "None", 0],

	64470 : ["Every Time!!!  I've done it for years, ever since I heard, or read/ the following true story> It kinda humbles us all. A man and his wife were once invited out to dinner by the man's employer. This was going to be a very important affair for the couple because they felt honored about the invitation. This particular employer was enormously wealthy. His financial status soared far above that of the employee and his wife. In fact, the couple became more nervous about the occasion as it approached with each passing day.  When the day of the dinner-date finally arrived the employer met the couple near the entrance to one of the most exclusive restaurants in the area. Following a formal greeting, the three of them proceeded toward the door with the wealthy employer leading the way. After a few steps the employer stopped in his tracks and appeared to be quietly staring at the ground in front of him.  After nearly bumping into the man, the couple stopped short, wondering what may be wrong. After a few seconds the employer bent over, picking up a single penny which lay on the sidewalk. He brushed it off, placed it into his pocket, and continued toward the door. The group was quickly seated and their order was taken.  As they waited for the food to be served, and, in an attempt to relieve an obviously tense atmosphere, the wife of the employee jokingly made the following comment: \"I noticed that you didn't walk past that penny on the ground outside. Is that how you have become so wealthy?\"  The employer smiled kindly, reached into his pocket, and brought forth the redeemed penny, laying it on the table-top.    \"Read what it says.\" He asked.  The couple leaned forward, reaching for the penny, and pulled it closer.  \"In God We Trust.\" Said the wife.  Then the employer explained that he didn't become wealthy by picking up pennies. He picked up pennies, and any other lost coins because of those words. He explained that God's name is holy. (Remember the words to The Lord's Prayer?) If we shouldn't use it in vain we should also make sure that it is not walked upon by passers-by. But, he also explained another reason for pausing a short time before retrieving the penny from the ground.  \"It is as if God has dropped a message into my pathway and He wants to remind me to keep my trust in Him.\" He told how he always said a short prayer of thanks, as a reply to God's loving message. The employer went on to explain, as they enjoyed the dinner and the evening together, that a single penny can become worth more than gold or silver in strengthening our relationship with our Heavily Father.
