	36817 : ["Another EDIT: So you couldn't refute a single thing, could you Solar Wind? So now you're telling us that the \"Grand Solar Minimum\" is going to cool us down.  The only problem is you've been selling that story for years, and it hasn't happened. That's another thing I've explained to you--the forcing from the Grand Solar Minimum is too small to stop the warming. I don't think you understood that, though, because it involved....physics. EDIT: Ah, poor Solar Wind, you got nothing, don't you? First, you make the mistake of claiming dividing by 4 is \"eliminating night\", when actually what it does is take it into account.  Apparently you believe there is no no night and the sun shines directly down on every spot on Earth continuously! The factor of 4 is what you get by using calculus to average over nighttime and because sunlight hits the planet at an oblique angle. Then you have no answer at all for why you got the abundance of CO2 wrong.  You also don't understand the first and second laws of thermodynamics--I've completely shot your \"ice cube\" analogy out of the water, and you can't defend it. When Yahoo Answers is gone, you might consider using that free time to take a class in physics, because clearly you don't have any understanding of it at the moment. Solar Wind, among all the deniers I am going to miss your questions. I don't believe you ever tried to understand my answers, but maybe with YA ending you'll actually try this time. In the first paragraph you seem confused about how much CO2 there is in the atmosphere--it is about 0.04%, or 400 ppm. As a decimal fraction, that is 0.000400--move the decimal point two places and it gives you the percent. So not 0.004%.  Water vapor, on the other hand, is about ten times more abundant, or 0.4% of the entire atmosphere. Since H2O and CO2 are by far the most abundant greenhouse gases, the total greenhouse gases in the atmosphere make up less than 0.5% of the total. Unfortunately many sources only give the SURFACE water vapor abundance, but it is not well-mixed in the atmosphere and falls off rapidly with height, so that is misleading. The idea that the greenhouse effect violates either the first or second laws of thermodynamics is poppycock. The first law is energy conservation, and I have shown you in detail multiple times how the incoming and outgoing energy fluxes balance at any surface. You must have been asleep when I gave those answers. We can write down the terms again if you like. Your belief that the greenhouse effect violates the second law is due to your misunderstanding of the second law. I have also shown you multiple times how the net energy flux in the atmosphere is always from warmer to colder, but you haven't understood that.  You illustrate your objection with a false dichotomy about whether your cup of coffee will be warmer with or without an ice cube in it, where the ice cube is intended to represent greenhouse gases in the upper atmosphere. Of course it would be warmer without the ice cube--but that is not the true choice. If you want to continue your strained metaphor, will your coffee be warmer with the ice cube (greenhouse gases) or with liquid nitrogen instead (the cold vacuum of interplanetary space).  THAT is the real choice. No, global warming and the greenhouse effect are very real. Maybe in the years following the closure of YA you'll have time to understand that.", 5478, "RhM1p6axaa", -11],
