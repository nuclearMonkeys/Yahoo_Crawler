	2656 : ["Developing countries don't have the means to conduct testing on a wide scale, so the number of cases could actually be far higher than the number that the government reports. People who live in developing countries may not have the same access to health care, and the standards of sanitation and cleanliness may be far lower than they are in developed countries, but many of those countries boast a more rural population where there aren't as many people concentrated in a relatively small area. Not to mention that the virus may not have even reached many of those areas to begin with as that would necessitate an infected person travelling into those regions or someone who lives there venturing out to a place where they may come into contact with someone who's infected.  There is some evidence to indicate that the virus spreads more quickly in temperate areas and less quickly in areas with a more tropical climate. Of course, this isn't a fixed rule, but when combined with a lower population density and less exposure to people in areas where the virus is already well established, it makes sense that warmer regions would generally have fewer cases.    ", 435, "None", 2],

	2692 : ["Zealandia is an almost entirely submerged mass of continental crust that subsided after breaking away from Gondwanaland 83–79 million years ago. It has variously been described as a continental fragment, a microcontinent, a submerged continent, and a continent. The landmass may have been completely submerged by about 23 million years ago, and most of it (93%) remains submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia that is above sea level, followed by New Caledonia. With a total area of 4,920,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi), it is the world's largest current microcontinent, more than twice the size of the next-largest microcontinent and more than half the size of the Australian continent. As such, and due to other geological considerations, such as crustal thickness and density, it is arguably a continent in its own right. This was the argument which made news in 2017, when geologists from New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia concluded that Zealandia fulfills all the requirements to be considered a continent, rather than a microcontinent or continental fragment. New Zealand geologist Nick Mortimer has commented that \"if it wasn't for the ocean, it would have been recognized as such long ago\".", 439, "HhZT5dqFaa", 0],
