	122814 : ["There are many causes of dark circles, from age, heredity, allergies, cold or sinus infection, bone structure and glasses which are not so commonly known.   If you would like to apply home remedies to reduce dark circles, here are some of my suggestions: Buy a box of regular, old fashioned unflavored gelatin (e.g. Knox) from grocery store. Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.", 10725, "fWYXZtwuaa", 0],

	122830 : ["It used to be that science couldn't answer the question about the origin of the universe or of the Big Bang, but that didn't mean we should make up an answer (such as a god) and say that it was the cause.  Within the last few decades science has discovered some good answers. Quantum mechanics shows that \"nothing,\" as a philosophical concept, does not exist.  There is always a quantum field with random fluctuations. There are many well-respected physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Sean M. Carroll, Victor Stenger, Michio Kaku, Alan Guth, Alex Vilenkin, Robert A.J. Matthews, and Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek, who have created scientific models where the Big Bang and thus the entire universe could arise from nothing but a quantum vacuum fluctuation in the quantum field -- via natural processes. In relativity, gravity is negative energy, and matter and photons are positive energy.  Because negative and positive energy seem to be equal in absolute total value, our observable universe appears balanced to the sum of zero.  Our universe could thus have come into existence without violating conservation of mass and energy — with the matter of the universe condensing out of the positive energy as the universe cooled, and gravity created from the negative energy.  When energy condenses into matter, equal parts of matter and antimatter are created — which annihilate each other to form energy.  However there is a slight imbalance to the process, which results in matter dominating over antimatter. I know that this doesn't make sense in our Newtonian experience, but it does in the realm of quantum mechanics and relativity.  As Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman wrote, \"The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense.  And it agrees fully with experiment.  So I hope you can accept nature as she is — absurd.\" For more, watch the video at the 1st link - \"A Universe From Nothing\" by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, read an interview with him (at the 2nd link), get his new book (at the 3rd link), or read an excerpt from his book (at the 4th link). -", 10717, "qVG5GJdPaa", 0],

	122836 : ["I didn't go freshman year, and I regret it oh so much. To be honest, I'm not quite sure why I didn't go. Anyways, I went to the last dance of the year, sadie hawkins, and I felt kind of out of place, since the other freshmen had experience at the dances and I didn't. I mean, it all worked out, I'm a junior now and I've been to pretty much every dance since then, but homecoming is pretty much unanimously considered thet best one at my school, and I only get four of them, so... Anyways, here's my proposed game plan: 1) Know what you're getting into. I'm not saying this to scare you, I'm just saying that if you go to a mainstream school, the dances are totally different than middle school. The prominent form of dance is the bump n grind, and it's not for everyone. Once again, ask around. (Also look it up here, HUNDREDS of people have asked how to grind.) 2) Organize a group. I went to my sophomore homecoming with 7 or 8 friends, and I really only knew four of them well. (I've since become good friends with the others). Surely you have other friends whom you'd want to invite. Believe me, a bigger group is infinitely more fun than just going with a friend or two. 3) Pick out a dress. Now I'm a guy, so I'm not going to be of any help here, but just ask around where people buy their dresses. Maybe go to Macys or Nordstrom. 4) Would it be cheesy to put have fun on the list? Anyways, I go to a pretty standard public school, so based on my experiences, that's how I would do it if I were you. Good luck, and once again, have fun. It's what dances are all about :)", 10726, "R3QArtcqaa", 8],

	122843 : ["Hi there...It's not unusual for some cats to have a tendency towards certain items such as plastic items such as bags (the crinkly sounds it makes perhaps a taste from a food item). Some tend to say it is because they are missing something in their diet. Some say it is rendered animal fat used in plastics that they are attracted to. And others think it may because it smell like food. However it's best to be mindful and supervise their inappropriate desires just in case of accidental ingestion of particular items...mainly plastic bags that get chewed off in pieces and anything easily swallowed. Ideally, pastic bags should be securely locked away if your cat later decides it would be something worth beyond licking like ...eating--ingesting this could create some serious medical problems which is expensive to later treat. It's best to please note that in the future never to pull out accidentally ingested material even slowly...from a cat's anus or mouth because those items may become twisted around the digestive tract therefore you may accidentally pull out the intestines. A vet visit would be required always under these circumstances.  Consider offering a safe kitty toys with similar textures in place of non-durable plastic items so that they learn to enjoy playing these instead. Here's a few websites that offer more reasons why cats possibly like plastic bags:", 10721, "0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa", 0],
	122844 : ["Do you eat a lot of meat or perhaps put a lot of meat or dairy waste products in the trash? Your cat must be attracted to something in the bag, not the bag itself. It is not necessary to stop her from doing so, but if you're uncomfortable about it, keep her away from it. You could put things she likes only in the kitchen trash bag and keep her away from the kitchen in general. I would generally advise not to let her because plastic is not good for cats in general. There is also the risk that she will bite into the bag. She could swallow any part of it and get it stuck in her system. Cats can't digest that kind of material.", 10721, "None", 0],
