Councils play this game within the law as simply there are too many people wanting social housing and not enough properties to go around......... so your options are ask the Council of their landlord list, who are  those private landlords prepared to rent to benefit collecting tenants and see what is on offer, once one rents to you, along with your AST you can then make a claim for HB and CTR..most private landlords will not take tenants on benefits, although some will so seek out the lettings agents /estate agents, go and speak to them  about your situation, some are great others not so great.... so you have to book a viewing and be clear at that time you will be claiming HB to pay the rent as there is a delay in applying for and getting HB you will need your savings to pay the security deposit and first months rent before you get the keys. Councils no longer hold any social housing stock, all their stock was transfered years ago and is managed by Housing Associations now, the Councils just manage the prospective tenant listing.
