That's just the way it goes.   It will typically take two or three screenplays to get the hang of the craft.  If you have a passion for it, you will improve.  Much of the screenwriting biz is about persistence and luck.  But it's going to take time, patience, and heartbreak.  Write, rewrite, and rewrite some more.  Show it to people who will give you honest opinions.  Friends who don't criticise are no help.  You want to get better, not stroke your ego. I would recommend reading the book \"backwards and Forwards\" to get yourself familiar with properly developing characters that have depth, releasing exposition gradually, etc.  Most screenwriting books are too dumbed down to really help you out, so I usually recommend reading playwrighting books (like the one mentioned above, which is a very quick read that explains important concepts clearly).  Read a lot of scripts, watch movies, listen to commentaries... Sorry, this isn't really to help you come up with fodder, just to shape it.
