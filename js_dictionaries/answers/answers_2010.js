The horoscopes are nothing more than a rough guide based on your sign/date of birth. Most of the time they are so wrong that they aren't even worth anything at all.

Well, there are a lot of ignorant people everywhere. So avoid those people and find the ones who are intelligent and open-minded. There are a lot of us out there.", 9954, "c4EzAAJlaa", 2],
	106264 : ["Mainly people who only stick to Sun Signs are people who don't actually know astrology, but claim they do. They either generally believe in the \"horoscope\" mambo jumbo (horoscopes does not exactly equate to astrology) or they don't know about natal charts, placements, etc. But of course they will claim that they know everything about astrology *rolls eyes*. And of course on top of it, these people also believe that astrology is absolute. They don't get that it is relative and that upbringing, environments, and experiences can alter those cookie cutter astrological profiles (which aren't even cookie cutter to begin thanks to Moon, Mars, Mercury, and etc influences).  Pretty much a bad case of people claiming to know everything without actually knowing the background and the information smh.

	106265 : ["Books are always better than the movies, because movies leave out some details. However, I have seen plenty of good book-based movies. For instance, neither LotR nor Narnia was utterly true to the book, but I did love them.", 9953, "u0zEutf1aa", 2],
	106266 : ["The movie Fight Club was better than the book in my opinion. Another Palahniuk novel, Choke, is coming out in September, and from the previews I think I'm going to like it better than the book as well. Maybe the accusation is true and Palahniuk really is just writing ready-made blockbusters.... But I tend to agree that the movies aren't as good as the book.   But sometimes when looked at as separate entities they are very good.  Like the movie American Psycho was very good on it's own merit (But the novel by Bret Easton Ellis is better by far).  And Catch-22 is an enjoyable movie standing on it's own (But nowhere near as brilliant as Heller's novel).", 9953, "fbAecUsSaa", 2],

There was a time when a hate existed, for what \"Nazis\" did to various races or peoples during WWII... have people forgotten?  I hope we're not heading there again!  I would tend to agree with the already given definition:   \"[Losers] are the ones who are mean and cold-hearted and insensitive to other ppl's pains no matter how hot they look.\" I would suggest that if one readily uses such terms as \"Loser\" and uses the term without substantial evidence, that they themselves may, unfortunately, be prone towards \"Loserism\".", 9951, "i9sdMtmuaa", 0],
