If that's the response you got after trying to speak with him in a sensible, adult manner... then I don't see why you should force your son to visit him.  I'm sure your ex cares about those kids, I can't imagine any father being that heartless or callous so as to not care! And to deny him access would be cruel! However, this man needs to understand that it's not ok to neglect and hurt his children. Your kids' needs should come before his! Unless he mends his ways, you have every right to keep your son away from something which causes him so much distress and grief.

Common theres only less than 40 million African Americans who almost all only originate from West & Central Africa mostly Angola and Nigeria. While there are more than 700 million Africans. When I mean diverse I dont mean being mixed race and not i mean from tall to small light to dark which are common features of different regions in Africa. West & central- Thick features East- Thin features South- Short & light North- Tall & dark African Americans took on the thick features from where their ancestors originated from, lips nose *** etc. So your answer is depends on who's judging everyones got taste but there is no such thing as an African look thats impossible to distinguish.", 9626, "None", 0],

In U.S. can be very UGLY African American girls as it can be very BEAUTIFUL African American girls. If you go to Africa there will be the same thing same girls r  PRETTIER than others. It's like people saying that LATIN AMERICAN girls r more prettier than WHITE AMERICAN girls. But in fact white and Latin girls could be  PRETTY or UGLY.

It usually goes like this... ahem \"Ooo! he has dreads.....they look waay better on Tom, actually Tom is the only white guy that can pull dreads off....plus he is the hottest guy to ever have dreadlocks....that guy over there ain't got nothing on him\" -You're taking German because of them - No, but i can break out into German when i'm mad. I got really mad in class once & started going off in German my teacher (who lived in Germany for 6 years) sent me out for using such foul language....thing is i have no idea what i said :/ -You giggle every time you drink Coke, although it was always your favorite soda, before you knew about Tom. - Nope -You giggle every time you eat pasta. - No....but i love pasta... -Sometimes, you only eat cornflakes and skittles and sausages, (not at the same time, ew) cause they remind you of Bill.

	97632 : ["Of course its a bad diet. See a doctor quickly and let them know what's been happening. You're not supposed to have orange juice and milk within at less than half an hour apart, coz when you have one directly after another you get sick, so that may explain why you're not feeling well. Of course you can't have a diet with just drinks and no food - that's really unhealthy... it may have worked for your friend but I highly doubt it will work for anyone else. Stop the diet immediately before you feel worse and of course it's a bad diet, if you want to lose weight then do it the healthy way-- do exercise and eat right, eat alot of fruit and vegetables, and do sport like cycling, tennis, basketball, volleyball, jogging, skipping, yoga, swimming, soccer etc or whatever sport you like doing. Also go to the gym regularly and maybe get a fitness trainer to help you lose weight and motivate you. Walk to places less than 30 mins in walking distance rather than taking transport, or ride your bike (if u have one). Do pushups and situps while watching TV and only eat when you're actually hungry, and not for boredom or because you feel like it. These tips will help you have a better lifestyle, feel better about yourself, look better and be a better person inside and out, and WON'T make you sick!!
