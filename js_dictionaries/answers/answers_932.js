	51880 : ["Prince Philip does not have the title \"King\" because the Queen did not ask Parliament for the title in respect of Queen Victoria's wishes. Victoria wanted the title King for her husband Prince Albert but this was denied even though there was precedent. Queen Victoria's predecessors as Queen (regnant ) were Queen Anne, whose husband was a Grand Duke and therefore the same rank as a King; Queen Mary II who insisted her husband not only be King but King regnant and this was agreed with him becoming King William III; Queen Elizabeth I who didn't marry so the situation didn't arise; Queen Mary I who had her husband Philip crowned King; Queen Jane whose husband, Guilford Dudley had the title King. Mary of Scotland, the mother of James I/VI gave the title \"King\" to her husband, Lord Darnley. Philip could have had the title King (consort) but the Queen didn't ask for it because Victoria, after Parliament snubbed her request for Albert, asked that if any of her descendants became Queen, they would not ask for the title for their husbands.", 7270, "80fd01eb6f2c0108807132e883d20ea5aa", 3],

	51883 : ["There are too many reasons the royal family wanted Diana out of the picture. That makes it difficult to completely dismiss the possibility they played a hand in her death. ", 7290, "None", -1],

	51888 : ["Most men are disappointing.. maybe she's just disappointed in him. ", 7285, "YjP01XlEaa", -2],
	51889 : ["As I understand it, they still do. Well, technically, they do have separate 'apartments', but that doesn't mean in British English what it means in American English, because in British English, it simply means separate sets of rooms within the same residence.  At any rate, the reason for it was for raising their children— to 'coparent', as it were, to use an Americanism. Then, once the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were grown, they'd gotten well past any unpleasantry and done it so long that it had just become habit. Also, a secondary reason, one that remains, is security, security being quite expensive and having two separate residences and two separate security details was and is more than either Prince Andrew or Sarah Ferguson wanted to bear the cost of, especially unnecessarily, as they are no longer embattled but are friends, and inconveniently, as it makes frequently getting together with their daughters much less of a to-do.", 7291, "None", 3],
	51890 : ["Because in truth they didn't want to divorce, but her behavior left them no choice. There is some speculation they may remarry in time, but I doubt either the Queen or Prince Charles would go along with that, and while he no longer needs their consent, he might miss the money.", 7291, "None", 3],

	51892 : ["Sweetie, you need to learn  not to believe everything you read about the royals, as tabloids don't tell the truth. It has not been proven that Andrew wanted to wear an Admiral's uniform--this is just a story that someone who is not  vetted, not identified, not trustworthy, has given a gossip reported, and that story repeated by other gossip tabloids and sadly, by lazy reporters from hard news sources.", 7293, "None", -1],
	51893 : ["I wonder why people keep assuming that the Queen nixed uniforms solely because of Prince Harry?  In fact, Peter Phillips and the Earl of Snowdon weren't entitled to wear uniforms either. That didn't cross anyone's mind? Andrew could have worn a vice-admiral's uniform, I believe.", 7293, "None", 0],
	51894 : ["Few, if any, of the Royal Family, seem to have any decency. It ended up a squabble over what uniform they would wear.  The second son demanding to wear a uniform, that he wasn't entitled to wear and Harry wanting to wear the uniform, of a regiment that he no longer has ANY links to. What to expect though; from a family that doesn't do SHAME.", 7293, "4fYEsgCwaa", -4],
	51895 : ["You are terribly biased. You don't like Meghan and you just wish to post false and negative things about her. Meghan made no announcements. Reporters stated who, not just Meghan, gave flowers. They mentioned Commonwealth realms, prime ministers...", 7294, "None", -2],
	51896 : ["The media announced it. She didn't issue a special statement. And all the media said was that a wreath from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been laid earlier in the week and that it included a note from  her since she couldn't be there.

	51920 : ["How do you imagine they communicate? Semaphore? Aldis lamp?  They speak the Queen's English FGS, which they all learn as a matter of course. If they go somewhere where they don't, they take an interpreter.", 7288, "None", 2],
	51921 : ["English is the Lingua Franca of the 21st century.   A number of years ago there was a documentary series about the descendants of Queen Victoria which aired in Australia where all of her living (at the time) descendants who were featured spoke in English ", 7288, "6Nxqnywuaa", 0],
	51922 : ["There's no one language that they all are expected to learn in order to converse with one another.  These days, most of them speak English, not so they can talk to other royals, but simply because it's becoming a general lingua franca. Perhaps we should start using the term \"lingua angla\".", 7288, "None", 1],
	51923 : ["The Queen is loved more that Diana was. Diana does have her detractors. Diana was young,beautiful, dressed well, was the superficial image of a British princess to those who really don't know what the world of royalty requires... Diana was able to make many people feel that she cared about them, something she held in common with Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Diana also helped tabloid reported write pro-Diana stories to feed her popularity.", 7289, "None", 0],

	51926 : ["She wasn't universally loved, and opinions of her have changed and become more realistic in the years since her death. She came along when there hadn't been a pretty princess for the media to cover in a long while -- Princess Anne wasn't media-friendly -- and after the 70s, a period when royal coverage had started to change, to become less distant and deferential and more in-your-face and relentless.  The coverage of Diana was obsessive, and parts of the public responded by demanding even more of it, which was the media's intention. It was more a fascination than \"love,\" though certainly some people irrationally adored her and have never gotten over it. But one such person, one such media obsession, was enough.  The novelty and lunacy of the Diana years had been exhausted. By the time later women marrying into the family came along, public and media attitudes were simply different, and so were the women.  A royal bride wasn't going to seem particularly fascinating any longer.", 7289, "None", 1],
	51927 : ["No. Family is family and he should go. If we were to extend your logic (?), then every family that has internal disagreements would be banning family members from attending family funerals. Sometimes, both sides need to “take one for the team” and attend and let the other family member attend and, oh I don't know, maybe act like adults maybe in memory  of dear old Grandpa. Besides, and speaking as an American, it would look better internationally for Great Britain if the Firm could just act like adults and have everyone there.", 7274, "2VtAreIyaa", 20],
	51928 : ["No. Choosing a career outside the family businss is not treachery, and, anyway, funerals are a time for reconciliations.", 7274, "None", 29],
	51929 : ["It was creepy that there was only *one* family member of hers, her mother, at her wedding. No old friends either, just some colleagues. Oh ... I forgot: Oprah and the Clooneys.", 7276, "None", 1],
	51930 : ["She doesn't hate her mother, and she seemed to have a good relationship with her father until he sold photos of himself in the context of her wedding and then a letter she wrote him on which she owned the copyright. She never had a good relationship with her half-siblings, who clearly resented her mother and her very existence.  (Her half-sister's own daughter is estranged from her, interestingly enough.) I don't think she hates the royals either, but she didn't get a lot of support from them or their staff.  They have an unfortunate history of expecting people simply to understand everything about royal life without being told, and to put up with a lot of negatives (such as the tabloids), without assistance when that can be extremely difficult. This was hardly the first time problems had emerged in the context of someone marrying into the family. You'd think they would have learned. So, no, not all of this was the Duchess's fault, not by any means. I question the wisdom of letting it all hang out in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, but there have been significant problems here on both sides.", 7276, "None", 1],
	51932 : ["I think the WHOLE thing with Megan and Harry is awful....no ones family is perfect. I loved seeing the best of them, not the very personal side of them.
