	95643 : ["Here are some great horror movies that I love and every horror movie buff should see. Jeepers Creepers, The Strangers(great horror with a lot of suspense), Vacancy(good horror with a lot of suspense), Silent Hill(very creepy), Black  (1974), Quarantine, The Crazies, Amityville Horror, Mirrors(it's a good scary movie and there are some gruesome deaths), Final Destination 1 & 3(not too scary but very good movies with a lot of gore), Dawn of the Dead(2004), Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead(1968 classic and great zombie movie but it's in black & white), The Funhouse, The Shining(good movie and \"Here's Johnny!\" love that part), Wrong Turn, Halloween(1978), A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984), The Cell, Session 9, House of 1000 Corpses, Battle Royale, The Uninvited(really good horror movie with a twist but it's rated PG-13), Martyrs, Let the Right One In, 28 Days Later, Inside, REC, The Midnight Meat Train and The Last House on the Left(2009, very gory with a lot of suspense, good revenge horror movie). My favorite movie is The Strangers because it's actually scary and it's based off true events. It's also something different in the horror genre which I love. Liv Tyler did an amazing job in this movie and it will scare you especially if you watch it by yourself at night. This movie was well written and the director knew what to do in order to scare you and it's a very suspenseful horror movie unlike any other. It's a good psychological horror and it could actually happen unlike a lot of horror movies out today. I love horror movies and I don't think they are funny like some people who act like they never get scared. I hate when people say they never get scared of horror movies or they are funny because obviously they are not watching any good horror movies.", 9555, "dl9Ajz5Paa", 1],
	95644 : ["Hello man. I found that the most horrifying movie I ever saw was \"The Ring\", the original Japanese version which features Yamamura Sadako, a kinda creepy girl that has psychokinetic powers and her powers were embedded to the video created by her minds, that if somebody would watch it, they will die. I mean it's scary first because of Sadako's face, her hair and her dress and the way people dies when they see her. Apart from that, the curse tells that when somebody watches the video, they will die after seven days, Sadako killing them, she's coming from the TV. Sounds odd, but herself coming from the TV is no joke and it's really really d*mn  scary. And there is also a part when some portion of the video was shown, and I was very very afraid to see it, because I think that the video really has the curse. So I waited seven days after I saw the movie but I didn't die LOL. The other one is \"The Grudge Ju-On\". Another Japanese movie that tells about the spirits of mother and her child and they are grudged. If you ever imagine a ghost peeking in front of your face once you wake up, yes, in the movie, the ghosts look straight in your eye when you are sleeping so that when you woke up, you'll look straight to their faces too. And it's scary. Though the child, when shouting, sounds like a cat. :) And the last one was \"Shutter\". I can't remember the details, and it's another Asian ghost story. All I can remember that a guy's girlfriend who used to always ride on his back died, and they cannot remember who the murderer was, but the real murderer was the guy, who can't remember anything. One time, he went to the orthopedic doctor to complain his aching back, but when the results come out, it shows he has no skeletal or muscle problems. But when the \"ghostly camera\" (I can't remember) took a picture of him, it is revealed on the photo that the girl's spirit is riding on his back. Too creepy. I always watch this movie again and again, and it always makes me shiver when remembering it. Hope you watched them too. I am really not afraid of Silent Hill, it's nothing but monsters, too mythical. I loved ghost movies, because ghost images can be drawn out of human imagination, for example, if you imagine a ghost, then probably a ghost will appear out of your imagination (like a group of fog sticking together) and it's very very creepy. Unlike monsters, when you imagine a monster, there is a small chance to have one appear from your imagination, at least. I played Silent Hill games and I found that the movie is not very scary, especially if you really do know what the monsters there are for, what are their symbolism and what does the walls undressing is for. And oh, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is also scary, but the trial and investigation in the latter part is so boring.", 9555, "LN07HZLsaa", -1],

Oh you need an extremely annoying movie??? Clock paintings Orange You watch it on Netflix watch rapidly in case you have that. i ultimately watched it some months in the past. completely annoying. VERY scary. Now isn't a creepy frightening movie. it extremely is basically very annoying! This too is one i will by no potential ever watch lower back.

F - that, I want to see competition like the one the MLS teams are putting out, with their stars and they are making the effort to make this an out of the ordinary league, not to mention they're in the middle of their season. I can't believe the performance America gave in the second half against the Dynamo, did those players even want to play? Because the 8 teams were selected by invitation they should come and play at their best. If not why accept such an invitation I would rather see a Tecos come and play their heart against the MLS instead of a Morelia with 15 year old players and an America and Chivas with B teams. I hope the Galaxy wins the cup, and MLS teams win the next few ones with domination so the coaches can get their head off their *** soon and bring real competition to the U.S. I want to see games like the ones played in the last CONCACAF Champions Cup.", 9556, "None", 0],

Lebron has 2 Regular Season MVP, and 0 Finals MVP. and he just blew his chance at #3 in a row. Anyone would have been better had they had Phil Jackson as a coach Straight out of High school. However Kobe didn't get that luxury either. Well since Kobe went from Charlotte to La. it would have been really weird for Philadelphia to trade away a player it never had. However Kobe still would have been an All Star. just maybe on a different team, or maybe in a few years after his first contract he would have signed with LA, since he wanted to be a Laker. Kobe owes as much Credit to Shaq, and Jackson, as they owe him. That's why it's a team game, and the Best Team wins Championships. Lebron has had Quality teams for several years, which is why they have had the best season records for the last 2 years. And that place you call a Gutter, is where Lebron was Born. He is justafied in moving and signing where ever he wants. Fact is Lebron chokes or \"Quits\" as Cavs owner would say in the playoffs. When the going gets tough, Lebron gets going. i expect to see more of it in the next few years, even as Lebron Jumps on DWades back, hoping that DWade can piggyback him to a championship.", 9557, "bxC81tJqaa", 2],
	95679 : ["First off, Kobe didn't start out with Phil Jackson when Kobe came into the league, his coach was Del Harris for two years. I give you credit that those first three rings wouldn't have been possible without Shaq, maybe one out of the three if Shaq wasn't there, but Shaq needed Kobe just as much as Kobe needed Shaq. All of Shaq's rings required him to have a great guard around him. Even with Orlando when they went to the Finals to lose he had Penny Hardaway. There were many times Kobe got the Lakers out of tough situations himself during those first three championship runs. Second, Kobe was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets then traded to L.A. for Vlade Divac. He just lived in Philadelphia. Third, no excuses for Lebron James. With a best record in the league two years in a row and a Finals visit against San Antonion, one of those three runs should of been a championship. If his players were that bad around him, they would of never had those best records in the NBA back to back or a Finals appearance. Just admit Lebron buckles when the pressure is on him.", 9557, "PAOvtso1aa", 2],
	95680 : ["I think all teams take it more seriously now than what they used to, as the money is quite good for those teams that progress each round.
