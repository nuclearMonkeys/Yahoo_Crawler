	67336 : ["there is nothing wrong with better salaries for teachers but his proposals will just make education in this country worse. He's going to award good teachers with higher salaries and instead of allowing teachers to help each other out he's going to create competition.", 8419, "mHdKANPNaa", -1],
	67337 : ["It's a good idea. Germany provides taxpayer-funded University education, even for foreign students. Needless to say, the Germans make high-quality technological products and are the envy of the Developed world today. They are the freight train which carries the European Union caboose.", 8419, "None", 6],
	67338 : ["No and hell no.  1) We spend more money per student in K-12 than almost every other nation in the developed world for a fraction of the results. Our K-12 system as of today is  failing by any measure. Our colleges and universities are among the best in the world and students from all over the world come to study here. So why apply the failing model of K-12 to the university system? 2) It is almost universally acceppted that well over half of the kids who entered college this fall are not academically ready for college. Most college freshman will be taking \"99\" and lower classes that do not count towards their degree in an attempt to be ready to take classes they actually need for their degree. This is a direct result of the situation point out in my first billet point but if we decide to extend universal education to undergraduates all we are going to do at least as of today is throw even more students in to lecture halls that are not ready for college.   So what is the solution. We need to do away with the current model of K-12 education and replace it with a system or a series of sytems (IE religious schools, trade schools, traditional schools) that works. For how much we currently spend on K-12 we should be able to come up with a modern competant work force able to compete globally. We also have direct evidence on some things that need to be implemented right away: 1) School uniforms- almost every study done on this topic has come to the same conclusion. School uniforms raise acadamic achievement levels. Every school in the nation should implement this policy. 2) Parental involvement- Where I live the best school in the city has  policy that requires parents to donate so many hours a semester. The results our this 1 school sends more kids to Ivy league schools than every other school combined, and this schools college acceptance rate is double every other school in the city. In one district if a kid was written up 3 times or failed a test 3 times the parent per school policy had to attend 1 week every course with their child. The results were amazing. Test scores and understanding the material went way up. 3) Student involvement- Study  after study has shown that when parents take an active role in their kids education the students take a more active role in their own education. This is most likely why the 2 examples I pointed out above worked.", 8419, "GHusBLjgaa", -2],

	67340 : ["I believe in Jesus Christ because the Bible has convinced me. I also know He is who He says He is because He has delivered me from many demons that had attached themselves to my life.

We have very good security policies and procedures in place so he was not successful although I was really scared at that time and it was very obvious with the 911 call I made that day. (I heard the tape when they played it in the court after he was caught and was charged.)

	67350 : ["Honestly it is a bad idea. Because it is basically regulation and for that to work you really need the govt to do a good job. (do you really think that is going to happen?). In any case a BIG reason why costs are so high is BECAUSE the govt interferes by providing aid to students who wish to go to college. This is seen as easy money by college and therefore they naturally charge more. Guess what? That means higher prices because the college will get paid as the govt guarantees it and there is no reason for them to reduce prices. And therefore if they continue to do this, then the govt will eventually run out of that money and will have to tax more. Ultimately it is better for the govt to be out of it and not provide any financial support at all. After all it is just a form of welfare. I am quite confident that if govt didn't interfere by providing financial aid it would mean less people who would be willing to go to college at a high price meaning market would have to drive the prices down.", 8419, "38063ff20156d7f58a3299173ef4d513aa", -2],
	67351 : ["Well, I do think that college should be free for those who pass tests to qualify.  And those who do not should have the opportunity to learn in a trade school a productive skill that would allow them to earn a comfortable living.  It is absurd to not properly educate our citizens.  The costs of education should be absorbed by a tax on all businesses for which there are NO loopholes.", 8419, "None", 6],
	67352 : ["Because the angel Gabriel told me that Jimmy Carter will become the Antichrist aka Dajjal (8th King in Rev. 17) and he will serve another term in office after the death of Obama (7th king).    The angel Gabriel told me in Aug. 1973 when i was in Phillipsbrug, Montana that Jimmy Carter will become the Anti-Christ, and that he is going to change his name, and divorce his wife!  Obama is going to die first and then the Anti-Christ aka Dajjal who was one of the previous 7 Presidents will take his place!    Rev. 17:10  And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, [and] the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
