	105662 : ["I used to have the same problem with my curly hair, but I have found a routine that works wonders! Just try it out and see what you think! What you'll need... -wide tooth comb -no-frizz curly hair gel (you can find some at any target, drug store, or salon) 1) While in the shower wash your hair with your regular shampoo and conditioner 2) Part your hair while you are still in the shower (if possible) 3) Comb your hair only ONCE through when you get out of the shower. (if you could not part it before, do it while your hair is still dripping wet, like you should be doing for this whole step) *Do NOT towel dry your hair, this is a HUGE frizz causing action *Regular brushes separate hair way to much causing even more unwanted frizz 4) After you have combed your hair then take about a dime-quarter size of hair gel (depending on hair length and natural volume) and rub it in your hand and use it to scrunch your hair. Only scrunch your hair once or twice in the same spot, otherwise you will cause frizz *Do not play with or unnecessarily touch your hair while it is drying 5)Once you have completed steps 1-4 then let your hair air dry, if you do not want soggy shoulders then put a towel around your neck to catch and water while your hair drys *If you need to dry your hair, add a diffuser attachment to your hair dryer and use it to dry your hair only halfway, if you dry it more than halfway it was make your hair frizzy 6) Once your hair is dry, Voila! you are done! *If you are still not satisfied with your curls then add a few in with a curling iron that has a barrel the same size as your natural curls, which is usually a 1\" barrel! I hope this works as well for you as it does for me! (i use this routine every day and I love it) Good Luck!", 9936, "None", 0],

Please Note:  Anyone can cut your hair as long as the guidelines listed below are followed.  We encourage all of our donors to go to a salon they are already familiar with to ensure their comfort when donating. GUIDELINES FOR ACCEPTABLE DONATIONS Hair that is colored or permed is acceptable. Hair cut years ago is usable if it has been stored in a ponytail or braid. Hair that has been bleached (usually this refers to highlighted hair) is not usable.  If unsure, ask your stylist. We are not able to accept bleached hair due to a chemical reaction that occurs during the manufacturing process. Hair that is swept off of the floor is not usable because it is not bundled in a ponytail or braid. Hair that is shaved off and not in a ponytail or braid is not usable. If shaving your head, first divide hair into multiple ponytails to cut off. We cannot accept dreadlocks. Our manufacturer is not able to use them in our children's hairpieces. We also cannot accept wigs, falls, hair extensions or synthetic hair. Layered hair is acceptable if the longest layer is 10 inches.  Layered hair may be divided into multiple ponytails. Curly hair may be pulled straight to measure the minimum 10 inches. 10 inches measured tip to tip is the minimum length needed for a hairpiece. Printable Guidelines (PDF) Please Note: Shorter hair will be separated from the ponytails and sold to offset the manufacturing costs. Although the shorter hair cannot be used in the hairpieces, it still greatly helps to reduce costs. Gray hair will be accepted and sold to offset the manufacturing costs. Colored hair is not usable if it is colored over bleached hair.", 9937, "d1ssVZtNaa", 17],
	105686 : ["Israel is a democracy. I challenge anyone with one line putdowns to describe African Apartheid & Israel's democracy & find the commonalities.  Then describe other democracies like the U.S. & it's commonalities (so false double standards at Israel aren't used). Even Jimmy Carter was speaking only of the territories, says in his book that it is NOT about apartheid racism, but about land & security -- very real & normal concerns.  He has since written a letter published in the New York Times, apologizing for using the word & all the misleading it did. The demographics aren't that cut and dry.  The Israeli Arabs are having much less children now that they are adopting a more educated & democratic/capitalist lifestyle.  (Or however you want to put it.)  Also now that there are less socialism programs that pay large families.  Jews are having a little more.   At no point would Jews consider apartheid.  That's absurd once you visit Israel & see how democratic, modern world it is.  It's just those who disdain Israel that want to paint with this propaganda.  They're jealous of the democracy Israel as... but just wait... the Arabs are fighting for theirs with the Arab Springs! @DanDan gives an example of the bigoted double standard at Israel.  In many countries, inner cities or certain areas tend to have less equality in how things are distributed.  It's not supposed to be that way, and people work against it -- but it happens.  To point at Israel vs. all those other countries, is itself a form of discrimination.  To call it apartheid is a deep insult to what S. Africans went through when they by law couldn't vote, or hold decent jobs. As for Desmond Tutu - he's repeating the Ghandi discrimination in reverse.  Ghandi for all his genuis was heavily bigoted against \"darker skinned, lower casts.\"  Tutu for all his powers is heavily bias against Israel for having \"white\" people, & for him that's an image of \"dominating darker\" even though it's not an accurate view of how the country works. @Sameer's observation There is an Arab on Israel's Supreme Court & Arabs serving on lower courts, an Arab cabinet member, and about 12 Arab legislators in the Knesset parliament. @Michardov Your definition (which you've changed from the original source's wording you used to post) -- isn't distinguishing actions taken in self-defense from apartheid actions for racial or group reasons.  A killing for self-defense, (whether slashing or by gun,) is not killing for murder.  A description that objects to murdering can not be applied even though many elements appear to be shared, as it ignores the motives involved themselves.  You haven't proven your claims. A conflict between two groups is not defined as \"apartheid.\"  Arabs in the territories have been attacking Israel from long before Israel was in the area, when Jordan & Egypt held it, aka conflict.  (Tons of bombing attempts into Israel.)  Furthermore, essentially none of that can even be pretend to apply within Israel itself, which has the exact same ethnic & religious group, so it's not by group but by actions. The current arrangements areas a,b & c, are results of prior negotiations, and can not be defined as \"apartheid\" since again, they are stages of negotiation within conflict & dispute over who owns the LAND - not who controls the PEOPLE. On a side note - to be apartheid it has to apply to essentially all people within control of the the apartheid laws - not to some but not others. To parse a concept that way, where the essense of the concept is removed - is to not use the definition itself.  In your definition, apartheid is oppression of a group because it is that group, not because there are other factors involved such as their behavior, ideology & goals.", 9935, "None", -2],
