And why would anyone even support such a move when that is state sanctioned legal discrimination against men, only because they are men?  Whatever happened to equality? If the reverse was happening, where women were being denied access to something where men were not, then we can be assured that a lawyer somewhere would take up the case and have that overturned due to women being a protected class in society through laws that protect them from discrimination by gender. Sadly, men have no such protection guaranteed into law, and so suffer legal discrimination to this very day where women do not. Time for a true \"equality\". And time for that to happen now, rather than wait until feminists get their way of ramming through frivolous types of social equality for women only, first, as they have been doing for the decades following women's full legal equality to men for the last more than half century here in the first world. .", 8093, "aSm9xSn3aa", 4],

	58312 : ["Mainly it's the quality of the image and the speed, and to a degree, how much it costs to operate each one. A laser printer uses microscopically fine ink powder to print 1,200 dots per square inch, making a crisp image every time. A dot matrix printer uses pins that press an inked ribbon against the paper (in small dots, hence its name) and can achieve 240 dpi--but only by going over the area multiple times. Its best image is readable, but nowhere near as crisp. Using black and white only for comparison purposes, a dot matrix printer in draft mode--one pass, no going back over characters to print them darker--may achieve 50 pages per minute, while a laser printer produces about 25 pages in much better resolution. Dot matrix printers' pins make noise, a buzz or rattle, in operation. The laser is substantially quieter. Both have some noise as new sheets of paper are drawn from the paper tray. So how often you print and who the noise might bother could be factors. The costs to purchase a mid-quality printer of either type are comparable. The cost of operation varies widely. Ribbons for dot matrix printers, while hard to find in stores, are inexpensive (and can be ordered online in anticipation of need). Ink cartridges for laser printer are far more expensive, and are a major factor in total cost of operation. If your need is for printed pages that look professional to the recipient, I'd recommend a laser printer. If you will transmit pages digitally but want drafts you can mark up or share for input, a dot matrix might be fine.", 8082, "None", 2],
