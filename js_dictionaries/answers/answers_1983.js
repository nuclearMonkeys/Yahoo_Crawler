Medium income under Reagan was flat and his era started redistribution of wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthy. One of his policies that started this was a large income tax break but then 4 years later had a large increase in FICA taxes on the premise of saving social security but was in reality to try to reduce the budget deficit caused by the income tax decrease.  The two tax changes in effect gave the richest Americans a large tax break and the poor and the middle class a very large tax increase.", 9898, "ymOLcU3kaa", 2],

What Creatine monohydrate does is give you an extra few jumps at the end of your rep cycle to perform more reps in your routine than you normally would, assisting in metabolic ATP muscle contraction. So if you take it regularly, and you have to take it regularly, or \"load\" a few days before it will begin working effectively, then you'll find yourself able to pull off a last few teeth gritting curls or presses which you would normally have been incapable of doing at the end of your rep cycle.

Only buy it in the powder form, as pills don't work well. They go thru the digestive track, and lose much of their value. After the 5 day \"Loading\" period, just 1 serving per day. Creatine helps your muscles store water, so you can work out a little harder. Taking it with Fruit Juice gets it into your bloodstream quicker, because it attaches to the sugars.

I could send a great journal article about Creatine which says the pills are 20% less effective than water soluble powder.  Loading phase should last about 5 days and take 5g grams 4 times a day. Maintenance lasts for about 6 weeks and you only need 5g in the morning before any exercise Remember to take a couple of weeks break aswell. Not only does it clear your system but it stops your body getting used to the creatine levels. Take it about an hour before the workout... Drink plenty of water. And work hard!! Unfortunately there are a lot of ppl who say Creatine is bad too take. I can reference to a journal by Poortmans and Francaux (2002) where they state that there is no proof that Creatine has any bad side effects... I've taken it for 2 years and not had problems. That other guy has for 14 years, had no problems. Supplemented Creatine does not stop novo Creatine Biosynthesis and does not impede the Dietary intake either.

Make sure you eat alot of Fiber. Lack of water to the Digestive system will cause Constapasion. Because most of your water is going to your Musculatory System. About 2/3 of it. Thats sort of bad. 5th. Take it before you work out for full benefits.  Ok. Just another thing for you to think about what scientists have been looking into. Steak has Creatine in it.
