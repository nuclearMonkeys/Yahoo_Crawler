	15974 : ["I've installed several Swann security camera systems and replaced a few hard drives (to store more video - nothing was wrong with the included hard drives). A 2.5 inch \"standard\" hard drive is for a laptop or netbook. A 3.5 inch standard hard drive is for an external case or for a desktop computer. There are some exceptions for this, but this has been \"normal\" until recently. With a computer, usually, the user powers it up, does work, powers it down or the computer sleeps. Normally, the hard drive is not spinning to record or read 24/7/365. With a CCTV NVR/DVR, the hard drive starts spinning as soon as it is plugged in/powered up - and, barring a power outage or drive replacement - that hard drive is on 24/7/365. The CCTV NVR/DVR drives are designed differently from \"normal\" computer drives because the requirement is very different. If the hard drive you got was not rated for being in use 24/7/365, and it fails prematurely, you will need to replace it - and after the next replacements, you will have spent more than the amount you paid for the incorrect drive had you purchased the correct drive... There are reasons for the specifications being different if computer (normal use), computer (media), Network Attached Storage (NAS), CCTV... Using the incorrect drive for the task is like using the wrong tool for the job... like using a hammer on a screw (rather than a nail). Will it work? Perhaps, but it will also, likely, fail sooner. Also, the connectors used by 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch drives will differ. Since we don't know which NVR/DVR you are using with your security cameras, there is no way for us to know if yours requires 2.5 inch or 3.5 inch drive.

	15985 : ["Equalizers can really strain an amplifier. If you turn up some frequencies too much, it can make your amplifier distort and may damage your speakers. Turning up the sound just 3db doubles the power needed.  Most people use equalizers to reduce the output of some frequencies to match the acoustics of their room, since some frequencies are amplified more than others because of furnishings and furniture. You can certainly use the equalizer to tune the music to your liking but beware that it can damage your speakers or amplifiers if you are not careful. The equalizer is not a toy and in fact I do not even own one. People who use equalizers wisely will use a spectrum analyzer to see if their listening room or car interior can emphasize some frequencies too much. If so, then they will use an equalizer to flatten the frequency response. They then refrain from changing the settings. They do not use the equalizer to tailor their music to their own tastes because it will sound tiresome after a while to hear music that is colored by an unnatural emphasis of some frequencies. ", 2735, "None", 1],
