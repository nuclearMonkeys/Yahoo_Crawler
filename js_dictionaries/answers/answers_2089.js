I've lived in Miami my whole life, recently moved up to Gainesville (North Central FL) and it's a BIG difference.  Even the weather is different. If you live by a coast, you won't have it that bad. It's hot all over FL but living closer to a coast you get that ocean breeze that keeps temperatures stable throughout the year. In Gainesville, it's the middle of a swamp.

Then my MD switched me over to Entocort (a steroid w/ no side effects that goes straight to the inflammation in the small bowel and it's not absorbed into the blood stream where it affects other body parts like bone loss, facial hair, mood swings, etc.   It takes  anywhere from a few days to weeks depending if the patient is able to wean off the steroids w/o any problems such as flaring up on a lower dose and having to increase it and then slowly taper again.

	110257 : ["All ethical theories accord some importance to human happiness. They differ first in their conception of what that happiness consists in, secondly in views of how an agent's own personal happiness is aligned with, or traded against, the general happiness, and thirdly in whether it is necessary to acknowledge any other end for human action. The simplest doctrine is that happiness is itself quite straightforward, consisting for example in occasions of pleasure; that agents only do seek or ought to seek their own happiness; and that there is no other possible or desirable end of action (see hedonism). The Cyrenaics may have held a doctrine along these lines. Complexity arises with more subtle conceptions of the nature of happiness (see, for example, Stoicism, Epicureanism, felicific calculus), and more concern for the possibility of incorporating the good of others into one's own ends (see, for example, altruism, friendship, prisoners' dilemma). Finally, theories of ethics that are not consequentialist in nature may recognize other ethically important features of action than those arising from the goal of maximizing either personal or social happiness. Read more:  As a state and a subject, it has been pursued and commented on extensively throughout world history. \"Call no man happy till he is dead.\"  - Aeschylus \"True happiness arises, in the first place, from the enjoyment of one's self, and in the next, from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions.\" - Joseph Addison Happiness is different from pleasure. Happiness has  something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing. -George Sheehan Happiness is often associated with the presence of favourable circumstances such as a supportive family life, a loving marriage, and economic stability. Kali Yuga, the age of darkness, is the time when these favourables are difficult to find. Unfavorable circumstances - such as abusive relationships, accidents, loss of employment, and conflicts - diminish the amount of happiness a person experiences. In all nations, factors such as hunger, disease, crime, corruption, and warfare can decrease happiness. However, according to several ancient and modern thinkers, happiness is influenced by the attitude and perspective taken on such circumstances. From the observation that fish must become happy by swimming, and birds must become happy by flying. Aristotle points to the unique abilities of man as the route to happiness. Of all the animals only man can sit and contemplate reality. Of all the animals only man can develop social relations to the political level. Thus the contemplative life of a monk or a professor, or the political life of a military commander or a politician will be the happiest according to their own \"psyche\".

	110262 : ["Facts are important in order to make good judgments; therefore let's briefly review the facts thus far:   Disclaimer: This is based on media journalism so no guarantees of any of this information being accurate.  Rudy Eugene: 31 year old male  Assault and battery arrest at 16 years of age; and 7 different adult arrests from 2004 to 2009; the most serious being trespassing and a marijuana related offense. (That's it, no other arrests)   Friends, family, and devoted girlfriend of six years claims: Rudy was not a violent person; had minor bouts of depression and friends used the term “he was battling demons recently” to refer to his depression; smoked marijuana occasionally but quit recently; never did any hard drugs; worked at a car dealership washing cars; 2011 lost his home he owned to foreclosure; was religious and would often take his bible with him; was looking forward to starting his own business.  Ex-Wife: claimed in divorce papers several years ago; she left him because he was becoming increasingly violent toward her; but Rudy never arrested for violence against his ex-wife.  Subhash Kateel from Huffington Post claims police investigated Rudy for threats against his mother in 2004 but NO charges were filed. (I put Kateel in here because this is the first I heard of this claim).  Can anyone identify the “early warning signs” in Rudy's life that would rise to the level to cause this kind of violence?? If not can anyone explain to me why so many are claiming Rudy was an evil person who devoured “bath salts” before the attack??  The ONLY person who mentioned “bath salts” was Armando Aguilar (The head of the Fraternal Order of Police Miami) who got on T.V. and ranted about “LSD like bath salts” implying they were responsible for Rudy acting the way he did. However it is important to note: Aguilar has nothing to do with the police investigation; doesn't know Rudy; was not on the scene; has no knowledge of the case; does NOT have any evidence that ANY drugs are involved in this case, let alone “bath salts”; has NO toxicology report because Rudy's body was still on the sidewalk when Aguilar deemed it important to get on T.V. and spew forth his version of events based on nothing more than guessing.  Now you have a news media (noted for their integrity and journalistic skill) reporting that LSD is to blame or “bath salts” are to blame; and some are reporting LSD and “bath salts” are to blame; all based on Aguilar's implied theories. (And in fairness to Aguliar, he has good intentions, and the media is twisting much of what he actually said and taking some of his comments out of context.)  In light of all the available facts thus far; it would be prudent for everyone to slow down and at least wait for more information (like an autopsy report, which is forthcoming), before implying that Rudy was some kind of crazed worthless animal who loved to devour “bath salts” and other hard drugs in his free time.  It's possible that Aguilar guessed right and bath salts may have contributed to this tragedy (we may know once the toxicology report comes back); but that doesn't negate the fact that Aguilar and the media (big surprise there) acted irresponsibly in this matter.  It is quite possible Rudy Eugene may be a victim in this tragedy too.", 10132, "Zwp4p0ABaa", 4],
