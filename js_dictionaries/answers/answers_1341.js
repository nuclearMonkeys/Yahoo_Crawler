Few if any scientists argue otherwise, and no scientific study has attributed more than one-third of the recent warming to solar effects (most attribute just 0-10%).  Bottom line - it's not the freaking sun! As you point out, the cooling of the upper atmosphere (not just the stratosphere, but also the layers further up) is even further evidence that the sun is not to blame.  Not that we needed any more evidence. As I discuss in the link below, I believe the cooling of the upper atmosphere is the final nail in the AGW denial coffin.

	72643 : ["I do not think Tony Romo is overrated and this opinion is coming from a 49er fan.  Remember that football is a team sport.  One man can not do it all.  Romo does have some clutch wins, but has also lost games on errors too.  They are few errors and will happen in the beginning.  Most of the games that I saw were not his fault and was out of his control.  For instance, for some reason, many Cowboy fans blamed Romo for the defeat against the Eagles in 2008.  I watched that game and do not understand why he was blamed.  Romo did not allow the Eagles to score 40+ points.  The Defense did.  Romo was playing from behind and was forced to throw the ball.  The Eagles D was ready for it because they new the Cowboys had to.  Also, The Eagles Defense was top notch.  What did you expect? For the most part, Tony Romo gets way too much criticism than he deserves.  He scores points and moves the ball.  It was not his fault that the rest of the team did not pick up the slack.  It didn't help that TO started a locker room fued that screwed up the chemistry either.  If you think he is overrated, then you obviously do not see or appreciate his immense talent.  I would gladly take Romo for the 49ers any day. Thumbs up to those who agree.", 8691, "4kdlE54Paa", 1],

	72650 : ["\"While long used as a folk remedy, apple cider vinegar became well known in the U.S. in the late 1950s, when it was promoted in the best-selling book Folk Medicine: A Vermont Doctor's Guide to Good Health by D. C. Jarvis. During the alternative medicine boom of recent years, apple cider vinegar pills have become a popular dietary supplement. Look on the back of a box of supplements -- or on the Internet or in the pages of any one of the many books on vinegar and health -- and you'll find some amazing claims. Apple cider vinegar is purported to treat numerous diseases, health conditions, and annoyances. To name a few, it's supposed to kill head lice, reverse aging, ease digestion, and wash \"toxins\" from the body. Most of these claims have no evidence backing them up. Some -- like vinegar's supposed ability to treat lice or warts -- have actually been studied, and researchers turned up nothing to support their use. Other claims have been backed up by studies, but with a catch: vinegar may work, but not as well as other treatments. For instance, while vinegar is a disinfectant, it doesn't kill as many germs as common cleaners. And while vinegar does seem to help with jelly fish stings -- an old folk remedy -- hot water works better.\" \"Scientific Evidence of Apple Cider Vinegar Benefits But there are some medical uses of vinegar that do have promise, at least according to a few studies. Here's a rundown of some more recent ones. * Diabetes. The effect of vinegar on blood glucose levels is perhaps the best-researched and the most promising of apple cider vinegar's possible health benefits. Several studies have found that vinegar may help lower glucose levels. For instance, one 2007 study of 11 people with type 2 diabetes found that taking two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar before bed lowered glucose levels in the morning by 4%-6%. * High cholesterol. A 2006 study showed evidence that vinegar could lower cholesterol. However, the study was done in rats, so it's too early to know how it might work in people. * Blood pressure and heart health. Another study in rats found that vinegar could lower high blood pressure. A large epidemiological study also found that people who ate oil and vinegar dressing on salads five to six times a week had lower rates of heart disease than people who didn't. However, it's far from clear that the vinegar was the reason. * Cancer. A few laboratory studies have found that vinegar may be able to kill cancer cells or slow their growth. Epidemiological studies of people have been confusing. One found that eating vinegar was associated with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer. Another associated it with an increased risk of bladder cancer. * Weight Loss. For thousands of years, vinegar has been used for weight loss. White vinegar (and perhaps other types) might help people feel full. A 2005 study of 12 people found that those who ate a piece of bread along with small amounts of white vinegar felt fuller and more satisfied than those who just ate the bread. While the results of these studies are promising, they are all preliminary. Many were done on animals or on cells in a lab. The human studies have been small. Before we will truly know whether vinegar has any health benefits, much larger studies are needed. How Should Apple Cider Vinegar Be Used? Since apple cider vinegar is an unproven treatment, there are no official recommendations on how to use it. Some people take two teaspoons a day (mixed in a cup of water or juice.) A tablet of 285 milligrams is another common dosage. Apple cider vinegar is also sometimes applied to the skin or used in enemas. The safety of these treatments is unknown. What Are the Risks of Apple Cider Vinegar? On the whole, the risks of taking occasional, small amounts of apple cider vinegar seem low. But using apple cider vinegar over the long term, or in larger amounts, could have risks. Here are some things to keep in mind. * Apple cider vinegar is highly acidic. The main ingredient of apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. As the name suggests, it's quite harsh. Apple cider vinegar should always be diluted with water or juice before swallowed. Pure apple cider vinegar could damage the tooth enamel and the tissues in your throat and mouth. One study found a woman who got an apple cider vinegar supplement stuck in her throat. She seemed to have suffered lasting damage to her esophagus. Vinegar has been known to cause contact burns to the skin. * Long-term use of apple cider vinegar could cause low potassium levels and lower bone density. If you already have low potassium or osteoporosis, talk to your doctor before using apple cider vinegar. * Apple cider vinegar could theoretically interact with diuretics, laxatives, and medicines for diabetes and heart disease. * If you have diabetes, check with your doctor before using apple cider vinegar. Vinegar contains chromium, which can alter your insulin levels.\" \"Wha", 8684, "None", 1],

	72652 : ["AWW, you dog sounds soo cute! =) Anyway not quite sure what your asking, but DO NOT let your cute little Labrador eat Apple seeds because you don't want to see an apple tree growing inside your doggy belly :)", 8682, "None", -6],
	72653 : ["Many people like to give their dogs apples as a treat, and many dogs like the treat. Still, there's a lot of information about apples that says they will poison the dog. In general, apples are harmless to dogs. However, there are a couple of things to be cautious about: the seeds and too many apples. The Seeds Apple seeds contain amygdlin, a form of cyanide, which is very poisonous to every living thing. Cyanide prevents the blood from carrying oxygen throughout the body. If the dog swallows a few seeds, the body will detoxify itself. Actually, the dog must ingest large quantities of apple seeds to do major damage. Also, the cyanide is within the seed covering, and if the covering isn't broken, it will pass through the dog's system intact. Sort of a no harm, no foul situation. So, if you're going to give your dog apples, core the apples. Then, cut them into bite-size pieces and feed the dog this way. This may seem overly cautious, but why take the chance. The Good Things Apples are a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin C as well as low in saturated fat and sodium. Some believe that vitamin C can help hip dysplasia, a common ailment in large and large, purebred dogs. Saturated fat contributes to heart problems. Apples contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which contribute to a healthy, glossy coat and help to control skin allergies. Too Much of a Good Thing On the down side most of the calories in apples come from naturally occurring sugar, not processed sugar that might be found in other treats it's true. Still, sugar is sugar, so it can contribute to weight gain in large quantities. Also, apples contain calcium and phosphorous, so if your dog has kidney trouble, don't give him apples. Too much calcium and phosphorous in the kidney are indicators of kidney stones and early- to end-stage kidney disease. Be careful of omega-6 fatty acids because they can cause inflammation, which wouldn't be good for an arthritic dog. They also aren't good for dogs with kidney disease. The apples themselves don't have that much omega-6, but if the dog gets it from other sources, it can be a problem. Eating too much apple can loosen a dog's bowels, and you don't want that. How much is too much depends on the dog, so show caution. Don't fear apples as a treat for your dog. Just remember to core the apple, so those pesky, poisonous seeds get thrown away. Keep the portions a reasonable size, and the dog's coat will gleam, he won't have diarrhea, and he'll be one happy camper. Papaw", 8682, "2P5WRadhaa", 4],
