	52883 : ["Other people's family trees that they created are known to be full of mistakes. They accept suggested relationships without confirming the documentation the made the site suggest it. But if you can access the right documents and see for yourself the data on census forms, church records of births and deaths, death notices, obituaries, wedding announcements, birth announcements, draft registration, social security data, and more, then you can confirm for yourself what's correct it your own tree. Early on I made the mistake of assuming other people did careful research, and it caused me some mistakes in building my own tree, but I think I've undone them all. Other people's trees also led me to information I would not otherwise have had, like the relative known to me only as \"Ricki\" was really a woman whose maiden name was Ricci and who used it as a nickname.

	52892 : ["I have frequently seen atheists criticize communism and Muslims. In any case, here in the US, Muslims are not the heavy hitters in trying to impose their religion upon others and trying to get the government to help them in that.

	52895 : ["If your son is 12 years old and still isn't able to read at grade level (he should be in the 6th grade by now) then he needs to be tested for both a reading problem and a learning disability. As for his disdain of being read to, that's understandable. He's not a little kid anymore- he's on the threshold of puberty. MOST boys his age generally develop an aversion to having parents do intimate activities like reading with them. He's also beginning to develop a sense of his own identity as a person, and you engaging in infantile activities like reading to him isn't helping him do this. Being read to is for toddlers and babies, and your son is long past that stage. I'm sure it embarrasses him, too. When was the last time he invited friends over while you were doing this with him (before the pandemic, of course)? If it has been a while, then you have your answer as to why he doesn't want you doing this with him. And rather than tutoring him yourself, you really need to have a professional do this. Or at the very least, a college student, who can relate to your son as a peer instead of as a parent. Your son's attitude has nothing to do with not wanting to \"bond\" with you. It has everything to do with the fact that he's growing up. Boys his age are usually embarrassed to have their moms pay this kind of attention to them. If you get a college student to come and tutor him, it might be good to find someone who is into gaming and knows how to play Minecraft. You'd be surprised at the lessons your son can learn from the video games.", 7410, "None", 1],
	52896 : ["Yes, on going talking makes it really difficult to focus. All the explaining and chatter add to his dismay of the topic. I'd just do it a wee different. I'd give him a paper where he could write the answers to a few key points in chapter. If he doesnt know then re read chapter find answer. Something that became very helpful in our house regarding home schooling and video games during covid19. Video games are time consuming and on the minds of pre teens from the moment they wake up. This is why we have study hours, study time, art time, clean your room , help around the house time, play with dog time. Shower, be helpful, respectful. As well as a get up time and bed time. So don't ask just like if you were in school no video games all day. After 4pm for 1 hour till dinner...bitchy, or have an attitude then pass on that hour. Another hour after dinner, that's it 2 hours a day on the video games. On a rare day,  done with school work, reading, spelling, being helpful, responsible,  respectful, showering and cleaning up your room with out being told...an extra hour of video games may happen but, don't ask. Hold him more accountable but, talk less. He needs a set reading daily time say 20 mins daily....reading aloud is a grwat way to improve reading skills.", 7410, "pfUZXsjxaa", 2],
	52897 : ["I agree with the other respondent who'd suggested letting your pediatrician know of your concerns about your son, as well as talking with the school counselor.  (Even if schools are closed due to Covid-19, the school counselor may give a call back.)  Most public schools have a Child Study Team (cst) who may provide evaluation for students with a possible educational disability, such as dyslexia and/or ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder).  The cst usually includes a school social worker, learning disabilities teacher-consultant (LDT-C), and school psychologist. Before testing by the cst was to begin, they would need the parents' permission.  The school social worker may interview the parent to inquire, for instance, about his or her concerns for the child, the child's medical history, family history, and/or the child's developmental milestones (such as when starting crawling, walking, and talking).", 7410, "rSTNUGy3aa", 0],

LOL We got the help our son needed. We learned behavior modification techniques. We learned to adjust and cope. So can you...if you are willing!  Ask yourself: is your spouse supportive about your child's condition? That is ULTRA important.
