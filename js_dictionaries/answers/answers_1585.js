	84944 : ["my answer it seems so, over and over with a smiling face disgracing America, with what our canidate does in their private life even in the Whitehouse or with a spiritual leader has nothing to do with their likeability or ability! of course it has to be America's fault, they went to Iraq not to stop terrorists but to get better gas prices.  America should not save its gas reserves, because when the terrorists take over Iraq we will have no other way than to pay in 9/11s and whatever they decide to charge us for the only available amounts of gas we can get over South America's dwindeling supplies. \"Ask any terrorist, dont vote for McCain.\"  that is the best reason to vote for McCain. asked who is the greatest hero and villan if we are talking about the living Jesus =hero the devil =villian Politics at the moment  according to the muslim terrorist and their ultra liberal american supporters ... Hero =they  consider both Hillery and Obama  the terrorists have a #3 too= Ben Laden (Pastor Wright prefers Kadaffi of Libya=the man with for years open door policy to let all terrorists against the USA to train protected in his country) their greatest hero's of the moment Villan would be any infadel Bible believer in  the USA  (Ironic the USA is its worst enemy as spiritual leader Wright stands with the terrorists and their leaders \"9/11 was an act of God against the USA & God 'd' the USA\"). Jesus is my best friend so hehe i have peace in the midst of storm, and it will be coming when the terrorists take over Iraq and have the oil money to sponsor them.  Yesterday said if Iran nuclear attacks Israel (Hillery and Obama said then they will take action) ---Nuke Israel a country the size of New Jersey... and nothing is left to take action for but burry the dead.  Has America mostly gone brain or heart dead or both? sort it out and there are spiritual and political and other related JEWELS here=spiritually right helps too= its important to be good and believe Jesus!  extreme liberalism happened because as is testified to 'communist' people arosed others and used government issues like protecting the communists=Vietnam where 2 1/2 million along with Cambodians were slaughtered when we walked away, or now in support of the terrorists to let them take over Iraq and its oil wealth. it is in part inspired by the ACLU a group headed by Jewish and non Jewish secularists, to remove the Bible, God, prayer, and whatever it stands for from public school and the public. We for the most part didnt learn in the past the need for faith yet before world war II many did learn=Jewish and all peoples, in Krakow Poland a Jewish reviival for the Messiah had been experienced and many Jewish people came to faith and the promise of heaven in the Messiah. Happy day & please pray as I help Jewish people to Jesus, they as predicted would reject their Messiah \"He is despised and rejected of man, and we would as it were hide our faces from him.\" these claims were made to me  that'Jewish sources' claim that there is no concept of a second coming to fulfill prophecy. Yet,Scriptures say; \"When we shall see him whom we have pierced we shall mourn as one mourneth for her only son which is gone.\" Zecariah 12:10 Jewish writers wrote of 2 messiah's one to suffer & one to reign why not the same one coming twice? Prophecy ended upon the death of the last prophets -- Zechariah and Malachi ( \"the one of righteousness shall come\" last chapter of the prophets)  The prophecy still had to be fulfilled! \"Unto us a child is born, a son is given, and he will be the wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father and the prince of peace.\" Isaiah 9:6 70 years before the destruction of the temple messiah Yeshua/Jesus came, if he had not come then as the Messiah we would be left with no fulfillment as predicted by Isaiah and commanded by Moses of the blood sacrifice Leviticus 17:11 \"The blood makes atonement for the soul.\" Isaiah 53 \"All we like sheep have gone astray, and the Lord will make to light on him, the iniquity of us all.\" \"He will lay down his life to make atonement for our soul\" the Jewish people could not die innocent/with no sin for their own sins! DESCENDENT OF DAVID  The Messiah must be descended from King David (see Genesis 49:10= Messiah will come before the king's line is destroyed, and Isaiah 11:1& 10 \"To him will the gentiles seek\").  Mary was in the line of the root of Jessie and David=Matthew chapter 1 gives the exact perfect geneology  Jewish people today do not know if they are in the line of David so it would be impossible to know today. TORAH OBSERVANCE The Messiah will lead the Jewish people to full Torah observance. Jesus stated \"I did not come to do away with the law, but to fulfill it.\" John  John 9:14 records that Jesus made a clay paste to heal a blind man's who he met begging to be healed, in violation of Shabbat, which caused the Pharisees to say (verse 16), \"He does not observe Shabbat!\" Fact is they added to the Torah (the Talmud)their own laws and rules.  Jesus asked if your animal child falls into a ditch on the Sabbath do you rescue it? or put medicine on your child's eyes to keep from going blind on the Sabbath?  If you say no youre uncaring, if you say yes but reject the Messiah for doing the same youre a hypocrite. MISTRANSLATED VERSES \"REFERRING\" TO JESUS? VIRGIN BIRTH  The virgin birth is derived from the verse in Isaiah 7:14 describing an \"alma\" as giving birth. The word \"alma\" has always meant a young woman. I already explained this and I agree with the 70 rabbis that translated it as 'virgin' to have a miracle birth of 'God with us/emanuel' what miracle would it be for a woman to have a normal birth? and how could God be concieved from two people in birth? SUFFERING SERVANT  Christianity claims that Isaiah chapter 53 refers to Jesus, as the \"suffering servant.\"  In actuality, Isaiah 52 & 53 describing the exile and redemption of the Jewish people. I explained this above, what is ironic is those that claim that people with sin, could die innocent for their own sins and make atonement for themselves as well as all be born in Bethlehem= The Messiah = \"Out of Bethlehem shall come this one from eternity.\" Micah 5:1&2 hehe today Bethlehem is entirely Arab, meaning if not Yeshua/Jesus, the Messiah will be an Arab the way i came to know him was the prayer he asks us to say; \"Help me Jesus, I am sorry for my sins, even one lie, come into my heart and be my friend, amen\" this he promises to do Revelation 1:1 chapter 1 verse 1 and 3:19&20 \"I love you, and ask you to repent of sin quickly. Behold I stand at your heart door and knock, if you ask me in I will come in and be your friend. \" (sup/have fellowship) The Messiah is my best friend I have one and his atonement too, what do you have? Shalom/peace David My mom who hates Jesus was an average like for the most part blacks and Jewish they are strong liberals demanding in Government  the Democratic line to ban 1. the bible,  2 teaching of marriage instead of homosexuality and fornication, and  3God from public schools and the public too,,  yet in recent times she has changed and is even voting for McCain maybe, because he stands against letting the terrorists take over Iran and its oil wealth to make 9/11 look like kindergarden play in the world and the USA,, Obama's spiritual leader..., against saying God 'd' America (It should go to hell weeping forever for rejecting the salvation of Jesus/Matthew 24), or against having 30 million dollars while starting poor in Arkansaw investing 300 dollars, making hundreds of thousands (White water scandal where those inviolved with the Clintons went to prison yet they stayed around to disgrace America to the whole world, but Bill never inhaled or 'told a lie') well may we stand for the Messiah no matter what or else we mall fall for just about anything,  and dont forget to laugh hehe, David have a day care free  and just food for thought as someone shared this=Paedophilia is disgusting and it still goes on. Eight-year-old wins divorce in Yemen?  A YEMENI court has granted a divorce to an eight-year-old girl whose unemployed father forced her into an arranged marriage.(To a 28 year old man) In response to a question from Judge Mohammed al-Qadhi, he acknowledged that the \"marriage was consummated, but I did not beat her\". Unbelievable it still carries on from Mohammed's time to this day. Isn't it time Islam put an end to this immoral perversion? Mohamed as the Haddith says married a 9 year old Aisha, thank God in civilized countries we have prison for these types. The issue in Islam is not abuse of little girls, because that men make the rules, when we reject Jesus love and care for all mankind and salvation.... As Muslim leaders the problem ... it is the major 2 groups Sunni and Shiite's = Sunni moslems the majority of Islam; blowing up each others Mosques and shrines and killing the religious leaders, since the Golden mosque bombing in Jan 2006. please pray for peace in the middle east Psalm 126 :6  and in our hearts peace ;) happy day!", 9185, "None", -1],

	84957 : ["My computer came with Norton preinstalled. I used it for a couple of months until the free trial ended. I then download the SBC(now AT&T) Yahoo Online Protection Package. It required me to completely remove the Norton program before it would function. This is because you cannot run two AV programs at the same time. They conflict and provide no protection at all. The two of them can also do physical damage to your computer. (Rare, but possible). I recommend the AT&T package. The AV program is excellent and is not an attention whore like the Norton was. The only time I get bothered by it is when it runs a scan. I have mine set to run scans every three days.  It automatically updates. You will see an update Icon in the SysTray when it is doing this. The Auto update feature allows for updates 24 hrs a day.  You will hear negative opinions from people about the Protection package provided by AT&T (SBC). Most of these opinions are from people who know nothing about the programs and have never used them. I have used it now for almost a year and am very happy with it. While I used the Nortons I was being constantly infected. The Nortons was great at informing me I had an infection, but poor at removing it. Of course, much of this was based on my ignorance about using AV and AS programs. I have since educated myself and have been infection free for almost a year. I recommend you use the package. You are paying for it in your DSL fees. I will recommend you add two programs to run with the package. You can use more than one Anti-Spy program.  Windows Defender Beta 2. Set it for daily full scans. This Microsoft site will tell you how to use it properly. When you know how to use it properly, it is a very good program.  You can dowload it here: SpywareBlaster. It does not scan and remove malware. It blocks programs it is updated to recognize as malware. You must update it manually. You can make a donation and get auto updates. You can get it here.  I recommend these because no single AS program can handle all the Spyware on the Net. It is recommended you use at least 3 AS programs that provide active protection. These two will provide that additional protection. They are free. Everything I recommend is what I use. I would not recommend it if I did not believe and trust it to help keep your computer safe.
