	106460 : ["Great question! Yes, we do. As a faith community, Muslims--especially those who are former Christians and/or who have Biblical knowledge--believe that there are many prophecies in the Bible which point to Prophet Muhammad (Allah's Peace be upon him) coming after Jesus, son of Mary (Allah's Peace be upon him).  However, the prophecy which I believe is most notable is Deuteronomy 18:18-21 in which Almighty God tells Moses that He will raise \"them\" (Israelites) up a \"prophet from among their \"brethren\" (Ishmaelites) like unto thee. . .  And I will put My words into his mouth. . .\"   Why do Muslims believe this?  We believe that both prophets Moses and Muhammad had many things in common, such as manner of birth, marriage and/or family life, and being recipients of Divine Law Codes:  Torah (Taurat) and Qur'an.  Other than being a prophet of Almighty God, Jesus did not have anything in common with them.  The Gospel (Injil) was not meant to be a Divine Law Code.  Jesus never said or claimed it to be so.   The term \"brethren\" is referring to the Ishmaelites (Arabs), the descendants of Ishmael, son of Abraham and his wife Hagar.  (According to Islamic tradition, Hagar was a lawful wife of Abraham, not his concubine.  Therefore, Ishmael was not his illegitimate son.)  According to that verse from Deuteronomy, Moses was an Israelite.  His people were the Israelites.  The Ishmaelites were their blood relatives, their \"brethren\".  Therefore, the prophet \"like unto thee\" to be raised up from among their brethren could not have been Jesus because he, like those prophets who came after Moses, was an Israelite.  Muslims also believe that Jesus was aware of this and prophecied the coming of Prophet Muhammad. Both Judaism and Christianity view Ishmael as Abraham's illegitimate son through Hagar.  Both faith traditions teach that Hagar was Abraham's concubine, not his wife.  Therefore, Ishmael was not the covenant child.  Those who disagree with Muslims on this issue should ask themselves this and come up with an appropriate answer:  Is/Was Ishmael really Abraham's illegitimate son, or do they want Ishmael to be illegitimate to prove that Isaac was more legit and superior and, therefore, qualified to be the covenant child?  The 21st chapter of Genesis must be re-read.  It has contradictions in it. As a faith community, Muslims are aware that The Bible doesn't specifically name the prophet to come after Prophet Jesus (Allah's Peace be upon him).  However, The Bible gives signs that Prophet Muhammad (Allah's Peace be upon him) was, indeed, the one prophecied in Deuteronomy.  (Even if he actually were mentioned by name anywhere in the Old and New Testaments, would Christians, Jews, and Hebrew Israelites believe and accept it?) Personally, I believe that when Almighty God established the covenant with Abraham (Allah's Peace be upon him), racial superiority was never intended to be a factor in determining who was to be the covenant child.  Even if Ishmael really were born out of wedlock, the \"right of the first-born\" was still his, regardless of the marital and/or social status of the mother, and also regardless of how the father feels about the child's mother.  If people insist Hagar was Abraham's concubine (modern-day terminology, mistress), then so be it.  However, the \"right of the first-born\" still belonged to Ishmael.  He was not a mistake.  (No human being is!)  Abraham's feelings about her were irrelevant. Even in this day and time, human beings are still being born out of wedlock.  Are fathers stepping up to the plate and taking full responsibility for their offspring, or are they behaving as if their childrens' mothers don't exist?  If any of these men are married and paying a lot of attention to their \"legitimate\" children, that is most unjust to their other children.  They must recognize, acknowledge, and respect all of their children, regardless.  All children have the right to know who their fathers are and to be supported by them.  No excuses! As far as Islam is concerned, Ishmael and Isaac were brothers and sons of Abraham, and their mothers were wives of their father.  There was/is no superiority of one son over the other. Human beings were created by Almighty God.  His Divine Stamp of Approval is on us.  No one is illegitimate.", 9960, "caen2K64aa", -2],

	106483 : ["Some think that 'faith' & 'blind faith' are the same. They aren't. The Bible definition of faith is at Hebrews 11:1-\"Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.\"- so, unlike what many think, the Bible doesn't encourage 'blind' faith...and everyone has demonstrated the kind of faith the Bible encourages for something in their life. To illustrate, if you have ever bought an item from a reputable company & then waited for it to be delivered, you have demonstrated that kind of faith- both the reputation of the company & the sales receipt in your hand gave you reason for faith in the company from which you bought the item, & gave your guarantee that you would receive what you had purchased...before the actuality of you receiving it.  Some say they cannot believe in what they cannot directly see for themselves. But the term \"evident demonstration\", in the scripture, carries the idea of faith being based on previous evidence, that which at times contradicts things that only appear to be factual. For instance, the sun appears to revolve around the earth- rising in the east, moving through the sky, & setting in the west. But, evidence from astronomy and mathematics reveals that the earth is not the center of the solar system. Once you become familiar with that evidence & accept it as true, you have faith that the earth revolves around the sun...despite what your eyes tell you.  So, therefore faith is not blind. On the contrary, it gives you the ability to see things as they really are, not merely as they seem to be. The Bible also actually encourages you to 'test' & 'prove' your beliefs & faith (2 Cor 13:5), and to 'dig for truth as for hidden treasure' (Prov 2:4).
