	19026 : ["In my State, in order for a 16 or 17 year old to get the Pfizer vaccine outside of a school program, both the teen and the adult have to show their IDs. If the pharmacist sees that your last names do not match, then they will require additional documentation. Either a matching birth certificate listing your name as a parent, or official court documents naming you as the legal guardian of the child. If you are unable to produce any of that, then they simply will not administer the shot. Don't bother trying to fake these documents. People submit all kinds of forgeries to pharmacies trying to get medications they aren't supposed to, and the pharmacist is on the hook if one gets by them. They are very experienced at knowing the real from the fake and they aren't going to be slackers about it. When the vaccine becomes approved for younger children, who don't have IDs yet, the pharmacist is still going to need to see the parent or guardians ID, with one of those records matching the approximate age of the child. That's how \"some guy at Walmart knows you're not his dad.\" It will not work, so you'd be risking criminal charges for no gain.", 3182, "None", 1],

He's raising his left hand and turns and shoots you. I'm sorry. I'm not waiting to find out. I'm shooting. He played himself. He could have thrown the gun away when he was running down the alley. Then the gun would not have been at issue. But he thought that he'd do the old Oke Doke. You'd relax and then he turn and shoot you. Then he realized he had no more bullets.
