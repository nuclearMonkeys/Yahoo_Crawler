However when you start swimming, or doing any other sport for that matter, you will be sucking at it for the first year or so but if you keep up at it and do what your coach says I assure you that you will improve. (swim faster, better stroke etc.) And yes it is true that some people are more buoyant.

I really don't know what to do when I see them, there are times that I cannot sleep because of them and they don't just appear on our basement but on my room and also I get a mood swing when I saw them it's like connecting themselves to me(e.g. when I saw \"the silhouette\" I just felt like so sad, that I just want to suicide and there is a time that when I felt one I just go mad for no reason, so mad that I just want to swing my bat on something).
