You have your faith and choose to believe in something greater than than scientific reasoning to why the planet was created and what we are all doing here. Logic and reasoning is what we have, and you have your faith and \"spirituality\" ... If you choose to blind yourself  from this reasoning (which makes more sense than a made up God), then continue doing so.  Everyone has their opinion about religion, but practically calling atheists stupid doesn't make me want to believe in your God any more than before. Skeptics are not spelling it out? At least the skeptics attempt to explain their reasoning and logic... whilst religious people have \"evidence\" and proof.. But what is your definition of proof? A book supposedly written by apostles and Jesus-like things? Skeptics write books too, you know.  What I'm trying to say is that unless you have SOLID evidence (besides things written by believers) that God exists and Jesus existed, do not try to take down skeptics reasoning and logic. YOU are the people with the short answers... Because after all, God is real. God is great. ... According to you. You can come to my door or get me to attend your masses, but in the end, you are all just preaching hand-me down stories and myths. This \"information\" has been passed down for thousands and THOUSANDS of years... who's to say this story was not adjusted to, oh I dunno, spice things up. Religion is a story that's been told so many times that things were altered. No one knows the truth. We may never know...  But if science proves it first, well..

Here's why I don't believe in God when it comes to your premise. I would agree with premise 1, if he rose from the dead 3 day later I'd probably have a very high chance in believing. Premise 2 is where my belief goes down the drain. There's no empirical evidence of it happening. The only thing you can go on is a book that says it happened. Premise 1: If a book says it, it must be true. Premise 2: Zombies are in a book, so they must be real.  I'm 99.9999% sure they are no zombies in the world so there is no evidence left for Jesus rising from the dead.", 8085, "ClxlD2B4aa", -1],

For example, in your logical argument re: jesus, you forgot to prove whether Jesus existed at all. Or indeed, whether he truly was part of the holy trinity or, as the muslims (I think...) believe, just another christian prophet. You talk of logic, and proof, but you have none. You have to take it on faith that Jesus is part of the trinity, actually existed, actually rose from the dead, so on so forth, just as any monkey who wasn't there has to take it on faith that the roman empire fell due to decadence and infighting. Believe what you believe, brother. But remember, if you want to convince others who *don't* believe, you have to have proof.", 8085, "wiRpuzLoaa", 1],

The Marriage license grants rights to your spouse pertaining to your household, medical and life insurance, parental decisions, contracts for loans etc. It shows the other person is a decision maker or beneficiary of your household. Now the definition of what is required to obtain a marriage license is also set by the state. The state defines a marriage between a man and a woman. This has nothing to do with religion.

The problem is that some people of religion believe that their job is to inform people of their religion and to convert as many people as possible. What bothered me about prop 8 was that people outside our state were funding the movement against gay marriage. Now I am not gay but do have gay friends and believe me, none of them are out recruiting people to be gay but religious folks are constantly pushing their morals on the rest of us. I believe that everyone who wishes recognition by the state should be in a civil union and leave marriage to the churches. I don't want to cap on religious people but many seem so hypocritical. I always hear that this country was founded on Christianity, which may be true but only because of where we live. If we were in India we might be hyndus.
