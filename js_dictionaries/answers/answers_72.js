	3622 : ["Time is the difference between being alive and dead, static or moving. Without time, the chemical reactions of your metabolism that keep you alive cannot happen. Time is how the Universe evolves and the laws of physics, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are all time dependent. How time is measured is human made. How time is perceived is dependent on your metabolic rate.  The purpose of time gets off into philosophy. I am not going to go off topic. Entire books have been written on that. You can do your own research.  There are different kinds and standards of time. There is local time, standard time, sidereal time, solar time and zones are offset a  daylight saving time. There are currently 37 time zones, not 24. Some time zones are offset a half hour, like India, or 45 minutes.  I assume you are in the United States. Yes, other countries and parts of countries do observe daylight saving time. Some countries and parts of countries do not observe  daylight saving time. Arizona does NOT observe DST, except on the Indian reservations. Arizona is in the same time as the west coast of the United States until the first Sunday of November. The UK and Europe and, parts of the Middle East , Asia, Australia and probably Africa do observe DST. The east coast of Australia does NOT observe DST. There can be 2 and half hour difference between adja sent time zones in Australia. Australia just went off of DST.  The purposes of DST are to make the .PST efficient use of sunlight, economic and cultural, yo make money from tourism and recreation. It does NOT save money on energy, which was one reason Bush 43 used for changing when the USA goes on and off DST in 2007.  DST also has military and political purposes. It was not used in the United States until WW1. In WW2 it was 2 hour time difference, independently confimed by both of my parents decades apart. My father did NOT confirm that DST was used during WW1. He started school during WW1. My mother was a WW1 boomer baby.        ", 593, "None", -6],
