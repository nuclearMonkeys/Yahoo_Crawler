I have felt that I was good, but not good enough to really make a difference. No matter how I achieved, someone was that much better Here, I can make a difference. I can tap into that great wealth of knowledge that I have acquired through my many travels and impart them to others who are uncertain or confused or just need a beam of light to pierce the gloom. OK, I can hear you snickering out there, thinking that this is some major cornball answer. If it was any more sappy, I could make my own syrup. I am so square, I'm almost geometric. But here, I can excel. It's not just the raw points to show my 'magnificence' (which is fleeting anyway), but the e-mails I get from people who let me know that what I have done has helped them. Now, not every answer I give is a winner and I have, honestly, had a brain fart or two (thousand) along the way, but if I can give a hand, lend an ear or point a direction, then I have accomplished something. I still live in a world of tens, but now, perhaps, I am an eight.", 10733, "8yE2sYGeaa", 6],

I've always been the curious type and liked to ask questions so Answers seemed like the perfect place for me. Also, there has been many times where I had a question that I just couldn't figure out by myself (whether it was an assignment or something from my personal life) and Answers is there for me in those times.  It sounds cheesy but it really is a comfort to know that there is a place where I can ask a question to thousands of people and get their opinion. It takes away the stress and panic when I have something I don't understand and have a deadline for an assignment which demands the understanding of this or that concept. It's like always having thousands of human resources to fall back on when in need. As I mentioned from the get go, it's also very fun. It's fun to troll around Answers and answer random questions. I've always liked helping people but am extremely shy; Answers is my answer. I can help people without the barrier of my shyness. The point system is also a great motivator and adds a fun twist to the whole thing.  Answers is special because a lot of people know about it. There are a LOT of forums and websites out there where you can ask questions but often times my question goes unanswered because no one visits that site or the ones that do don't know the answer. Answers has a large variety of people that come on frequently and in masses. That equals a better opportunity for my question to be answered which is extremely important when choosing a website to post questions on.", 10733, "vAJafujuaa", 3],

The police were called to the scene but refused to do any more than give him a ticket. The address he gave, of course, was fake. The cops refused to try to verify it, or the drivers ID, at the scene, because this was in San Francisco and the City council has declared SF a \"City of refuge\" for illegal aliens, so the cops won't do those sort of checks in case the guy shows up as one.
