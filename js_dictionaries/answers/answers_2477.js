Why do these Senators and Congressmen have big salaries and big bonuses, when they don't know how to distribute money fairly! All Pelosi is doing is trying to grab a few more votes with the money they will be taking from food stamps. Not that IT shouldn't be reformed, along with the whole Welfare system!

	129684 : ["Answer: The only thing the Bible tells us concerning the Garden of Eden's location is found in Genesis 2:10-14, “A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold…The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.” The exact identities of the Pishon and Havilah rivers is unknown, but the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are well known. If the Tigris and Euphrates mentioned are the same rivers by those names today, that would put the Garden of Eden somewhere in the Middle East, likely in Iraq. It cannot be mere coincidence that the Middle East region is where the planet was most lush—the place where the Garden of Eden was placed. If oil is, as most scientists believe, primarily decayed vegetation and animal matter that has decomposed, then this is the area where we might expect the greatest deposits of the substance we call oil. Since the Garden was the epitome of perfection, it stands to reason that the decomposition of the earth's most perfect and lush organic materials would produce vast stores of the earth's best oil. People have searched for the Garden of Eden for centuries to no avail. There are various locations that people claim to be the original location of the Garden of Eden, but we cannot be sure. What happened to the Garden of Eden? The Bible does not specifically say. It is likely that the Garden of Eden was completely destroyed in the Flood or that it lies decomposing into oil buried beneath centuries of sand deposits.", 11034, "None", 0],

The public has a right to know, and the public wants to know.  Honestly, there are somethings the general public do not need to know.  It does violate national security.  And, a lot of people could really care less about all the trival crap. Second, the media reports the terrible things.  Take Iraq and Afganistan for an example.  How many stories have you read about the schools being built or the medical attention we are giving the sick (I'm not talking about the wounded) people?  I believe if you are going to tell a story, then you should tell the whole story and tell it accurately. Third, they believe they are smarter then the public they serve.  They are so unbelievably intelligent, they decide what we should be told.  For example, how many gun commercials do you see on TV.  Yet, it is a proven fact that drinking kills more in one year then gun violence does in several years.  They report the stories involving gun violence is there is a sad ending, but they fail to report the stories where guns were used by private citizens to stop crimes.  The media is totally one sided. This is America.  One of the things that makes the USA great is our freedom of speech.  Unfortunately, there are not enough people reporting the other side of the coin.  Hence, we are given partial truths.  This in turn generates hate, lack of acceptance of others, and a misinformed public.  Maybe someone will open a company the tells the other side of the story.
