Price?... getting vehicle for less money in this range is not the issue, the issue is can you drive vehicle for a year or more without problems having had value for your bucks. I realize your buying from a mechanic and if he is not a personal friend I would put no more trust in him than buying from just anybody, the simple reason being many of these guys fix clunkers on the cheap cutting corners for fast profit with band aids and used parts and once you take delivery your on your own. If I was in your shoes, study this link     from there should I still be interested I would make deal subject to an independent mechanical inspection by another mechanic, it will cost you a few bucks but its peace of mind. and $2600. is still a fair chunk to have laid out should you encounter problems.

As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on you. Don't take it personally.  Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets.  The bottom line is that successful people do not let garbage trucks take over their day.
