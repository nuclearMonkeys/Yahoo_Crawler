	50791 : ["The difference is not in what commands it can do or can't (there are some differences, like in anything in more than 20 years. But yes, windows command inherit from the MS-Dos shell. It is the same thing). The difference is in what it is. You are confusing an Operating System and a Shell. Operating system is what makes the machine work, run programs, access to hardware (memory, hard disk, peripherals such as sound card, graphics card, keyboard, ...), schedule concurrent programs, ... Shell is just one interface to that. The CLI (command line interface) to discuss with the OS. In MS-DOS there was only one standard shell (but you could find some others. Hackers all used back then more powerful shells, some sort of extension of the command.com shell. In my last years of MS-Dos, I was using tcsh, a shell from the Unix world). In windows you also have powershell (so I have been told. I've not put a hand on a windows machine in a while). Or bash (I am not referring to what lot of people call improperly bash, and is a whole linux. Same dichotomy goes in unix world: unix or gnu/linux is the OS. Bash is just one CLI to it, which represents less than 1% of the code of the OS) Graphical interface is another. So you are comparing * A shell : just a program, a CLI, whose job is pretty simple (read a command line, execute it. Of course, it is not that simple, since those commands can be sophisticated, but still, it is just one program, whose job is to start other program. It doesn't schedule it, it doesn't allocate ressource to it. It does nothing. It just ask the OS to do it. * An OS : that allocate resources, manages drivers, hardware, ... Windows is the OS. Windows command is A Shell (the default one). MS-DOS is the OS. Command.com is A shell (the default one). So, in other words, if your question had been \"what is the difference between Windows Command and MS-Doss command.com shell\", answer would have been \"nothing, but 20 years of small improvements\". It is the same code. 20 years later. One is just a more recent version of the other. But since you asked \"what is the difference between MS-DOS and Windows Command\", we may assume that you believe that windows command is a small OS inside the Windows OS, which is not at all the case, and reply \"they have nothing to do which each other. One is an OS, the other is a CLI shell\". Again, understand that there is an OS. And there are user interface so that the user can interact with that OS. That user interface can be CLI (like MS-DOS's command.com, or like Windows-command, or like bash) or can be graphical (like old windows 3.1 or like Windows graphical interface, or like Gnome) The confusion is made easier to make, considering windows history. Once upon a time, MS-DOS was the OS. It was running, fullscreen, by default, at startup, a CLI, command.com, and from that CLI you could decide to run any program, including another interface, such as windows 3.1, which was not an OS, but just an alternative graphical interface to MS-DOS. Nowadays, it is the otherway. Windows is the OS. It runs fullscreen, by default, at startup, a graphical interface. From which you can decide to run any program, including other interface, such as Windows command, which is not an OS, but just another text interface to the Windows OS. Since people often confuse the MS-Dos OS and its default text interface, and also confuse the Windows OS with its graphical interface, it gives the feeling that once upon a time \"DOS was used to start windows\" and now \"Windows is used to start DOS\".", 7151, "d3cd3e0f2e8feaaff79363574632bf96aa", 1],
