	140337 : ["1. you won't be able to run phantom power through this mix of adaptors. the mic uses a battery? 2. the standard xlr to 1/4 phono plug combination uses a 3 connector phone plug. the mic connects to the ring and tip. the braid connects to the shield. this is still a balanced connection. 3. using an unbalanced connector like a mono phone plug or a stereo 1/8 phone is, well, unbalanced. the only way to preserve the noise protection of the xlr is to use a transformer. i don't know what kinds of electrical noise environments you will be shooting in, so keeping the mic balanced may not be that important considering it is only a 12 inch run of mic cable.  4. a more important concern is the impedence presented by the camcorder. unbalanced phone inputs are usually high impedence and xlr connectors are normally for low impedence mic cables. 5. is there a good reason for not using a mic that is intended for this camcorder application and has the correct connections?", 11459, "9mTctb7jaa", 0],
	140338 : ["It's possible to do it, just works in reverse, but it's not really a good mic. And with the cost of cheap electret mics from Wal-Mart, a lot easier than trying to rig someting.

Please do not give her any human medications as some are very toxic to dog and it will also limit the medication your vet will be able to give her tomorrow if you give her anything. If she is not bearing weight on it and it appears to be broken she would benefit from being seen today (yes as an emergency) to avoid further damage to the leg. It is not likely to heal much but further damage can be done to the vessels and nerves of the leg if it is broken and not stabilized. Unless you know what / where it is hurt I would not wrap it as you could make it worse. Best of luck and keep her quiet, no stairs, outside on leash only.", 11457, "M5SKaf5haa", 0],
	140353 : ["It just boggles my mind that folks can own a dog, then profess poverty when it comes to getting them the care they need.  Owning a dog is a big responsibility, and takes a financial investment.  Your dog needs a vet- NOW.  (Actually, yesterday)- if your dog broke her leg, and you let her go, the break can actually get worse.  Let's say that it was a bad break, but not a total break yesterday- you would have paid the $150, the x-rays, and the cast.  But, you've let her walk around on it because you're too cheap to pay for this care, so you wait until Monday, or Tuesday, or whenever is convenient for you to take her in.  Well, now she's walked on it so much that it has broken clear through and requires surgery- that $150 doesn't seem so bad now, does it? A \"wait and see\" attitude is NEVER a good idea.  It can make a bad situation worse, and can cost you more in the long run.  It's just like owning a car.  You can't afford to put oil in it, so you wait- then you burn up the motor.  Wouldn't it have been cheaper to skip a McDonald's visit or two and buy some oil?", 11457, "JtZfTiEEaa", -5],
	140354 : ["You need to take her to the vet immediately. You can work on paying for it later. Maybe, you could call your vets office and get someone to meet you there. Whatever problem your poor dog has could get worse with time, not to mention the pain she is in. It may only be a sprain, but they can cause more pain than a break. You have a responsibility to your pet, and must act accordingly.

	140355 : ["Many times you don't need a transformer.  The xlr connecter is usually used for a balanced circuit.  You can use one for an unbalanced circuit with no problem.  You can also adapt a balanced circuit to an unbalance circuit simply by grounding one of the wires in the balanced circuit.  This is probably what your adaptor is doing.  In the large majority of cases this works just fine.  The only time you need a transformer is if you are changing impedances.", 11459, "None", 1],
