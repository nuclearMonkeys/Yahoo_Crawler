I do enjoy watching some episodes of Disney's Recess when they come on, and I deeply miss House of Mouse reruns as well.  You are right, the classics will never get old. My brother loves Tom and Jerry, Old school Looney Tunes, and old school Scooby Doo. We also love the Jetsons and the Flintstones, and the Smurfs and all the other Hanna Barbera classics you can find on Boomerang. (We're addicted to that channel!) My brother does sometimes watch MAD on cartoon network, but my Mom does too, probably because it's basically a moving and talking version the magazine. I stay away from Cartoon network. When the TV is free, Boomerang is what I have on. In fact, I'm now going to go put on some Jonny Quest right now! P.S Yes, TV is crap now.
