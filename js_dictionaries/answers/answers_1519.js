	81619 : ["To be honest I have no idea, and I think it's really sad.  I was LUCKY to have cervical cancer and fall into the BCCCP program (Medicaid for cancer patients in Michigan) and all of my treatments were either paid in full or I had a $1-$3 co-pay which is nothing.  My total bill has added up to $389,000 as of right now.  I am scheduled for another PET scan in a few days which will tack on another 6k, then another pap and office visit which will add on a few hundered, then if I need biopsies and anesthesia in the OR we're talking another 7-8k, and then *god please don't let it come to this though* if I need surgery to remove the bit of cancer showing on my last scan, I imagine that would be really expensive at least 10k but probably wayyyy more.  By the time its all said and done I am thinking I will have racked up somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000.  My treatment was short in comparison to a lot of cancer patients too.  I only had actual treatment for 2 months, now I have been getting scans and paps and playing the waiting game for 3 1/2 months.  I cannot imagine the financial hardship that many families go through.   I almost did not qualify for treatment based medicaid based on my income.  I was just a few hundred dollars away from not qualifying. I did not have health insurance.  I was turned away by the hospital I am being treated at now because I was uninsured at that time.  I was referred to the local downtown Detroit county hospital for treatments, and this is a place that no cancer patient really wants to go to for treatment. There are no \"cancer experts\" or enthusiastic caregivers there. It would be devastating to have gone thru this experience in a hospital which I had no confidence in.  And on top of it, I would have a huge medical bill to pay for those services from the crappy hospital.  Thank god I qualified. I think you should contact members of the government, including President Obama and your state Governer.  I am also contacting my state representatives because I think its really sad that as soon as I get a clear pap test and clear pet scan, my Medicaid will be dropped right away.  This means that even though most cervical cancers recur within 7 months-2 years, I will no longer have insurance or medical care with the doctors who really know what they are doing.  Since I am also a victim of this horrible economy, I will not be able to afford to go to my good docs because as of now I was lucky to find a decent paying part time job, and that doesn't even cover my regular bills completely.  It's really sad, we need a breakthrough in healthcare in this country.  I hope Obama gets this right soon! ADD: One more big problem with healthcare in the US- I have checked into buying my own insurance since my job does not offer insurance for part-time employees.  I have been told by several insurance companies that there is a waiting period which I must wait (between 3-10 years depending on the company) and if I am still cancer free for that length of time I can buy their insurance then. The alternative is Blue Cross which accepts cancer patients but it costs as much as I make in the entire month since I had cancer, which would leave me homeless and broke.  The only way I can get health insurance right now is through a group policy, which may mean that my bf and I are going to get married sooner than planned so I can be insured  under his group policy from work. ADD:  All states handle their Medicaid and insurances differently...My friend in Minnesota had stage 2b cervical cancer just like me. They don't have special medicaid for cervical cancer there.  She was eligible for some financial assistance through the county health program in her area. She was not eligible for Medicaid. She made substantially less money than I did as well, so I know money was not the issue.  Also my medicaid social worker and hospital social worker have both ensured me that if I join a group policy regardless of my cancer status, I cannot be denied, there is no waiting period, so if I get married or find a job with group plan insurance they tell me I will be covered instantly.  Maybe thats just MI but I was told that this is part of the HIPAA compliance laws.", 9070, "None", 1],

	81624 : ["In California it is called Medi-Cal in every other state it is Medicaid. They do not have special programs for breast and cervical cancers. It is a program for people who need medical treatment and do not have a way to pay for it. Your friend had insurance so she would not qualify and her insurance paid far more than Medi-Cal ever would. If she did not have insurance she may have qualified for Medi-Cal if her parents did not own property or made too much money. The people who fall into this category are the ones who really get screwed.  Why do you think the number one reason for individuals filing for bankruptcy in this country is the cost of healthcare after major illness?  This is nothing new it has been getting progressively worse for the past 25 years. Cedar's only takes a certain number of Medi-Cal patients because they have to. They are a teaching facility. They can also afford the loss. There is a reason they are located at George Burns and Gracie Allen Way. Why they have the Mark Tapper Imaging Center and the Ray Charles Cafeteria.  Your friend was very lucky to be treated there as most Medi-Cal patients are not so lucky. It is a well known fact the majority of these patients gets substandard care. A stage one colon cancer patient on Med-Cal will not do as well as a stage two patient with private insurance and this is not fair either. Most private hospitals in Los Angeles County do not accept Medi-Cal, as they can't afford to. Why do you think we have had 10 hospitals close in the last 15 years? Have you been in an ER lately? They are packed and you can wait days for a bed, because now we don't have enough hospitals. Meanwhile, there are people in this country who believes it is every person for themselves and the only people without medical insurance are the lazy, irresponsible, unemployed unable to manage their money well enough to get their own insurance and they should not have to be forced to pay for them. Failing to understand they already are while the entire system is falling apart. Take a look at the politics or government section of YA if you don't already know people like this. Then we have our politicians playing their usual games, telling us one thing and doing another, arguing over crap, pointing fingers, bringing up irrelevant bull **** and pretending to be working in our best interest. They have great medical insurance. They never have to worry about going into debt, hitting their lifetime maximum benefit, delays, cobra, wondering if their doctor is on their plan, getting authorizations  or worrying what to do if they lose their job, because they are insured for life and guess who pays for it? - Now that is not fair.", 9070, "None", 1],

It was repealed  because the \"Tax on the Rich\" was hurting the sales of boats and causing unemployment in the ship yards...  >>> (From the link) KWAME HOLMAN: The theory behind the luxury tax sounded simple enough. Congress believed anyone willing to spend $100,000 or more on a new boat surely would be willing to pay an additional 10 percent to the federal government. But that didn't happen. Rather than pay the tax, many people in the market to buy a boat either didn't buy one, or bought one overseas. As a result, the luxury tax didn't bring in much money at all, and the customers' reluctance to buy put the boat-building business, particularly here in Rhode Island, out of business. We first visited Rhode Island in June of 1992. The luxury tax had been in effect for 18 months.

	81633 : ["It's based on income, not which cancer you were unlucky enough to be diagnosed with. If someone has cancer or any medical problem when going for any insurance, whether group or individual, you will have a waiting period of up to one year. If you had previous insurance and did not have a lapse before joining a group plan, you will not be subject to a pre existing condition clause. I've just gone through the same situation myself. Yeah, about the group insurance...I've always been told the same thing. However, when I had an actual medical condition, I would have been subject to a waiting period for a pre existing condition had I gone ONE DAY uninsured! I know this for a fact because bcbs sent me a notification that I was insured, but would NOT be covered for ANY dr consultation relating in ANY way to my pre existing condition for a certain period of time. Mine was not to take effect till june of this year, however, they were mistaken and I had not been one day uninsured. Now, had I broken my leg, under the waiting period, I would be covered because it wouldn't have been related to my cancer. The shortened waiting period is in effect, if at all, for employer group insurance, as per HIPAA regs...from hipaa site:  Can a plan deny benefits for chronic illnesses or injuries, like carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer using a preexisting condition exclusion? It depends on whether you received medical advice, care, diagnosis, or treatment within the 6 months prior to enrolling in a new employer's plan. If you did, you can be subject to a preexisting condition exclusion.  Although HIPAA adds protections and makes it easier to switch jobs without fear of losing health coverage for a preexisting condition, the law has limitations. For instance, HIPAA:  Does not require that employers offer health coverage;  Does not guarantee that any conditions you now have (or have had in the past) are covered by your new employer's health plan; and  Does not prohibit an employer from imposing a preexisting condition exclusion period if you have been treated for a condition during the past 6 months. States don't have special insurance for certain cancers. It is income and asset based. Each state has the option of adding a \"medically needy\" program. That's where the differences in eligibility come in.  Are you both single, married, one of each?  Do you have more in assests than her, or does she have more than you?

	81634 : ["You have asked a fair question.  Why does the American health care system have so many failures?

Perhaps as a result, Americans have the shortest average life expectancy among people in all industrialized nations.  Globally the U.S. ranks 49th in average life expectancy. (see weblink)   *  50 million Americans have no health insurance whatsoever.   *  Another 50 million are seriously under-insured, but will only discover that unfortunate reality in the event of a catastrophic illness.   *  The 100 million Americans on Medicare, Medicaid, and V.A.

	81639 : ["Yup, i think you have an anxiety disorder. I am psychology major and i just got through with an Abnormal Psychology course. I think your grandmother's death triggered a biological and psychological predispostiton for a develpoment of anxiety disorders. Because anxiety is psychologically based, you need to seek some help from a psychiatrist. Your symptoms develop from an apprehensive anticipation of future danger or threatening situations in which you believe you will have a loss of control. Also, your panic attacks are influenced by your anticipation of your panic attacks; as soon as your heart starts beating fast, you start to worry and that worry causes your heart to race even more, your muscles start to tense up, your blood pressure rises, etc. These increased reactions make your anxiety increase, and as your anxiety increase, so do your physiological symptoms, until you have a full on panic attack. In other words, your cognitive beliefs (thinking that you would not be able to handle another attack) and your physiological symptoms influence eachother. Do you see how anxiety is rooted in the mind? People who are prone to anxiety are vulnerable to stress or are overreactive to normal daily events that most people wouldn't find threatening. I think you might have a co-occurence of two or more anxiety disorders, such as Panic Disorder, Phobias, and/or possible Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Treatment might include exposure-based treatment where you are gradually exposed to the feared situations; and cognitive therapy in which attitudes and perceptions are identified and modified; relaxation, breathing, and meditation techniques might also be taught; antidepressants and antianxiety medications might also be prescribed. I suggest you do some reading and learning on your own.

The Presidential and Congressional Accountability Act of 2008 Whereas, the people of the United States of America have been lied too, manipulated and ignored repeatedly by our political leadership; Whereas, the people of the United States of America have been divided by self serving partisan political bickering preventing the attainment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness promulgated by our political leadership through bad public policy, inaction and legislative gridlock;  Whereas, the people of the United States of America have been sold into economic slavery through the mismanagement of the public treasury and the accumulation of massive amounts of pubic debt mortgaging the freedom of future generations for political expediency and excess; Whereas, the people of the United States of America have been subjected to never ending military and political interventions in foreign lands draining the public treasury and demoralizing spirit of the American people; Whereas, the people of the United States of America have suffered the invasion of their borders, the failure of their schools, the uncertainty of health care, the loss of their jobs, the erosion of the dollar, the decline of American prestige, the restriction of their freedoms and the loss of confidence in their political leadership; Whereas, the people of the United States of America have just ******* HAD ENOUGH; Be resolved that the people of the United States of America serve onto the Congress and the President of the United Sates the Presidential and Congressional Accountability Act of 2008 reaffirming the Constitution of the United States and imposing standards of conduct and accountability upon the members of Congress and the President which are consistent with values of the American people. Article One No more bullshit! We are tired of lame, ambiguous and immeasurable promises from politicians. If you promise “Change” you had better tell us WTF it is, when its going to happen, and how we will know you actually got it done! Article Two Start managing our own money like it was your own! Reduce our debt and stop spending like drunken sailors. Article Three Protect us! Secure our borders. Article Four Manage our natural resources effectively and reduce our dependency on foreign oil.  Article Five Stop babysitting the rest of the world! If foreign nations are indeed a threat, kick their *** and leave.  Article Six Getting and education is really about getting a job! Nobody gives a **** about the quadratic formula or the theoretical applications of the “space time continuum” if they can't put food on the table or a roof over their head! Align our educational system for the jobs we have and those we will need in the future. Article Seven Stop trying to regulate every aspect of our lives! We get really frustrated when you restrict our freedoms, create barriers to entrepreneurship and then tax the **** out of us for it. Article Eight Stop ******* with each other! We really don't care who you are sleeping, what you did twenty years ago when you were drunk or stoned although we do find it interesting and sometimes amusing. Article Nine Try to have a sense of humor! God and the American people know that sometimes **** happens. Stop trying to justify it, excuse it or ignore it. If you **** UP, admit it, just fix it and move on. Article Ten If we forgot to say it, this is where it goes. God managed to rule the world with ten rules so surely we can.", 9078, "None", 4],
	81656 : ["The Black\" leaders\" no longer matter. That is why they supported Hillary in the first place. I don't know why Obama is called a lot of hot air. He has very specific policy positions, a 12 year history as an elected official both in Illinois state government and in the Senate, and clear plans for healthcare, the environment and foreign policy. he does very well in debates when his views and positions are challenged and has worked very well with Republicans AND Democrats . Nobody is afraid to say what they think. The Republican party has NOt been verysupportive of McCain. At least not the conservative wing. They openly despise him. He has been very open about his policy about Iraq and it has been commented on EXTENSIVELY by both his rivals and the press. On the Black\"leaders\" again they DID publicly support Hillary and even disparaged Obama but ther resulkt was that in South Carolina and ever since Obama has SMASHED Hillary in 13 states on Super Tuesday and in 11 ELECTIONS SINCE! Blacks are not listeniong to these so-called \"Black leaders\" (and we shouldn't either) some of whom are simply jealous that their own Presidentiial bids were unsuccessful. McCain is NOT another Bush but he IS a conservative and proud to be so. I don't see how that is a surprise since he is a Republican. Hillary has no chance because 50% or so of this great nation is well informed enough to despise her as the corrupt weasel that she is and we don't want any more Whitewater.
