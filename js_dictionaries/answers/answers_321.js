The only good reason to have them is if you like the experience of handling and playing them - definitely not for any supposed audio quality. And unless you get a really good turntable, with a good cartridge and stylus, they will wear and degrade rather rapidly. They do that even on high-end gear, just not as fast. Compare using LPs to keeping a vintage car - you don't have one because it is \"better\" than a modern car, you do it for the experience, if that happens to be what you are in to. I lived through the LP / vinyl era & I remember the 78 disc era before that. I was as happy to see the end of LPs as the end of 78s, though I still have quite a few original 70s/80s LPs & singles and a good turntable, just for novelty value.", 2736, "T5MR7fNHaa", 4],

A 320 Kbit MP3 created from a CD using a good encoder such as LAME will be very little different from the original CD audio, you need to listen carefully to notice any difference. At the other end of the scale, a 128 Kbit MP3 or one made using a bad encoder sounds plain bad; eg. certain sounds being muted as other sounds play - especially such a ringing cymbal being muted by another sound. MP3 uses \"lossy\" compression, where sounds that the algorithm predicts are not very noticeable are removed when louder sounds are present. The lower the bit rate setting, the more sounds are removed and the more messed up the results. And it is a one-way process; converting an MP3 to a FLAC or WAV gives you a perfect quality reproduction - of the messed up MP3 audio.  ", 2755, "T5MR7fNHaa", 0],
