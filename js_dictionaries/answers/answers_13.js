	681 : ["Hi Frankie, I think this is a great question by the way and i would like to answer it from personal opinion and experience. Firstly it depends on what context, are you reading for your learning / self improvement or pleasure? I can see you're reading Stephen king great choice of author by the way, so I am assuming pleasure.  Secondly its a matter of your own reading abilities, personally I only really started reading at 24 and I am 26 now so I am not the greatest, however I have learnt that your reading capabilities improve not only on how much you read or how long you read for, but what type of book and what time of day it is. Now not everyone is like me but for example, reading a Stephen king book in the am would be a bit too much, id get lost have to go back pages and struggle to focus, however 5 pages of a self development book in the am gets me focused. On the contrary a self development book in the evening would seem difficult to read, where as poetry or a fantasy books wouldn't. In addition I try not to set times because it can feel like a prison like you have to do 15-30 minutes ect, instead I tell myself just 3 pages a day(everyone can manage that), it creates the habit of reading and doesn't restrict you, however that doesn't mean maximum 3 pages you can go on if you're enjoying the book just make sure its a consistent 3 pages a day. Imagine if you did the bare minimum thats 90 pages in a month which sometimes can be the smallest of books. In calculation to your Stephen king book it would be 33 pages a day, thats why i say its down to your ability, figure out the best time of the day to read it and do it at that time everyday and if you can stay focused for 33pages great, if not dont beat yourself up it will just take a little longer than a month. Lastly Im not saying that you will finish your massive Stephen king book by the month or an additional book, however what you think you're supposed to read in a month is down to you, but you should question why you want to in the first place. Pleasure reading might help your vocabulary and mental health, but wont necessarily move you towards your goals. I have 3 books I am reading at the moment, a self development in the am and either a fantasy book/poetry in the evening. so there is a balance and on average I finish 1 and occasionally 2 books a month through this method and this is coming from your average working class self taught reader at an older age, its mostly down to habit, make it your routine and calculate the pages logically by dividing them into say your average month (30 days) then you know roughly how many pages to read.  Hope this helps Regards Aiden", 89, "g5QOf1P1aa", 1],

This not only delays diagnosis, but causes people to not take their blood pressure medications because they don't feel a difference whether or not they take it. However, when blood pressure goes uncontrolled, over time the subsequent damage in the body puts the person at increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. This is why regardless of the presence of symptoms it is very important to see your doctor annually so you can be screened for high blood pressure.", 126, "wB2iNnQKaa", 0],
