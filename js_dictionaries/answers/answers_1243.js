How many sects of Christianty are there, of Islam?  And these sects are usually the one promoting war on eachother, or at the very least intolerance. I don't recall seeing a message from God on the 6:00 news telling us which religion he personally believes in. Religious tolerance doesn't just mean tolerating religion. It means tolerance of beliefs that vary from our own, and tolerance of the people who believe such. I don't think it's promoting \"catering to what others expect\" as much as it is not letting hatred and ignorance influence how you treat other people. It's intolerance that gives people reason to have to \"stick up for their own personal beliefs\" in the first place.", 8433, "07143bbaf66d54b19ee2f5fa0df64723aa", 0],
