	99439 : ["A stock certificate is generally a very small piece of ownership interest in a company.  By virtue of the ownership, you have a right to the profits (owners equity) of the company.  A company \"goes public\" by issuing an initial public offering of stock, generally by way of an investment bank.  Thereafter existing stocks are bought and sold on an exchange.  Gains come from (1) price appreciation [price of stock increases] and (2) dividends.  While the stockholders have the right to profits, if the company goes bankrupt, the shareholders are usually last in line (behind debt holders such as banks and bondholders).  Basically it is good to be a stockholder if a company does well, and better to be a bondholder if it is going under. This is a very small discussion about the markets.

If one owns a share of a company, it is often considered that they own a piece of the company, however, this is not the case at all because most common people that own stock do not make any executive decisions nor do they really have any say in what goes on in the company.

The Nazi Movement - it is well documented that Hitler was a Christian and that the Nazis, by and large, were all Christians and believed it to be god's will to kill the Jews to \"cleanse the Earth.\" 6 million Jews died due to the Holocaust. 3. The Crusades - millions killed, basically, because they were Muslim over a piece of land. These are just the big ones. My point? Religious views and politics are not mutually exclusive. Stalin was a moron, as was Hitler, as were the Spaniards, as was the Pope and the Vatican in the Crusades. I'm an atheist, but I treat people a HELL of a lot better than most Christians I know.

They may have said that they believed in the christian god, but im certain that it was all just talk. A truly religious world? Yeah right. Whose religion; YOURS? You claim atheists would do whatever they want because they would feel unstoppable? that is unlikely. You do not need to believe in gods to have morals. any person brought up right will know that they should respect others, not to commit murder, and respect those who deserve it, as well as all the other ethical doctrines instilled into people throughout the world. So, to conclude, i totally disagree. There are just as many evil people who belong to each religion as there are atheists.

You have to prove that Stalin did what he did because he was atheist or in the name of atheism and we know too much about Stalin and his political views to substantiate your claim that he did it in the name of atheism. This is akin to saying Hitler is a great example of Christianity because he was a Catholic and murdered millions of people so therefore all Christians would rule similarly.  That's drawing conclusions based on one example of a person who had a religious belief but did not do what he did because of those beliefs (or lack thereof in the case of Stalin).  Hitler did not kill people because he believed in Jesus Christ.  He did it because he wanted to shape the world to match his personal ideas of how society should be shaped. If you want to take a truly objective look at what a majority-atheist society would likely be like, you must take a broader sample size of nations.
