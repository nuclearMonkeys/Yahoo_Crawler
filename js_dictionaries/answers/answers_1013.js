	56135 : ["the earth is huge, and mankind is trivial.  Local balances can be offset, but the global balance is pretty much beyond our current ability to affect. You are not recognizing the HUGE amounts of water that most places have to deal with constantly.  The dang St-Lawrence River passes more water in 100 seconds (on average) than gets used by all humans in Canada in a day.  And Canada has a very high per capita water consumption, to put things in perspective. Besides, most of the water that gets used is put right back where it came from.  No net loss. Just a short diversion. In a regional sense, the only actual loss is from evaporation. Everything else ends up back more or less where we took it from.  The 10 liters or whatever used to flush a toilet does not miraculously disappear from reality.  It just takes a long route back to the river. Now, if you are talking about Nestle or whoever pumping the crap out of an aquifer to fill bottles with water that gets shipped away, that is a net loss, and could be a problem if the system is very dry to begin with (has low recharge rates), which is why we normally would not let nestle or whoever pump water in such a situation.", 7801, "WbVE1cXKaa", -1],

They offer .com domain + .info domain + web hosting of 1GB = approx. $50/year.  It takes around 12 hours to set up with everything and I think this is the fastest.

	56138 : ["We can not tax our way to prosperity. And tax cuts alone will not restore prosperity. When you are poor, the first thing to do is REDUCE YOUR SPENDING. And as a nation, we have a trillion dollar trade deficit. We import twice as much as we export. WE SPEND TWICE AS MUCH AS WE EARN. The ONLY way to correct this is to CUT YOUR SPENDING (cut imports) and INCREASE YOUR EARNINGS (increase exports). Selling is hard. Controlling where you buy is EASY. Which is why Obama is ignoring our excessive imports and attempting to correct our trade imbalance by selling more exports. We saw the result at the G20 summit - selling is hard, and our trading partners are indignant that we are asking them to buy more of our exports. Duh, who knew. TRANSLATION: Obama is intentionally destroying the economy by defying common sense. He is ignoring the easy solution - control where you buy - and fixating on the impossible, by expecting us to just double our exports. Somehow. Durrrrrr.... Nobody is this stupid, and he is a Harvard graduate. He is doing this intentionally. So the NUMBER ONE best way to create jobs is GET RID OF OBAMA as our president and get somebody who is not intentionally destroying our economy.

The only thing you can do now is deep condition the hell out of it, but that might not even help- try putting the deep conditioner in your hair and then sleeping with it in, rinse it out in the morning before you go about your day. Also, since your hair is so dry you should use the gentlest shampoo you can find & don't wash it every day. This stuff might help a bit but it kind of sounds like its too late- you might want to just cut it off. The only thing I can think of that might help improve the quality of your hair is this product: it is a bit expensive, but it really does work wonders, my hair is 100% better after using it for about a year now, and I always used to have problems with my hair being dry, frizzy & damaged. You can also get this stuff on amazon.com.  For your damaged hair, I would recommend getting the Fig scent (it smells a little like robitussin cough medicine to me, but it made my hair feel AMAZING). If you don't think you can handle the smell of that, Lavender is the next best thing, and sweet almond mint after that (my personal favorite). The whole concept of Wen sounds weird at first, but trust me it really works and I think that it would really be your best option.

	56163 : ["In fact, the ancient Greek philosopher/scientists, knew that the earth is a SPHERE (not \"round\"; a disk is round, but it is not a sphere) because of the evidence. Other societies of the time, however, were not as knowledgeable as the Greeks were and they believed the earth to be flat, and, more specifically, in the form of a disk. That includes the writers of the Bible, who made it quite clear from their various descriptions of the cosmos that can be found in the Bible.. In the fourth century B.C. Aristotle presented several scientific arguments for a spherical earth, and Heraclides provided rational arguments to show that the earth is spinning on its axis. And in the third century B.C. Aristarchus even proposed a view of the solar system essentially the same as our modern view. He also measured the distance to the moon and its size with remarkable accuracy. Also in the third century B.C. Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth with remarkable accuracy. That is in contrast to the Bible, where the earth is described as a flat, immovable disk, supported by pillars and covered with a solid vault of heaven, the rim of which is is resting on the perimeter of the disk of the earth, and the stars are just lights set in the vault of heaven. In fact, belief in an immovable, flat, earth has had a long history in Christianity. Citing the Bible, many early leaders of Christianity, such as Eusebius, John Chrysostom, Lactantius, Tertullian, Theophilus of Antioch, and Clement of Alexandria, expressed their flat earth belief at a time when most scholars understood that the earth is a sphere.  Later, in the sixth century, Cosmas Indicopleustes wrote a book called Christian Topology, which advocated a flat-earth system in opposition to the Ptolemaic system with its spherical earth. Even after it became clear that the earth is a sphere, the idea that the earth is immovable, as the Bible indicates, still held on, and was demonstrated by the trial of Galileo by the Catholic Church. The Protestant leaders of the time also condemned the idea that the earth moves. Unfortunately, there are still those today who believe the earth is flat, and even immovable.", 7805, "sdS6tLTPaa", 1],
	56164 : ["The flat earth theory originated in a novel about Columbus by Washington Irving. For the novel it was more dramatic to have Columbus opposed by people who thought the earth was flat than the historically accurate argument that they knew the world was round and they correctly calculated that it was too far sailing ships of the day to reach Asia by sailing west.  Since then the idea that before Columbus people thought the world was flat has become an urban myth.", 7805, "BRqu1xBlaa", 1],
