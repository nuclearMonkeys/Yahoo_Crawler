What I think you are talking about is entanglement, correct? If so, Einstein stated that information can never travel faster than C, since entanglement (in my opinion) cannot transfer information, it is not violating Einstein's statement.  As for gravity traveling faster than c, I disagree, this is why. Gravitational wakes occur when large objects travel at high speeds, this effect takes place because it takes longer for the gravitational field behind to collapse than in front to be warped. Currently, gravitational wakes account for gravity being the same as C.", 10405, "AscEQtagaa", 1],

	115043 : ["They are LED lights.  They've only been available as   lights the past few years.  They have a rated lifespan of over 100,000 hours (over 10 years).  They use very little energy.  As in the product description, each string only uses 3.5 watts.  That means, at a cost of 15 cents/kWh, you could burn a string of these lights constantly for less than $4/month.  If you only burn them 8 hours/day, and your energy cost is 10 cents/kWh, then the cost is only 87 cents/month.   Those cone-shaped objects shown on the lights on the webpage aren't actually the lightbulbs themselves.  They are merely colorful, refractive covers, designed to change the color of the light, and to cause the light to spread.  You see, some of the drawbacks of LEDs are that their light tends to shine in one direction, and the colors of LEDs can be rather muddy, so the covers improve the look of the light.   The science of how these lights work is rather complicated.  I will forward you to a website for more information on that:   I saw an LED lightbulb for home use (as a replacement for incandescent bulbs) in a hardware store a few months ago.  Unfortunately, it cost $25 and it had a harsh, bluish light, and was only as bright as a 40-watt bulb.  It only used about 4 watts though.  The current technology isn't a good replacement for incandescent or CF bulbs.   LEDs are used now in many applications, including taillights on cars, in all sorts of electronic devices, and even traffic lights.", 10412, "AA11668453", 1],

Especially avoid weekends. Generally the summer months are supposed to be extremely busy; however, I just came back from a trip where I stayed for 3 days and it was surprisingly not that busy for being a summer month. I would suggest getting up and going to the park right around the time of opening (usually 8, you can check the Disneyland website in case it changes) when the crowds are thin. That way you can ride lots of rides with little to no wait.

	115060 : ["you are perfectly right, they dont really affect each other!! but may be your teacher expected something else!! like at high speed due to the aerodynamics of the car and the bernoulli's theorem, there is an net upward force on the car, the tires of the car will actually feel less upward force!! it must be noted that the same aerodynamics can be used to increase the weight of the car. and by weight i mean the net downward force of the car towards the road. another possible situation is that car is going in a curved path. if a car is going in a curved path which has it's centre down, the apparent weight of the car decreases. the decrease in weight is proportional to v^2. but technically weight is defined as the force exerted on any object by the earth or any planetry mass. so technically the force by which the earth pulls the car towards itself is very much constant. so i think your teacher must have asked for any of the above two situation!! hope this helps. :) EDIT : hey may be your teacher wants to consider that the earth itself is a sphere and hence at higher velocities you are actually going in a curved path and will experience less weight!! but the speeds must be very high like some miles per second!!", 10407, "W7PeyF08aa", 0],
	115061 : ["Hey got milk- there are many variables that affect \"how fast\" a car can go.  A high horsepower to weight ratio is only one side of it.  A car is considered to be fast if it can achieve a low acceleration time- say 0-60 in under 6 seconds.  Most of today's cars can do a decent job of this without gobs of power, it's all about the gearing of the drive line.  An engine produces torque as well as power, and the correct blend of those two things is the basis of a truly great car.  Take for instance a new Cadillac CTS V sedan.  It has well over 500 horsepower.  A new Ford Mustang  GT has less horsepower than the Cadillac, but is also very fast.  It is almost always a trade off to get the correct balance of power to torque from an engine, but most modern cars are able to do so and get respectable mileage too.", 10407, "zPw3Uq2Saa", 0],
