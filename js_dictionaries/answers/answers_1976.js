	104591 : ["Exclamation points mean that he device IS WORKING. Generally \"if it anit broke, dont fix it\"... The exclamation point usually refers to a FORCED situation whereby the IRQ, the DMA, the I/O, or the MEMory has been FORCED to a NON-Plug and Play setting, which \"works\" but was not set in your CONTROL PANEL, SYSTEM Device Manager properties and RESOURCES as USE Default SETTINGS. In order to overcome a device RESOURCE conflict, the device had to be forced to use some Resource that would not normally be chosen.   Unless you are really good at manually removing, both physically and Device driver \"remove\"s, and replacing cards, with RESERVE RESOURCES option set in the DEVICE manager, to manually overcome Plug and Pray \"logic\" settings, you will probably just keep getting the same situation  if you remove the drivers and put them back under window's control.  LAN cards are really tempermental, and just finding the drivers at all often requires RE_POINTING windows to the correct location of the files. Win98SE is really great at starting an installation of a LAN card, say from a floppy or a CD location, ie. LANXXX   DRIVERS   WIN9X   and after the first set of INF files is loaded, getting LOST, and will state UNABLE to find file xxx -- on the CATROOT or the CD or the FLoppy or the WIN98 Setup disk, -- when in fact the driver is sitting right there in front of it, IN the WIN98 Setup CD, or the Floppy, or the LAN setup CD, etc, but Win98 is looking in the wrong spot. You have to GUESS where the file that it is looking for really is. Sometimes it wants the LAN setup, and looks in WIN98 Setup CD, or really wants the WIN98SE setup CD, and asks you for the LAN floppy setup file...    If the updated driver SETUP INF for a LAN asks you to help find a file, you may have to guess it is in the C: Windows CATROOT, or C:   Windows   INF, or in the WIN98SE setup CD, in one of the CAB files, or on the LAN setup Floppy/CD, in the SUB FOLDER under WIN9X. The most common mistake is that people get the LAN driver, and just use the the LAN INF files in the main directory, without going into the WIN9X subfolder on the driver disk. It will \"appear\" to work, but totally make a mess, and will absolutely get lost.  If the exclamation point is a BLUE one, this is just a note, not an error like a big YELLOW mark or worse, the RED marks.   If the device \"works\" you probably do not need to change it. Since the Device Conflict is a matter of all the OTHER devices in the slots and on the motherboard, a new driver will likely result in a newer driver with the same exclamation mark.  One way to reslolve the conflict is to remove all non-essential cards in ISA or PCI slots, and turn off all non-essential devices in the BIOS which are on the motherboard, like onboard sound, onboard Modem, onboard USB. Then put in the LAN card. Since there will be no device conflicts, you can see where the card \"normally\" is situated in terms of the Device Managers RESOURCES - What IRQ, DMA, I/O and MEM are allocated. From there you can start adding cards to see which device kicks out the settings, -- sometimes the first card to grab resouces KEEPS them, but with LANS, adding another card usually RE-ALLOCATES the LAN, sometimes giving it bad settings.  Since you know the \"default\" settings, you can go into the Device Manager and check off the RESOURCE \"Use automatic settings\" and put in the normal values anyway. This \"may\" lock the settings, and all the other devices, added one at a time with reboots, may be given other, non-conflicting resources. If this does not work, the last resort is to go into the Device Manager, click on COMPUTER, click on the RESERVE RESOURCES tab, and grab the resources you need for the LAN card ( after removing the card and the drivers from the machine), and installing the other devices. You \"may\" be able to go into the computer's BIOS, CMOS, BOOT setup, ( typically Press DEL to Enter Setup ), and reserve resources there as well ). Once Windows has booted and installed all the other devices -- without using the \"reserved\" resources,  you can put in the card, go into the BIOS and reserve resources, and open up those resources. Sometimes Windows reacts immediately and re- Plug and Prays the resources back to conflicts, and sometimes it just leaves things alone.  Sometimes, it is a matter of figuring out EXACTLY which 2 cards or devices are conflicting, and just switching the two of them - putting in the LAN FIRST, locking the resources, and then installing the other device.  You may have to experiment, and re- set Windows a dozen times to totally remove the error - the first time something goes wrong though, Windows will default to its usual self and screw up the Resources again. Be certain to write down the final procedure and the conflicts if you \"win\", so that you do not have to go through the process of trial and error a second time. Like I said... \" rule of thumb \" if it aint broke, dont fix it\" , and if the LAN  WORKS, why fight with Windows Plug and Pray, to get rid of the Blue Caution Exclamation mark.... I have seen so many of these exclamation marks, that I just have a good idea of where the problem is, depending on which LAN card, on what motherboard, with what devices, located in which slots... etc. - it takes experience and luck to reslove the conflicts QUICKLY... hope this helps", 9889, "AA10295434", 0],
