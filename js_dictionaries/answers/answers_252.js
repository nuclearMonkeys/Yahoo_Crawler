You have no understanding of memory and if you are pushed to explain your argument, you will run straight to the internet. You have no understanding of (so-called) paranormal having never experienced it, yet again you preach about it? Why? Do you tell people how to fix cars when you have never seen under the hood before? When it suits you Gary, you stand on a soapbox and wave the dictionary around telling people that paranormal is anything not understood by science. When it suits you, the next day you spout \"paranormal is just a made up word\"???? Now, you are more or less stating the word does not exist (so-called paranormal) If you meant actual paranormal does not exist, then you are blatantly saying that science understands everything. You then say \"sorry but that is how it is. You then screw it up again by actually showing us the link where you got your nonsense. I repeatedly tell you, Gary, if you want nothing more than to argue, then argue your own side, don't tell us what the internet said. We all have computers. We don't want to argue with someone who wrote crap on the computer, we want your side, things like \"interstellar flight is impossible\" If you must repeat other peoples work (plagiarism) at least get it right. Carl sagan NEVER said that.  EDIT! You are telling porkies again NG. You are trying to make your first decent input but can't. What you just said is a lie. Remember what you said about my post? how little details change? That is down to the human brain and how memory diminishes over time. Strange enough, your yucca man tale is just that. Every time this long winded story appears, it is EXACTLY the same. Every little mistake that we all make, is in exactly the same place? This is nothing more than a cut and paste from a book or magazine or maybe the computer. That is how you spot a fake NG, not because a post changes but because it doesn't.", 2108, "FFMhfwYzaa", 0],

	12649 : ["Here's how it started... He was one of the regulars in this section and he posted here for years. Most of the other regulars got along with him pretty well, and I find it a stretch to think that he was the type of person to bother with sock puppet accounts. Most of the upvotes he got probably came from other users, but he did get plenty of downvotes as well, because as Voelven said, he wasn't the most diplomatic or tactful fellow. At the end of the day, this site was designed so that people could ask knowledge seeking questions and receive knowledgeable, accurate replies, but this isn't chemistry - it's books, so people had more leeway here when it came to asking questions that were more about opinions than facts. It's just that some people abused that and took it to the extreme.  Essentially the questions asked in this forum fell into four categories: questions focused on factual information about the topic of books and writing, i.e.: \"Does anybody know who wrote this book or story?\"; questions focused on opinion, i.e.: \"What do you think of this story?\" or \"Who's better, Tolkien or C.S. Lewis?\"; questions posted by self-professed amateur writers asking for plot ideas, names for characters, suggestions for a title, etc., and I'll lump the endless questions from lazy schoolchildren looking to get someone to do their homework for them into that category as well; and lastly questions from users that had practically nothing to do with books or writing - repeater troll spammers looking for attention, people with mental issues that were compelled to obsess over something very specific, and people who were just looking for a chat or a bit of back and forth. I think most of the regular users on this forum - Andrew included, did genuinely try to be constructive, but the plain and simple fact is that a good portion of the self-professed authors here - especially the adolescents, weren't all that accepting of criticism. And while some users demonstrated a remarkable degree of patience with repeater trolls and donned kid gloves with users with fragile egos, others weren't like that, Andrew being famous - or perhaps infamous and notorious, for not playing into that game with them.  Whenever something is free, the quality is going to suffer and people will find a way to take advantage of it. Pound for pound there were ten or twelve people in this section whose answers were far and away superior to the next thousand people who would reply from time to time. I would say that love him or loathe him, Andrew was a guy who obviously read his fair share of books and while his delivery may have often left something to be desired, his replies were informative and insightful. I'm sure if you were to ask him how he felt about being hated by legions of people he perceived to be buffoons he would likely tell you that the opinions of people who know what they were talking about when it comes to books and writing are the only opinions he cares about, and I think it's probably safe to say that the wide majority of users who are well-read and capable of producing a decent piece of writing would say that Andrew was the real deal. You really can't fake that sort of thing. If you're going to be a pompous prat you have to be able to back it up, and the man did.  As far as Andrew being overly cruel and evil, I think that's a big exaggeration. If he were still around and it were possible for him to make his account history public, then the case could be settled definitively, but that's not going to be possible with him gone, so people will have to decide for themselves using whatever first-hand information they might have, and that's only fair. it's been said that the greatest compliment one human being can pay to another is to say \"I'm better off for having known you.\" Personally I think this section would have been all the poorer if not for Andrew's contributions and I doubt that I'm alone in that. If people have an axe to grind and wish to spend their last few days on this site seething with hatred for a guy they never met, I don't think it will affect anyone other than themselves really, so they're more than welcome to do that if it makes them happy. Soon this will all be nothing but a memory. Those that remember Andrew fondly can content themselves with the thought that he very likely feels the same while those who hate him and hold him in contempt may one day come to the realisation that the man never even knew they existed.  -and that would be the end of us. ", 2115, "None", 8],
