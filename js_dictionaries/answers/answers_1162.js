	63595 : ["Hi CAustin!  A great Q. A faith? Kind of, but not really. Part of my \"belief system\", yes. I would say on average about 1/3 of all human's belief systems come from what they \"are taught\".  So my belief in a the \"Big bang\" comes partially from what I've been taught. Also, I would say that about 1/3 of human belief comes from what they \"Know\" or \"fact\".  In other words, some things are just plain, \"on their face\" true.  Like 1+1=2.  That is a fact, and you can always get some kook to disagree with that, but it's still true.  The \"Big bang\" theory is not this kind of a belief though.  We just cannot call it a fact as of yet.  The numbers are a bit more complex than that. And as for \"personal desire\" and belief systems.  I would say on average 1/3 of human beliefs come from personal desire, or in other words, they would just like it to be true (i.e. a wishful thought).  Mr. Smoot, the Nobel peace prize winner (2006 physics, and extensive writer on the theory) notes that the \"Big bang\" theory states that the universe went from the size smaller than a pea, to a size larger than we can currently see, in a period of time shorter than we can measure.  And if this isn't creating a big something (the universe) out of nothing (something smaller than a tiny pea) instantly (in less than a hundred billionth of a second) then I am not sure what is.  Even Smoot says it appears \"Science and religion are coming together\" (and he is not a believer as far as I know).  In other words, it would appear that the universe suddenly leapt into existence out of nothing, as if it were created from nothing.   I'll admit it, I'll believe it because it sounds good to me, not just because of the facts, but because it is easy on my brain.  No cognitive dissonance, no conflict to my paradigm, and I base it on an \"appeal to authority\" argument (which technically comes under the area of a false argument).  But most arguments made for belief systems *are* based on the authority of others, or the veracity of prior witnesses to the fact.  Smoot seems credible, so I'll go with him for now. But I will not argue semantics.  The definition of faith does and can mean simply \"belief\", and it can have the connotation of \"trust\" (i.e. trusting the veracity of another witness like Smoot, or the ancient attorney Saul of Tarsis or who-ever, etc) but it relies more on \"hope\" than \"trust\". And I would classify all belief systems in the same category, whether they be supernatural or not, as they all come from the same sources whether people like to admit it or not. So I would argue that even though it is part of my \"belief system\" (and \"faith\" is a sub category of \"belief system\") I have not placed any \"hope\" on that theory, so it is no a true \"faith\".  There is some \"trust\" there though, but not enough to push it into the faith category. In other words: Belief System = Sum of all beliefs Belief = Indoctrination + Facts + Desire Faith = Belief + Hope  Belief in the Big Bang (for me at least) = Belief + Trust Trust is related to hope, but it is not quite the same. Your question is a good one in that it brings out alot of concepts that blend into one another, there are no hard lines in this matter.  Belief, faith, hope, trust, desire, indoctrination , and facts all blend into one another and they are difficult to distinguish.  And what we are taught by others must be tested or else we fall into the trap of placing our hope on the false desires of another person.

Homosexuality is a harmless variant of sexuality in the animal kingdom.

So, let us now put the big bang on the shelve for a minuet and let us look at the expanse of the universe as always being there. Not everything that is in it. but an expanse that has always been. Now we have a starting point! an empty eternal expanse that has always been there. Everything in the expanse we see today has order This we call the universe.It continues to expand in the eternal expanse. everything follows all the rules of physics, and math. So just how did the three dimensional universe as we know it start? We know from Einstein's formula E=MC^2 that we can get energy from matter. We also know from Newton's law of physics that every action has an equal reaction. So, taking dynamic energy one could create everything and start the motion of everything created in the expanse with order. Is this logical? Yes! Is it true? It has to be because we continue to discover more about it using the laws of physics and mathematics. So this would open the biggest question of all, just who or what created it?

I don't work in those fields, or even ones like them, so I don't profess to know what you do about the theory.  However, I've always had an interest in astronomy and theoretical physics, so I've picked up a bit on the bare basics. From what I know, the theory started as a way to explain why the matter in the universe is seemingly expanding from one central point.  The logical conclusion would be that it all started in that point as an infinitely tiny, infinitely massive bit of matter that suddenly blew apart.  The reason for that blowing up has always been a question, although the string/M-theory people think they have a solution. There's where the faith part comes in, because you're right, most people don't want to touch the science behind the big bang.  Becase it's an accepted theory, it's taught in schools as the above.  People just accept that it's fact, but they don't bother to delve further into it.  They place their faith in the scientists and mathematicians who came up with it.

	63633 : ["Proof of Creation Irreducible complexity. The eye is a good example of this. According to evolution things evolve parts so they can achieve an advantage for survival, and anything that dosen't contribute to the survivability of the species is eliminated.  The eye has to have all of its parts before it can function. If you take the retina, the lens, the blood vessels, the nerves, or any other part away from the eye it can not function at all. According to evolution the different parts formed slowly, or peice by peice. A half formed eye is no good as it offers no advantage. The eye uses a large amount of brain power to process information. It would be a waste of resorces on any creature to have a good portion of its brain capacity used up by something that is not working. Since the eye is present in so many creatures it obviously had to appear fully formed, since it is something that even evolution would have to say would not contribute to the survivability of the species unless fully formed. In fact since it uses up so many resources it would be detrimental if not fully formed, and would allow a species without one to survive better. Charles Darwin admitted,  QUOTE    \"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous,succesive,slight modifications,my theory would absolutely break down\"   Perhaps the greatest proof of the creator's existence is seen when you gaze into the mirror. Your eyes have focusing muscles that move an estimated 100,000 times each day. Each eye has within it a retina that covers less than a square inch and contains 137 million light-sensitive cells. Even a wide eyed Charles Darwin said  QUOTE    \"To suppose that the eye could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree\"   The famous statistician George Gallup said, QUOTE    \"I could prove God statistically. Take the human body alone: The chance that all the functions of the individual would just happen is a statistical monstrosity\"   Radiohaloes and the decay rate of polonium. Decaying radioactive particles in solid rock cause spherical areas of damage to the surrounding crystaline structure in rock. A small peice of U-238 for example will leave a spherical area of discoloration that is characteristically different for each element it produces in its decay chain to Lead 206. When you look at cross-sections with a microscope these discolorations appear as rings called radiohaloes. A scientist named Dr. Robert Gentry has researched radiohaloes for years, and has published his results in leading scientific journals. Some of the intermediate decay isotopes, for example polonium have short half lives. Polonium has a half life of only 3 minutes, in other words it decays very quickly. Strangely enough rings created by polonium decay are often found in rocks without the parent uranium haloes. Now the polonium has to get into the rock before it solidifies, but it can not derive from a speck of uranium, or else it would be a uranium halo. Either the polonium was created (primordial, and not derived from uranium), or there have been radical changes in decay rates in the past. If the latter then radiometric dating is definately useless.   Evolution states that all forms of life evolved from lower forms of life. If this were the case there would be plenty of transitional forms in the fossil record. This is not the case. Throughout the fossil record when any form of life appears it is fully formed. All 32 orders of mammals are found fully formed in the fossil record with no intermediates. The first bats and birds were fully fledged fliers with no transitionary forms. Evolutionists believe that turtles evolved from cotylosaurs, but they admit there are no fossilized intermediate forms. They can't argue an incomplete fossil record since turtles leave more and better fossils than other vertibrates. The oldest known sea turtle fossil was a fully formed sea turtle, not at all transitional. The renowned evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould wrote: The absence of fossil evidence for intermediary stages between major transitions in organic design, indeed our inability, even in our imagination,to construct functional intermediates in many cases, has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution. And also: I regard the failure to find a clear \"vector of progress\" in life's history as the most puzzling fact of the fossil record. The reason there are no transitional fossils is because God created all things fully formed.  Ralph Muncaster is an author who states why he came to a belief in the God of the Bible, and more specifically faith in Jesus through examining the evidence available in his book A Skeptics Search for God.
