	49349 : ["The words we use are, \"Digital,\" where the image is recorded electronically, or , \"Film,\" where the image is recorded chemically. Film can also be instant - where the camera spits out the image in seconds, or latent - where the film has to be protected from light until it can be chemically developed to turn the latent image into a visible one. Modern DSLRs started out as 35mm SLRs but the film chamber was replaced by a sensor.  Subsequent developments have changed things a bit, but if you put (say) a Canon EOS 5 35mm SLR next to an EOS 5D, the family resemblance is unmistakeable.", 6928, "ExHxKVTJaa", 1],
	49350 : ["Dark photos is a result of either the camera not metering the scene correctly which can happen in any of the exposure modes. If choose a metering mode other than Matrix, it's likely that you will have more of a chance for a bad exposure if you do not understand how to meter or when your camera is trying to tell you that the exposure is going to be bad.  Cameras will try to tell you something is wrong by blinking either the shutter speed or the aperture or both.  Blinking numbers is always a bad sign that the camera cannot make a good exposure based upon the shutter speed (when in shutter priority) or the aperture (when in aperture priority) or both (when in manual mode). Your camera's viewfinder has a scale that looks something like this: -2,,-1,,0,,1,,2 with a floating dot under the number.  When metering off of something, the dot will tell you if that part of the image will be dark (e.g. -2) or middle gray (0) or very bright (e.g. +2).  If you point the camera at a white object, you want the dot to be in the + range.  How much depends on how bright the object is.  Clouds should be between +1 and +2.  Dark objects like a black car should have the dot around -1 and -2.  Middle toned object like healthy green grass should always be at 0.  If it is, then you know the exposure is good. So basically if you are getting dark images, it's either because you made a mistake or the camera was fooled by a difficult scene like backlit subjects such as someone standing inside a house in front of a bright window. Not getting crisp and sharp images are either a result of a bad lens (which you do not have) or by user error.  In your case, the results you're getting are likely to be your fault.  How?  Well, most commonly unsharp images are due to using a shutter speed that is too slow to be hand held.  The rule of thumb is that when you are hand holding the camera (i.e. not on a tripod), your shutter speed should be 1/the focal length x the camera's crop factor.  For example, if you set your lens to 50mm, the minimum shutter speed required to avoid  camera shake is 1/75th.  50mm x 1.5x crop factor = 75.  Since your camera doesn't have a setting for 1/75, use the next fastest shutter speed such as 1/90th. To confirm that your problem is camera shake due to an inadequate shutter speed, check the shutter speed and focal length of the images that aren't sharp.  If the shutter speed is equal to or lesser than the focal length used X the crop factor, then that's the problem.  Otherwise, it's something else. Lastly, the problem could be that the Sigma 17-50 f/2.8 doesn't focus well with the Nikon D5600.  This does happen occasionally with after-market lenses.  Check to see if there's a firmware update for your lens.  Often Sigma will have firmware updates that fix autofocusing problems.  You might need to buy Sigma's docking device which allows you to mount the lens onto it and then connect the device to your computer via a USB connection. You could be having one or more of these problems.  It's hard to say without seeing an example.  Posting a link to your photos will be a great help.", 6950, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
	49351 : ["Yes, there is definitely something missing.  You're comparing your photos with those taken by other photographers? Even if you used their cameras and lenses, you will not be able to get the same results as theirs. Why? The camera and lens are only tools.

Smartphones with their tiny little sensors (and Apple's is the smallest of all) ought to only be able to take rubbish quality photos. The reason why they don't is that backlit sensor technology and brilliant software design has improved them considerably. You'll still notice better potential image quality from APS-C and 35mm sensor DSLRs, but just remember that the 35mm sensor is 50 times physically larger and so can easily accommodate the extra photosites/megapixels.  Another consideration is that the current craze of making smartphones ever slimmer makes it harder to conceptualise the idea of a real optical zoom lens with moving parts. What they do now is use an extra camera module and 5x lens (which is lossless) and then digitally zoom down from that.", 6930, "UReKGnGXaa", 1],

	49364 : ["\"?\" provided a fine response to one of your questions... The Nikon D7500 is a good camera - in the right hands. Will the photos last for years? That depends how the photos are stored. As digital information, the captured images can be stored electronically on various media whether flash drive, hard disc drive, on optical disc, in a cloud storage environment and a few other ways. Flash drive or flash memory card storage is likely one least stable - a couple of years should be OK, but digital \"deterioration\" is possible. These are not a good long term storage (many years) option. HDD is a medium storage options - in the three cases, storage in more than one place will help - If one copy fails, *hopefully*, the other copy is OK. Good optical storage is probably the best digital method, but its drawback is what happens in 100 years when the drives to read that media are no longer available? The same can be said about flash memory or hard disc drives... What will computers look like in 20, 50 or 100 years? Leanr from the past - what did computers look like 100 years ago? (This is a trick question.) Cloud storage might be a good method, but we have no way to know if any of the cloud storage companies today will be around in 20, 50 or 100 years - or longer. What happens to the photos stored in their cloud server farm when they are sold or for whatever reason, are no longer in business? Professionally printing the photos on good photography paper and storing them in a cool, dry place, is another potential long-term possibility, but the concept of more than one copy needs to be carried through this, too. So... How important are the pictures and how long do you want them to be stored?", 6932, "8vF85gInaa", 3],
	49365 : ["Yes, the D7500 is a good camera.  It's designed for the advanced photographer who normally shoots a wider range of subjects including sports and wildlife.  To use it just for family shots is overkill.  You'd get better images if you went with a cheaper body and a more expensive lens.  Differences between sensors these days is pretty close and not like it used to be. Nikon and the rest of the camera manufacturers are moving away from the DSLR towards mirrorless cameras.  Therefore, for longevity of the system, I would encourage you to not get the D7500 but instead take a look at the Z6 or Z7.  Better than that is Canon's R series of mirrorless cameras.  Canon's R series is better not just because the bodies are better (which they are) but because the lenses are superior, too.  Of course, that'll change over time as it always has between C & N. If you go with a DSLR like the D7500 today, you will eventually find that there are no camera bodies to upgrade to other than mirrorless which will require you to use a lens adapter.  This is fine, but it will slow the AF down considerably.", 6932, "OczpbeMdaa", 4],
