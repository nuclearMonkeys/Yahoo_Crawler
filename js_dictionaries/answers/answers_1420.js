I have no interest in forming any more relationships in my life...been there, wrote the book. I happen to enjoy married men, they like to get what they can't get at home. Which works out well for me, since I like to GET. Fortunately, the world is filled with many different desires, and there are more than enough to keep me happy, while I am keeping them happy. They will not go home with a disease, and in fact, I suspect I have kept more married men married than any 50 marriage counselors.

A guy who IS looking for a relationship and thinks you MIGHT be the one .. is willing to wait 2 to 3 months without sex. But the more insecure we are, the quicker we have sex, hoping this will snare the guy.  Doesn't work that way. Understand that once the honeymoon phase dies out, we will never be happier in a relationship than we were happy without one. And the more insecure we are on our own, the more miserable we will be in a long-term relationship. We have to become whole first, if we want to attract lasting love.", 8860, "sMtpQ4f2aa", 0],

So what your referring to in regards to struggles, selling drugs, etc....that shhhh is old and played out too.  You want that, go listen to 50cent, who's still on that crap!  How much you need to hear about the same ol' thing?  Have you listened to Rick Ross or anyone else when they first hit the scene...they all begin w/ that hardcore gangsta album...but to go on w/ the sophmore and forward on the same shhh is fake and played out.  Because they ain't that no more. Music changes...and progresses...You ain't gonna see that type of stuff unless its a new artist trying to break some grounds.  Hip Hop ain't dead like Wayne said...what cause you white you ain't hard?  Seriously could you be more stereotypical...yeah, there's some major crap out there in regards to Hip Hop but you know what...thats what people are making popular.  I see a trend...its going back to the original roots w/ the feel good, party and shake ya a** songs.  Thats where hip hop/rap began....however the rap you want, highly doubt it will go back to that...that era ended in the 90's.  Like we don't know how people struggle... If you want some in-depth songs...you ain't gonna find it on the radio.  Like a previous poster...rappers like Common who are on that deeper stuff will not be put out there like that.

There are plenty of women who feel the same as you do.. As long as you are safe and considerate to your partners, noone else's opinion should really matter. As for having sex with married men, well thats a tough one, cuz if their wives found out they could be adversely affected by it. I'm not judging you, I am just saying to consider everyone involved and even if the wives are not apart of the encouner, they are still apart of the mans life and deserve consideration. It could easily ruin their marriage. Just a thought to consider. It is good that you have such a clear understanding of your sexuality and emotions. Many people never find that. P.S. To katheb: What if said vagina does not want a penis to go into it? Or said penis does not want to go into a vagina? Then I don;t think anyone is getting anything wrong.

	76656 : ["Go to the bathroom. Slowly undress yourself in front of the mirror while caressing your body as you do so. I'd suggest bringing ice-cubes with you as it adds to the experience. Once your top is off, rub your breasts with ice-cubes and gently pinch your nipples. Run the ice-cubes down to your inner thighs and take off your panties. Squat down and continue rubbing yourself with ice without touching your girl parts. While doing that, fantasize about something that turns you on. Once you're completely turned on, stick an ice-cube in your vagina (unless it feels uncomfortable) and/or your anus. Let the sensation overwhelm you for a moment. Next, get into the bathtub and turn on the water. What you do from here is your choice. You can finger your vagina with one hand and stretch your lips to make sure the water hits the right spot with another. You could opt for anal stimulation. Or your could pinch and roll your nipples while the water does its job.  I'd suggest teasing yourself by stopping right before you orgasm. Take an ice-cube and caress your body for one minute. Then, go back to stimulating your clitoris again.  Have fun.", 8847, "B5QJhTjSaa", 20],

I do agree that we have grown to be lazy. so m uch to the point that are economy has gone to siht. and honestly, in part i beleive its because PEOPLE DONT WANT TO WORK. theyre so used to getting things handed to them, things being easy... that most of us are leeching off of the benefits our government has to offer. I hate that i was raised the way i was. I honestly wish that my parents had instilled the value of exercise and eating right at a young age with me. but thats how everyone is now. its cheaper to buy the crap that your kids will actually eat with your food stamps than paying more for something they don't find appetizing. its something you have to enforce or else we will just continue to go downhill. this pattern will just keep repeating itself.

His resolution's (HR 362) claims can easily be disproven by anyone intelligent that does not rely on the U.S. Corporate Media: A-Accusation R-Rebuttal A) Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons R) There is not a shred evidence that Iran has a nuclear weaponization program. The International Atomic Energy Agency has certified time and again that it has found no evidence for a nuclear weapon program. A) regional hegemony R) Regional hegemony with a 3rd-rate army, an obsolete airforce that belongs to museums, a navy that is no match for the naval forces in the Persian Gulf? How is this \"hegemony\" going to be achieved? A) Iran's manifest efforts to destabilize and reshape the Middle East R) Iran provided crucial support for the U.S. when it invaded and overthrew the Talibans. Then, Iran played a fundamental role in helping the National Unity Government of President Hamid Karzai to emergy in 2001. Iran has done more for rebuilding of Afghanistan than any other country, with the exception of the U.S. The Shi'ite groups in Iraq that are now part of the government spent years in exile in Iran. They were funded, trained, and armed by the Iranian government. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his predecesor, Ebrahim al-Jafari, both have excellent relations with Iran. In recent months, when forces of Muqtada al Sadr wanted to rebel against the government, it was Iran that prevented that. So, how is Iran trying to destabilize that region? A) the means to produce enriched uranium, the key to producing Nuclear Weapons. R) The enriched uranium that Iran has been producing is at 3.8%. To make a nuclear weapon, the uranium must be enriched to 90%. Although the technology is the same for both, one cannot simply convert the present technology to bomb making. In addition, all of Iran's enrichment facilities are safeguarded by the IAEA. There is no way to divert the facilities to bomb making, so long as they are safeguarded. A) Iran is backing and arming militias and terrorists fighting the United States and our allies in both Iraq and Afghanistan. R) There has never been any evidence that Iran is either arming the militia or the terrorists. The United States Military has never presented any concrete evidence to establish the connection between Iran's military and what is happening in Iraq or Afghanistan. Once in a while, a claim is made to provoke the public, but the claim is usually refuted quickly, and then retracted. As an example, the Pentagon has promised several times to present to reporters the evidence for the alleged interference, and each time it has either cancelled the press conference, or backtracked completely.", 8846, "LT7IwZdhaa", 1],
