	109364 : ["As a Christian I am not \"militant\" about anything. Rather, as an ambassador for Christ I speak the truth in love to people who are in a false religious system or to people who have a wrong conception about what constitutes sin in the eyes of God. The lie that a man can be the wife of another man and a woman can be the husband of another woman, this oxymoron, self canceling notion,  is just one of the many deceptions of the Devil.  However, the enemy of our souls is moving his ignorant slaves to have this lie established as the secular law of the land that is in place to provide standards by which people know right from wrong. Ephesians 2:1  And you  He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,  2  in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,  3  among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.  The Bible is clear that God has to give a person the gift of faith and draw them to the Lord Jesus. So it doesn't make any sense to try to legislate faith.  Ephesians 2:8  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,  9  not of works, lest anyone should boast. When it comes to sinful behavior on the other hand, people have freedom to choose what they are going to do. Many people have not committed crimes because they were afraid of the penalty that they might suffer from the secular authorities. Your comparison between the two issues is unbalanced and incongruous. Trying to ban what people want to think and believe is the mark of an oppressive regime. Telling people that there are limits on their actions and that the government will not sanction a lie by pretending that it is the truth and putting that lie into the law is the role of reasonable restraint necessary to have an orderly society that is bounded by reason instead of being abandoned to anarchy. Romans 13:1  Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God.   2  Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.  3  For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.   4  For he is God's minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.", 10085, "AA11232725", 3],
	109365 : ["Good point. That's is why there should not be a vote on gay marriage. The right to marry should just be granted at the government level and that is all. That's what happened in Canada. The problem with democracy is that the majority rules. If the majority thinks that women should not vote, and we vote on it, women would obviously lose. The same applies to slavery, banning other religions, etc. Democracy sometimes doesn't work because it can be used to violate fundamental rights of minorities. *** if women were a minority. I'm just giving an example here to get the point accross.", 10085, "q9T1UWu4aa", 0],
	109366 : ["The act of sex does not define your sexuality.  You can remain a virgin until death and still be gay.  It is not the act of sex that defines who we are.  It is an attraction, a desire, a connection and an uncontrollable feeling that cannot be changed.", 10087, "AA11571939", 1],
