Let me explain.  You see, we aren't on this earth by accident. God created us, and He put us here for a reason: to know Him and to enjoy His presence in our lives, both now and throughout eternity. God even created us with an empty place in our hearts—an empty place that He alone can fill. The Bible says, \"He has also set eternity in the hearts of men\" (Ecclesiastes 3:11).  Whenever we try to fill that empty place with anything or anyone other than God, we are bound to fail. No matter how many things we have or how successful we are, that empty place is still there. But when we come to Christ, we discover that God loves us, and He makes us part of His family. More than that, He comes to live within us by His Holy Spirit. Think of it: God wants you to be part of His family forever—beginning now.  By faith turn to God and tell Him that you know you need Him. Then open your heart and life to Christ and ask Him to fill the empty places in your life. Jesus promised, \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives\" (John 14:27). Turn to Christ today and discover the joy and peace He alone can give. ", 9350, "None", 0],

The idea of a baby shower, stemmed from an ancient practice of celebrating the impending birth of a baby, basically a good happy fun time of getting together and talking about babies. These days, it's all about \"Oh MY GOSH, I don't know where too register\" or \"I can't find the right kind of invitation, I want formal ones\" or \" Is it ok to register at 3-4 different places\", instead of just wanting all the guests to have a good times. Baby showers have gotten greedy. Parents are registering large items such as cots, prams, strollers, etc, when they should be buying them themselves! It's in very poor taste, and I do not attend baby showers with registeries on that principal.

The AKC and its relationship with puppymills . . . the pot that calls the kettle black. Breeds becoming ever more exaggerated by the dog fancy, and the harm that many individual dogs (and their owners) suffer from because of those exaggerations. ie: the Pekingese has become a brick with a toupee that can't breath in anything but the best conditions and can hardly walk.  On top of that it has a ridiculous coat. How could breeders be allowed to ruin such an incredible historical breed? Genetic Diversity and how purebred breeds are becoming genetically impoverished. In a recent study of 10 representative breeds, 9 were highly inbred, and over six generations most lost >90% of unique genetic variants.  The effective population sizes of eight of the breeds had slipped down to between 40 and 80. Below 200 is considered genetically endangered by zoologists caring for our rare breeds. I think we need to say OOOOOOPS. How did purebred extremism become so entrenched? How did we get to this extremist fantasy of purified bloodlines? Of what advantage is it to our dogs? It was not always like that.The law that regulates purebred registries in Canada simply defines \"purebred\" as being descended in 7/8 or more of the total pedigree lines from a breed's original foundation stock, yet the registries instead insist on purity. Every other type of animal registry has allowance for infusion of blood that does not derive from original foundation stock. What's the deal with the dog registries?

Don't commit suicide, it will not solve your problems, it will just end your problems and your life and then what? It's going to be ahrd to put everything in the answer but I will give you some advice which I hope you try out and it works. - Remove the things that cause you to be depressed or only bring negatives things i in your like your boyrfriend, just leave him and forget him and focus on yourself for now. - you;ve been bullied, have no friends at school, been arrested etc. - don't fret over these things, learn from them and move on - You're doing bad at school becuase you ahve no motivation: it's going to take a lot of effort to bring your marks up in all your clasees so start grdually. Pick one subject you like and just focus on that, do your homework, ask your teacher questions during or after class, get a tutor and once your marks improve in that subject it will make you feel better about yourself, and give you motivation to work harder on other courses - Find happiness in your life: I would suggest volunteering, it could be something smalla nd simple like visiting an old folks home, volunteering with the city, in some after school program, your local place of worship - helping others brings you a lot of happiness and a reason to live - volunteering will also help you meet new  people and slowly help you talk with other people. Maybe the first place you volunteer at won't do it for you but keep trying until you find something you like - I don't know if you're a religious or spiritual person but this may be something you want to look into and research to find your purpose in life. Who created you? Why are you here? What do you want to do in your life? If you believe in God or some sort of higher power and just ask to be guided, ot be shown the right way and if you truly mean it, you'll find it. I belive in one God, to whom we shall all return to one day and be accoutnable for our actions and responsibilities towards ourselves and others and it gives me such a great reson to be a better person.  - i hope that helps, also try to do nice things for people in your family and try to have a better realtionship with them, that can help you increase the quality of your life Do all these things, and just have a goal to improve your life, to do something great with it and it's going to be a slow process but it will be worth it in the end.", 9350, "IR7e44yDaa", 3],

	90298 : ["KILL. To cause someone to die; to put to death. One of the ten commandments is \"thou shalt not kill\" (Ex. 20:13). The Hebrew word translated \"kill\" in Ex. 20:13, ratsach, is translated \"murder\" 14 times (Nu. 35:16, 17,18,19,21,30,31; 1 Ki. 6:32; Job 24:14; Ps. 94:6; Is. 1:21; Je. 7:9; Ho. 6:9) and \"slayer\" 17 times (Nu. 35:11,25,26, 27,28; De. 4:42; 19:3,4,6; Jos. 20:3,5,6; 21:13,21, 27,32,38). Bible truths about murder and killing. (1) MURDER AND SLAYING ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME (Nu. 35:15-25). There are at least four occasions in the Bible when killing is not murder: Accidental death. It is not murder to kill someone accidentally (Nu. 35:20-23). Self Defense. It is not murder to defend oneself or one's loved ones and property (Ex. 22:2-3). Military service and Law enforcement. It is not murder to kill a person in the line of duty in law enforcement and in the military (Ro. 13:1-4). Capital punishment. It is not murder to put criminals to death for heinous crimes. The Bible plainly says that the man who takes a life is to forfeit his own life (Ge. 9:6). The Law of Moses called for capital punishment in the case of murder (Le. 24:17; De. 19:11-13), idolatry (Le. 20:2; De. 17:2-7), witchcraft (Le. 20:27), adultery (Le. 20:10; De. 22:21,22), homosexuality (Le. 20:13), bestiality (Le. 20:15,16), rape (De. 22:25-27), incest (Le. 20:17), and blasphemy (Le. 24:11-16,23). The avenger of death in O.T. times was a relative or friend who put the murderer to death (De. 19:11-13 ). God allowed for this, and made provision for cities of refuge for those who had killed someone accidentally. In this dispensation God has given civil government the authority to put offenders to death. In Ro. 13 we see that God has given nations the authority to \"bear the sword\" against evil. This obviously refers to capital punishment. The sword certainly does not speak of a fine or of imprisonment! (2) MURDER IS AN UNUSUALLY HORRIBLE CRIME. It is horrible because of its finality (He. 9:27). It is horrible because of the value of a soul (Ma. 16:27). It is horrible because of what man is (Ge. 1:26; 1 Jn. 4:20). A man is not an animal; a man has an eternal soul, and to cut a man's life off seals his eternal destiny (Lk. 16:22,23; He. 9:27). (3) MURDER DEFILES THE LAND (Nu. 35:33; Ju. 20:13) and requires capital punishment (Nu. 35:30-34; Ge. 9:6; Pr. 28:17; Ro. 13:4). (4) MURDER IS PROBLEM OF THE HEART (Mt. 15:18-20). Christ compared murder with anger (Mt. 5:21-22). The first murder was committed by the first child born into the world (Ge. 4:8-9).", 9346, "qyoXSdPCaa", 1],
