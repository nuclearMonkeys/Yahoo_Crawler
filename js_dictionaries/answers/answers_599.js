They will all be making a pan of Scouse in celebration city wide hopefully. In Blackburn we call 'Scouse' a meat stew. Course I remember Istanbul, I watched 1st half in pub got a kebab on way home threw my betting slip in bin outside shop(I had L/pool to win in extra time/pens at 12 to 1) I had to run back to shop and fish it out, chilli sauce and old wrappers.

	33804 : ["First, the Packers pretty much ended their relationship with Rodgers the moment they drafted Jordan Love. While it is true that Rodgers is an aging QB, it also showed that the Packers wanted to move in a new direction sooner, and felt that Rodgers had begun to decline. By drafting Love, the Packers all but made it clear that Rodgers was no longer the primary option going into the future.Â  The truth is, Aaron Rodgers has two things that go against him at this point:Â  1. His age - He is now 36, which means, he has just about reached the end of his prime. At this stage, he is naturally declining as all QB's do when they age. He seems to be still playing very well, but after this next season, we may start to see a downward progression due to age which is normal for every QB.Â  2. His lack of playoff success - Aaron Rodgers is one of many successful players that has earned a reputation based on a single super bowl win. While Rodgers has the numbers in the regular season to back up his resume and legacy in the NFL, he is just 11-9 in the playoffs. While 11-9 is still a winning record, it isn't great. Also, he is now 1-4 in NFC championship game appearances.Â  Rodgers will be a first ballot Hall of Famer, and yes, if he is released by the Packers, he will be picked up immediately by another team. However, the Packers as an organization understand that they are approaching a ceiling with Rodgers as the QB. Unless he wins a super bowl next season, his career in Green Bay is finished.Â ", 5121, "XLXncQu9aa", 1],
