	88676 : ["Tact,jesus TACT. have you ever heard that statement \"give a man enough rope, and he'll hang himself. \"\" now properly articulated that gives you an idea.Words work the same way. there is such a thing as too much information. Interupting people is just downright rude. every source of information deserves respect even if it is just the doofy guy from accounting, To be a social person, It requires genuine interest in other people, Their lives, their opinions, their jokes good and bad, and how they make you feel. Now it's good to have back and forth, but since you're learning how to be social, listening is key, Annecdotes aren't terrible, just unnessesary intially, don't TOP someones story, and DON'T think about what you are going to say while they are talking, really take it in, ask questions, give feedback, then after if you feel it pertains to the convesation, allow yourself to tell YOUR experience, describing how you felt ect. Never allow yourself to be manipulated.either. don't allow yourself to shamelessly gossip, although a little teeny gossip just can;t be helped.(literally imossible) as long as it's harmless. try being the one in room who's not talking for a change. just listen, and people will automatically include you.( unless you fired someone they knew) good luck i hope this helps. there's more but start with this.......-m", 9305, "66a9458faf79154173184f17a826bbd3aa", 3],

	88695 : ["Kate is intelligent and well mannered. She never tried to catch William - he went after her.  I think it's important to be educated as Kate is to be the wife of a future king. She must be able to see matters as a whole and not just single pieces, and for that you do need a certain grade of education, a certain grade of logic. Which Kate has.  She also has that certain something about her person, she's elegant both in style and mind (ok she's got a naughty silly sense of humour but that's the private Kate and it's ok).  She's considering what she says,is cultivated and well thought through before saying anything. She's not gushing along and neither is her family.  See, it's not easy on the job market for a girl like her. Being William's girlfriend, she can't go out and work for anybody. She has to keep private and careful to whom she says what. So it's not fair to criticise her working life. She's been most safe to work for her father.  If she didn't marry William, she would long have worked on  her career. She is very down to earth, and she'd never dreamt of dating a prince and marry him. But that's how life goes. You never know where it takes you, and Kate's life has taken its course towards William. They are for each other, that's as certain as death comes one day.  And the fact that she won't be a working princess right away is William's and Kate's wish and well thought through. They have learnt from earlier mistakes in the family. Kate doesn't seek the limelight, she wants to be sure she does the right thing - when she does something. That doesn't mean she won't do anything. She will do a lot - just behind the scenes. She's a person who wants to support her husband. To her, William is the prince and she will support him.  And William is very protective of her. They don't want anybody chasing Kate down the lanes like they did Diana. Kate will be just the right \"amount\" of public princess to serve the people exactly how they need it. This is going to be right - this time. And William will not have anybody mingle with that, not even (or just not) his father. EDIT: You said \"Pls dont be nasty- I just want your views\". - Then please accept our views and don't give any counter-arguments. Kate was dating someone else in St. Andrews, she had a full blaze relationship with another bloke. If she went to St. Andrews to catch William, she'd remain single. And as for her education I said it before, what could she do after her studies but working for her father. She's been dating William at that time. She didn't have much choice. Look, thousands of girls were dreaming of marrying William. From your comments, I take it you're one of them. I'm not criticising you; it's understandable. He was a catch but to 99.9 % of the girls, he was out of radar range. Kate got the 0.1 %.", 9303, "UCkluEDTaa", 2],

It would also be great for our economy if people stayed at home and spent their money here instead of taking it abroud... even though it sometimes could work out more expensive to stay and holiday at home ;o)   But saying that, if you go anywhere too touristy [is there such a word?] they are likely to take advantage of this.

	88707 : ["This was a great barrier I had to get over to get to where I am today. A bit of a \"pursuit of happyness\" story on my part. The trick to becoming what you wish to is to first recognize how things happen. Things always occur in one's mind first, then in reality. Everytime that's the way it goes. On some level you visualize it or anticipate it in your mind, and then it occurs. For most people, they get everything they expect from their surroundings, in other words, they take people's view of themselves as how they really are, when in truth that isn't true. You truly are how you see yourself to be, others only are getting their view of you from how you view yourself to be in their eyes. So if you're both looking to one another to see how you are, your actions of looking to them for approval will be who you become according to that process. So in general just practice viewing yourself seriously as a person who is very sociable, look at examples of how you want to be by watching visuals of how you wish to be from movies and the like. If you want to have marylin monroe's sex appeal, simply watch her on youtube or the like and learn to adopt her mannerisms. Never forget them and try to implement them into your natural behaviors as easily as she does herself. Soon it will be a part of yourself, for this is how the rest of your personality was created, you saw a behavior and mimicked it. Majorly from your peers and parents of long times past. You take this to a mental level and always be aware of your behavior and everything you do, down to your very breath itself. Eventually, this new you will become the you that everyone sees and is used to, the only difference is, you'll have everything you've ever wanted or expected from yourself this way. It's simply a choice to make. Isn't it Amazing?", 9305, "AA11542491", 4],
