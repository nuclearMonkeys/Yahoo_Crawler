We try to avoid any food imported from China, for example, after all those reports of contamination.  Remember, the FDA/USDA inspectors are not there like they are at US processing plants.  And why would anyone ever want beef from South America or Puerto Rico where limits on growth hormones,etc are not regulated/enforced compared to Iowa beef, or even Canadian (better yet Kobe)?  Pay a little more for that tilapia from MN instead of China.  Mushrooms (canned) from USA or Canada instead of China. They are only a few pennies more, and less risk. Then there is the issue of terrorism.  Contamination of the food supply is one known plan of some terrorist groups.  Much easier thru big corps with wide distribution.  Of course, the big corp would not be party to this, but a terrorist (or just a nut case) can douse a lot or two with poison with enough advance work.

Yet, there were many afflicted people on earth at the same time who did not receive healing or exorcism, because they did not come into contact with these ministers of God. Once humankind rebelled against God, God's initial good order of the universe (Gen. 1 \"and it was good\") ended.  The new order is randomness, in which evil will fall on some people.  We are forbidden to regard those who suffer the misfortune as any more evil than others who do not (including ourselves) (Luke 13: 1-5).  God does not promise to take the effects of our human rebellion away from us in this world.  He leaves these things for all of us as a reminder of our sinfulness, while providing for us the Means of Grace, the Word and Sacraments, by which we can be freed from the eternal effects of our sin.", 9246, "fb32217e975ff5844cd7200fbf61284caa", -1],

I agree that some types of \"processed foods\" are disgusting, but I think it unfair to label companies as cruel, disgusting, or unusual because you can visualize their practices.  If you still find it offensive go to places like whole foods that sell \"cage-free\" or the like... I bet you will find it costs much more.  This is basic to all commodities, the more effort to produce, the higher the cost.  People are very divided about what concerns them most, method or cost.  ALL COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED WITH PROFIT AND PRODUCTIVITY!!!  So many people use that phrase like it is a bad thing...  Do you realize that cost savings by companies benefits themselves, but you also?  If companies did not try to reduce costs, EVERYTHING would cost much more than what it costs now.  What are the health problems?  I don't know of anyone getting sick... There are natural methods that lower fats and cholesterols, etc. but you have to pay more for them.
