	105703 : ["Definitely an imposition - actually strange unless there is something else going on and they are desperate for help.  However, if that were the case, it would still be a favor and polite for them to give at least a brief explanation of what is going on.  The fact they want your husband to drive her back and forth pushes it even further.   The daughter is not coming to visit you.  She is coming to be watched by you.  If she wanted to stay with someone on her break, she would probably ask to stay with a school friend's family.   I'm confused by your husband, as well.  For one, he seems to be easily pushed over by this couple, yet is very defensive about it to you.  Also, you say you do work at home and take classes, so you do have things to do, but he seems to be implying \"you don't do anything all day.\"   I could entertain myself pretty well at that age, but it was kind of expected of me and I've always been rather introverted.  If she is going to be so bored at her own home, what is she going to think of your house?  However, the situation is not really the girl's fault.   Maybe they simply are unaware of how much they are asking.  Some people fit things to be convenient for them and the other people involved in their plan might not see it the same way.  They may not understand boundaries.  (Set them anyways.)   You could try to turn down this \"invitation\" this time.  Your husband would probably have to say: \"I'm sorry.  I should have asked my wife first.  It turns out she isn't able to do it.\"  I'm not sure he is willing to do that and turning them down after accepting may create some waves.   You may end up watching her this time, but you are right to be concerned about a \"regular thing\" and make it clear that you don't intend for that to happen.   One suggestion I have is going to the library with her to pick out some books and DVDs so she can entertain herself.   My parents love my daughter - she is their first grandchild - and I would only ask them to watch her overnight (even for one night) as a big favor.  I'd leave them the option to say no and let them know I appreciated it.", 9935, "wJxDdlcmaa", 1],

	105708 : ["Yes, you BOTH will be at the hearing for the Restraining Order. I've taken out a few in my life time. You'll be ordered to Anger Management counseling. It's up to her as how long she wants the Order to last. I myself broke a couple by meeting & talking to him. The last one I had taken physical abuse for far too many yrs., was afraid of being permanently hurt at my age. Was separated for 9 mons. Went back to court to have the Order lifted. The Judge asked me if I was sure I wanted it lifted, told her yes. He KNOWS IF he ever touches me again, he will do jail time. I still get emotional, verbal & mental abuse at times, but it's no where like it was. We've been together for 23 yrs., both of course retired. When one gets older they do usually change for the better. I dare say if the two of you really do love each other, didn't fight much on the whole, she no doubt will have it lifted like I did when I was younger with my now ex husband...the best to you...:)", 9934, "naequcqlaa", 0],
	105709 : ["I'm guessing there's another guy in the picture. Most women would never file an RO over some yelling and a smashed phone. Here's the thing ... smashing someone's phone can be a felony because you're taking away their ability to call for help. You don't admit to that in court. You say that you're in counseling to deal with stress, and that you raised your voice and threw something you thought was ... your phone, the remote, or that you tried to take her phone and SHE smashed it. Tell the judge that you're sorry you yelled because it's caused you a lot of trouble but that you haven't called the police at times when she's yelled at you and you're really just shocked and disappointed by how everything turned out.  Treat your girlfriend like you're upset. Do not go to anger management classes. Go to therapy and work with a therapist on reacting to stress in healthy ways. There's a difference. Especially to the ears of a judge. I wouldn't recommend talking to your girlfriend or even looking at her. That is the easiest way for you to make her think about what she's doing. RO's weren't meant for fights where someone starts yelling. They are for protecting you against a dangerous person, and will go on to affect your ability to work, to rent apartments, etc etc throughout your life. It's not something to cop to so your overreactive girlfriend will stop being mad at you (which, btw, wouldn't work in a million years anyway ... drama queens thrive on drama). You do not want a permanent RO on your record.", 9934, "FHxZx4Thaa", 0],

Hair that is swept off of the floor is not usable because it is not bundled in a ponytail or braid. Hair that is shaved off and not in a ponytail or braid is not usable.

	105718 : ["I agree that it does seem a bit like they are imposing on you. Because you've only meet them twice, and seeing as your children are all grown up, yes they are. Maybe there is possibly a fight going on between the couple and they don't want their daughter to know about? In that case it makes sense. However sine you have their daughter for three days, maybe take some time off and take her to the zoo or something? But then again you are spending your own money, so ask the parents to give you some money as well. Doesn't seem fair that if you were to take her somewhere you're stuck with paying for it all with no reimbursement. I suppose even if it is wrong of them to do this to you, maybe look on the positive side, you get to be a mom again for three days. You can maybe teach her some cooking or cleaning, so she can help her mom around the house. As odd as it sounds try to stay positive no matter how angry you are, because yeah, you have every right to be.", 9935, "wLJNvwt4aa", 1],

	105722 : ["\"im seeking professional help.\" NUMBER ONE!  GET professional help BEFORE you go that hearing.  Don't tell the judge that you are \"seeking\" professionmal help.  GET IT, and stick with it.  Don't do ANYTHING else until you get that help. Promises mean nothing; actions show you mean what you say. \" I'll do anything.\" So, will you follow the law and OBEY the Restraining Order?  If you are a man of your word, then you WILL \"do anything\" that IS RIGHT, and you WILL obey the restraining order to SHOW that you are going to \"do the right thing\". GET your professional help, and then DO WHAT THEY SAY.  DO NOT attempt to get back together until you have started to recover, and to find the RIGHT ways of handling your anger. Frankly, at 22, you are not yet a full grown man.  While your BODY is ready, your MIND is still childish, selfish, angry, and immature.  You WILL NOT reach your EMOTIONAL maturity until you are about 27.  Professional help will help you understand this, and will show you how to think like a man instead of an impulsive, angry child. GET THAT HELP before you go to to court, or your case is lost.  DO nothing, SAY nothing, until you have RECEIVED professional help, then get advice from the counselor before you do or say anything else.", 9934, "pRF5LLloaa", 0],

	105725 : ["Vacations and nice dinners are wonderful and it sounds like your wife deserves them.  Also, a massage when the kids are in bed would probably also help her relax. When it comes to having sex with your wife, do you just go straight for intercourse?  As soon as the kids are away and she is finished sorting through unpaid bills do you try to get her in the sack?  I am not bashing you for being horny.  You are human and humans have sexual needs.  But people, especially women, are rarely ever able to immediately switch from the daily grind mind set to the hanky panky mind set. What I'm getting at is - flirt with her, make her feel special.  Foreplay begins long before oral sex or anything else in that arena.  Romantic dinners and roses are great, but let her know you think she is the one that gets you hot.  Appreciate what she does for you, the household and the family but also let her know that she deserves a little pleasure too.  Even if she is wearing every day clothes, if you like the way her rear end looks, tell her.  If she smiles or laughs at something you say or anyone says, tell her how beautiful she looks.  Check her out like you did when you were dating.  Try to remember the things that used to make her blush before you two were in a serious committed relationship and the stress of everyday life set in.   These are just suggestions.  You know your wife, so comment on the things you genuinely love or find especially attractive about her.  This may put her in the mood for a little more romance and fun. You should take her away and give her a break.  However, during those in between times remind her that she is special and that even when things are far from perfect, she still deserves some sexual release.", 9932, "czRXtX47aa", 0],

It's their job to find activities for their child on school breaks and not dump her at your house.  Better yet, one of them should take off work and spend time with their daughter. How are you \"helping them\" and why?  Do they have someone in the hospital or some other emergency? This is the kind of favor you would only ask very close friends or relatives.

I'm not sure if they work cuz i never tryed a heat protector product but i would try one. it's a good idea because maybe your hair is frizzy because of heat damage.  2.
