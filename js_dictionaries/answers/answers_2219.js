	116772 : ["I have had this disorder since 2003.  I find it interesting that many people in California suffer from this condition.  I was a pest inspector in Oregon when the symptoms became noticeable to me.  In my research I found that many California exterminators were killing the rats and not treating the bedding and nesting areas of the mites that lived on the rats.  Once the rats died off the mites went looking for a new host.  The inhabitants of the home were the next victims.  The mites could not survive with human hosts so some skin bites would have occurred and upper resperatory infections possibly resulting in pneumonia. However the mites would die shortly but not the filerial nematode parasites that the mites carried.  This is a real condition it appears to be more symptomatic in immunocomprimised individuals.  I believe that this condition is ignorred by the medical community because many who are infected will want to blame someone.  To reasonably assign the liablilty to any one entity would be impossible.  Unfortunately we who suffer from other disorders that comprimise our immune systems will have to deal with the disorder.  It all points towards the healthy will survive.  I just wish the so called practicing physicians would take a second look at there \"Hypocritical Oath\"  I don t care what this is I don t care if its real or in my head I will do what ever it takes to make it stop.
