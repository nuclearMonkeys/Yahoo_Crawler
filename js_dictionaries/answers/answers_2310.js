	121312 : ["Killa, I applaud the other people in here who have delivered such great answers.   If we be pragmatic and realistic here, racism occurred both ways but I must say that Filipinos are also victimized of racism as much as anyone in here and I do feel that racism against Filipinos have been ignored in many cases. Every race has had their share of racist people. No race is an exception. We all have our flaws. We cannot simply just target and stereotype one race as the aggressor while the other is the victim. I have seen almost every race in the forum be attacked. I have seen Europeans, Latinos, Asians, White Americans, and African Americans are target of racism in this forum. Nevertheless, we represent ourselves, our families, and our self identities. However, we are humans with emotions, and we are affected by these numerous false statements and racist stereotypes.  There is no need for the blame game. There is no need to target one particular group for wrongdoing. We need to top these stereotypes and focus specifically on the people that have used racism.  But to focus on your specific question, I definitely do agree that some of these racial statements against Filipinos have been overtly exaggerated and unjustifiably erroneous. It is offensive, hateful,  and truly unbearable.", 10649, "None", 8],

	121323 : ["I copied and pasted one of my previous answers to similar questions, and I will give you a sneak peak at what we call relaxed, or the unschooling method. I would like to add another resource book on unschooling that I think gives a pretty good snapshot of this method of learning, as well as the life style. The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith. ISBN -- 10: 0761512764 Hope this helps a bit, but please understand that unschooling is the hardest to describe since it is different for each family, it is unique to their life style, as well as each individual in that family. Here is a rundown of our unschooling way of life:  First, and most important we have long talks, and discussion about anything, and everything. We do math, and language arts in the more traditional way, since I believe that math, reading, and writing are the most important things a person can learn. If these are firmly in place, you can learn anything you put your mind to. Proper communication is very important. For history we choose, movies, documentaries, talks with veterans, good historical fiction books, games, and other literature. For geography we do essentially the same, but we also include games, travel video's, road trips, and cooking meals from the regions. Map skills (regular, and topical), as well as compass reading are learned, because these skill are a necessity where we live. One should not rely on technology (GPS) alone, these gadgets can break, making basic survival skills a must. The Boy Scouts, the Civil Air patrol can teach many of these skills as well. Science is part of everyday life, the first six years are the day's of creation, each \"day\" has enough subject material to cover a years worth of reading, experiments, as well as field trips; one drawback are the animal habitats; they become a permanent part of our families zoo. :) Home economics's, and life skills; chores, learning how to budget, shop, and cook by planning the meals, and preparing them. Getting a job, balancing a checkbook (even at age 12), and learning how to save, learning how to work with, and interact with all kinds of people on the job,or while doing their volunteer work are skills that need to be practiced, and cannot be learned properly from a textbook. They are learning languages, cultural diversity and music, from members of our congregation who gladly share their knowledge, and talents with them, because the children are genuinely interested. Bible; Sunday school, Awana's, youth groups, and Bible camps; add daily devotions, voila, no curriculum needed unless you like to have a chronological study; my kids did want to do that so we got one.  Civics's, study a basic book; add a study of the constitution; go to see your elected officials in action at your state capitol, follow a bill to see how it is drafted, and what it takes to move it through the system, volunteer at voting booths, or a candidates campaign. Speech, and debate sign up for Toastmasters, or another club. Electives; use 4H for everything from cooking, sewing, photography, veterinary science to robotics. Sports; the sky is the limit, both for recreation, and competition. I would say all that adds up to much more than the average \"textbook\" could cover. Life was meant to be experienced, lived, and questioned, with all it's ups and downs. The added benefit is that learning actually clicks, because it is a part of their daily life, it makes sense, and they gain the needed self confidence to become independent, with that I can do attitude.

	121328 : ["Interesting question!! I'm kinda working on two novels right now, one which I'm finished and am in the process of editing and partial rewriting, and one I've just begun! So I'll briefly go over both, since this question seems like a fun one! My first one is based off of a collaboration of different things.  First there's the movie \"Let Me In,\" which affected me very deeply for reasons I'm not entirely sure.  The love between my two characters is based off of the story in \"Let Me In,\" but thankfully took on a life of its own so it's not too much like the movie after a point, haha! Then there's a few real life events which really got me going.  They were at my school.  One was where a reasonably good friend of mine kinda had a mental breakdown, and was out in front of the school screaming, wanting to fight, getting pissed off.  Another was of a girl I know who went into one of the bathrooms during class, and was gone most of the time.  Someone found her there, crying and barely able to walk.  These turned out to be basically normal happenings, one involving girl problems, another involving a problem with medicine, but they became a basis for my story, haha! The other is based off of three prominent things.  One is the song \"Alone with the Sea,\" by Hurt.  A very unheard of band, but absolutely amazing, and that song really struck a chord with me, so part of my story is based off of those lyrics.  Another inspiration was the movie \"The Village,\" the idea of an isolated small community.  And the third thing is a concept I've always thought would make an amazing ghost/horror story: where the main character, rather than be the typical character, is someone who is half insane, someone who knows horror in his life and who is a writer, and therefore isn't actually afraid of the things which are happening to him.   Those are basically it! Fun question! Cheers!", 10654, "B6RHDGzOaa", 2],

	121330 : ["Okay. I'm going to talk about one of my side projects, because it is a lot more fun than the novel I am currently editing. (If you really would like to know more about my more serious writing pursuits, this link will take you there:   ) So now for the fun answer. A couple of years ago, when I was between projects, I was idly flicking through B&A when I saw a question by the very lovely JLT (regulars to this page will know who that is) giving writers a possible title for a story and asking if they could come up with a plot. One of the titles that JLT suggested was \"Perched Outside in the Rain\". I quite liked the title and came up with an idea for a short story about a young woman who was sitting on the steps of a pub in the rain. A shadowy figure begins to talk to her, and offers her comfort when she tells him about her abusive boyfriend. Over the course of the conversation she begins to develop feelings for him. It was not until they both eventually step into the light that she discovers that he is her neighbour, who she has always been terrified of, due to the number of scars and tattoos that cover his body. I eventually expanded the story to become a novella, retitled it Outside in the Rain, which had a moral that people may not always be what they appear at face value and sent it away to a publisher. Unsurprisingly, it was rejected. Anyway, as I'm deep in the editing stages of my current manuscript, I decided to pull this one out and work on it whenever I felt like writing instead of editing. Just as a small side project. The plot has expanded somewhat and I'm really pushing the whole \"people are not what they may seem\" bit. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it. In many places the writing is very simple and I doubt that it would make a commercially successful book. On the other hand, it might be fun to post it free on Smashwords or the Amazon Kindle Store.", 10654, "za9b8cHKaa", 2],
