When you take him to a party, he always makes sure you are having a good time as much as he is.  I would say, someone who cares about me as much as himself. I don't care if he is good looking or not... I have known some guys, all they think about is themselves, their job, or their car.  If they spent half of that time trying to make their girlfriends happy, this would be a happier world, there would also be fewer divorces.   Because then the women would be trying to please their men also---- more than usual.....most women are natural givers, and very nurturing, many men aren't.   Very Important:  A Guy that Doesn't crank his neck around to look at women passing by him at the mall.  This is a huge mistake men make, women hate that, it also causes insecurities and jealousy, arguments, etc...If he is going to be looking at other women, \"up and down,\"  he should not be in a relationship...he should just stay single, and spare all of us a lot of grief.

	117159 : ["Hey kiddo, you've just asked an incredibly open question.  So lets start by answering those points that are most obvious.  I'm gonna use house shopping as a metaphor... so bear with me.   Before I start lets get one thing clear.  Unvoiced expectations can kill a relationship before it starts.  Most people assume that their partner will instinctively know whats best for the other, or what makes the other feel good.  Wrong.  The number 1 thing that a man wants from a woman is for her to voice her expectations of him and give him the chance to meet them.   If he doesn't want too, well then, its most likely not gonna work out...  You need to make sure he knows what you want, but at the same time, you have to give him a fair oppurtunity to work on it!  Communication is the most important thing in a would be or existing relationship! -------------------------------- What catches the eye: (First time you meet) 1.  Sexual Appeal.  (\"The house looks good\") READ: This does NOT mean you have to look like Hallie Berry / Jessica Alba.  It doesn't even mean you have to be the best looking girl around.  In fact, looking like that might put off most guys.  Sexual appeal is when you are very comfortable with your sexual prowess, your body, your abilities and your looks.  If you have confidence, you will walk sexy, dance sexy, stand sexy and look sexy.  Guys like girls with confidence too!   Solution: Lots of things can get you that sexy confidence.  Take dance lessons and then rock your body at a club or with your friends for no other reason than to show off your moves. Go to the gym with your friends.  Obviously it will enhance your figure, but upsurges in good hormones and endorphins will make you \"appear sexy\" while feeling sexy too...even in the short term!   Finally, Intimacy with a significant other can make you feel really sexy.  You probably remember making him say \"Wow,\" after some serious passion, right?   It made you feel like a champ didn't it?  Even if you are single, remembering that you can satisfy any guy will remind how sexy you are!  I'm not condoning going out and hooking up with guys to make yourself feel better... what I'm saying is every woman was a FOX, but many are just too caught up in lonliness and heartbreak to remember how sexy they were. --- 2.  First Impression Personality. (\"The house looks inviting!\") Listen, there is no quicker way to make a man comfortable with the idea of being with you than smiling, laughing, and looking at him.  If you catch someone you like looking at you, don't think that you have to play hard to get or strike a sexy pose in order to attract him. Solution: If you smile, wave, or just look plain friendly, guys are going to want to be with you, especially good guys.  Believe it or not, girls that act like supermodels are often too unapproachable for most men.  Often times this \"pretensiousness\" means that they really don't have much to offer besides looks.  Usually, only dirtbags with lots of money or huge egos go for them. ----------------------------------------- What keeps him from walking away: (Those first few times you interact) 1.  Stay friendly.  (\"The house is comfortable\") A guy is going to want to get to know you because you are friendly, the same way you want to hang out with a friendly person, .  READ: this is NOT being \"easy.\"  You know your bounds, so respect them, and make him respect them.  If he oversteps his bounds, or begins to \"creep you out\" let him know; your safety is most important.  But if everything is going well, let him know that you are alot of fun and you are having fun with him.   Solution:  Smiling, fliriting, dancing, laughing, and keeping the conversation going encourages the guy to keep at it.  Conversely, looking away, acting disinterested, not talking, not laughing or not smiling will usually give the guy the impression that you aren't interested (this is good if you are trying to drive the dude away). --- 2. Confidence.  (\"The House is isn't gonna fall appart\") He's at your proverbial \"doorstep\" because you had that sex appeal and you looked inviting.  Most girls are a bit nervous at this point, but remember: so is the guy!  If you are confident in yourself, hes going to know you are worth the nerve-racking effort it takes to walk up to you.   Solution: This is where alot of girls bug out.  The truth is most people think they are born with what the attributes they are going to have for the rest of their lives.  Unless you have a serious birth-defect however, this is untrue.  At almost any age, you can become better at anything.  If you want to improve your intellect... start reading informative books!  You want to improve your dancing? Take lessons(some people take longer than others but eventually everyone gets good)!  Go to the gym to better your physique.  If you want to improve your personality start talking to people!  Talk to everyone and you will learn valuable social cues.  Ultimately, being confident in yourself is knowing that even if you aren't good at something, you can always improve with a little effort!   Pearl for Practice:  Even a guy who dances like Usher will chill with a girl who atleast \"tries\" to dance. ----------------------------------------- Stealing his Heart: (usually when its obvious he's into you or when you've started seeing each other) 1.  Sense of humor.  (\"This house is great for entertainment!\")Guys really want to think they are funny.  Laughing is an instinctive human form of flirting.  Even if the guy would have rotten tomatoes thrown at him at a club, cracking a smile or a chuckle will usually win him over.  Even better... joking with him or teasing him casually will usually put cupid's arrow through a man's heart.  Even if you aren't that funny, most guys will be so impressed at the effort, they'll want to take you home to momma!   Solution: Simple, Laugh and tell jokes.  I'm telling you... it works like magic! READ: humor is also a way you can determine a persons values.  If his humor makes you very uncomfortable, (racist or dead baby jokes galore) you should let him know.  Maybe he isn't a bad guy, but he needs to learn to cut certain things out of his routine. --- 2.  Fun Factor.  (\"Good times are gonna be had here!\")  Okay, this does not necessarily mean that you have to go play football in the rain with his buddies or play poker every tuesday while smoking a cigar.  This means three things: A)  You aren't above trying what ever he does for fun.  B) You are willing to put up with his hobbies.  C)  You never EVER criticize him for his choice of entertainment.  Even though a girl that can beat me in Halo 3, knows her NFL division standings by heart, and is willing to surf / work out / dance / capoeira with me IS MY DREAM girl... the girl I nearly married was none of the above.  She simply abided by the ABCs. IMPORTANT:  There are only two reasons why you should not follow the ABCs for fun (as above).  1) His passtimes are dangerous.  If Drugs, Alchohol, Fighting, or Crime are what he does for fun... you probably should avoid getting involved, in fact, you probably shouldn't be with him at all.  2)  His passtimes really go against your most sacred beliefs / morals.  These can include views on monogamy, religious practices, substance use, animal torture, and pretty much any other practice you can think of that really \"makes your skin crawl.\"  --- 3. Nurture His Ego: (\"This house makes me feel good about myself\")  Dudes are constantly wondering if they measure up.  Some dudes may be complete wrecks about it.  Truth is if you are headed towards a relationship or have been for quite some time, his ego always needs a little stoking.   Solution: Unless things are coming to a definate end, you should never stop complementing him.  (and he shouldn't stop complementing you!) Tell him how attracted you are to him.  Call him a stud.  Pinch whatever part of his body you find most appealing.  Keep flirting with him and being friendly!  If the guy feels like a million bucks because of you, he most likely isnt gonna want to lose that!   ------------------------------------------ Getting him head over heels: (you've been dating) 1.  Personal Honesty:  (\"This house is what I bargained for\")  Okay, so he found out that you aren't a Halo champ and you thought the Patriots kicker was the quaterback.  Now what?  Be honest.  Be yourself.  You are already in his good graces.  So that really isn't going to matter much.  You probably found out he wasn't a big stud in High School or he farts alot in bed.  An endearing quality to most men is being honest and comfortable about your imperfections.  Men equate this with monogamous loyalty.  At the same time though, he is going to expect you to be accepting of his imperfections.  If he doesn't readily admit his flaws, make it known that you are comfortable with them, or even like them.  Example: \"Honey, that scar on your lip adds character.\" or  \"Nothing cracks me up more than when you fart in bed!\" IMPORTANT: At this stage in the relationship you should know what really bothers you about him.  If his drinking habit is getting out of control, or he isn't really going anywhere in life... by GOD TELL HIM!  If he truly cares he is going to change.  If he doesn't, then its up to you whether or not you want to persue this relationship. --- 2.  Situational Honesty:  (\"I know house is gonna hold up against a storm\")  Sometimes you will develop a crush outside of your relationship or the time just isnt right for moving in together.  Whenever a hurdle that puts a strain on the relationship comes along, thats the time to communicate the issue. SOLUTION: Talk it Out. Always make things that can cause trouble clear.  Never leave any room for doubt about your feelings or his.  Usually bottled up emotions lead to passive- aggressive or even agressive behavior like cheating and psychological abuse.  That being said you owe each other the truth... always.   If something is threatening the relationship, he needs to know, whether or not its something he can work on.  If you think your extracurricular crush is going to steal you away, he needs to know.  If his habits are ruining your life he needs to know.  If you've exhausted every option in trying to improve the relationship, and you just can't do it anymore, he needs to know. IMPORTANT:  Yeah, he needs to know that leaving the toilet seat up bothers you... but he should be able to discern this kind of issue from an issue that threatens the relationship.  What men refer to as \"nagging\" is treating a relatively minor issue as if its going to bring the whole love affair down.  Positive communication techniques are good for settling issues and making sure he knows which ones are really important.  (use \"I feel like you should...\" or \"It would be nice...\" as opposed to \"You always...\" and \"I hate it when you...\")  Pearl for Practice:  This is something which has made me completely gah-gah for girls, so listen up!  When you have a point to make (like leaving the toilet seat up), tease him about it, or put a bit of humor into it.  Laughing or joking will definately diffuse the tension behind the problem and avoid the dreaded \"nag.\"  Be sure to tell him that you are serious though... the conversation can go something like this: Girl: \"Hey you!  I almost stepped on a cat turd!\" Boy: \"Are you serious? Hhahahahahaha...\" Girl: \"Yeah!  Next time im gonna pick it up and throw it at you!\" Boy: \"Hhahaahah!  Oh man! Why?\" Girl: \"Would it kill ya to clean the kitty litter?\" Boy: \"Hehehehe my bad... \" Girl:  \"Come on... up up... clean it up or no booty for you!\" --- 3.  Keep on Keepin on: (\"This house is gonna last\")  Keep following the above points and make sure your BF is too!  One of the things that ends a relationship is stagnation.  People often can't get over the fact that the honeymoon period is over.   One way to get over this hump is by being the same person you were in the beginning.  You'll remind him just why he dated you in the first place.  If you find yourself bored by him, tell him, and say he can improve by being as fun as he used to be.  (This usually scares a guy straight.)  Never take a lull for the end, unless you've seriously tried to fix it. IMPORTANT: If you find yourself at month 6 or 7, and following the above points isn't a chore, then thats a good sign.  However, I want to make perfectly clear that if you no longer feel that you can \"keep it up\", or that he is not returning the favor, then its time you guys have a talk.   --- 4.  Sex:  (\"This house makes me feel like a MAN!  HOOOAH!\")  Alright, yeah, I saved this one for last.  But its very important.  A man is biologically hardwired to reproduce all the time.  He is constantly looking for an outlet.  At this stage, that outlet is you.  Dont be scared!  Sex doesn't have to be a chore.  Any guy can be a sex god given 2 things: 1) Passion and interest in you.  2) Good sexual communication.  He needs to know what makes you feel good.  Tell him what doesnt do it for you.  Then ask him what makes him feel good.   Talk about sex over dinner or in the car.  Trust me, if there is one thing guys are always going to pay attention to, its sex talk.  If you \"strategize\" in the car on tuesday, I can guarantee you, he'll try those same manuevers wednesday!Basically, never assume hes \"just going to get it.\"   IMPORTANT:  By Sex, I dont mean sexual intercourse (penetration).  Never compromise your sexual ethics when you dont want to!  The guy is always gonna want to score, but if you aren't ready, let him know that if he keeps being a good significant other, the time will come.  Sex is everything from courtship(dancing/flirting), to dating, to making babies!  Sex can be a hot make-out session in kitchen or dancing real slow together.   It can even be a smoldering look or a \"I love you\" from the bottom of your heart.  Keeping the passion in a relationship is often the glue that binds people together.  It helps diffuse tensions and promotes well being for the both of you!  After all, it is the biological reason why people get together! ALSO VERY IMPORTANT:  Many women experience libido loss at some point in a relationship.  This can come from any number of reasons.  (Drug induced, stress related, or psychological / emotional)  Whatever the reason, your partner needs needs to know why.  (Turning him down is often a big blow to his fragile ego)  If you just don't find him attractive anymore or you feel that the relationship cant go on... the guy needs to know.  In this case your libido will come back with the next guy, and he most likely will get a Bally's membership. Otherwise, If you still want to be with him, you should try to identify the cause of this lack of passion.  Pearls for Practice:  Sometimes, your libido has been \"bored\" away.  Somethings to improve your chemistry are so easy and fun, that you'll wonder why you didnt do them before.  For Example: Making out for atleast 12 seconds every day, going out for long walks, working out together, reducing your work load, and getting a good amount of sleep have been found to help women get back into the saddle.   Listen kiddo, Im sure you already knew all these things.  You've most likely just forgotten.   What I've outlined above is actually pretty relative.  A good sense of humor for one guy is totally different for another, the same way guys like girls with different looks.  In the end though, Men are pretty simple. Once you catch their eye, become their good friend(with benefits), respect and care for him, you've cemented a good base for a relationship.   Not everyone is good at all these \"pointers.\"  You have to decide whether or not to work on them.  Whats most important is that you don't have to excell in all of them.  Please don't take this as \"the way you have to be.\" Remember,  you are already somebody's dream girl.   I hope this was helpful.   -A", 10489, "Yl7BApkJaa", 0],

If they don't then i think that you should just move in with your boyfriend and hopefully your family will realize how they are treating you is wrong. Your going to have to move out at some point so you mind as well just do it. My mom was trying to get me and my boyfriend broken up and i was put on lockdown for a looonnngg time!! but my mom realized that no matter what i'm still going to out with him and she realized that how she was treating me was wrong. then we sat down and had a long talk about it. Hopefully, your family will do the same. Good Luck!", 10490, "None", 0],
	117177 : ["I think his families assessment of a pathological liar is correct, and after six years with him I'm sure you can confirm that also. I seriously doubt this other woman doesn't mean anything to him. Why would he keep in contact with her if she doesn't mean anything to him? He's a liar, and a very immature one too. I have doubts that will change. You seem to be a sensible, caring person. You've given your partner more than his fair share of chances to get his act together, and you're getting lies and cheating in return. You deserve more than you're receiving in this relationship....and so do the children. You have two choices #1 Continue in the relationship, which has no chance of ever becoming a happy positive environment for you or your children. #2 Terminate the relationship, and sever all ties with him, only allowing contact for child support and visitation. Your only 36 years old ( just a baby yet! kidding) there is plenty of time to find Mr. Right and get treated with the love, happiness and respect you deserve. You will be an even more loving, affection Mother when your treated that way, and your children deserve that, do it for them to. Good Luck God Bless", 10490, "None", 0],

Such as morals, strong family connections, dedication, and desires. When you look at cars, body types and styles, rims and tires, etc. Some REALLY catch youe eye. Though the female body is by far the best of beauty and art. I will not go into detail on here as that is personal. But I look at everything from head to toe. Each woman is unique and so are our tastes. Thus without saying to much, if I see it I'll know if I like it.But I'll say this, I like slender or athletic, 5'-5'7ish, red,black,blond, or brunette. Long or short hair as looks good either way if it fits them. Dark or light skin.Has to smile often or I will make them. Hee Hee.I know it sounds broad but those are all pieces of that wonderous puzzle that makes up that wonderfully unique individual that can captivate this man.

	117179 : ["This is just my personal opinion: 1. Sexual attraction: this doesn't mean she has to be a super model; she just has to have something that appeals to me sexually. I pride myself in being able to find beauty in unexpected places and reject, although not always successfully, what is consider beautiful today. But it is true that most facets of human behavior revolve around sexuality and most men find an answer to their low self-esteem (all men have it, consciously or unconsciously) in getting an attractive woman to fall for them. In the case of men, all men, love and lust go hand-in-hand. It's really difficult to force someone into a relationship if there are no sexual sparkles. 2. Faithfulness: as unfair as it might sound, most men think we can get away with anything but to try and forgive a female partner for being unfaithful is, I would say, the hardest thing to do. A girlfriend or wife might be flawed in several ways but this thing can mess up ANY relationship. 3. Shared Interests: this doesn't mean the girl has to like everything the guy likes (football, beer, action movies, etc.), it just means they have to have some common ground in which to base the time they spend together. cultural background, education, religious preferences, etc. It all plays a part, big or small, but it counts. 4. Personality and Character: this is where men choose one woman over another if they are pretty much alike, they have to have a personality they know they can like most of the time or endure every once in a while.", 10489, "bUmpbDmzaa", 2],
