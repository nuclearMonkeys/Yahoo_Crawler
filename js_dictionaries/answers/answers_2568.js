	134234 : ["Do not use a prong collar and hurt him.  This is stupid and can cause him to take a stand and openly challenge you for pack leadership!  You have alot of work to do, and you need to start NOW!  Actually, it should have started the day you brought him home.  But anyway, you need to establish that you are the pack leader and he can eat only when you give him permission and only what you want him to eat.  You need to go watch the dog whisperer, he has invaluable advice on doing exactly this.  If it was my own dog, I would start out by setting his food dish in front of me near my feet and as soon as he went for it, say NO! and step in front of it, and then picking it up off of the floor.   Make sure when you say it, you mean it. Dont touch the dog, you can get bitten. Repeat this until your dog finally just gives it up and sits down and looks at you.  Dont let him at the food if he is staring at the dish itself.  He must be looking at YOU, completely focused on you, you must have his full attention.   To further establish control, you can take the dish back without feeding him and just put it somewhere out of his reach.  No, this isnt teasing.  In the wild, pack dogs NEVER eat until the pack leader says they can. And this is something you can keep in mind if you are eating in front of your dogs.  They dont take it personally if you do it.  They will wait for some and if they dont get it, they wont hate you. Same goes for giving one dog a treat and not the other, they dont hold grudges, thats the beauty of dogs!  Anyway, you need to do this exercise with the dish over and over.  You can offer him little tidbits from your hand and only let him take them when you say ok.  After he has begun sitting automatically when you get his dish out, and he will if you stick to your guns, you can start placing the dish on the floor, still telling him no, and play around in the food.  If he starts to get up to come to the dish, give him the big NO and take the dish away. Maybe you can throw a little piece to him, so he still gets it that YOU control the food, and then after you have had \"your fill', tell him ok.   After you feel comfortable with this, go to the next step, which is to take the bowl away from him as he eats.  Having a leash on him might help if youre afraid of getting bit.  When he growls, jerk that leash upright and say NO, make him sit.   If need be, pull him away from the dish and then you take charge of it again.  There are other things I would suggest, but you need to have alot of experience with aggressive dogs or you can get hurt.  All of my Rotties  will let me remove food right from their mouths, or they will spit out their food if I say drop it.  This can save their life.  Another thing...I would take things out of his mouth every chance I get throughout the day.  When he releases things willingly, give him all kinds of praise, but make him sit and wait before he gets it back. And puberty may be some of the cause, in which case, neutering him might help, but I suspect it's more of a power struggle at this point and neutering will only help minimally. He is a Shepherd and they are strongwilled, intelligent dogs.  A happy, well adjusted dog who knows who the leader is, is a great companion to have . I would also strongly suggest obedience training.
