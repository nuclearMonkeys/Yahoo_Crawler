Oh, that you would choose life, that you and your descendants might live!)

That's why it's important for Pagans and non-Pagans alike to help educate people. I am neither a Wiccan nor a Satanist, but I've publicly defended both against senseless accusations. You'd be surprised how many people can't distinguish the difference between theistic Satanism and Wicca (or any other type of Paganism).

Gays don't just want to be left alone to be gay or even married. They want Christians to quit saying homosexuality is wrong. They want to make it into a hate crime for a preacher to preach Romans chapter one in a church.(Romans calls it sin) They want to force us to say that we condone homosexuality or face the possibility of being arrested. I don't hate anyone, gay or otherwise. Sin is sin. They can be forgiven. But, if we lose the freedom to preach and teach the Bible, that will have some terrible ramifications for everyone in America.
