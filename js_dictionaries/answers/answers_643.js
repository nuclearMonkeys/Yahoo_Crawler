	35961 : ["Gonzaga The only way Gonzaga can be beaten is for it to have a really really terrible shooting day and the opponent have the best game of its life.  In other words, it has to defeat itself because no other team can do it.  Gonzaga has four starters each of who will go to the NBA:  Timme, Kispert, Suggs plus one other I can't remember right now.", 5413, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", 1],

	35965 : ["IMO, Tyson never took many big punches, and when he did he was shaken. RE James Buster Douglas who was not a great boxer and was not afraid of Tyson, and KOed Tyson. Answer to your question is Ali, as he would tire Tyson by making him continue to come after him, just as he did with Liston, then bust up his face with jabs and right crosses. I would say  by 6th or 7th round, Tyson would not be able to defend himself any longer; end of fight would be KO or  referee stoppage. ", 5414, "391fb23dafd355005ac7c816295c4b03aa", 0],
	35966 : ["No, from a fitness standpoint boxing is and excellent sport to take up after age 30 as it provides a good workout in a number of areas. Besides promoting stamina and cardo health, boxing also strengthens the core.  That, in turn, helps to prevent a number of ailments associated with the approach of middle age, like back pain and the dreaded \"dad gut.\"  Boxing also promotes balance, timing and coordination, so it is as good a \"workout\" for the brain as it is the body. I've heard of several MLB players, NASCAR drivers and PGA golfers all took up boxing in their mid to late 30s for these exact reasons...keeping the body strong, but lean, and the mind sharp. Actual boxing training is recommended over fitness classes that incorporate \"boxing moves\" because you want to learn good technique.  Simply \"punching the air\" doesn't achieve much and swinging at heavy bags with bad technique can actually lead to injuries. If you intend to enter the ring and compete, that's another story.  But even then, a good boxing trainer will make sure you don't get in over your head.", 5415, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", 1],

	35971 : ["Boxing is killing itself and as a long time fan i hate to see it. MMA generally has 2 major organisations (UFC, Bellator) with minor promotions Generally it's 1 guy calling all the shots in each promotion. The big fights get made. It's clear to see who the champion is. It's easy for the casual fan to understand who is number 1. By having a central organisation, their marketing while flawed is more coordinated, the promotion of fighters is better and there is a clear progression. Also there's limited weight classes so the talent pools are not spread too thin. At the moment across UFC and Bellator, there are a combined 15 male Championships (counting each belt in each weight individually)... With boxing, you have 17 weight classes. 4 \"Major\" with another 3 minor ones all having their world champions. 2 \"Unofficial titles\" that hold weight (The Ring, TBRB). The WBA currently has 3 World Champions in some weights, WBC/IBF have 2. Also must throw in, the WBO once ranked a dead guy for 18 months and actually promoted him in their rankings 12 months after his death, despite not having fought due to being dead and no one around him having lost. Also just google Rocciganni. So just focusing on the major organisations, at the moment we have 97 world championships. And that's just the alphabet bodies. The big fights are harder to make as every promoter wants his piece. The promotion of the fighters is less coordinated so its harder for a fighter to become a big name amongst the casual fans. There's also a lot more people wanting a piece of the fighters purses. Boxing is slowly dying and it's only a matter of time before MMA overtakes it. Unless boxing becomes more organised and less corrupt, MMA will dominate combat sports in the future.", 5416, "TdmTjKt8aa", -1],

	35973 : ["Steph Curry because of how good he makes his teammates and how he completely changed the game.  Draymond Green may get 100 assists this month and he wouldn't do that on any other team.  Wiggens now actually looks like he's playing to his potential, and bench players are left wide open because so much focus is on Curry. ", 5407, "PaB7mWlnaa", 2],

Antichrist's mother is a 12th generation prostitute (according to saint Lavrentiy of Chernigov). According to researcher Grigoriy Klimov, prostitutes = lesbians = witches; so, antichrist's mother is a witch, a lesbian, and a prostitute. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion).

	36004 : ["If you like to watch basketball as a sport then Harden spoils the game. He has no teamwork whatsoever. If however you are more about being entertained by each possession, then watching Harden score through every single frustrated player designated to guard him, will be an exciting thing to watch.  Expect more cringes from Durant's face and head scratches from Irving but the biggest question is how will Nash, a true certified team player, handle it all. Contenders? Definitely! But up to when? Until they bump into another superteam that's more gelled than them? Or until Harden decides to quit again?", 5401, "21112cc7ac2bacc93374e23ada41a67caa", 1],
