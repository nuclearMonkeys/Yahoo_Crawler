Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 7747, "None", 0],

	55655 : ["The easiest way to explain it is also the most misleading way. The first problem is thinking it started as a point - it didn't. It is highly unlikely the universe started as any kind of a singularity. Think of a positively curved universe like a sphere and imagine it being very, very small. Any point on the surface of the sphere is exactly identical to every other point on the surface of the sphere - there is no unique center on the SURFACE of the sphere. As the sphere expands, the observable universe for each point on the sphere is centered at that point. All evidence so far indicates the the universe has zero curvature. A universe with zero curvature is flat and infinite. It started out infinite. Conceptually, that is no different than the above description of a spherical universe. Pick any point on the flat surface. The observable universe for each point on the surface is centered at that point. Even an infinite universe can expand indefinitely since the ‘metric' of the universe is purely internal to the universe. In both case above there is no boundary to the universe.

	55661 : ["Popular Physicist Dr. Michio Kaku, PhD has said that human life and other Earthlife is far too precious to continue to exist on just one planet. We need to be a 2 planet species (or more) in order to ensure our future survival. I agree with this.   I personally believe that the movie, \"Elysium\", starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, is a good representation of Earth's near future. Except that there won't be any huge orbiting habitat, as in the movie. Instead, a high IQ, high tech, high prosperity human society will arise on Mars, while the Earth wallows in squalor. In 100-200 years, humans on Mars will be sending fusion powered Mars built spacecraft to other star systems for the purpose of setting up new colonies of Earth life. By that time, humans will have colonized our entire solar system to a limited degree, and the atmospheres of the gas giant planets will be routinely harvested for obtaining Helium3 by the metric tonne to power our world wide fusion reactors and spacecraft. And Martian water is five times richer in Deuterium, the other necessary fusion fuel.  If we ever want to raise our third world peoples up to a 1st world standard of living, we are going to need lots and lots of energy. Windmills and solar panels simply will not cut it. Controlled thermonuclear fusion power is the only answer in my opinion. Check out the ITER, under construction in the south of France:  I believe that in ~500-1,000 years from now, we humans will have spread to at least 30-50 other star systems. Around that time, all humans will be required to leave Earth, and we will then allow Earth to return to its previously wild state. Bison will again roam the plains of North America, and Aurochs will once again graze the grasslands of Eurasia. I can't wait.  Please read the excellent book, \"The Case for Mars\", by Dr. Robert Zubrin, PhD, available on amazon and other places.
