If you're not, click here for tips on identifying a wireless router:    If you are using a wired connection from your router or modem to the Wii console, you will not need to \"Search for an Access Point.\" Simply choose \"Wired\" as the connection type and try a connection test:  •How far away is your wireless router from your Wii? If the router is a good distance away from the Wii, or if there are many walls and objects in the way, move the router closer to the Wii and try again. •Check the broadcast settings of your router. Wireless routers usually have a feature that allows you to either hide the network's name, or even turn off wireless altogether. You can typically find this information by logging into your router's settings, and looking in the \"Broadcast\" area. For help logging into your router, try Nintendo's wireless router connection information:  If you still cannot find your wireless network, please call 1-877-347-0079 so that Nintendo may assist you further.", 9436, "D1syICpCaa", 0],

	92330 : ["Begin weight lifting. Not to be monster huge but to increase muscle mass.  Also increase your intake of protein in your diet. Don't go for sugary things and fat ladden foods, those will not help in a healthy manner, sure you'll gain weight but it won't be the right kind.  My son was a premie at birth and has always been underweight for his height. Now that he is a teen he eats a very healthy diet and is doing weight lifting and other work outs and eating more protein. Generally fish, chicken, lean beef. He eats peanut butter a lot too, a good source of fat and protein.  Make sure you drink plenty of fluids when working out too and try to keep your fiber intake balanced too or you might end up with digestive issues changing your diet. Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal is what my son uses. He eats a bowl every day.  Before you start though it would be best to talk to your doctor ..since I don't know your medical history. Let them know you want to gain weight/muscle mass in a healthy manner. The doc can advise you and can even monitor you through blood work to make sure you are gaining HEALTHY weight and not what most American's (including myself) are fighting...the unhealthy weight.
