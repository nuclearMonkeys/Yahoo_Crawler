Evolution does exist in concerns of timelines. for this reason, each and each \"cutting-factor\" international grew to become into greater useful than the previous. so some distance as faith is going, it is not important. each faith all of us understand of (different than God's very own) is guy-made. each and each of them have been created for their very own society and for their very own cultures and notwithstanding the \"cutting-factor\" people believed in on the time. sufficient people 'unfold that faith' around and coerced others to connect in - it then grew to grow to be the norm. Conformity grew to become into the main suitable glue that held faith mutually, extraordinarily in the greater primitive days. in case you have an interest in any respect, God's faith is in James a million:27. this is the only one i've got ever properly-known it is clever.

	59485 : ["I read the Bible Unearthed. I actually keep it in my bedroom - I was just referencing it last night. But I'm kind of confused - why would I not remain a Christian after reading it? Help me out here. I have read the Bible Unearthed several times over. What about that book, specifically, should cause me to abandon Christianity? Never mind the other two - what is about that book in particular? As for the Jesus Puzzle, if Earl D. makes such a convincing argument, then why doesn't he publish in peer-reviewed journals? Why didn't a single scholar endorse his theories? Why did so many trained historians reject his work amid a flurry of laughter? Did you bother to research (or even think deeply about) the points raised in the book? Didn't you wonder why no peer-reviewed scholar on planet earth lends even the slightest credence to the whole \"Jesus Myth Hypothesis\"? Case in point. \"Angel\" is apparently convinced that scholars of all religious faiths across the globe are all embroiled in a grand conspiracy to suppress the \"truth\" that Earl D. reveals in his book. Isn't it easier to just accept the fact that the experts know more about their own subject matter?! As for the Bible Unearthed, I can't help but wonder if you got your sources confused. Unlike the other two books (which were written by laymen with no specialized training or expertise in their fields), this one was written by an actual scholar, and represents (for the most part) academic consensus.

The whole point is political not factual because what happened thousands of years ago cannot be proved when the evidence is no longer available. The fact that these epics are narrated by word of mouth by successive generations in India is sufficient proof that the epics belong to India. How come we do not narrate the Trojan war in India?

Religion is an easy way to make a society work without having one person   with more apparent power than another. There is a need for this higher power figure within life, I personally go  with Freud's theory that we are  born with Thanatos  ( Death) and Ethos ( Love) Insticts. We are born with these drives and through oiur fear of death and want for love we find something to protect us. Religion is important it does hold merit in the world, creates a morality structured with threat and  reward  which without parental figures could be lost in someones life. It  prevents loneliness  and creates communities. Some people do  need it others don't is the only way  I can answer this.

	59515 : ["My favorite religion would have to be my own, solitary eclectic Wicca, because I made it my own. It is a compilation of what I have logically assessed to be most likely true in my opinion. The religion I disagree with the most, not necessarily because of my religion, but just in general (besides religious radicalism of any religion), is Christianity. It is built on a belief in \"absolute truth,\" and that if you don't believe in it, you're wrong. It gives (many) Christians a feeling of superiority, and that, if anything, should be a sin. In a way it is, because pride is a sin, and superiority is a feeling of being better than others - if that's not pride I don't know what is.

	59520 : ["Hinduism is generally considered to be the oldest religion still being practiced today. This ancient religion was born when the Aryan peoples migrated to Northern India and first put their religious tradition into writing. The texts they created are the Vedas, which were written around 1,500 B.C.E. (before common era) and have greatly influenced Indian culture ever since.  Several other religions are almost as old as Hinduism. Judaism traces its roots back to the patriarch Abraham, who lived around 1,800 B.C.E. While the Jewish people are descended from Abraham, it was Moses who first recorded the Torah, the Jewish holy text, in 1,400 B.C.E. Most sources consider the date of the Torah as the beginning of Judaism.  Zoroastrianism is sometimes called the world's oldest prophetic religion. It's certainly one of the earliest religions founded by one person. Scholars are not certain when the founding prophet Zarathustra actually lived. Some believe Zarathustra lived in the 6th century B.C.E., while others trace his writings to the 14th or 13th centuries B.C.E.  India has been a veritable cradle for world religions -- in addition to Hinduism, both Jainism and Buddhism originated in India. The first of Jainism's sacred lords, called a Tirthankara, lived in the 8th century B.C.E. The last of these lords was Mahavir, who lived in the 5th century B.C.E. and was a key figure in spreading the religion. The philosophical teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, spread around Asia after his death in 483 B.C.E.  Oddly enough, the two religions that dominate the world today are relative newcomers to the spiritual scene. Christianity began with the teachings of Jesus Christ around 30 C.E., and Islam started in 610 C.E. with the prophet Muhammad's revelation.", 8044, "43f7de5bfb8024d1b1a1e14bafcba3afaa", 2],

If your religion is not popular enough, it is a cult. If a religion used to be popular, but falls out of favor, it becomes a myth.

If you ask me the egg and chicken question i will tell you i believe the Universe is the chicken and everytime it lays another egg is when a star is born.  Makes sense, the universe is expanding too... the cicken is still growing you see! Secular doesn't mean there is no need for belief.  It doesn't even mean the people are not allowed to believe.  It means the organisations that rule the beliefs have no real power in matters of state.  Religion should not have a political influence.   Britain isn't secular.  Church, state and education are intertwined.  The Dutch and Belgians have a word for it.  They call it 'verzuiling', which basically means pillarization or denominational segregration as in this excellent explanation  Within communities belief is important.  Which is why ethnic groups will come together on basis of beliefs.  And the more the countries with non secular governing carry on being religious, the more that those who don't believe the ruling religion will form enclaves of their own.  And the less communities and people will lern to tolerate the other since they will grow up in a seggregated society. I see it everyday at the moment in the playground.  Very few children from immigrants under school age speak english or even understand it.  Which leaves me having to explain the why's of it to my almost 4year old.  She is being made aware of other cultures.  But are those non-english speaking children?  They grow up in a seggregated society.  Wether we like it or not :-(", 8045, "AA10973537", 2],
