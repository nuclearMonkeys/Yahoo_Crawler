	2554 : ["When a pharmaceutical company researches new drugs it takes a long time, costs huge sums of money and only a small percentage of putative medicines that start the process are found to work and make their way into use. A pharmaceutical company makes no income from its medicines until they have been approved and licensed for use. To enable them to recoup their costs and to have the funds for research and development they are usually allowed to patent their drug for a certain length of time. When that time expires they have to make the information on how to manufacture the drug available. There are lots of small pharmaceutical companies that do no research and development but simply manufacture drugs under their generic name that are out of patent. I cannot see the pharmaceutical companies that developed the COVID-19 vaccines simply giving away the drug details so small pharmaceutical companies can produce them cheaply. The companies that developed them are commercial enterprises not charitable organisations. Vaccines could be made more widely available if richer countries and inter-governmental organisations provided funding to purchase vaccines for poorer countries. It is not only the rich West that should be held to account. There is no reason why the governments of many poor countries could not purchase the vaccines from the manufacturers. They receive billions per year in aid from the rich West. The problem is much of this aid never reaches the people but ends up in the pockets of their despotic rulers.", 405, "kz04oBhsaa", 0],

If someone has had a bad reaction to the anesthesia or too much of it, perhaps that may be similar or the same as someone with a type of brain injury, which may be referred to as an \"acquired brain injury\" (abi).  Please, however, do *not* try to provide a self-diagnosis or self-treatment and seek a referral to a board-certified neurologist (M.D. or D.O.) for further evaluation. For those with a slur during speech, *perhaps* a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be able to help.  One may need a 'script from a medical doctor to receive speech-language pathology (SLP) services beforehand though.  For individuals with cognitive issues, such as memory, processing (understanding), attention span and concentration, problem solving and/or sequencing, a SLP *might* also be helpful, too, with providing cognitive therapy.  (It may *not* be a cure-all/panacea though.) Just an fyi that another type of therapist who may administer cognitive therapy for those with cognitive dysfunction is a licensed clinical neuropsychologist (PhD or PsyD).  However, the evaluation of cognitive abilities by a neuropsychologist may take at least five hours, depending upon the individual.", 416, "rSTNUGy3aa", 1],

	2568 : ["A single dose will cause a much higher maximum concentration of the chemical in the blood stream than the same amount spread out over a day.  The main issue with toxicity, like with most things, is mostly one of maximum concentration.  Toxicity does involve two different facets of possible harm.  There is acute toxicity, which is what we are discussing here, and that is simply when the concentration of the chemical exceeds the tolerance of the organ to process it without harm, and actually more than that, involves exceeding the capacity of the organ to prevent harm, so lots of harm happens, fast. Chronic toxicity is the other type of problem, and that arises from slow destruction over time, or repeated minor injury eventually becoming enough to cause organ dysfunction. So, there are two limits that are given for any possible poison: the acute limit, the amount at any given time which has a high risk of serious immediate damage, and the chronic limit, which is the amount that will cause irrepairable damage if maintained for a long time. The 4000 mg per day is a chronic damage limit.  the 1000 per dose is an acute limit.  You should not exceed the acute limit even if it leaves you within the chronic limit for a longer time frame. As with any poison or drug, though, there are no guarantees of harm or not harm.  Just variable intensities of risk.  The more you take, the higher the risk.  Risk is not usually a linear response behavior.  Doubling a dose typically does way more than double the risk.", 417, "WbVE1cXKaa", 0],
