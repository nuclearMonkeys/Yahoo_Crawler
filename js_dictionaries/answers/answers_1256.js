	68375 : ["Here are some things that I have found that help: 1. make sure your razor is clean and fresh. Dull razors, I have found, are the biggest culprit for razor burn, bumps, etc.  Spend a little extra for a nice razor. I love the one my b/f uses and ended up getting one for myself - the FUSION one with 5 blades and uses a battery to help for a smoother shave.  I think anything less than 3-4 blades isn't worth it. 2. Use a good shaving gel - for sensitive skin. The reason you may be having the breakouts is because your skin tends to be sensitive to any soap or other gel you're currently using to shave. 3. I don't exfoliate my skin before I shave. Too harsh. 4. I have started to use TEND SKIN - a topical liquid you apply directly to the razor burn/bumps and ingrown hairs. It can be a bit pricey, but worth it. The other brands I have purchased do not do the trick. This dries fast and clears up the skin quickly.", 8458, "1AV3WJUraa", 3],
