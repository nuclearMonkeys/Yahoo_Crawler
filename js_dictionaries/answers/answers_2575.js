ANd then they start talking about having three litters in less than three years and I start thinking about the dog.  The dogs are, after all, my concern. I think it is the dogs that get to all of us, both breeders and rescuers. The reputable breeders I think have a harder time getting through because the BYB wants to come back and say they just don't like the competition. And no matter what a reputable breeder says, that comes up. I always try and point out that I do not breed, but I do know that those who do it right spend far more than they make. And I also point out that continuing the lineage to the reputable breeder is a passion not a job and that they earn their money in other ways, the breeding is not a job they gain income from. I am not sure if it sinks in or not. But if just one gets it and changes he way they think, then it is worth it.", 11225, "Sl0gZOvuaa", 6],

Personally, I had no idea about breeding, BYBs, health clearances, etc. before I joined a Lab forum after I got my puppy.  Unfortunately, he did come from a BYB.  But I learned from answers there.

First, I would ask, what do you plan to do with the horse? Show? Trail ride?  What style do you intend to ride... Western, saddle-seat or hunt seat? Full service boarding will be the most expensive, costing several hundred dollars a month, depending on the facilities. If you live in an area that gets a lot of bad weather in winter, I would suggest a place with an indoor arena so you don't freeze your hoo-ha off. Personally, I would look for a well broke stock type horse- Quarter Horse, Appy, Paint... at least 10-12 years old, one that's been there done that.  They tend to be calmer, or maybe a nice flat-shod Tennessee Walker... sooo smooth to ride! And there's nothing wrong with a good old grade horse!  I also recommend a gelding rather than a mare,so you don't have to put up with her monthly PMS b*tchiness. If you want more info, you know where to find me. ;-)", 11224, "b46j6rwoaa", 9],

Google for rescues in your area and start volunteering and get back up to speed with horses.  Chances are you will find a horse that you 'click' with there and can move into the adoption stage. In the meantime, take come lessons and brush up on your horsemanship and riding skills. The costs will depend on your area for boarding, hay, feed, vet, farrier, and all that. Expect to pay around $300 per month for partial care board, and budget $75 to $100 for hoof car every six to eight weeks. Feed us usually around $12 per 50 pounds. Then you have worming, once every 3 months, at about $15 a pop. Then grooming instruments, tack, blankets, etc. Budget money and put back monthly for emergency vet calls. If you want to trail ride and/or show figure in a truck and horse trailer and insurance. It gets pricey pretty quick. I'd recommend volunteering first.", 11224, "AA10780748", 3],
