When you try to point out the errors in his teaching, the false prophecies, the lies, and teaching for shameful gain things he ought not to teach; they get mad and falsely accuse you of blaspheming the Holy Spirit (the unpardonable sin). Militant vegans falsely accuse us meat eaters of \"murder\". They seem to want us to have heart attacks, cancer, diabetes, covid, and/or be executed as murderers. They also call us racist because we eat meat and dairy, which has nothing to do with racism. They know it's an inflammatory word, that can destroy someone's reputation. Whether or not militant vegans will admit to it, they are on PETA's bandwagon. If you read in the King James Bible (in 1 Timothy 4:1-6), you will find that the militant vegans have given heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. They speak lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron. They forbid marriage, as instituted by God exclusively between one man and one woman. And they command people to abstain from eating meat. I also want to add something else: It seems like militant veganism is being promoted by both the New Age movement and the LGBT community. If that is indeed the case, then it would be wrong to go vegan. We shouldn't listen to people who are doing things that are an abomination to God, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, and who call evil good and good evil.", 6676, "None", 2],
