DAVE REICHERT (R), WASHINGTON: Well, you know, what I`m worried about is that we continue on with this -- this whole idea that we're going to pay for this bill by taxing people. So, now we're going to tax their health insurance plans. On the House side, we have already passed a bill that taxes families, taxes small businesses, taxes medical devices for seniors and our special-needs community. And then we are also going to fine people and send them to jail. So, the bill just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. Every day that goes by... CAVUTO: I understand, Congressman. BECK: They justify the $1 dollar health care plan by saving, you know, money through some magical fairy money. I don't know how they're going to do it. They don't play by the rules the rest of us have to play by, because they make them up as they go! But if you don't play by their new rules on health care -- oh, here's a new little twist. Have you heard this? You're going to be looking at a fun little stint in jail. MUELLER: We are losing freedom. The Berlin Wall anniversary is just the other day. And these are the kind of policies that used to be imposed on people behind that wall. One problem we're going to have, though, Sean, they're going to have, though, Sean, they're going to have to do something about prisons. They're going to put all these people in jail. It cost $50,000 a year to take care of a prisoner. So they're going to have to do prison reform. HANNITY: That's going to be true. GLENN BECK, November 10, 2009 JUDGE NAPOLITANO (filling in for Beck): Last Saturday, at 11:00 in the evening, the House of Representatives voted by a five-vote margin to have the federal government manage the health care of everyone in America at a cost of over $1 trillion over the next 10 years. For the first time in American history, if this bill becomes law, the Feds will force you to buy insurance you might not want or may not need or cannot afford. If you don't purchase what the government tells you to buy, if you don't do so when they tell you to do it, if you don't buy just what they say is right for you, the government may fine you, prosecute you, and even put you in jail. DICK MORRIS: Well, the fight over the public option is the focus at the moment of the Senate debate and the abortion provision as well. I don't personally much care about either one. I think that the bill, even with the abortion amendment and even without the public option, is plenty injurious itself. That would leave the Medicare cuts, the huge payments by the uninsured. One of the provisions in the Pelosi bill is you actually can go to jail for not having health insurance. It says that if you don't have health insurance, you have to pay a fine of 2.5 percent of your income to the government. And if you don't, you face $250,000 or five years in prison. Can you imagine your prison yard, what are you in for? Murder. I'm in for rape. I didn't have health insurance. GARY B. SMITH, EXEMPLAR CAPITAL: I think it is very practical. Look, Charles, at some of the things we've seen. You don't pay your health insurance taxes, you could go to prison. You are chairman of G.M., we don't like you, you're fired! You know, Wall Street, we gave you money, no   party for you! You know what that sounds like to me? That sounds like Soviet Russia back in the '60s and '70s.

Sometimes, I think the Constitution is what defines our country as the best place to live on earth, or millions would not be trying to get here anyway they could. 3. If Fox was banned all the TV channels may as well have Robert Gibbs reading the daily news, but they would have to destroy the first ammendment entirely to prevent people from talking via phone, internet, newsprint or accessing foreign news services. I watch CNN and MSNBC along with Fox, CBC, CSPAN and BBC, rarely listen to talk radio. Anyone has to be stupid not to remember that MSNBC and CNN were anti-White House the last 8 years and pro-White House since last January, or that disagreeing with or protesting what the last President did the last eight years wa spatriotic, but disagreeing with or protesting the policies of the new President is dangerous, treasonous, unpatriotic and racist. No, it would not make the USA a more peaceful, better place, because without checks and balances things would tip so far left into facisim that rebellion would occur, the polls on the Obamacare proposal should be a warning that the honeymoon is over and that the hope and change most people had last November is not what they hoped for.", 9118, "None", 5],

	83166 : ["First off you have transgender confused with transsexaul. A transgender feels that their gender is a bad fit, but they will usually not have a surgery. If you want to learn about transgender, listen to Eddie izzard. He is a great example, and the only famous transgender person I can think of. He say he feels like \"a lesbian in an man's body.\" So When you say transsexuals aren't \"real\" in a biological sense, you are right. No matter how many surgeries a guy gets he will still be genetically a guy. That doesn't mean someone can't be born the wrong gender. It isn't a fact of manliness though. It isn't about being a little feminine. That's like the \"kids with adhd just needed a good smacking\" mentality. OF course the transsexual thing is a huge factor in relationships. Would you date someone that you know can't have kids? I wouldn't. So yes, while someone who changes their gender isn't really a different gender.

True, you do have a point about how parents should \"buy positive items\" for their kids instead of just letting them watch TV.

If it is, you need to reevaluate. 2) Yes, transgender people choose whatever changes they make. But that is not something people decide on a whim, because they think it would be 'fun.' Most transgender people deal with dysphoria, meaning that they experience a huge amount of pain and distress from their body. Approximately 40% of transgender people attempt or complete suicide. Would you rather people live their lives miserably (or not live their lives at all) just because it makes you uncomfortable? 3) I'm not going to comment on that.  4) Transgender people are hardly accepted by society yet, but aside from that point, there have been transgender people all throughout history. It's just not talked about. Look it up.  5) Nobody needs to know whether someone is transgender any more than one needs to know if you are cisgender.

There are also men who are born with ovaries and as a result they have more estrogen in their body.  It all comes down to hormones and the affect it has on the brain.  If a male was born feeling like a female (or female like a male) then it would be wrong to tell them that what they are going through isn't \"real\".  It's very important to understand that the world is filled with many different kinds of people going through many different kinds of experiences.

This is the difference between gender and sex: sex is what a person is biologically, whereas gender is a social construct created by society. Since transwomen look like women, talk like women, and act like women, most people honestly can't tell the difference unless a transwoman comes out and tells someone she's transsexual. Since she is in all senses female except for having XY chromosomes, she is - at least from a societal point of view - a woman. So while some may disagree, I think of transwomen as women.
