	124836 : ["I saw an answer which said \"You can't learn to act - you either can or you can't\" Now, I am not trying to discredit that persons reasoning, but basically it is false.  Let me explain, We all act. it is through acting how we project ourselves or else others would not know who we are. If you think about it we all are actors. We project emotion, through physical action to define who we are and what we are to those around us, but not at the level to which we can step out of our own life into that of the character we are portraying. That's where training comes in. Professional acting is a trained skill, the same as being an auto mechanice or brain surgeon. As with such, it takes training (which by the way is a never ending journey to refine) It does not matter how old you are, just that your desire to become a professional working actor is greater than the obstacles which every aspiring actor or actress faces along the journey. There will be quite a bit, but it's those obstacles which help us define who we are and what we stand for. believe in yourself and your dream, find a source to which would give you a solid base (through training) and most of all, know that you can achieve anything you put your mind to. www.actingcareerstartup.com This is a link to Tony's site. He's here on Yahoo answers, and more than likely will post an answer to you question, if not, I have given you the link. He has a lot of information on his site as well as links. This should point you in the right direction. I welcome you to the wonderful journey of becoming a working actor. You can do it, I believe in you.", 10807, "khDn2erIaa", 1],

I teach my daughter my values and hopefully she will follow them, even after she is 18.

	124846 : ["The September Watchtower is about to announce “increased light” on the 144,000 – that they have been wrong for about 100 years and that the number is now understood to be symbolic and not literal.  It is suggested they will retain the two-class teaching (heavenly and earthly) and just change the meaning of 144,000.    This will help to resolve the anomaly of the “anointed remnant” increasing in number instead of decreasing. In 1935 there were 52,465 Witnesses who claimed to be part of the “anointed remnant” with a heavenly hope.   In 1936 that number was dramatically reduced after “increased light” on the subject when only 39,225 partook of the bread and wine.  The numbers partaking continued to reduce till 1975 when there were only 10,550 “anointed” Witnesses partaking. 2005 saw the lowest number since 1975 – only 8,524.  And that number should have continued to drop.  But it didn't. In 2018 there were 19,521 claiming to have a heavenly hope – almost 9,000 more since 1975. No doubt, there were even more this year who took the bread and wine at the memorial service.  How timely that the Governing Body have now received “increased light” through Jehovah's spirit to explain the reason why the numbers continue to increase.  After clinging tenaciously to the wrong interpretation for over 100 years Jehovah has now given them clearer understanding. This “increased light” from Jehovah will also help to solve the problem of the Governing Body running out of “anointed” ones who alone are eligible to replace the older members of the Governing Body (as they die off). Theologically, it overcomes the contradiction in their original view that 12 x 12,000 from each tribe is symbolic (they are not literal Jewish male virgins from 12 literal tribes) while maintaining this somehow equals a literal total of 144,000.  Looks like the Governing Body are now being forced to admit that you can't say one part of Revelation is literal while the rest is symbolic.  Wonder when they will be forced to admit they also got 1914 wrong?", 10811, "None", 3],
