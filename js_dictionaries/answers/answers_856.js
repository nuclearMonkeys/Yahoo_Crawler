Put the dog feeds back up. You may want to change the needle, it could of been damaged.  Set the machine to a straight stitch and about a 3 for stitch length. Then with no thread at all in the machine, sew on a piece of paper. How is it sewing.  Is it making any weird noises or heating up?  Are the holes uniform and the same distance apart. If everything is good. Now rewind the bobbin with an even speed.   Put the bobbin in and make sure it has caught on the tension notches. Next thread the upper thread with the pressure foot UP. Thread the needle and pull the thread behind the needle. Keeping the pressure foot UP Hold on to that thread tail and manually turn the the hand wheel and pull up the bobbin thread. Pull both threads behind the needle. Now insert your fabric, lower the pressure foot and hold on to the thread tails for the first few stitches.  Sew a straight stitch.  Sew for a good length.  Does the machine sound good. No heat. Stop, left the pressure foot and pull the fabric back and out. You always want the thread moving behind the needle.   How does the back look? As good as the top?   If not you should seek help from an experienced sewer.  And or take you machine in for a tune up. Which I would of suggested doing when you first got it used off of Craig's list. Free motion embroidery is tricky,  it takes a lot of practice.  A LOT,   It looks like you may have Been sewing too much in one place. I have sewn for 30+ years and have rarely ever had to adjust my tension.  A beginner sewer is going to make many mistakes. You don't know how to fix a problem and can make it worse.   Watch YouTube's.  Take lessons.  Some places will give you a one time lesson on how to use your machine.  How to thread it, wind the bobbin, change the needle, drop the feed dogs, do a satin stitch. Change the width and length, just the basics of your machine.  It can take time.  I would practice just sewing first before you go on to free motion embroidery. Be comfortable with using the machine.  Do a straight stitch and see if you can sew straight, make a good seam. Practice sewing an inside and outside curve.   Do a zig zag stitch. Then a satin stitch.  Be patient.  It takes time. ", 6729, "0WASp0bHaa", 4],

Not trying to discourage you, just stating fact.  Art is a luxury for a majority of people, especially now, with businesses struggling to survive and many people not working.  Art requires extra money people don't have.  You can find art all over eBay and Etsy that sells for far less than the cost of materials an artist put into it, never mind their time and talent. You need to somehow find what people want and will buy and concentrate on that, and for many artists, doing that turns their stomachs, it feels like selling out, they want to make the art that THEY want to make. So many of them work doing other things to pay the bills while they make the art that pleases them, and some of them find a market and some of them don't... Some artists will take part in artists' workshops, where they get to know other artists, and they can collectively spread the word about what they're doing.  Try that. Join some local artists' groups. Start networking.  Networking works in other field of work.", 6721, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 4],

One day i noticed it was looking really dry and i remembered i didnt use coconut oil for awhile. My hair is fine and it lacks protein so the oil helps when i do use it. I always wash my hair twice afterwards because its pretty heavy for my hair. If you have fine hair that takes well to protein treatments coconut oil would be good once every other week to deep conditon your hair. If not then DO NOT use it hair that doesn't respond well to protein will end up dry, brittle, and it will not look good. Coconut oil is one of those remedies that's very all or nothing it either works really well or it just goes horribly wrong.
