If Trum is the Republican nominee and loses then there's going to be a lot of \"I told you so\" going on from the Republican establishment.  This will be especially true if he loses badly, as currently polling shows is likely to happen.  A Trump loss would seem to confirm all the negative things they've said about Trump and how his angry rhetoric and lack of commitment to conservative ideals would hurt him in the election.  The question is whether or not Trump supporters would hear that message and internalize it.  Would they recognize that Trump was a flawed candidate and that his style of politics doesn't work, or would thy feel that he was robbed somehow and try and stick with that line of politics.", 8277, "None", 0],

Not only would this make her emails unavailable for public scrutiny, but it allows the former First Lady to pick and choose what emails she releases to us ‚Äì if any.  So essentially‚Ä¶ Chinese and Russian hackers are probably fully aware of Hillary's activities as Secretary of State, while we the people are not. But Hillary's record for honesty and ethical behavior has always been less than impeccable.  Let's take a walk down memory lane with 7 of Hillary's biggest lies‚Ä¶ 1.  Chelsea Clinton was jogging around the World Trade Center on 9/11.  Immensely insensitive to those who actually were affected by this horrific attack, Hillary later admitted that Chelsea was actually safely in her Union Square apartment at the time of the attack.", 8280, "l4yjKPIVaa", 0],

Well, sweetie, as a college professor, I don't think everyone and his brother requires access to ANYONE's college records, barring a serious disciplinary issue.  This isn't a \"liberal vs. conservative\" issue, it's a simple matter of privacy and decorum.  Given the truly hysterical conservative efforts to make something horribly negative out of Michelle Obama's really quite ordinary senior thesis at Princeton -- something written when she was only 21 years old -- I can't imagine why anyone thinks we should all be excoriated for whatever the hell it was we thought or did between the ages of 18-22. I've spent years, decades, associated with major universities -- including Ivy schools -- and teaching college students.  I doubt you have. I know how minds develop, where they start and where they may end, over the course of many years.  It's simply ludicrous for anyone to say, \"Oh, he earned this grade when he was 19!  And that means this!\"  Or, \"HE wrote this in his thesis at 21! and that means this!!!\" Are you  really that stupid?  Where did YOU attend college, and on what did YOU write your thesis?

If politicians would quit jacking with them and trying to change them to suit themselves with every other admin so they can have funds to pay for their own agendas, those programs would work fine. They don't even give them a chance to find out where the problems are they just keep making major changes every few years which makes it impossible to assess where the major problems are. as far as oil is concerned, oil profits are in conflict with the success of small business where 70% of American labor resides. It is also in conflict with national security, when that much of a nation depends on it. I'm not saying nationalizing is the correct idea, but something needs to be done better than it is now.
