	36666 : ["Wow, I can't believe these people. But it's typical. Sweetheart, there is someone in your life who is making you feel like that. It can be anyone. The most likely culprit is your parents or siblings. But it is possible to be a boyfriend. Or even a so-called friend. You might not even know they are doing it. It's called love bombing. First, they shower you with love or gifts.  Then they insult you. Then shower you again. It's a vicious cycle. Look up narcissistic victim syndrome. ( not a true medical diagnosis. But can be helpful in identifying your symptoms) If the symptoms fit. Then read everything you can about narcissism and try to figure out who it is. Get them out of your life and eventually, you will return to normal. But it takes about two years. Even then you will need to be diligent in your recovery.Good luck sweetie, I wish you a fast recovery.", 5495, "qnTNBzNMaa", 3],

No 24 hour laundrymats around you? Clothes do not normally shrink unless they are tossed in a hot dryer or washed in hot water. If they do, just tell her she is getting fat and needs to go on a diet!

	36678 : ["The founders put the Second Amendment in there to ensure their posterity would not suffer the same fate as those who did not have the ability to hold the government in check. From the Declaration:  \"That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive to these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. \" You cannot institute new government if you are not more powerful than the old government. Ask \"The Duck\" about the battle of Athens Tenn. If your government is full of corrupt bastards then you really need the guns for them to hold the people in awe. Get the book:  That Every Man Be Armed. Many others but start here.  There was a reason a peasant could not have a bow in England. There is a reason the Barons were able to \"Take King John to Runnymede\", in 2115, they were more powerful and were able to force him to agree to the terms. In every country that has take the guns from the people there has been  genocide within a generation. The question is not why do you want the guns, the question is which group in America will be eliminated first. We will not see one genocide here, we will see several as there are 9 distinct groups in America. Never have this many groups lived in the same land before ins such relative peace.  And it is because we are armed to the teeth. The most violence occurs where the guns are the fewest and most restricted. John Calvin said: “When God wants to judge a nation, He gives them wicked rulers.” We have the wicked rulers and you will see the path we have been on for quite a while in Isaiah 19. When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn arrived in America after being exiled from the Soviet Union the press asked him “How did things get so bad?” “Because” he said, “We forgot God”. You cannot, and never will be Safe and Free. As Jefferson said, and I paraphrase: I would rather be exposed to the hazards or too much Liberty, than the hazards arising from too little.

	36691 : ["You sound pretty rational to me. I think it could br triggered from super depressive episodes. Or high stress or traumatic something. I mean... Could just be anxiety and over reacging and thinking. OCD people ive heard have obseive thoughts they cant control. That be my guess. You are just overly high with anxiety and stress.

Can you contact your doctor through a patient portal? Otherwise, you will need to wait until tomorrow morning.  One day won't kill you. In the meantime, take ibuprofen for the inflammation. Do NOT drink any acidic juices, like cranberry.  They won't cure the UTI and their acidic quality will just increase your discomfort. Drink plain water only. Probiotics will not cure a UTI either.", 5489, "swkDtnCjaa", 2],
	36698 : ["This is a common problem for homeowners who do not want to pay for a professional cleaning. Most SPRAY water into the coils to clean them but what they are doing is forcing the dirt deeper into the coils where not even a professional can get it out. Additionally, dirt is also where you cannot SEE it. Especially the drain from the front to the back. If it gets clogged, water spills out the front when running.
