If treatment is not possible then answering 'No' to any of those questions means there is no blame in having the dog put to sleep. Next, ask yourself if it was yourself in your dog's situation, would you actually wish to continue living? Better a day too soon than a day of misery too late.

	102677 : ["Here's What I Know About Mutual Funds!  (I'm only 16 so I hope I can be some help but here is what I know for fact.) Mutual funds are investments that pool the money of many investors and place it in stocks, bonds, and other holdings.  Mutual funds are the most common investment vehicle for individuals because they don't require a lot of money to get started. They carry some other advantages as well. When you put your money into a mutual fund, you're throwing your money into a pot with another couple hundred million dollars or so.  A portfolio manager and a team of researchers are responsible for finding the best places in which to invest the money. While a portfolio is a group of investments assembled to meet an investment goal, a portfolio manager is someone who is paid to supervise the investment decisions of others. The managers get paid for their services from a fee within the fund, usually a percentage of the value of the fund. Although you don't see this fee, you should remember that it exists. The terms “portfolio manager” and “money manager” are used interchangeably. Both handle the management of a portfolio, be it for individuals or for a mutual fund. They are paid a percentage of the assets under management. In addition to the portfolio manager's fee, there are several other fees you need to be aware of when deciding which mutual fund is right for you: 1. No-load mutual funds let you avoid paying a sales commission on your transactions. No-load funds are shown by advisers who receive compensation otherwise, often by an hourly rate. The companies that offer no-load funds have toll-free phone numbers that you can call for recommendations of what funds to buy. 2. Load mutual funds pay sales commissions to a broker, financial adviser, insurance consultant, and so on. The load, or a portion of it, is paid to the adviser who recommends the mutual fund to you. If your mutual fund has a load, know how much it is and how you pay it. Fund loads/fees should be reviewed by the salesperson and stated in the prospectus (paperwork) sent from the company. Load funds have front-end loads, deferred sales charges, or back end loans: 2A. Front-end loads are fees paid up front. 2B. A deferred sales charge permits the load to be postponed, and it gradually declines over a period of years until the sales charge is 0. 2C. A back-end load means you pay a set fee upon the sale of the mutual fund. Mutual funds can offer you some great advantages: 1.Money can be taken directly from your bank account each month and transferred into a mutual fund. This makes investing nearly painless. 2.Mutual funds can offer “diversification”. (Diversification is investing your money in different securities in different industries hoping to protect your investment against one or more companies undergoing financial disaster.) If you are “diversified”, and one or more of your investments hits a slump, then you can rely on your other investments to boost your total portfolio. You could, for instance, divide your money among three or four different types of stock funds, ensuring that you'd always have some money invested in a profitable area of the market. Part of diversification is also investing in bonds, as well as different types of stocks. It can be difficult for you to plan that diversification on your own, which is why people look to mutual funds to diversify their portfolios. 3.It doesn't cost much out-of-pocket to buy mutual fund shares. If you purchase a no-load fund, you do not pay a sales charge buy the fund. “Brokerage” for the investments within the mutual. Fund, or the cost of buying or selling shares of the stocks or bonds, are generally far lower than standard brokerage, because the fund managers buy or sell so many shares of a security at one time and buy and sell frequently. Having this power enables them to negotiate traders for a lot less money than you could on your own. Many people assume that mutual funds do not pay to trade securities, but that's a false assumption. Fees occur whenever a security is traded; although the fees are usually lower inside a fund, due to the large number of shares traded. 4.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the records and expenses of all mutual funds. 5.You can direct almost any amount of money to where you want it. If you're into a mutual fund for the long haul, you can direct your money to funds that invest more heavily in stocks instead of directing your money to the more conservative bond funds. If you're looking for mutual funds that don't require a lot of money to open or to be contributed to each mouth, consider the following options. They all were given high ratings by “Morningstar Mutual Funds”, a newsletter published twice a month by Morningstar, Inc. in Chicago: American Funds: 1-800-421-0180     www.americanfunds.com Fidelity Funds: 1-800-Fidelity            www.fidelity.com Oakmark Funds:1-800-Oakmark        www.oakmark.com T. Rowe Price: 1-800-638-5660          www.troweprice.com Vanguard: 1-877-662-7447                 www.vanguard.com One final advantage of mutual funds is that they carry almost no risk of going bankrupt. Due to diversification within a fund, a mutual fund is very unlikely to lose its entire value. Take a careful look at mutual funds as you begin to think about investing your money. They're a great place to start investing and are an excellent vehicle in which your money can grow. If you decide mutual funds are not for you, you can always invest in real estate (if you are wanting long-term investing). You can invest in stocks or bonds also. Go to your nearest book store and purchase “The Complete Idiot's Guid To Personal Finance in Your 20s and 30s Third Edition”. It has helped me understand everything about personal finance.

	102678 : ["A mutual fund is a basket of stocks, bonds, options, or commodities that spreads your risk around so that you don't lose all your money on one particular investment vehicle. The money is pooled together and a firm runs the fund.  The upsides are that you don't have just one stock that will break you. So diversification and professional management are your positives. The downside is that mutual funds are sorta slow to make money from. They go up very little over the year in my opinion. If you do want a fund, make sure it is a NO LOAD fund. Another downside is that if a mutual fund goes down in a year, it takes so much time for it to turn around and actually make you money.  Check out the Vice Fund (VICEX). They invest in companies that sell vices, such as cigaretts, gambling, alcohol.  An easier investment would be a Certificate of Deposit (CD) from a bank. They yield 6% a year right now.

Though there is also some physical achievements you can gain from martial arts it is way more than just learning how to punch or kick or keep your balance so you don't fall.

The Nay SEALS are an Elite Special Forces team, but in order to become part of that team, they go through something called 'Hell Week'. Hell week is 5 days straight of no sleep and constant physical, demanding exercises to do, along with severe mental and physical punishment. They are ALWAYS cold, sandy and wet. A SEAL training class might have 120+ people to start, and dwindle down to 10-15 at the end.  Most people quit the training during Hell Week. The advice given to the trainees is this:  Take one evolution (exercise) at a time; take one day at a time.  When the SEAL trainees start thinking about the future, or the days ahead during Hell Week, they start to second guess themselves.  They think to themselves 'There is no way I can keep this up.  Five more days of freezing, being wet and no sleep?  I am gonna quit this'. You see, you need to take one day at a time.  You need to take one activity during your day at a time, and not think too much about what is happening to yourself. You dn't want to break down mentally, or worse.  SEAL trainees, when they quit, they go back to the regular Navy, but with you, if you end your life, thats it.  Its eternal. Navy SEALS who look back say to themselves \"Hell Week was the hardest thing in the world for me, but I got through it; I saw it to the end' Take it one step at a time, one day at a time.  Whether it's finding a job you like or a place to comfortably live, surround yourself with positive people.  Com online more often and talk with people; get your mind off your troubles. I also recommend reading the book, 'The Shack'. A man loses everything to him, but what he does....just read it and you will enjoy it.  I know I did. Stay positive and focused.  You cannot change what other people think of you or how the world reacts to you.  You can, however, change how you react and perceive the world. You are going through your own Hell Week (although for a much much longer period obviously) but you need to take it one step at a time. No mater what your goals are, if you do it one step, one evolution at a time, you will get to the end of your hell week, and look back and say 'yeah, I was in a bad place.....but I made it.....I survived'", 9816, "None", 0],
