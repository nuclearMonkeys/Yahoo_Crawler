But after the first week, i realized there wasnt really anything to be nervous about. The teachers are all helpful in directing you where your classes are. And usually you get your schedule the day you register for school (which is usually a week or so prior to the first day) so kind of map out where all your classes are so your not lost your first day. And stay by friends if you can too. At least you wont be the only nervous one then.(: Good luck(:", 10804, "kd4CwLTIaa", 0],
	124718 : ["these are tips that i've been giving freshmen lately... TIPS: - don't be scared/nervous/worried... high school is not that big of a deal - get a map of the school so you don't get lost... but don't walk around the school with it in front of your face - don't ask upperclassmen for help if you're lost (ask a teacher or friend) unless they look nice cuz they might point you in the wrong direction - don't stop in the middle of the hallways - join clubs/sports... trust me it's an easy way to make friends and it looks good on college applications - don't run to lunch - don't be intimidated by upperclassmen - don't tell your boyfriend you 'love' him in the same week you started dating him. - on the first day don't wear you hollister shirt, hollister pants, hollister flipflops, and carrying your hollister bag... you will have freshman written all over you and don't wear too much makeup/accesories... just wear something simple but cute :) and honestly nobody gives a crap about what you wear - it is possible to fall UP the stairs... lol. but if this (or something like this) does happen don't be embarrassed... just laugh at yourself and walk away cuz its no big deal - please don't be an immature freshman - make good grades (don't screw it up freshman year cuz you WILL regret it) - don't come to school on the first day with your huge backpack full of colored pencils, glue sticks, tissue boxes... you don't need all that crap you're in high school now. all you need for the first day is paper, pencils, and a folder - there is no pool on top of the school - if someone offers you an elevator pass.... don't buy it!!! - don't be the annoying kid who always cracks immature jokes in class. teachers hate that. always be nice to the teachers cuz one day when you are a senior they will help you write college reccomendation letters and you will be glad that you behaved in their class. - don't decorate your locker (nobody at my school decorates them)  - don't start talking to random uppperclassmen like they are your best friend - don't talk about your UPPERCLASSMEN friends cuz you can tell someone is a freshman when they say \"my SENIOR friend..... blah blah blah\" it doesn't matter what grade they are in! all of your friends are PEOPLE. - don't talk about how \"cool\" you think you are cuz your finally in high school - most upperclassmen have other things to worry about and they could care less about freshmen.... if people do pick on you they will most likely be sophomores: they think they have the right to pick on you cuz they're not freshman anymore..... but i think if a sophomore picks on you that is pathetic cuz they are only a year older than you. - be prepared for freshman friday!!!! nahhh i'm just kidding it doesn't exist.... and any rumors you hear are all FAKE! nothing scary happens... and high school is nothing like the movies. good luck :) class of 2010!", 10804, "None", 0],

Do start with social groups or even attending the social places. If there is any social functions ask people you intend to befriend if they will attend and if they yes then accompany them.

Most people change once they are out of high school...some move to different states for college, some start a new job, and others even start families, but in some way or another, everyone is starting something fresh and new. This most likely means, their old life...well, it's out of the picture. If you have friends from high school that still keep in contact with you and are willing to hang out with you, then I would treasure those friends, but if you're getting blown off by people you haven't seen in years, then I'd say MOVE ON. They are obviously doing their own thing now, and what you had in high school, well, that's old news. And you too, should leave it at that. Why put in the effort if they won't? It's not worth your time. Try meeting new friends, or just love the ones you have now, and thrive on the fact you actually DO have friends. It's natural to not want change, but the change has already happened, so make the best of it. And trust me, once you get married and have children, those \"friends\" you went to high school with won't even matter...you'll be so tied up in your own life, the only thought you will ever have them is old high school stories you share with your family. So, don't be sad, or dissapointed, be happy that you had a good time and enjoy your life how it is now. And just one more thing...life isn't a popularity contest...

When you see people that you'd like to be friends with, compliment them on something.

I don't invite all the other people to be with me because they are harping about the world or some other thing when I am not able to get out much and I want to have a good time or I want to go to the library when they want to go shopping .

That is the best way I can tell you to do things. But do make a special time for them, an hour that you devote to only them, each of them. It is a pain in the patooty sometimes, but it is worth it in the long run. It allows them to feel special and it lets you off the hook. Make a special day just for the other friends.

	124745 : ["I just got past freshman year and here are some tips to help you when high school starts: 1. Learn to love studying- It's rough, but you will get a billion study guides and you have to do them all or you will get a really bad grade 2. Take High School more serious than any other school you have been to in the past- Colleges do not look at elementary school grades and hardly middle school grades. Make sure you get the best high school grades!! 3. Challenge Yourself- College look at two things: After school activities and how much you challenged yourself.  4. If you have a question or you don't get it then ask the teacher- If your lucky then your teacher can stay after school, but about less than half do, so make sure you ask questions when in class. 5. Go to bed as early as possible- I went to bed at like 7:30 on school nights because I was tired and had wrestling afterwards. If you can then try to go to bed around 9:00 or 8:30 6. Make less friends- I know it sounds weird, but you have to tone down how open you are with people. Try to have at least 3 or 5 close friends. They can hurt you with school by wanting to hang out, but you could probably have homework or have a big test tomorrow. Make sure you can trust them too. 7. Be respectful to your teachers- If a teacher asks you do to something then do it. Treat them like you are interested in learning and you want to grow smarter. Try listening. Always have your head up. Most people in my school to this: sleep, eat, fail. 8. Be organized- Take good notes, read them over, if a teacher asks for a paper- have it done or with you.", 10804, "j7kdn0JAaa", 2],
