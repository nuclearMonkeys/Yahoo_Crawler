The reason is because Windows phones 7.x for instance will \"Tombstone\" a program that is not in the active window. This means that with the exception of a save state and with the lastest 7.8 updates a few minor API's the program is not running in the background. Its frozen.   The additional icons on the \"Home screen\" have very deep hooks into the OS that allow for them to query for status (emails/text messages received) without having to fully run the program.  This can either be thought of as a limitation or an advantage for the OS, as it saves battery life however, greatly impedes \"True Multitasking\".  As far as the antivirus is concerned. There is no antivirus for windows Phones. And that is not due to superior programming either. That is because there not enough windows phones out there to make it worth the investment of time to a hacker.

I have saw animals use reason many times. Actually I would put animal nature up against human nature ANY DAY ...with the animals winning the contest!!! They don't abuse their children, or do anything that is considered 'out of nature' as was given them by God. And even when they as pets are owned by abusive people, they STILL at the sound of a 'moment of kind voice' will come and cuddle and LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.  The difference comes from our inherent DIFFERENCE between having human nature or animal nature and having GODLY NATURE...the part of us that lives within our mental abilities, spiritual abilities and OUR SOUL. The difference is the fact God made us to RISE ABOVE the level of human nature which is essentially evil, to ANOTHER LEVEL...GOD'S LEVEL. So as animals do their instinctive deed of procreating however it is for their species, WE on the other hand are EXPECTED to rise above that level and create a 'family' of God type love. WE...are expected to have Godly control over our actions.  So it is in our 'Godly nature' that we must RISE ABOVE the level of animals or even 'humanity' as we know it today!
