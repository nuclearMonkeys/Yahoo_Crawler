Towers DO go down, as in my town the towers went down and all cellphones went offline for almost a entire day.  Landline in 2020 is actually VOIP that goes through your cable companies private servers. The modem you get from your cable company has a jack adapter on the back of the modem that mimics the analog POTS phone system. The jack on the modem plugs into your wall jack dispersing landline service throughout the home.  Your calls are all VOIP, though the jack on the modem disperses a landline tone, tricking you to think it is actually traditional landline.  Your cable companies VOIP is usually superior to internet landline, as faxing isn't an issue.

Properly done comparative tests and measurements can give a good guide to how well something will work, but it's not a total absolute as everyone has a different idea of how a piece of music should sound. Tastes vary & eg. some people think such as recording hiss or synthetic \"ambience\" effects somehow add authenticity. However, any company that does not provide proper specifications using standard units for audio equipment they sell, should be avoided like the plague - the only reason not to provide specs is because they show how bad something really is. One or two big-name home hifi makers come to mind.. Cables for analog audio can work very differently, depending on their construction. That does not mean they have to be expensive, just properly made - and the equipment they are being used with properly configured to avoid ground loops and stray pickup. The \"hype\" features and claims on expensive cables are usually meaningless waffle, or things that any reasonable cable complies with, like it being oxygen-free copper. For digital interconnects, cables either work or do not; there is no subtle degradation  with digital audio and any cable that complies with whatever frequency and impedance requirements some connection needs will work exactly the same, whether it costs a trivial amount or thousands. The simple fact is that recording studios do not use stupidly expensive cable, or the cheapest lowest-quality versions. Professional grade audio cables cost typically 30p a metre for fixed installation types or about a pound a metre for heavy duty flexible trailing leads like for mic cables or guitar leads. In functional terms you cannot get better than the types typically used; silly priced ones just have gimmicks and hype to con people in to playing stupid amounts. Multipair snakes for such as mixing consoles are obviously more expensive, but are equivalent to many separate cables in one overall sheath.
