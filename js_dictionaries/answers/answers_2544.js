He's said that he's not dating any of his female team members (or former team members). I saw him Tweet on Twitter about a year or so ago about something his girlfriend was doing, but that's the last I ever saw/heard him mention a girlfriend.  I think he's one who prefers to keep his romantic life private, which is perfectly understandable.  And not only him, giving out the name of his girlfriend, if he still has one, would cause her a lot of attention and possibly jealous fans harassing her - so I'm gonna say, this is an answer you're not going to find.

I can hit a target from a mile away with a .50 cal, and drive a 'dozer/back hoe. Sometimes you have to sleep on a hill for days, to take out a target, and then you can start building stuff.
