You are now old enough to start investigating religion for yourself.  Don't let it be a purely emotional reaction or a need for company but a sincere desire to learn about the true God.   You say \"you left\" but you didn't really; your parents left and you being just a child, had to of course go with them.  Now you are older and old enough to make some decisions for yourself.  Ask your parents  (I can't tell from your answer if you are still at home) if you can have a bible study with Jehovah's Witnesses to find out more about the teachings and requirements.  If they refuse, you can learn so much online.  There is even the online study aid WHAT DOES THE BIBLE REALLY TEACH  When you are free to do so, you can attend meetings and see if this lifecourse is for you.  It's not an easy life but its the more rewarding.  And yes, we'll all be there, this great big family to welcome you back with open arms. Agap√© Sunshine", 10680, "Y8rvG7auaa", 0],

	122063 : ["Really hard to make a storyline with The Undertaker at the moment... If anything, this is what could happen. I think he should face Shawn Michaels, and the two begin to feud as of the Royal Rumble, yet have no match until WrestleMania 25. In the meantime, the two are on separate shows with their own feuds (Undertaker beats Big Show at RR, and HBK beats Jericho, but doesn't win the title).  Then, the two face each other, possibly crossing paths in the actual Royal Rumble match, and HBK and Undertaker eliminate each other. HBK begins to talk about how he is one of the best to ever do it and challenges The Undertaker to put up his WrestleMania streak against him, reminiscing on their past encounters, including the Hell in a Cell and HBK even mentions beating Flair's streak. Maybe at No Way Out, the two choose an opponent for each other to face: Undertaker faces someone off RAW, and HBK faces someone off of SmackDown (Maybe HBK faces HHH, and Undertaker faces Batista or John Cena). The week before WM, the two confront each other and begin to brawl, which leads to their WM match. HBK looks to be winning the match, as he hits Sweet Chin Music. However, Undertaker kicks out. HBK is shocked and decides to go for a Moonsault. HBK gets caught and Undertaker Tombstone Slams him. Undertaker wins the match, poses in the ring as HBK is led out by the asisstance of the referees, and then the lights go out as the fog picks up in the arena. The Undertaker then disappears into the abyss, leaving the fans on a cliffhanger, wondering where he is. **starred**", 10678, "None", 10],

Option A (Taker LOSING at WM)- Have he and Shawn Micheals start a storyline from about the End of Survivor Series leading up to Wrestlemania, only teasing encounters up to that point. LET PEOPLE KNOW IN ADVANCE that this will be Taker's match regardless of the outcome and have HBK put him away with two, maybe even three Superkicks.  HBK wins, he and the undertaker shake hands, and you can let undertaker leave with all the bells and whistles he deserves. Option B: (Undertaker WINNING) You can have either Randy Orton or John Cena for this storyline. Have one of them win the WWE/WHC title at Royal Rumble and have the Undertaker win the Royal Rumble a final time. If Orton is your choice, you can use all the underhanded heel tactics and sneaky mind games you want. If it's Cena, build it up as a sort of \"passing of the torch\" match between the two. At Wrestlemania, have Undertaker beat one of them in a VERY close match. Like Donovan said above, perhaps have him disappear in some sort of way  from the ring, leaving the WWE/WHC championship behind. Then over the Announce system you can hear him utter something cryptic like. \"My time here has come to an end.....I can FINALLY....REST....IN.....PEACE\".

But I have to agree with what others have shared with you.  The Bible points us to a Person for salvation, not to an organization.  There are so many religions that all claim to be the only true religion, but the Bible points us to Jesus Christ.  He is the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6).  Salvation is found in Him alone. I pray that you will listen to others on this thread who have pointed you to Jesus and not toward a religion.  I agree with those who have suggested that you read the book of John.  Ask God to speak to you as you read His Word and to teach you about Himself and His Son.

HBK even no sells the deadman's mind games leading up to Wrestlemania..making it seem that much more of an intense encounter at Wrestlemania.  The match would be a casket match, loser has to retire. At the match, it would be a classic encounter where both wrestlers counter each other's every move..seemingly that both wrestlers will not want to retire whatsoever. Near the end of the match, Undertaker seems like he's about to win, after tombstoning HBK and is rolling him towards the casket. The lights go out and you hear Paul Bearers voice over the loud speaker..lights come back on and he's right next to the casket with the infamous urn.  Undertaker starts to go out the ring, but Paul Bearer drops the urn into the casket. Undertaker stands there in shock, turns around and gets Sweet Chin Music. He collapses to the ground and just doesn't move at all. Paul Bearer is screaming \"yes, yesss\", in his creepy voice..HBK just drops to the floor, obviously still feeling the effects of the tombstone. Nothing happens for a while and Undertaker just doesn't move whatsoever. HBK struggles up..goes over to Taker who hasn't moved a finger...and HBK rolls Taker into the casket with the urn in it..and he falls to the canvas before closing the lid and Paul Bearer closes the lid...Druids come out and start rolling the casket to the back but leave it at the top of the ramp on the stage area. The lights go out...and in a pitch black arena the casket bursts into flames on its own..then you hear the Undertaker's voice on the loudspeakers saying \"I will, Rest In Peace.\" Then they play a tribute to the Undertaker on the Titantron from his days in WCCW all the way until the casket burst into flames on it's own.

	122073 : ["It's hard, ok. But I'll start with this: At Wrestlemania 27, The Undertaker, now in RAW roster, defeated Vladimir Kozlov in an Interpromotional Match to make his streak 19-0 (17-0 : VS Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania 25 for The World Heavyweight Championship and 18-0 VS Cena and Y2J in a Triple Threat match for WHC). He continued his feud with Kozlov when Kozlov was traded to RAW after Judgment Day, ended in Hell In A Cell at Great American Bash. Undertaker takes one month off, and return at Unforgiven to face the World Heavyweight Champion by that time (say, it's Cena). During their match at Unforgiven, Masked Kane interrupted, and cost Undertaker the title. The following RAW, Kane explained that his hatred against The Undertaker has never been forgotten. He only waited the the right time to do the job, and then he challenged The Undertaker at No Mercy, where Kane managed to defeat The Undertaker, and takes his urn. The following RAW, Kane brings out Undertaker's urn, and tell the audience that this urn holds The Undertaker life, that's why he can't be destroyed for more than 2 decades. Kane then proceeds to burn the Urn, destroying any chance for The Undertaker to return after this. This lead to a Casket match at Survivor Series, and The Undertaker lost. Kane claims that the Undertaker is now gone for good. But, during a championship match at Royal Rumble, The Undertaker comes back and cost Kane the title. The following RAW, Undertaker returns to explain, while it's true that his urn hold his life and now he will be vanished from this world in _ days (how many days left until Wrestlemania 28, for example 60 days or 65 days), he won't go without bringing Kane with him. And then, he challenged Kane for a Buried Alive match at Wrestlemania 28, to finish Kane long lasting hatred once and for all, for eternity, by saying that he created Kane, and now he will destroy Kane. The weeks leading to Wrestlemania 28, Undertaker and Kane taunt each other. At Wrestlemania 28, they fight as hard as they can, entertaining the fans for one last time, by giving it all they have.  The match ended after Undertaker managed to Tombstone Kane near the grave, and threw him in. Making his streak 20-0, and ending Kane for eternity. The druids come out from the entrance holding torches, and The Undertaker does one final stance at the ring. Then, The Undertaker walks through the torches. He does one final look back to the fans, before vanishing into the darkness, never to be seen again.", 10678, "None", 2],

If you find that that moisturisers make you oily, have you looked into oil-free moisturisers? Neutrogena has a decent one. I would also recommend Good Things Miracle Mattifier Moisturiser.

	122098 : ["I have a horrible fear of spiders too. Luckily I live somewhere where there aren't many big spiders, but when I was staying in a cabin in Costa Rica I lacked a lot of sleep because of the spiders. I'd see them and not be able to sleep until I killed them, and I would take so long to kill them because I'd have to spend time working up the courage to go near them. While there, I once opened my door to go outside and on the doorframe I saw a spider which looked a bit like a terantula but I swear it was about 6 inches in diameter. I slammed the door shut and my mind was going crazy and I felt like I'd nearly have a pannic attack. That was probably one of the scariest moments in my life. The fear of spiders doesn't make sense, but it happens. I really don't have advice. But one thing I did which helped was, before sleeping, move the bed away from any walls so that spiders won't likely crawl onto it. The legs at the bottoms of most beds are thin and spiders won't be likely to get onto them. Then, check all of your sheets and under pillows to make sure the spider isn't in your bed. Then you can sleep without much worry. If I lived somewhere where I was likely to encounter spiders, I'd probably be the same as you. But I live in a pretty spider-free area and I have yet to see a spider in this house I've been living in for two weeks, so I don't need to worry.

	122100 : ["In my opinion, there is only one man who should retire the Undertaker. Kane. The Undertaker, tired of the double-crosses and being screwed over and screwed out the WHC, goes on a rampage.  All fall to the Undertaker.  Cena, Big Show, Triple H, Michaels, Orton, JBL, Batista, Edge, Khali, Mark Henry, Matt and Jeff Hardy, Punk, Mysterio...all fall, nobody can stop him.  He no longer cares about anything but the destruction of the entire WWE roster. After he defeats all of the main event and upper card guys, the whole roster is scared to death of the Undertaker and jumping at shadows.  Finally, we see on the tron, Paul Bearer.  \"Undertaker,\" he says in his eerie voice, \"your mission is complete.  It's time to come home.\" Undertaker ignores Bearer and continues his path of destruction, targeting tag teams and anybody who dares to get in his way.  There are two or three more messages from Paul Bearer, which Undertaker ignores. Finally, during a Kane match, another tron.  Paul Bearer again.  \"Kane.  Your brother's mission is complete.  Nobody else can stop him.  YOU must send him home to me.\" Kane, as if he can't disobey Bearer, walks out of the match and leaves the arena.  He shows up on Smackdown and stops the Undertaker from destroying another opponent.  He tries to tell the Undertaker that's it's \"time to go home\".  Undertaker ignores that and tries to attack his opponent again.  Kane chokeslams the Undertaker.  'Taker sits up and glares at Kane, then attacks him.  They fight up the ramp and into the back.

Do not get in my way...or I will take your's, too.\"  This was just a warning to Kane and the Undertaker leaves.  Later in the show, during Kane's match, another tron from Paul Bearer, more urgent this time.  Again, Kane walks out of the match, this time straight to Mike Adamle's office.  He demands a match with the Undertaker at Wrestlemania.  A Casket Match.  Adamle readily makes the match. There is still a couple of weeks until Wrestlemania.  Undertaker continues destroying opponents, ignoring more Paul Bearer trons. At Wrestlemania, Kane wins the Casket Match.  After shoving Undertaker into the casket and slamming the lid shut, Kane backs up to the center of the ring to do his \"make fire shoot from the corner posts\" thing.  He brings his hands up, then slams them down.  But instead of flames shooting from the corner posts there is a huge bolt of lightning that strikes the casket and it bursts into flames.  The guys from the back rush out with fire extinguishers and put the flames out.  They open the casket lid and find it empty. \"You have done well, my son,\" we hear Paul Bearer's voice say.  Pan up to the tron and we see Paul Bearer in a crematorium standing in front of an open casket.  In that casket is the lifeless body of the Undertaker.  \"The Undertaker is going home now.\"  Kane nods once, showing no emotion. Bearer turns his attention to the Undertaker lying in the casket.  He then does a short farewell speech to the Undertaker, speaking to him as a loving father proud of his son.  Then he closes the lid of the casket.  A couple of Druids appear and push the casket into the fire.  \"Rest in peace, my son,\" Paul Bearer says.  Wrestlemania ends as we watch the remains of the Undertaker being cremated.
