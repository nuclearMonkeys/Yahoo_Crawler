He just never had to use it. Yes, Benedict is in decent health for a man of 88 years.  You have any idea what a Pope does in a day? He has tons of meeting with foreign dignitaries and has to write encyclicals and Holy Week is particularly grueling there is many ceremonies and he right now could handle it but why? He gave them 8 good years and I think its time for a younger man to take the job there are plenty of possibilities. Of course the Church isn't 'planning to become more liberal' the Church has its doctrines and it has its liturgies and they aren't going to change just because one man steps down. The Church is not a human institution, its guided by the Holy Spirit.

	99092 : ["I don't think they're compatible, and that they are contradictory.  You can be an ethical atheist and an ethical Jew at the same time.  But someone who is an atheist and an observant Jew at the same time is a walking-talking contradiction. People are complicated.  Those Jews who pray to a God they don't believe in generally do it because they've found a culture and community they like, and wish to fit in, even if they don't intellectually buy into it.  Are they living a contradictory life?  Yes.  But we're all hypocrites about something. The technical term for this school movement of Jews is \"Orthopraxy.\"  I recommend that you Google it for more information if you're interested. Note: Some forms of \"observant Judaism\" actually require very little theological observance.  For example, Secular Humanistic Judaism, which, in my humble opinion, has very little, if any, Judaism in it.  Some streams of Reform Judaism also don't have much about God, and instead focus on Good Deeds (Tikkun Olam) and Spirituality.  So being observant in that and atheist at the same time isn't necessarily contradictory. ******************************** EDIT: Re \"Judaism's sine qua non\" - According to traditional Judaism (that's the Orthodox and Conservative denominations), it is generally accepted that it is mandatory to believe Maimonide's 13 Principles of Faith in order to be considered observant.  (Interpretations of these principles differ, of course.)  These principles both explicitly state and are predicated on a belief in God.  (Google for details.)  Regarding actions, it's generally accepted that there are 613 \"commandments\" given by God that must be observed to the best of one's ability.  (Details and interpretations, again, differ.) Progressive Judaism (Reform, Reconstructionist, Humanist, etc) either reject or ignores these principles, along with most of traditional Jewish law and theology.  Depending on which specific rabbi in these denominations you ask, you will get different answers as to what, if anything, is required to be an observant Jew.  The *only* thing that they agree on is that a Jew cannot accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior.  See   for more about that. (And before anyone bashes me, please read what Rabbi Dana Evan Kaplan, a preeminent Reform rabbi, has written about this: \"The Reform movement has no central theological positions that are advocated by our leaders and/or believed in by its followers.  The movement has such blurry principles that we cannot determine where our parameters areâ€”or where they should be.  The result is that sociological facts determine normative values.\"    ) RE  \"supple enough to recognize contradictions\" - Judaism has recognized and grappled with contradictions in beliefs, ethics, actions, and theology for (literally) thousands of year.  The ancient rabbis filled volumes upon volumes of discussion of these issues, known as the Talmud.  The discussion continues through this very day. ******************* This quote from the aforementioned Rabbi Kaplan can provide an interesting insight into this phenomenon:   \"Americans are convinced that abstract ideals and concrete reality can be synthesized successfully. ...[P]eople in most of the rest of the world are more pessimistic about human nature and have lower expectations of reality. Therefore, they see it as natural to believe that ideals will differ from how life is actually lived. Many non-Americans consider it perfectly proper to view a strict form of religion as the ideal, even if they fall far short of its standards and may have no intention of becoming more devout. The public recognition of these standards provides them and their children with an ideal to which they can aspire, a public standard for behavior, and the norm for communal events. Orthodoxy [the most traditional form of Judaism] thus should be and must remain the public standard for Jewish attitudes and behavior, although this conviction does not obligate them to personally believe in or practice such a Judaism.\"", 9681, "f8f06ff9fca48b1a62ebc8b7833b7976aa", 1],

	99104 : ["A few nights ago a young man showed up at our house at 1am. He said he needed counseling because he thought he was the son of God. My wife said \"I'll get you some help. I'll call 911.\" He left. The point is this kind of thing never seems to come to an end around here. Keep this in mind as you read these pages. Yahweh wouldn't let the Jews have an image of Him even inside the Holy of Holy's. He also said \"don't do the things that pagans do.\" God has a way of marking His people. The devil also marks his people. Religion and politics have always been an effective tool to control the masses. The Creator God is The Lord of Light / God of Truth. Any religion or political agenda that leads people away from truth is not of God. Mind control is highly effective on the gullable, followers, uneducated and children. Higher level mind control sometimes called propaganda works on almost everyone. A person who exists in the darkness is not enlightened or aware of their condition. If someone repeats a lie enough times some people will believe it. If a person repeats a lie enough times they will come to believe it. When these things occur the lie becomes the truth to those who follow. It is almost impossible to reveal the truth to those who follow a lie. These will hold to their lie usually to death without realizing how they have been deceived. If a person is raised by parents or guardians who live a lie they will usually believe the lie without question. This is found in all religions. Those who are on the path to truth know how to test the spirits to discern them. They are not easily deceived. Religion offers an artificial enlightenment, just as the laws of Moses did. The laws of Moses could not offer true enlightenment or salvation, but they did give guidelines to live by and important clues so we can find the truth. The Bible offers a similar form of enlightenment along with critical testimony to this truth and more clues to help a person find the path to the truth concerning the Creator God. Understanding who the Creator God is allows us some insight into who and what we are. True spiritual enlightenment comes only through the Holy Spirit of Christ. Once a person emerges from their former darkness they shall never willingly return to it. Those who believe the lies comfort themselves with each other. They encourage each other to believe the lies they have been taught. It takes true courage to break away from organized religion and find Christ and the Truth on your own. Only few ever accomplish this. Now remember what Jesus said, the way to destruction is wide enough for all that choose it. The path to truth and salvation is narrow and only an exceptional few ever find it. Are you the few or the many?", 9683, "None", 0],
