Yes you can make a profit and i have on my 2 very large litters of over 10 - but that was such hard work and it wasnt a hug profit BUT more often i either come off even or losing! The costs incurred some people do not take into consideration for example health screening before any litters are even thought about!!! The and ill use my last litter as an example - £450 stud fees - £100 travel expense's - £3000 unpaid leave (8 weeks) - £350 vets fees - £100 puppy food - £250 puppy bits ie vet check, micro chip, jabs etc I ONLY had 4 pups (i kept 1  girl) 3 pups sold for £750 each = £2250  Total expense including money i lost from being off work £4250 - which gives a total loss of £2000. I love breeding i have a passion to better the breed and find it so very rewarding to bring healthy pups into the world BUT i do wish people would stop doing it as a profit thing your pet should be the main priorty it takes alot of time to plan a litter properly!! There may have been extra costs but this is a rough guide I do go to work to earn my money and i do not rely on my dogs to make me a profit!!!", 8435, "gBIrmaOXaa", 2],
	67783 : ["I'm a Boxer breeder.  I used to breed other breeds years ago but changed to Boxers because I love the breed.  There are so many costs in breeding your dog that I do not make a profit such as a business might do.  We show our dogs so there is that cost, we have various medical checks done on them before we breed, that costs.  Pregnancy costs such as xrays and so forth are not expensive but are a cost.  Then there is the cost of the puppies... dew claws, shots, check-ups, etc.  Then once the puppies get to around 4 weeks, there is the cost of food (not a small amount either).  This last time around our dog had 10 puppies so you'd think we would make lots of money but still, 10 puppies is a lot to care for.  Perhaps we do more than the average breeder but most of our puppies are housebroken when they leave us at 8-12 weeks old.  Also they are very well socialized because we have both \"mom\" and \"dad\" living here and they live in our home.  Those are a list of litter costs.  The other costs such as whelping beds, etc also add up to lots of money we spend.  If our two dogs did not produce an even better dog, we would never breed them.  This does not include with our female had any problems in brithing the puppies which she has not ever had.  People think they will make lots of money with breeding, it is just not so.  Poor quality breeders do not make as much per puppy as I do either and yet I am not rich in money because of what I do.  I am rich in many other ways from it though such as producing great show dogs, teaching and training new owners, etc.  Not to mention all the puppy licks I get!", 8435, "VQlkO7lqaa", 1],

	67795 : ["Nice list. How do Judith Curry, Tim Ball, Fred Singer, Patrick Michaels and Richard S. Lindzen score on your list? Although, I think that I can tell from your avatar. Dr. Schneider's quote \"We are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we'd like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To do that we need to get some broadbased support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\" And why do \"skeptics\" offer up scary scenarios of what will happen if we reduce emissions, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts they might have? What is worse? Claiming that a million lives are in danger when only a thousand lives are in danger, or claiming that some iris will save us because big oil pays you to say so? <Cliff Mass comes to mind when he tore a strip from James Hansen> What did James Hansen actually say in the paper that Cliff Mass was critiquing? That if not for global warming, there would be no heat waves or that there has been a statistically significant increase in the amount of warming in heat waves? James Hansen said the latter. Mass' post also shows just a simple shift in the bell curve rather than the broadening of the bell curve due to global warming. So, rather than Mass catching James Hansen in intellectual dishonesty, Clijmate Realist has caught Mass in intellectual dishonesty. <I have high regard for Curry and Lindzen. Lindzen may be calculating climate sensitivity too low but I hold him as honest (even if he might be off scientifically). Curry seems perhaps a little narrow in her focus on uncertainty but she is less of a skeptic than many> On the surface, scientists like Cliff Mass and Richard Lindzen know that many people are to smart to belive that AGW is a lie. So, instead they plant seeds of doubt and make statements that they hope hard cored denialists will take out of context. It is actually Richard Lindzen who started the denialist claim about no statistically significant warming since 1995. \"This contradiction is rendered more acute by the fact that there has been no statistically significant net global warming for the last fourteen years.\" While ignoring the fact that there is nothing unusual about fourteen years without statistically sgnificant warming and the period without statistically significant warming is a signal to noise issue and not a \"global warming has stalled issue.\"", 8433, "None", -3],

The Constitution allows the government to coin money and 'regulate the value thereof', meaning that it's the federal govt's job to control inflation.  It also allows Congress to make any laws that are 'necessary and proper' to carry out its responsibilities.  The 'necessary and proper' clause is usually cited in cases where the Constitution doesn't give Congress explicit power to do something. It seems to me there are certain things that the government has to do or they won't get done.  This includes things like public education, building and maintaining roads and bridges and other infrastructure, public health (epidemic control), etc.etc.  A lot of Obama's stimulus plan is for things we needed anyway, and by doing them now we provide jobs, stimulate the economy, etc.  The Republicans have used defense spending to stimulate the economy ever since WWII.

Obama has to repay those who donated to his campaign and those of the Democratic Senate and House. This guy has no idea of what he is doing, first he overturns bills that former President Bush signed that would have helped the economy by providing jobs, in Alaska and the Gulf Coast drilling for oil, and sending billions of dollars overseas for abortions. Obama has no plan, he filled his cabinet with Clinton retreads, some of whom, should be in prison for their actions, during Bill Clinton's 8 year reign. The sad part is they fail the Senate Nomination hearings, once again forcing Obama to make another choice, from the Democratic Party. This coming after he called for an end to partisan politics, when he said he would be reaching across the aisle to the GOP, I haven't seen or heard of that happening yet.

While it will take generations to pay off the total of 1 3/4 trillion dollars, in packages for Congressional and Senatorial Districts, that loaded their specialty programs, including one in the San Francisco Bay area, Dianne Feinstein's district, about some kind of rare mouse.

If you don't like the program, you could contact the advertisers and ask them to stop advertising on that program, however, it will have little if any consequences to the program.
