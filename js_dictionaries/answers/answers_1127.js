	61835 : ["I must congratulate you on asking this question as it appears that you are willing to learn. Evaluating your images is one of the first steps at becoming better. Experienced photographers are always evaluating their images. The flop images are your learning tool. What makes the image bad? What makes the good image good? For starters, you need to learn about the exposure triangle, lighting and composition. It will take a year of practice to get comfortable with these subjects, but, expect a lifetime of learning. Depending on what you shoot, perhaps learning about styling and posing. A good read for the exposure triangle is \"UnderstandingExposure\" by Bryan Peterson. Lots of pictures to emphasize what he is discussing. Your local library might have this book. B&H's Youtube Event Space channel has lot of good lecture videos at beginner and intermediate levels.", 8142, "HFuI8oVYaa", 0],
	61836 : ["i think the first guy is pretty right.  perhaps you could also tell your husband why you're feeling so insecure? that way it'll help him to put things into perspective too, and he won't fel like he's constantly being tracked etc either. because that kind of sends the signal that you don't trust him, which i guess isn't really the case, you're just anxious i'm guessing.  once he gets to understand and know the reason behind why you get so worried all the time, it'll be much easier to work things out :D", 8137, "JpvsT4J5aa", 0],
	61837 : ["you have to realize that no amount of tracking you do, or stalking, can prevent your husband from doing what he is going to do. He is a grown man and if he is going to cheat there is nothing you can do about it. You are holding yourself prisoner by believing that you have some kind of control on your spouse. Let go and try something that I have learned works better than all the nagging and accusations. Ready for it? Trust him. If he does something that he's not supposed to it will come to light. It always does. This will relieve a lot of your stress. You can not control him...only yourself. Control yourself. He is a grown man, let him control himself.", 8137, "rEW55r59aa", 0],

	61849 : ["You can also pose the same question about doing panoramas in phone or using a DSLR and software on, god forbid, a desktop computer. I recently saw a pano taken by an Apple cell phone. At first glance, it looks pretty good, but when blown up (equivalent to a 16x20\" print) you can see the poor stitching job. Part of that was user error (most likely holding the camera at arms length while panning), but it's also processing issues since they are taking short cuts with the stitching to reduce processing load. The software I use to stitch would have worked much better. However, you probably wouldn't have noticed the issues since you probably don't have a critical eye for problems associated with panos.", 8140, "HFuI8oVYaa", 0],
	61850 : ["First off, phones make anything look good on the LCD, even if the shot is poor. This is because the phone's small LCD tends to hide gross errors. Second, pictures taken with a smartphone are tuned to make it look good on-screen. Yes, computer logic helps a lot on that and it may be not as aggressive as with cameras. We'll go back to that later. Third, HDR in phones, even if you think is instantaneous, is still a multiple shot picture. You can't go away from taking at least 3 shots. You just don't feel it. So why not dedicated cameras? First, the camera is just a tool and being so is just supposed to be manipulated by the photographer to get the picture. Skill comes in first so what you take tells a lot about you. Second, cameras are not well-blessed with the processing power of smartphones. Cameras are dumb. Again, it's the user who's supposed to be smart, right? Third, although HDR in some cameras can be made automatically doing multiple shots too like a phone, it is best done manually, because you're supposed to know what you're doing in the first place. If you don't know, don't blame the camera for getting it wrong. There is nothing to catch up. The disparity of preference between a smartphone and a dSLR has never been wider. To each his own. Pros prefer it to stay this way until kingdom come. ", 8140, "21112cc7ac2bacc93374e23ada41a67caa", 2],

	61854 : ["Yes, this is normal for any beginner.  Shooting hundreds to get one good one is not a good hit ratio.  This tells me that you do not do any internal editing, which is fine for now as it's something you'll learn to do with experience.  With experience over time, you will learn as to what is a keeper and what isn't before you even press the shutter button.  Being able to pre-visualize the image is an important skill that should come slowly with time. I'd say that an enthusiast with a few years under his/her belt will likely consistently get about 1 good shot for every 20 shots taken.  However, as your experience grows, what you consider to be a good shot will change, and become more critical.  Thus you'll have to shoot more to get more keepers, which is why National Geographic photographers shoot so many shots and publish just .01%.  But then again, the photographers and editors at the Geographic have extraordinarily high standards. It also depends upon what you shoot.  Someone who's a street photographer will have a lousy hit ratio simply because they can't control the environment.  However, a wedding photographer will have a much better success rate since they can control every aspect of the shot.  For the rest of us who go out with no particular shot in mind, just shooting to shoot, our hit rate is going to be rather bad in comparison, but that's okay.", 8142, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
	61855 : ["Nowadays with digital yes. Then one day the penny drops and you start to put your camera on a tripod and compose the shot in the LCD panel making minor adjustments to get the composition right. Shoot in RAW and bracket the exposure. Once you get into doing that, you will automatically 'help' even your smartphone camera to do what nobody designed it to do.  Make the picture tell a story; no story then it's probably not the shot to bother with.", 8142, "UReKGnGXaa", 0],
	61856 : ["No.  I started out with film so I learned to pick my shots very meticulously. I still do even now with digital which is a lot more convenient. Before I take a shot, I would already know my settings. I would take a test shot then readjust if necessary before shooting again.

	61866 : ["Phones have exactly the same problems as any other camera - movement leads to ghosting and they don't work well in low light (much worse than DSLRs / mirrorless).  In their favour, they can shoot at high frame rates, and the images tend to be displayed on very small screens, so the problems are less obvious. \"When will DSLRs catch up to the intelligence of phones???\" Years ago!  Much of a camera's smarts is aimed at enhancing creativity while phones use theirs to try and overcome the inherent limitations caused by tiny lenses, noisy sensors etc. \"How does the phone HDR feel so instantaneous?\" It can take the required 2 or 3 frames very quickly and there are no mechanical parts to give it any \"feel\". <edit> \"When I said it feels instantaneous, I meant in the context of time, not of haptic feedback\" My point is in the absence of feedback, haptic or otherwise, how do you judge the instantaneity of something? ", 8140, "b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa", 1],

	61869 : ["It has been said that the difference between an amateur and professional photographer is the size of their wastebaskets. But that is really somewhat mocking. Nowadays with digital there are a lot more photos taken but hundreds of photos taken to get one you like is excessive. I spent 19 years in the field and started out in the film age as well as long before automated cameras and it did require more planning and discipline so that meant fewer photos. Therefore my habits may be more old school. However, I did shoot multiple exposures of each composition as well as backups. Typically 4 photographs would have 20 exposures and of the 4 versions 1 would choose 1 or 2 versions as \"marketable.\" The net outcome then, would be ten photos of each saleable photo including backup frames. Ultimately though, it comes down to eye and composition. Starting out, your \"eye\" should have some ability to see what will make a good photo to begin with and your ability to frame the view and make a pleasing composition will spell the difference between being an amateur snapshooter and a good or professional photographer. You'll make mistakes, certainly. But out of every-say ten exposures, my personal experience is that eight should be of subjects that are worthy of attention and out of those eight with a minimum of four exposures each with varying composition and exposure at least 4 should be worthy of attention. This calculates out to 32 photographs to yield 4 good photographs. This estimate is off the cuff and would take time to achieve. It is also old-school and one photographer's point of view. Others may consider it too rigid. However, it is one \"target\" you might consider as you think about your work and becoming more discerning to avoid hundreds of \"flops\" to get one you like.
