	12556 : ["basically, jews,buddhists,muslims pray head down to satan. during the night christian earthlybowdowns count 40 times more than daily earthlybowdowns. since, most of the time witches pray during the night against christians, it's best to pray at night ...maybe you could do 2000 christian earthlybowdowns.. notice that muslims-jews-buddhists stay head down which shows that they worship satan; christians have to get up super fast showing allegiance to Christ and not the devil. so, christian earthlybowdowns: u face east, legs together (so that demon don't run underneath ur legs); u look at the eyes of icon (energy goes ur way according to saint Pelageya of Ryazan); u make proper Orthodox sign of the cross (first three fingers together as if u had a pinch of salt in them; thumb always straight; ring and pinky to palm; firmly touch forehead: \"in the name of the Father\"; firmly touch 1cm above belly button: \"and of the Son\", raise hand to chest level and now move to right shoulder where there bones meet: \"and of the Holy\"; move to left shoulder: \"Spirit. Amen\"; release the fingers; hand down by ur side); u bow down on ur knees (knees together), then put hands together on the floor, then forehead on top of backofhands; as soon as ur forehead touches the back of hands, get up super fast showing allegiance to Christ (and not the devil). do 2000 times during the night against witches. 'cuz witches work hard for satan (by praying like three hours); you have to show them respect by outworking them; u feel me? but of course when u tired u could pray the Jesus prayer at least three times every hour (don't sleep 4 more than 1 hour; wake up and pray the Jesus prayer three times; then u can rest a little bit; in case witches pray real hard to satan, then u have to pray to Jesus as many times as possible); thank u; forgive me rudeness. edit: chosen people = the ones that have the correct religion. orthodoxy is the only true faith with one cup and one spoon and no one gets sick. roman catholics tried one cup one spoon ritual and got sick with bubonic plague; if heresy enters orthodox monastery, then its inhabitants will get sick also. covid = another heresy; that's why disposable cups were introduced in heretical gatherings. churches who had disposable cups, masks, disposable spoons, dipped spoon into alcohol, or closed for covid = no grace of the Holy Spirit in them = they woik for satin. death to de antichrist! oh...snap... here he iz flyin' thru ma neck of de woodz; hide ur kidz, hide ur wife; antichrist is flyin' thru town; take ur glocks out and shoot dat son of a bytch down; he's an s-o-b 'cuz his mother is a 12th generation prostitute to jews and hindus; ew...he's gay 'cuz she a lesbian who pretends to be a virgin; well... project blue beam will show five figures (christian god, buddhist god, hindu god, muslim god, and jewish god) merging in2 1 (de antichrist); so, hide now (within a 7-15 people group; 10-12 according to saint seraphim of sarov; 10-15 according to saint gabriel urgebadze)... no documents as they r from satin (burn 'em); no electronics so that u won't be tracked (even old broken unplugged 1970 tv set will show de antichristo using tesla's ether); forgive me 4 dis spiel.", 2118, "None", 0],
	12557 : ["There's a TV series called A Million Little Things but I don't know what a million little things for abs is, so I am unsure what you are asking. I can tell you that an actor that is a series regular does not get a salary.  They are paid a weekly rate.  In the US, the actor's union (SAG-AFTRA) negotiates a base rate which is the minimum an actor can be paid.  The base pay for a series regular in an hour drama is about $4,200 a week for 13 episodes.  This is just a general idea - there are a lot of variables based on the specific role and an actor's agent can negotiate a higher payment. And the more popular a series is, the higher the actor will be paid.  This is the base pay for filming an episode and for the initial broadcast.  An actor can also earn “residuals” which means they get paid when the episodes are rebroadcast or made available on a streaming service or broadcast in a foreign market.  Again, an agent will negotiate the residual rates beyond a minimum set by the union.", 2118, "4dIdBbOhaa", 1],

	12562 : ["Let me disburden myself of something very strange that happened about two years.  A little over a decade ago someone disappeared from my friend group.  We knew he was going through a bad patch when he vanished.  We'd been friends long enough to know family and this man was just gone from everybody's life.  After a time we thought the worst had happened and life went on.   This is the paranormal event: one night I woke up in the small hours of the night feeling like I was wild swimming through changing currents.  Exactly that feeling.  I was lying in bed just feeling the sensation, vaguely wondering what I might have been dreaming before I woke up.  Then this feeling of urgency began to come over me until it became an unbearable pressure and I had to get up and satisfy it. The feeling took me to my desktop, itself unusual as I mostly use my laptop these days.  I went online and found myself googling an event similar to tough mudders, something this vanished person used to do, but not my hobby.  I felt completely driven to go to the sign up page for the event and when I clicked on the link the whole membership database was wide open.  I could see everyone's full details!  You guessed it, I saw our missing friend's name, DoB, address, email, even some credit card details.  I was trembling like a leaf at this point and just stared and stared.  I got up and went to the loo and the screen was still the same when I got back.  By this point I was not just trembling but shuddering.  I wrote down everything as best I could, I could hardly hold the pen because I was convulsing violently.  I wanted to take a screenshot but something prevented me, I had to write it all out longhand.  After that I was suddenly so exhausted I was weaving when I went to bed and fell straight asleep.   The next morning I thought I'd had a really vivid dream and was unsettled in that way really vivid dreams came make you feel.  Except, in front of the computer there was a yellow post-it note with a shaky version of my hand writing - but still legible and the information as I recalled it.  I started the computer and went into my browser history with a real sense of trepidation.  I could see the website in my history but when I clicked on the sign up link the site had been repaired and all I got was the sign-up form, even when following my history.   Anyway, I used the information to discretely make inquiries along every line I had and lo! it really was him and I feel so relieved.  He does not know that I know and I've never told anyone else, not even his parents and I don't know what to do about that.  I don't feel like I can invade his privacy but still feel sad that whatever he was running from involved cutting everyone out.  I do know that he's on the other side of the country, is married, and has kids.  I wouldn't want to throw a bomb into the peace he found.  I'm easy enough to find if he wants to.   The whole computer episode was so strange and I don't know what to think.  It happened because I could never have found that information otherwise.  There is one more thing.  While I was on the computer that night I had a sense of being surrounded by houseplants, like almost a jungle of various houseplants in that lush 1970s style.  It wasn't sinister, more like the background ambiance you pick up on while visiting a friendly house.", 2108, "None", -1],
