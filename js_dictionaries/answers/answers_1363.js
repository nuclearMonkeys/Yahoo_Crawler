	73754 : ["What is interesting is how it was argued years ago how the head motion (indicating a frontal bullet) was a neurological reaction. As an engineer who has published in neurology journals (on brain modeling) that is crap (IMHO). Bullets passing thru the brain will not cause such a coordinated pattern of excitation-inhibition resulting in head movements like that.  What I really can't believe is how the sheep will not question this. They still buy into Iraq being the cause of 9/11 I guess. Sad.", 8732, "c34f4c68d941757f445b7488262ccbf1aa", -1],

	73777 : ["Hi! Dharma indicates your ethical imperative and personal spiritual center. For example, if you are centered in religion then your dharma is \"faith\". If you are centered in intellectual ethics and morals then your dharma is \"duty\". If you are a fighter and proud of it, then your dharma is \"honor\". If you are a lover and kind and happy, then your dharma is \"following your bliss\" or \"happiness\". If you are a practical person, your dharma is \"utility\". Dharma is a mental tool by which to define your spiritual center. It's vagueness as a definition is due to its sacred source in a holy language of Sanskrit. It is a very useful concept! Now, how do we know what is our dharma? The simple but not easy answer is: look at the values you hold most dear. They will be the path (marga) by which Krishna manifests to you. It is through love, devotion, worship, caring, attention, focus - it is through the center of the heart, in short, that dharma is discovered. It is not easy but it is very simple and direct.

	73787 : ["You may be trapped there. First, you don't mention the monthly fees. Those sometimes can be quite high. And even though it may be reasonable for what's covered, lots of uninformed people tend to compare those fees to condo fees, which might be only half or less the land rent. Second, lots of buyers of manufactured homes can't afford them. That is, they can't pay cash. And they can't get financing. Incidentally, it's very difficult to get financing on a used manufactured home that's more than a few years old. As a result, lots of owners have to offer owner financing in order to sell. Around where I live (in Virginia), regular homes sell in 30 days. Manufactured homes often take 120-180 days, sometimes much more. It'll go down some in value, but not a whole lot. That's not a big problem. So what if it goes down $5,000 in value? Over the course of 7 years, that's $714 a year, or about $60 a month. The main consideration is how long it'll take to sell.
