I continued through college and adulthood and several years ago, after stopping for a bit, began anew. Well, I'm 54 now, a poet published many times over and author of a couple thousand poems in every imaginable format. I'm also an instructor of poetry and both teach and write professionally. And all because my mother had the forethought to buy that typewriter because she saw something special in me. Bless her. I'm still trying to prove I deserve her kindness... Come dance with me beneath the moon; It suits us better than the sun My precious one. The wolf and owl will know my tune, And love you soon will too Before the world's bejeweled in morning dew. I'll praise your beauty till the dawn, Until the night's peace ends at last And, sleeping past,  The shades the villagers have drawn Will raise the day anew. Ah then, but not before, will I leave you. I'll spend my waking hours in dreams Of love for you I can't deny; When evening's nigh And in the heavens Venus gleams I'll hurry to your side And there sweet maiden all the night abide. We'll live our little lives in fear Pretending to be daylight friends; The half-truth rends My heart and soul.  When you are near I live in paradise And feel the gates of Heaven in your eyes. Until we walk in sunlit ways And don't deny the cloth we share, But instead wear Our evening robes in full display My life will die at noon And you will be no nearer than the moon.", 11591, "None", 9],

It was weird because my mom thought I was dyslexic until I was like 11 (I used to never read). So that was really my intro to literature. I've been reading and writing like crazy ever since.  Lately I haven't been writing. I think it's because for the first time in a while, I'm happy. And I just don't know how to write happy stuff. I feel like I have to be sad to write... which sucks.

I am an overweight woman...and, to add insult to injury, I am also older...I used to worry about my weight, and it made my life a living hell.  Several years ago, I began to shift my focus on to things that made me feel good about my self...I began to work on accepting myself as I am.  Now, I am older, but much wiser.  Last week I had 3 different much younger guys (about 15-20 years younger) flirting up a storm with me. I am still fat, but now I am confident.  I am happy.  I enjoy life, and that is what really attracts men.  The ones that worry about whether you are perfect physically are going to be very shallow men.  So work on being happy with your self.

	143685 : ["Edward. Not because he`s so handsome and perfect in every way, but that's definitely a plus, but because he really cares for Bella. He would do anything for her. Like Bella's mom, Renee, she said \"It's like he'd throw himself in front of a bullet to save you.\" I don`t know why people are irritated by his overprotective attitude. Isn't it so nice that your love will protect you in every way, just to make you safe? I started lowering down my hate for Jacob, because yes, he did help Bella when she was in \"zombie mode.\" Bella would probably have suicided if not for Jake being there. But I hated it when he practically forced Bella to choose him over Edward.

I'm not really sure why I started, I just kind of did. I used to HATE reading with a passion and now I read all the time. In my opinion, a book can be an escape from the world. Anyways, I write about anything and everything. My first \"good\" poem (it actually was kind of formed and together with a meaning) was called Hopelessly Hopeful. When I started, I was writing happy and inspirational, but when I started posting the happy ones on here, people called them cheesy and other junk. So, since then, I've been trying to find a dark side. Which is pitiful, and I shouldn't just to please readers. I definitely have tons and tons to grow on with my writing. I've actually started 4 fiction novels and have yet to finish one... I'm patient, which isn't always a good thing, but I figure that if I ever want to publish, I will in my twenties. So that gives me plenty of time to finish one, and I don't have to tell anyone how long it took me. Honestly, I don't talk to the people in my life about this stuff. I'm kind of like you with the whole friend thing. I have friends, but none that I want to talk to about this stuff. I'm in a world filled with people who are my \"friends\" but I feel alone. I was even homecoming queen last year...I'm a nerd though, in my opinion. I never go to basketball games or things like that. I do play volleyball though. Yeah, sorry, Im getting off track and telling my short life story, but oh well. I'm glad that you were able to find poetry again. When you said you lost your cause to live, my heart sank, but then you found it again and it was okay!  Congrats again with finding your writing and your lucky albatross has now fallen off of your neck. ~Laura Marie~", 11591, "LLD5jcg2aa", 2],
