Without knowing a little more background of the story it seems that you are portraying an emotional man.

Men are not, in my experience, susceptible to these kinds of fantastic mood swings.  There is nothing more irritating, to me as a male reader then an author portraying characteristics onto a character that do not follow reality.

	81783 : ["I know its a shocking thing to discover, but this sort of discovery even at your daughter's age is completely normal. We are all sexual beings and those feelings begin in childhood....even prior to the age of 10. I think its good to keep a watch and to be as aware as you can be about whats going on in your daughter's life. But also, in order for our children to discover and develop normally into adults with normal attitudes about sex I believe we need to eliminate the shame factor associated with these matters. Being approachable and talking freely with your child helps her decipher her feelings and come to terms with influences from the outside world. Kids today are exposed to sexual inferences very early from every angle because it permeates our society as a whole much more now. Diffusing a situation like you encountered last night is obviously a good idea, but being mindful of your child's embarrassment factor when you go in is imperative. If you make her feel persecuted or give her the feeling you are judging her behavior then you are starting the cycle of shame I mentioned before. You may think I sound rather cavalier now.........but if a child associates your involvement in such a situation with feelings of shame or perceives you as feeling disappointed with them because of their sexuality then they will not consult you as they get older because of the discomfort associated in doing so. Not only that, but they will make every effort to hide anything related to their sexuality from you in the future. The ideal relationship to foster in this respect is an open, reciprocal, matter of fact exchange. Always try to level the playing field that way so your child feels comfortable talking. Of course Im fully aware this is easier said than done. Nobody is perfect and it is hard to calm your own mind quickly enough to temper your reaction when confronted with a shocking moment like you had. So don't worry about what you did or didn't do last night...you learned from it. I think you did pretty well actually. Raising kids is hard work. Sometimes if moms can draw from one another's experiences it helps to bring clarity. Modern parents have to shepherd our kids so much more than even our own parents did because the world is becoming more daunting by the day for our kids. Technology allows them way more access to information (good and bad) than we ever had. And they have to make sense of it all one way or another. This is what that incident was all about. Just hug her today and let her know you are always there for her to talk. Leave it at that for now. Im sure she feels very embarrassed right now and is worrying about what you think after what happened. So just set a positive tone between you and give her some time to think. Its time now to start discussing sex with her if you havent been already. Incorporate the conversations into private brief moments in everyday life. Just be matter of fact and casual about it and she will follow your lead. Interject in a subtle way how you feel about these matters and guide her gently....but dont preach or she wont hear you. She IS listening to you even if she doesnt seem like it. Kids this age think in their own time. By the way....a great book addressing this matter is: The Portable Pediatrician by Dr. Laura W. Nathanson. This book is actually a pediatric book for birth to age 5 so most of it you dont need........but there is a great explanation in there about normal childhood sexuality and behaviors that I think you would find very insightful. Maybe go take it out at the library. Also, my daughter is 12 now and I had wanted a book about girl's matters that she could read in my absence to bolster my talks with her. I read just about every book I could find on the subject matter until I found the one I like which is Girlstuff by Margaret Blackstone and Elissa Haden Guest. For older girls I still like the book my mom gave me when I was 16 ( o how times have changed!!) which is Our Bodies Ourselves by Boston Women's Health Book Collective. Gee...I hope my words made at least a small difference for you this morning. As a mom I can truly feel your yucky feeling right along with you.
