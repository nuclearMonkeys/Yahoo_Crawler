Each and every one of the things that feminism lays claim to was brought about primarily by men working, fighting, and sometimes dying in the cause of promoting and enhancing human rights and equalities. Women here had the vote  less than five years after full male suffrage - women here have always hdd the same right to an education - equal pay for the same work in the same position has been the law since the 1970's here - anjd so on and so on. NONE of these was ever brought about by feminism. On the other hand, Faux Feminism and its useful idiot adherents and beneficiaries has re-introduced to our civilisation the concept of guilt by accusation, overt discrimination, violent abuse of the law to attain a political/social end, direct abuse of a segment of our society as a means of oppression and disempowerment through control of the media, education, the violence of the law, and so on (a crime against humanity), and the consequent grabbing into their own hands of total power, under the guise of protection a specified group (women or Sudetenlanders - take your pick), by our elected representatives bent on total control over our society and its inhabitants. Thus - feminism is a retrograde social step (or series of steps) and not a positive and upwardly mobile one. I will be marching soon - before Winter.", 10885, "jCL8xsgtaa", -1],
