If it does not, the keyboard will need to be replaced.  This is not a setting, as it is only one key. a good tech can replace it easily. ", 8126, "f841afbad67e2febaf16f5f41aea6d1eaa", 2],

There are also tariffs but this is only something people in North America have to worry about. Finally, the demand for Graphics cards is through the roof thanks to Cryptocurrency mining making a comeback. To make matters worse, now you're dealing with scalpers that are only buying graphics cards to resale the card for a nice, fat profit.  Since there are so many factors at play, it might be a year or 2 before you see a Graphics card at it's MSRP. Now, I think the RTX 3000 series is the lost generation. The last time I remember seeing Graphics cards at a good price, with a good selection of cards that were a good value was around May of 2017. That's before Ethereum mining took off and became highly profitable. While there were no problems getting an RTX 2000 series card, for the most part none of what the 20-series had to offer was a good value. ", 8154, "210366f079220c727fec4c0249d14085aa", 0],
