To the person who thinks the presidential elections have to do with affirmative action, it does not, since the president is \"elected\" by the people, and no one can force you to vote for a person because of their race.   Affirmative Action was instituted to give a level playing field for minorities as well as whites, and it was thought that it would go away once it was not needed, or once the institutionalized discrimination was no longer as rampant as it was in the '60s.   It was not a racist policy, it was instituted as a result of discrimination in education and employment of minorities.  I think today it is needed less than it was 40 yrs ago.   This program has been a double-edged sword of sorts. People say we are unqualified, but we are hired and educated anyway because of this program, but if not for the program, we had less of a chance than others, simply based on ethnicity. And on top of that, whites feel that the program discriminates against them and forces them to hire a minority over a \"better qualified white person\".", 10362, "None", -2],
