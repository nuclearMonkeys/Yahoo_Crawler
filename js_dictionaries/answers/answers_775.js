All they have done is added more cores and raised clock speeds. Supposedly next month, Intel is set to release their 11th Generation Rocket Lake processor which will finally be based on a new architecture but these will still be made on Intel's 14nm process.  A PC with an older Core i7-4770 which is a quad core with Hyperthreading, 16gb of RAM, and a 6gb GTX 1060 is worth a little bit more than $400.

After c.1100AD it was downhill with the relationship because the Jews like others in the Arab lands faced more discrimination as time went on.  By year 1800 the Jews wanted the land they originally settled after leaving Arabia, (Canaan) back which they had more or less 1500BC-100AD, with themselves in the drivers seat, that's when the real hatred started. The Arabs and their Jewish cousins managed to barely to get along till year1900, but then after that...it's basically been war for 120 years.  It's too bad because they have much in common and got along for a long time before, but the Arabs just won't part with that sliver of land (whether Jerusalem is included or not) and the Jews have no other place to go if they want a country.    ", 6229, "oxjgA8c5aa", 0],

To start out with, much of the Islamic world actually doesn't have any beef with Israel to begin with. They're just boycotting out of solidarity with the group that shares their religion, as they believed they \"should\". It's rather clear that some of the nations that are rather loud in speaking ill about Israel actually don't care too much internally, and are just doing it to look good to a few other states in the Islamic world who do. Much of this attitude is fading away, and increased interaction with Israelis in third-party nations and forums have lead others to believe that it's gotten ridiculous at this point. Israel is a part of their world and, honestly, I think a few realize that they're not the threat others may paint them to be. There is great benefit to Israelis coming to their nations, I think. Morocco does allow in Israelis now but with relations more will risk the journey, so that tourism (especially from Israelis of Moroccan descent) would be something to desire. Israeli businesses are notoriously profitable in the West, and economically savvy UAE will clearly pay attention. And I remember reading about how Sudan may benefit from Israel's impressive environmental technologies.  Edit: As for allowing non-Israelis but people who have been to Israel in, it's simple: They recognize they're NOT Israeli. A lot of those who ban those who have been to Israel in addition to Israelis are those who may have engaged in war with Israel (or still have active conflicts) but most who don't really are only banning Israel for the \"Islamic solidarity\" look.

	43037 : ["Honestly, I'm not sure who to say... and I'm a Jew myself! We like to say about ourselves that \"two Jews will have three opinions between them\", so perhaps that's why I'm having trouble talking about my own people in this regard. Even if it's for a very broad generalization, I'm not sure what to say. Most Jews are citizens of either the United States and Israel. Between these two nations, you account for 80% of worldwide Jewry. So perhaps you can make assumptions based on that, I guess. Most Jews are normal citizens of their respective nations; though, I'd say that the Jews from Arab nations lean more towards France (many of whom left the Arab world for France) than Persian Jews (who reside mostly in the USA and Israeli nowadays anyway) so perhaps assumptions from broader populations aren't as helpful. And it's worth noting that Israelis and Americans may respond differently, so that makes it also difficult to imagine. One thing to note is that Jews have been in Europe for far longer than these other groups, so many people may think that the ones with the largest Jewish populations may take the answer.... but, Jewish history in Europe is complicated. Russia at one point had large amounts of Jews but it's greatly reduced nowadays for a reason. Trust me: There are only a few Jews who like Russia that weren't already born there, and even then most did what they could to leave over the last few centuries. Russia still has a large Jewish population when compared to most other nations... but it's dwarfed by the USA, Israel, and France in this regard.  Well, with that you may think France... but they're bleeding Jews nowadays too, and there are many who notice increasing anti-Semitism there. So, it's favorite status can be questionable.  If I *had* to make a guess, I'd go for the UK or Germany. The UK because many Israelis are proficient in English and both the USA and Canada are in the top five of \"most Jews\" with a lot in Australia as well. And Germany is in there because a lot of Israelis like Germany and live there... which, yes, is ironic, given what still remains in living memory. I also feel like I should mention the Czech Republic because a lot of Israelis note how they've always been rather friendly and it's one nation I can think of that has been singled out for praise... but most people focus on the larger nations, and I think many American Jews are unaware of them, unfortunately. I should say that Jews in general don't have anything against most European nations. I know many who'll love to go to Italy, France, Sweden, Greece... basically, just assume they're individuals and avoid generalizations. I will say that East Europe gets less love from the Jewish population because of the perception that it's very anti-Semitic. Honestly, a lot of Jews still think to evaluate anti-Semitism when they travel abroad to Europe, even if they do like many European places. Edit:  BS - I'm a Zionist Jew and I like tons of other people across the globe. And they like me, knowing about my Jewishness or Zionist/pro-Israel stances. Honestly, do realize most of the world actually isn't bothered by Israelis or supporters of Israel and views your stance on the matter bigoted and highly problematic. If you want specific nationalities, look to how Indians tend to respond to Israel and you'll see a big example of how you not everyone dismisses large swaths of people as \"cancer\". And, of course, as an American I can point to the shining USA as a place that not only doesn't regard Israel as a cancer but is more favorable towards it! Also, \"real and authentic Jews\" are much more varied than Neturei Karta. I'm not going to say they're not Jewish ... but more akin to how Christians can't deny the Westboro Baptist Church is Christian, or how al-Qaeda are Muslims. They're on the FRINGE of Judaism, to be sure. They shouldn't be used as your example for Jews as they're less than 0.01% of worldwide Jewry. Even other anti-Zionist Jews f**king hate them, because they consider more than their anti-Israel stance.
