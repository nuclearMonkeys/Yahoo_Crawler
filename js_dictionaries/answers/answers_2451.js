In this case you are supplying the green light, and you would like to know where the other component (the red) is coming from. Firstly, I am not sure what kind of HeNe laser you are using, because HeNe emits at the 632nm band (red), but I'm gonna assume you know your stuff and you have some pumping going on or whatever, and it is in fact emitting green.  The red is coming from the fluorescence of the red dye in the paper when exposed to photons of higher energy.  The green photons coming from your laser excite the red dyes in the paper and cause red light to be emitted (in the same way that it would be emitted when exposed to UV).   To test this effect, just try using a red laser on a piece of green fluorescent paper and see if you observe the same effect (a yellow dot).  Because the low energy red photons cannot excite the green dyes in the green fluorescent paper, no green light will be emitted and the dot will still be red.", 10978, "ej8ODhC4aa", 2],

	128394 : ["\"Since white is made up of equal parts of the three primary colors red, yellow, and blue, my logic tells me that non-primate mammals can not see white or gray because they can't see red and you need red to make white, and you need white to make gray.\" That is not correct. White light, such as from the sun or a light bulb, is made up of red and blue and all the frequencies between. If you mix red, green, and blue light, you can fool a human into thinking it's the same as white light, since humans only have three different color detectors. However someone who can see four colors can tell the difference. Now if you understand that, then you will understand that an animal that has only yellow and blue detectors will be fooled into think that a mix of yellow and blue is white. Well frankly so would we. But here is the other thing. Pure monochromatic green light is partway between yellow and blue, so it will stimulate their yellow and blue detectors about equally, just as white light would. But it will stimulate them both less. What is a less-stimulating version of white? Gray. That is to say, for an animal with only yellow and blue detectors, gray and green are the same color, and very bright green is the same color as white. So when you say, \"My logic says they see a very bright shade of perfect green in place of white,\" in some way you are right. However it's wrong to say \"in place of\". You can no more say they see green in place of white than you can say they see white in place of green. You are trying to say they can't see white because they are missing one of the colors of it. You can say that, when you admit you can't see white either, because there are more than three colors of it too. Instead of red, they would see grayish yellow. That's because red is near to yellow. It will stimulate their yellow detector almost as much as yellow, and their blue detector very little. \"Another thing, I have a red laser. In the darkness, I waved it in the direction my cat was starring in. I would suspect that my cat wouldn't see it because it's red - a color they're supposed to be blind of.\" That is not correct. You have red, green, and blue detectors, but you can see yellow, orange, and purple too. There is a difference between light being out of your visual range and light being not exactly matched to one of your color detectors. Cats can see red. Bees can't see red, but they can see ultraviolet. \"She thinks the \"void\" of not being able to see red light creates an illusion of absence of light (color) - and, since black is the absence of color, their brain would \"fill\" the red light that they can not see with black. I tried unsuccessfully to explain the flaw in her \"logic\". I explained that because white is made from equal parts of bright red, yellow, and blue, the absence of red does not darken what they see because the equally bright blue and yellow in what we see as white illuminates the color which they would see as a bright green.\" If it were true that something couldn't see red (for example bees), then instead of red they would see black. Saturated red color does not contain blue or green frequencies. The object that is red absorbs those frequencies, even if they exist in the ambient lighting. So they do not help something that can't see red to still see some light coming from that object.", 10978, "x9Bs0jkTaa", 1],

I mean people still claimed that the defense carried him while ignoring the fact that the defense blew for much of the season and ranked 27th. It wasn't until the Jets game where they finally started to click, Eli's comeback drives kept the team from matching their record from 2003 season. It's true that SB shouldn't be the measure of the player's greatness, in fact it's how the player contribute to the wins. Also regarding Marino, give him a good defense that knows how to stop the run and a running back that can run well, he'd get another shot for the ring. Too bad Shula stopped relying on that decided to ride on Marino's arm, sucks to be him. Jim Kelly on the other hand...now that's a choker.

	128403 : ["Hi Brandon, You're right! But the confusion might arise depending on the color system you are using, \"CMYK\" or \"Prang\": In CMYK Blue plus Yellow makes Black In Prang Blue plus Yellow makes Green (B+Y=Black in the CMYK color system where the primaries are Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow)  (B+Y=G in the Prang Color System where the primaries are Blue, Red, and Yellow.) In CMYK: Blue = Magenta + Yellow Magenta + Cyan + Yellow = Black Therefore: Blue + Yellow = Black Here are some quotes from sites about printing using CMYK: “To save money on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colors are produced by using black ink instead of the combination of cyan, magenta and yellow.” 	But… “A combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks soaks the paper with ink, making it slower to dry, and sometimes impractically so. This also can cause the ink to bleed. A combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks often results in a muddy dark brown color that does not quite appear black.”", 10978, "Aetr4vamaa", 2],

We see a specific color because the wavelengths of that color are reflected from the colored object and other wavelengths are not. Think also of the spectrum of visible light as being a continuum, not separate colors combined. As far as the names, Cyan, Magenta, to me as an artist are still blue and red. There are tens of different pigments which will make paint blue, red or yellow, but only a few which will be true enough to be the best primary colors.
