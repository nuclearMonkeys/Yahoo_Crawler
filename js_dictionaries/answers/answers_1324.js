It does seem much harder to sustain the number 1 rank than to reach it....but having said that England have had tough tours, with touring the sub continent and playing South Africa is always a challenge - but the number one team should be able to perform well under all conditions against all opposition - England haven't quite achieved that, but up until now they have been better than anyone else. I think Kevin Pietersen played a brilliantly at Headingly, but I wouldn't say that the draw was all down to him. Don't forget Matt Prior's contribution and in the second innings Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott held out for the draw. Over the last couple years,  players like Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott have been far more reliable batsmen that Kevin Pietersen has been, and the bowlers have been terrific. Of course Kevin Pietersen is a great player, and when he plays like he did at Headingly, he is a real asset to any team, but England's success hasn't been down to him, it's been down to every player performing at one time or another and England playing collectively well as a team and a lot of credit goes to Andrew Strauss and Andrew Flower. If there is any player who is harming the trust and unity that exists within the England camp, then the management is right to drop him, regardless of how good the player might be.....yes i do think that England look a slightly weaker side without Kevin Pietersen in the team, but i dont think we can underestimate the value of trust and unity within a team sport (especially such a mental one) like cricket.

	71810 : ["The similar situation could have occurred if Bradman was born in India. If India and SL were the starters of cricket (like Eng & Aus in reality) with few minnows like Bangla and Zim (as minnow teams SA, Ind & WI in real Bradman's days) assuming that there was an India version of Bradman who averaged 99.94 after playing 70% of his matches against one good opposition (SL) and the rest against minnows, would he be considered as the greatest by Aussies later? Wouldn't we hear complains like \"oh he has played only in S/Continent flat tracks against one good team plus minnows\", \"Oh he has never played on quality pitches outside the S/c\". I bet that at least there would be half of non S/C fans who refuse to claim the Indian Bradman was the best! But not the case in reality where we all accept the real Bradman as the best without any hesitations. So this has lot to do with how some fans think. So back to your question. What would have happened if we reverse Ponting & Tendulkar's country of birth? During T's career he has been very unlucky bcz his efforts were not credited enough due to the fact they were overshadowed by weak bowling efforts by India. How many times it has happened? Tendu scored his runs at a good pace(like his ODI st/rate shows) which is higher than most of the other greats. So he didn't waste time to reach his personal feats. It is even shown by the number of times he got out on 90's where he thought about the team's total and gave away his wicket playing riskily. Ponting's St/rate was below Sachin's which proves a point. We also can't deny that Sachin was always under enormous pressure of carrying 1 billion fan hopes on his shoulders. So if Sachin was an Aussie he would have even had a better record IMO considering that he would be surrounded by number of greats which would have helped him to bat with ease under less pressure. The Indian Ponting would have been a complete different character then. More of a character like Rahul Dravid as we cannot deny Ponting's ability to perform under-pressure and come up top like he has proved many times in his career including the 2003 WC final. As for leadership skills it would be like this. Just bcz you are a great player you can't be a great leader. So I don't really expect Shane Sachin to be a great leader for Australia despite the fact that he'd still be a successful leader considering the invincibility of the Australian team. On Ponting's case he could have been one of the good captains for India assuming his ability to handle the pressure. But surely he won't be successful like he has been for Australia, because he will have to lead the Indian team which is not invincible by any means. So 100 test wins are not on for both IMO.", 8646, "JkINOCoxaa", -1],
	71811 : ["There has been a specific paradigm shift inside the final 12 months. In the UAE England did have a good first innings lead within the final two experiment suits. They even bowled Pakistan out for under a one hundred in the 0.33 test though the spin bowlers were helped via the quickies who over finished in these stipulations. The thing was once they did not appear to have a plan when they had an skills, now they have a bit more nous on learn how to go about their business. Sure, at final England has a group that may play in all conditions. As for South Africa they are going to nonetheless be difficult to beat on the sub continent when you consider that despite the fact that they wouldn't have so much in the way in which of spinners themselves, their batsmen can nonetheless play spin well. They would no longer be the high-quality geared up to drive a result by way of a spin bowling assault but they is also able to maintain out for draws and stay at the high of the rankings because they'll win most of their home sequence'.", 8643, "dflTIzLhaa", 0],

If they weren't green carpet how on did SA pace attack wiped England out, winning match with an innings to spare. It seems weired excuses to justify last years loss by Indians (not majority if I may add), somehow England singled them out, and magically made them incompetent because pitches were good and fast. By any chance do you remember how much it rained during that period last year?  You didn't see England make any excuses at all when they lost in India. It was England to blame as they were unable to play against spin. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE between pitches India played on, and SA playing on now.  And whats with these theories England will make a slow pitch, when England are still weak against spin? What if on friday the pitch is same? It'll be plain stupid SA are no weak against spin. They're the only ones who beat India in Tests recently last time they were there. The pitch will be same.  KP has not been sidelined, its his own shenanigans, I remember very recently you stating the same thing. So you're ok with him bad mouthing his team mates, captain and the coach? So ECB should drop everything and make exceptions for KP? While to original question, of course he's being positive. Bring the team together, get the spirits up. However the main problem is batting and England team not attacking. They were playing too defensively against SA. There is no reason SA should've gone above 400 in the second match. All England bowlers had to do was go on full attack when they came back next day. Instead they gave them that opportunity and let them settle in. There is only one way, only one solution.

India got good players to replace him but they wanted him to go for 100 centuries. He got there. He is not Javed Miandad, even the last time Javed Miandad gone for win. He is more of a milestone player to me. I don't know what he really thinks of himself. What is he doing in the team!
