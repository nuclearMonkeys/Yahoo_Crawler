	41232 : ["Preventing tree roots from entering sewer pipe - have no trees within 1 mile of the sewer. Trees can send roots up to 1 mile in search of that water. You can use a root destroyer crystals in the drains to kill the roots. But it won't REMOVE the roots. You need a powerful drain auger with the correct attachment to remove them. But they WILL come back so long as there are any trees nearby. Some plumbing companies can do a trenchless sewer repair. That buys you more time. You have to contact them for details and pricing. How roots get into the sewer in the first place: The roots begin to wrap around the pipe trying to get the water. Tighter and tighter they get until they form a crack in the pipe or break the pipe complete. Roots use a kind of hydrostatic pressure to do the job.

But before you stress about it, think deep and ask yourself suppose its not your fault that they are running away or why you can have a stable one. if you cant seem to have an answer then check with your soul or your future. i know many people believe in reason and working hard to archive whatever they get but life goes deeper than that. take for an example luck .LUCK is success or failure apparently brought by chance rather than through one's own actions. If its success its called GOOD LUCK and if its failure its BAD LUCK. No body is born with bad luck we are all born pure, free in spirit and soul. But how nay people always get what they want? yet LUCK is forever crossing oour paths all the time. let me tell you a story    Once upon time there was a man who inherited much wealth from his father, but who led such an irregular and unwise life that in a short time he had spent everything, even to the last penny. Then he sat down, folded his arms upon his chest, and sighed as he thought of his unfortunate condition. His father's friends gathered about him to console him. One of them, an old and learned man, said to him: \"Son you have offended your luck who has run away from you. You would better go after your luck; per chance you can find it, and reconcile with it and become a fortunate man again,\" The man at once set out and traveled mountains and plains in search of his luck. One night he saw in his dreams that his luck was a human being like himself, who had fallen upon his face on the top of high mountain sighing and beating his chest all the time just as he himself had done. In the morning he got up and continued his journey towards that mountain. On his way he met the fairly lion, sitting upon a mound of earth beside the road.\"Don't be afraid, human being, proceed\" said the lion. And when the man approached the lion asked \" where are you going\", am going to find my luck said the man. \"Good!\" said the lion \" your luck is very wise: ask him what is the remedy for my disease. I have been an invalid for seven years if you find the right remedy i will reward you.\" \"very well\" said the man and went on his way. Soon he came to a very beautiful farm full of all kinds of fruits. picked some of the fruits and ate but they where all bitter. There upon the farmer came and asked where he was going. \"am going to find my luck\" said the man. \"Please ask your luck what is it should do for my fruits not to be bitter, i will reward you bountifully said the farmer. The man promised to ask his luck, and again went on his way. Soon he came to a beautiful palace situated in paradise whose soul inhabitant was a beautiful maiden. \"What man are you?\" asked the maiden, seeing the man, \"and why have you come?\" The man told her his story. you see, said the maiden, \" i have this splendid palace and measureless wealth and property; But am lonely please ask your luck about me and if you bring me a device to make me happy,i will reward you in bounty. The man promised , and went on his way until he came to the mountaintop where his luck had fallen on his face, He told him all his misfortunes and grief. His luck listened to him ad said; Everything is going to be well since you came here . Then the man asked of luck things he had promised to ask and received answers. After the man returned. On his way back he first met the maiden. And said \" your grief and loneliness will disappear as soon as you marry a young man of your choice. then he came to the farmer and said \" there is gold in the spring from which you get water to irrigate your fruits that's why your fruits are bitter. you have to clean the water then your fruits will be sweet. Then he came to the fairly lion and told him he had seen his luck and the message he had brought to the farmer and the maiden. \" And what present did the maiden give you\", asked the lion. \" she said i should marry her\" answered the man, but i refused. \"And what reward did the farmer give you\" asked the lion. \"He took out all the gold from the spring to clean his water and gave it to me but i refused i didn't want to carry a heavy load\", And what advice did your luck give you for me\" asked the lion, \"He said the moment you eat an idiot's head you shall be healed\" answered the man, The lion looked in the man's face and said \"By heaven i cannot find a greater idiot than you on the face of this earth\", and he bite off the man's head.  Am BABA MUSA  of handsofnatures.com YOU SEE IN LIFE TIME we always have a chance but do we acknowledge those chances, not every chance come pure and clean.

	41253 : ["I'll offer a tiny bit of insight that hopefully you'll get something out of. The grief process applies to a whole lot more than just one type of loss or grief. The relationship you and your husband had prior to your discovery is metaphorically “dead.”  And with it went trust elements, the respect you had for a “faithful husband,” etc.  He knows this. The relationship you have now is something very different because of the infidelity.  Of course it can work and recover; however, the “death” of the old one feels very real for both of you. The grief process applies to your former marriage relationship.  First stage: denial...everything going along almost normally, seemingly too easy?  Second stage: bargaining, where you may think to yourself, “maybe if I do this or that everything will go back to the way it was.”  And because it can't?  Third stage is anger. And that will show up in all sorts of ways. You sound like you're still in that bargaining stage, (maybe still in denial?) making concessions and trying to fix and control things back to the way it was.  Do a little reading on grief so you can recognize what's going on around you. I'm no therapist or professional anything.  I'm just a guy who's been around and experienced a lot. I know that once I have a little idea on where emotions are coming from, I can deal with them and other people better. I hope this helps you and I wish you the best.", 6023, "RKD60nJnaa", 4],

	41280 : ["You have to try to get off of it. It can actually destroy dopamine neurons in your brain. It's been hypothesized that's why comedian Robin Williams developed Lewy Body Dementia. Because he did a lot of cocaine during a certain period of his life. It's really nothing to mess around with.  I'm pretty sure I have some dopamine damage to my brain as well, not that I ever did cocaine, but some stupid psychiatrists I went to had me on some antidepressants including one called Wellbutrin for a while which is known to have some of the same effects that's cocaine does. It's sometimes called ”poor man's cocaine” because people try to get it from psychiatrists and then they grind it up into a powder and snort it. These things can destroy your brain. So I definitely have some drug-induced Parkinsonian symptoms because of these types of antidepressants that I took over the years. Parkinson's disease is also the result of damage to the dopamine producing areas of the brain just like Lewy Body Dementia. You only get one brain. And when the brain goes, everything else goes as well. Because it runs the whole show. If you have to do something radical to stop this habit like finding a new circle of friends who aren't into cocaine, then you might have to do that.
