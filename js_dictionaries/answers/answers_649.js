	36270 : ["Most NBA teams are lucky to have one superstar player and then four other good starters. Normally their bench is made up of supporting players who might have been starters at one point, but now are only useful for limited minutes. However, the Lakers spent big money to get several starters and two superstar players in LBJ and AD. You could split this team up and have two good teams. The only other team with more superstar players is the Nets, but they have a more normal bench. The Lakers are heavily the favorites to win another championship because they are stacked with talent. The commissioner probably should have stepped in and stopped this from happening to help keep the teams more fair. In the past, the basketball commissioner would not allow a team to be made up of all-star players or so heavily stacked with talent by way of free agency. It is different if the team drafts well and ends up with a super team, but buying up all the best players is something we used to only see the Yankees do in baseball and not something that was allowed in basketball. Many people who are not fans of the Lakers think they are cheating. The Lakers have the best team because they bought the best players to create this super team. Â ", 5435, "fBHyn7iUaa", -3],
