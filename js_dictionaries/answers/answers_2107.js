	111151 : ["Hmmm. A million dollars versus eternal life...let me see...hmm. Most people would pay a million dollars for eternal life, would they not? So keep the money. You need it more than I do. If I'm willing to give up my life to gain life, then how much more am I willing to give up a million dollars. (Mark 8:35-37) If I reject a million dollar gift, have I lost anything? No. If I accept it, I may lose my eternal life. If not by accepting it, then by letting it corrupt me. Sherry B is correct. Jehovah's Witnesses do not have a restriction on accepting   gifts that I have seen. But this is the rub for me: by accepting a   gift, I open myself up to accusation. Either they say \"I gave you a gift, now you have to reciprocate or you are sinning,\" or they say \"You accepted a gift, so your faith must not mean that much to you,\" or it is a bribe and they will expect a favor. But if I reject the gift, their feelings may be hurt, but that's not my problem. Everyone who knows me knows my stand, and if I have to explain it to them and they still want to force the gift on me, that's their problem, not mine. They alone are guilty respecting themselves. No matter how you look at it, it is a blood gift and I will not accept it. Besides, if I am not supposed to accept a birthday gift meant for myself, why would I accept a birthday gift meant for Jesus? The difference between gifts is intent. If they say it is a   or birthday gift, then it is an obligation. Any other gift may simply be out of their heart. However, I would reject the million dollars even if it weren't for   for the reasons I stated above. Though if it is willed to me, I will take 2% to pay off my hospital bills and other debts and give the rest away. As for holiday bonuses, the company cannot, by law, take it back, and they are an expression of thanks for production, not just a   gift. I would not be guilty respecting it in either of these two cases. As a note, no witness would ever apply the money to a political end, as we are no part of this world. Involvement in politics is a disfellowshipping offense. (John 15:18-19; 1 Corinthians 4:8-14; 5:9-13)", 10162, "None", 0],

I also know that you are not being honest to him or yourself.  He should consider his wife's feelings, but by the same reasoning you should try and live by the same bible principles that he does.

Their Utopia beer comes in a brass-looking fermentation vat.  I wouldn't suggest buying the actual beer because it is very costly but you might look for empties on ebay.

They've always been quite popular with classic rockers from my generation...but some of the younger classic rock fans coming of age during the 80's - present may have lost out due to overshadowing by the big mainstream bands; Cream, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, etc.  I own pretty much all of Savoy Brown's LP's on original UK vinyl (Decca Records) along with spare copies of each on the the US/Canadian \"Parrot Records\". Everything from the debut LP in 1967 \"Shake Down\" with the short lived lineup of Brice Portious (vocals), and Martin Stone (guitars), who shared this duty with Kim Simmonds, all the way up to the highly underrated/overlooked 1981 release \"Greatest Hits - Live\"...this is a great double album release, and I've always failed to see why many are unaware of its existence. Perhaps the words \"Greatest Hits\" scared some away? Not sure...but if you ever see a copy...be sure to grab it, as it's never been reissued on CD...one of my favourite live albums, and Kim's playing is at its best. The album also contains my favourite versions of \"Hellbound Train\"...the lineup was a bit different here, with Ralph Mormon (vocals) who also sang with The Joe Perry Project/early 80's, and the amazing John Humphrey (Jean Luc Ponty) on bass. It's his superb bass intro and solo that sets this version of Hellbound Train apart from all others IMO. This is what the double LP looks like: Here's the track listing...as you can see, .lots of classics here. Each rendition is quite lengthy: Though admittedly, my preferred phase of this great band was with Chris Youlden on vocals...\"Getting To The Point\"(1968) - \"Raw Sienna\"(1970)...which by the way might just be my all-time favourite Savoy Brown album. Such a nice mix of acoustic rock, mixed with jazz...beautiful! Here's a couple of my favourite songs from the \"Raw Sienna\" LP... Stay While The Night Is Young... I'm Crying... I could continue pasting links all day, 'cause honestly...where does one stop when it comes to Savoy Brown? So many fantastic albums, all with such diversity. Another phase that I enjoyed a lot...with ex-Blodwyn Pigsters, Andy Pyle(bass) and Ron Berg(drums), not to mention the great Stan Webb (ex Chicken Shack/Broken Glass) on guitars...not much in the way of videos to be found on YouTube, sorry. Edit -  I could have posted more of my favourite songs...but you and David have already done that :)", 10169, "srtoPxN2aa", 0],
