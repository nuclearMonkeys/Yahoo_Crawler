Get the performance they wanted for a great price... Go to the Drag strip or just enjoy.... And it worked In 2004 they brought the GTO back after teasing the public with the 1999 Show version. And they FORGOT the concept MAKE it affordable for everyone !!! With performance. The cost was to be 14999 to loaded 19995 it was going to be an overnight hit again..... Price tags grew before the car hit the land off the boat... Basic model 21995 but you could not get the basic car... prices jumped 22555.00 to 30000.00 Everyone that wanted one test drove it 60% walked away and never looked back. In 2005 they built enough to have 3500 left over for the  year 2006 to sell... In 2006 Pontiac pulled the plug... And looked at it from another view it just wasn't going to sell good enough in 2006 to keep going... And the G8 was brought to the Same table, go after the BMW, Mercedes customers with a 4door model and keep in under 30,000 ... They have made it. I like the 50 cent (rapper) version... Pulling the plug was a good thing people could still buy a brand new 06 GTO in DEC 2007 there were 156 GTO cars still in Dec 07 to sell  coast to coast ?

	106011 : ["Wow, all these idiots are completely wrong. At the time Pontiac no longer had a flagship model.  The Bonneville was about be be on it's last year.  The Grand Prix was overgoing a major restyle and the Firebird was already dead for two years. Bob Lutz in GM fell in love with the Holden Monaro and thought it would be a good business case to temporarily fill a niche @ Pontiac for a powerful RWD coupe. So it was quickly modified for US standards, and dropped onto our laps.  Planned US modifications like a scooped hood, and SPLIT dual exhaust didn't make it in time, but was done in 2005. The car was never cancelled.  The car had already been in production in austrailia since 2001 and was slated to cease in 2005, as a NEW generation was to be coming out.  Instead the GTO's presence actually extended production another year for them as well until 2006.  Also due to importing rules, they could only build and ship so many here to the US.  Thats why there weren't alot of them produced. Even currently, there is no 2-door coupe in the next generation thats currently out (think, two door coupe of the G8)  Only so far there has been a concept. Initially right with '08 There was supposed to be a new G8 and GTO, but GM rushing the newest generation of trucks killed ALL REAR WHEEL DRIVE products in the pipeline.  That includes a Buick GS, a Pontiac GTO, as well as a Chevy Impala. Also somebody mentioned the price of the car.  It cost 33k.  The cost of the Holden counterpart was around 65-70k in USD.

However, one of my best friends dropped well over $200.00 on a first date that ended up going nowhere.  If he's the type to overreact, don't get too excited.   Also, look at the negative possibilites.  I don't know this guy at all, so I mean no offense in the following.  If you dated about 2 years ago, and he's suddenly going to fly from coast to coast just to see you, has he been pining over you since you broke up?  Is this guy possibly obsessed with you?  Hopefully not, but it's something to think about.  What if he flies out and you feel nothing for him, but you can't get rid of him?   I hope I've helped, but I realize I probably raised more questions than I answered.  The bottom line is: It's a big deal, good or bad! A)  He really likes you and it will go somewhere.

Wallahi we have become a sad state, and it is no one Else's fault but ours as many are away from Quran and Sunnha. Only when we return back to the Haq (truth) justice will be given to us.

One of the companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) asked: 'O Messenger of Allah! Will that relate to being few in numbers?'

	106032 : ["All creatures need an energy source. They can be autotrophs like plants and photosynthesize from the sun or they can be heterotrophs and eat another organism. Weather it is an herbivore like a horse that eats grass or a carnivore like a wolf that eats mice, herbivores, omnivores, & carnivores are all heterotrophs. They all eat other organisms for energy rather than make it for themselves like plants. Non herbivores, like wolfs, digest carbohydrates, protein and fat by enzymatic action in their stomach. This gives them an efficient digestion of their type of food. Their digestive system is short and works rapidly digesting the raw meat and bones.  Their teeth are well adapted to puncture and shear meat from the carcass but gives them little ability to chew so they swallow their food in large chunks. Their molars in the upper jaw are modified into blades, or carnassials, which can cut flesh but also have grinding areas to crush bones. They have just the one stomach so they can produce a very acidic environment necessary for starting digestion of lumps of meat and bones. It also destroys harmful bacteria they get when they go back to old kills.  The gut is simple and only about five times the length of the animal.  Ruminants (cattle, sheep and deer) use bacteria in the fore stomachs to digest fiber by fermentation and use enzymatic digestion in the small intestines.  A horse has energy & protein requirements, as other animals do, but differs in the ordering of their digestive system, falling between a ruminant and a carnivore. Horses digest grain in the fore gut by enzymatic action and hay in the hindgut by fermentation. Horses stomachs work in the reverse order of ruminants. This means they begin digesting protein, & fat like the wolf does but go on to digest the cellulose from the plants they eat and the wolf doesn't. This gives them a much longer digestive system than the wolf at about 100 feet. Horses evolved to graze with their heads down at ground level eating grasses for many hours a day, eating about 3% of their body weight each day. Their teeth are shaped to tear plant stems then grind & shred the cell walls before swallowing. This is called grazing dentition.", 9948, "YYLybWHSaa", 0],
