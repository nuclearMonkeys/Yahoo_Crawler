They don't have to worry about their money running out before their next paycheck or retirement benefit.  They don't have to be driving a 20 year old car (I have a 1999 Honda Civic) and hope it lasts as long as they do.  So they enjoy peace of mind knowing that they have the money to cover whatever they need - and want - without having to take out loans. They can afford to eat out every day if they wish - in fine restaurants.  Can't remember when I could last afford a meal in a nice restaurant.  They can go on vacations whenever they wish for as long as they wish and where they wish.  I haven't been able to go on a 3 day in-state vacation in several years. They will have a comfortable retirement.  If they need a caregiver they can afford to hire them and be cared for in their own home.

Aside from the obvious technical challenges of building two 40-kilometer (25 mi) bridges or a more than 80-kilometer (50 mi) tunnel across the strait, another major challenge is that, as of 2021, there is nothing on either side of the Bering Strait to connect the bridge to.Russian sideThe Russian side of the strait, in particular, is severely lacking in infrastructure. No railways exist for over 3,200 kilometers (2,000 mi) in any direction from the strait.[19]The nearest major connecting highway is the M56 Kolyma Highway, which is currently unpaved and around 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) from the strait.[20] However, by 2025, the Anadyr Highway is planned to be built connecting Ola and Anadyr, which is only about 600 kilometers (370 mi) from the strait.[21]American sideOn the American side, an estimated 1,200 kilometers (750 mi) of highways or railroads would have to be built around Norton Sound, through a pass along the Unalakleet River, and along the Yukon River to connect to Manley Hot Springs Road – in other words, a route similar to that of the Iditarod Trail Race. A project to connect Nome, 100 miles (160 km) from the strait, to the rest of Alaska by a paved highway (part of Alaska Route 2) has been proposed by the Alaskan state government, although the very high cost ($2.3 to $2.7 billion, about $5 million per mile, or $3 million per kilometer) has so far prevented construction.[22]", 5936, "BZnWmkofaa", 2],
