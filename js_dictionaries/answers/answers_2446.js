	128120 : ["If you think it isn't healthy for her to go through what she is going through right now, you have rights to tell her. You have to keep her updated on what's going on in life and that she needs to remember to be careful. As a friend, I'm sure you are very concern and worry for her safety. I would be too if things like that happen. If it gets any worst or that you feel that you have to tell her right away then do what you have to do. I wouldn't risk on losing a friend to someone who makes fun of her and such, but by the looks of it...it seems rather normal for them to go through with that. Never have I experience something like that before, but I have seen couples do that once and awhile at my school. As long that your friend doesn't get hurt or injured in some ways then it's okay to let things like that happen, but if something were to happen such as her getting her feelings her really bad and that she cries to you like there's no tomorrow then that is when you have to step up and tell the person to back off before you call report them for what they done. Overall, I think it's normal for a guy to make fun of a girl that way because many people have different relationships with each other. Love is a mystery and people show it many different ways.", 10968, "83e3f54d66520f1c7e112babb64470d6aa", 0],

He may be wrestling in his mind over whether he is gay. It just doesn't sound right. Yes, there is lots of teasing going on back and forth. That is a smoke screen. Something is just not right here.  Think about it.", 10968, "None", 1],
	128122 : ["Call me crazy, but I was never into the huge bulging macho man...  they look weird to me.  I like a guy who can whoop the big guy and not have to look like a monstrosity himself.  My husband is fit and in great shape (soldier), but he is not hugely weird looking like some of the guys.  He can lift much more than anyone might expect.  He has endurance and can run 6 miles daily without complaining, and he took down a huge guy, literally about 2 1/2 times his size who had a confrontation with his mother, it was totally hot!  He is very good at MMA and alot of guys with their big bad muscles do not expect to be in a submission by the average sized man.  In combatives he was kickin tail all over tha place.  I think this is the perfect man... which is what attracted me to him. A macho guy is typically the weird steroid injected  football jock who put a mirror in front of his weight set and kisses his \"guns\" and lusts after himself.  The preferred guy is hard working, he would not realize just how sexy he is, his natural muscles compliment his body, that endure like an energizer bunny, he loves his momma, wife, and daughters and would put to shame any man that harmed them! Then there are the wimps that are scrawny bony, running to momma men, and there is the in between... Type of girl (he is not average/normal though, he stands out for a lot of reasons not as goofy as monster guns)... well when I went for him I was an all around straight A student, athlete, varsity & then college cheerleader, Christian, church going gal.  Had many date opportunity's I never even considered besides him...  (including the quarter back, which I thought was a gay set up cheerleader/Qb,,, retarded)  Now... I am married to him with a 5 year old and a 2 1/2 month old. He is definitely a man's man! Hard working soldier who breaks a sweat without pissing and moaning.", 10967, "uUXB54HMaa", 1],
	128123 : ["A macho idiot is any guy who automatically thinks that any other guy who does not like football or does not have a tattoo is gay. Macho tools also show no emotion and think they are God's gift to women, oh and usually they have a big beer gut.", 10967, "None", 1],

Race has nothing to do with love and it is a shame that people will try to hurt someone else because they are not the same color as someone they happen to fall in love with.

But I think there are explanations for them, for instance I had heard descriptions of what the house looked  like and its interior and my brain had probably formed a picture of it that I wasn't aware of, and of the people who I dreamed had died, one was really obese and one was a heavy smoker, so I probably had been thinking that they would probably die soon and it was just coincidence. If you really said that it's probably a phrase that you heard in a song somewhere, I highly doubt that you're some kind of walking Rosetta Stone,  though it's probably possible.
