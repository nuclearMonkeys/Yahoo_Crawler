Military experience doesn't count unless you will be doing something for the IRS that requires similar skills to what you did in the military.  What your military experience does more than anything is simply let you be hired in the first place, as you have preference over a non-vet.  If you are a GS-4 step 4, then you will not be eligible for a WIGI (within-grade increase to step 5) for two years, two more years to 6, two more years to 7, then three years for each step afterward, up to ten.  It's likely that you will be selected for promotion to a higher grade before you get more steps, unless you are on a term appointment and are thus not eligible for internal promotions.  Here is the pay chart.    The base chart is at the top, but find your city in the list and click on that chart to find your total salary including locality pay, which really varies from area to area.  If your city isn't listed, then go to he bottom and find \"rest of the United States\" and use that chart.  A GS-4 step 4 in RUS (rest of the United States) earns $30,788 per year.

	73161 : ["All of them! Actually there are three verses that I think are very deep and don't often get quoted or commented upon. And sometimes the last of the three is mistranslated. I think the following translation by John Ross Carter and Mahinda Palihawadana makes it clear by simply not translating the key terms:  277. When through wisdom one perceives,        \"All sankharas are transient,\"         Then one is detached as to misery.        This is the path of purity. 278. When through wisdom one perceives       \"All sankharas are suffering,\"       Then one is detached as to misery.       This is the path of purity. 279. When through wisdom one perceives,        \"All dhammas are without self,\"       Then one is detached as to misery.       This is the path of purity. \"Sankharas\" in this context means \"conditioned phenomena\" though in other contexts it can mean \"mental formations\" or \"habit-patterns. \"Dhamas\" in this context means all phenomena whatsoever - including the unconditioned which is identified with nirvana and in other texts (the Udana if I remember correctly) it is called the unborn and the deathless.  These three verses are basically stating what are called the \"Three Seals of the Dharma\" - that all things are impermanent, ultimately unsatisfactory, and provide no basis for a fixed, isolated, unchanging selfhood. What is interesting is that the first two verses apply onto to conditioned phenomena, but the third applies even to the unconditioned. This points to the Mahayana teaching that all things are empty, which is to say empty of a self. So these three verses affirm the Three Seals of the Dharma and the Mahayana teaching of emptiness and demonstrate the continuity between the Pali Canon and the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras. That is why I find them particularly interesting, and they are rarely ever remarked upon.  Namu Myoho Renge Kyo, Ryuei", 8709, "40ZEiFgeaa", 0],

While in training at Oklahoma City at the FAA academy you will recieve on top of your salary $79.20 per day in per diem (that is, non taxable income) 7 days a week 30-31 days a month for however long you are at the academy. Per diem is not locality. Your locality is added to the roughly 17K a year you make in the academy and Per Diem is on top of that.   Locality rate is a percentage added to your base salary all federal employees get. Base locality is I BELIEVE 13.86% and at its highest goes to around 28% in the Houston area.
