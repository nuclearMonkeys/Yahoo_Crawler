You need thin oils to moisturize while dissolving and clearing gunk in your poors. Try fish oil or seafood. 2 tsp fish oil a day or 4 servings of seafood a week. Stick it out for at least 2 months; it will take a long time to replace all your oil. Any effect after 1-2 days is temporary or random; so even if it makes you break out a little at first, you haven't given it a full try yet.  In the short term you can wash and moisturize well, but that will only go so far. Plus excessive washing can be drying and excessive moisturizing can be clogging. Use a small amount of a light moisturizer, made with oil not jelly or grease. Often that means soybean oil or mineral oil. Mineral oil means mined from the ground. So soybean oil is usually better, though mineral oil won't cause too much harm. Clean with soap and water, not a harsh acne cleanser. Even then they only work so well. So you really need the seafood.  Antibiotics aren't really good for bacteria long term, they'll come back in force after. Short term they may help. After you get off them find some kefir with acidophilus listed first or 2nd to replace the friendly bacteria they destroyed. Studies show less illness when you have these bacteria, even outside the stomach in places such as the lungs and elsewhere. You want friendly bacteria to fill the void when the antibiotics stop, not harmful ones.  In the short term you might also try 100,000+ iu retinol vitamin A (a megadose, and too much for normal use) or one of the acne drugs that is similar to retinol vitamin A. It's some minor harm to your organs, but it helps against bacteria on your skin. At least it doesn't have the other long term drawbacks to your skin that antibiotics and many scrubs do.

	109578 : ["Yes, I had the same problem. I'm using Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Scrub and Retin-A (tretinoin) and most of my acne and acne scars are gone and I had really bad dark scars covering my forehead and now they are mostly faded now. And also always use a sunblock to prevent further blemishing and drink lots of water daily. Theres also authentic black soap (which is really brown) whcih can be bought from Amazon, Ebay, or flea markets. All of these are very cost-effective and have worked the best for me. You should choose an acne product that may contain the following: 1. ISOTRETINOIN  This ingredient can reduce oil or sebum production, soothes the inflammation in the form of pimples, pustules and cysts and can also help unblock the clogging of pores. However, use of this product can also result to side effects such as dryness and scaling of the skin, particularly on the lips. 2. ALCOHOL AND ACETONE  This is a mainstay ingredient in cleansers as well as astringents. They are effective in removing dirt and oils from the skin. They can cause stinging or a burning sensation on the skin. Some dermatologists would advise against using these products on your face if you have severe acne, however, it can prevent the increase of break-outs if you use it regularly at the onset of acne. 3. SALICYLIC ACID  This ingredient aims to dissolve comedones or whiteheads through the removal of dead cells inside the hair follicles. This in turn prevents the pores from being clogged allowing oil or sebum to pass through unimpeded. It has the effect of stinging and in the first few days of use, it can cause mild redness. Some products have a maximum of 2 percent salicylic acid in their preparation. However, for some people, a stronger mixture can be prepared depending on your skin's needs. 4. BENZOYL PEROXIDE  This is considered the most active ingredient in acne treatment. It is basically an anti-bacterial ingredient that helps remove bacteria in the follicles. It also has the effect of dissolving comedones which is an early sign of acne. Some products have Benzoyl peroxide ingredient from 2.5 to 10% worth. Again, it depends on the severity of your acne. This is recommended for early onset acne and for prevention. Side effects would include dryness and scaling in some and redness and swelling in others.  5. SULFUR  This is rarely used alone as a product. This is actually included in acne products as an additional help to reduce acne. They remove dead skin cells and excess oil. A keratolytic preparation has drying effects on the skin. It can also cause soreness, especially at the start of the treatment. If this persists, it is advised that use of the product be discontinued until the side effects subside. A change to a lower dosage can also help.", 10100, "None", 1],

Bunnies absolutely hate getting picked up, because they get scared when all four feet aren't on the ground. They are the prey animal in the wild, so when someone picks them up, they automatically think \"I'm going to get eaten!\". Try not to pick it up until it shows that it trusts you, no matter how tempting it is. They may look like stuffed animals, but they can really bite and scratch. When I got my bunny about 5 days ago, I didn't pick her up until she started licking me, and eating from my hand, because I knew that this was a sign that she trusted me. And even then, I only pick her up when I absolutely have to (to clean her cage, check her teeth, trim her nails). When I do pick her up, I make sure that she's close to the ground, so that she doesn't get scared. Also try to keep it in a quiet room, where your kids aren't allowed. You definitely shouldn't have any more company over on it's first day at it's new home, because it needs time to adjust to it's surroundings, and the disco ball falling doesn't sound good.

As well as being a great natural moisturizer it can also help with acne, Jojoba Oil penetrates into the skin without clogging pores and is suitable for all skin types it contains vitamin E and antioxidants which are great for fighting aging signs and moisturizing the skin.   Studies on jojoba oil show that it has the ability to prevent skin from becoming too oily. This is due to the fact that putting jojoba oil on our skin can trick our cells into thinking they have produced enough oil.   Remove any surface dirt from your skin, then put just a few drops of jojoba oil into your hand and rub it into your skin when you start to work jojoba oil into the skin, the oil penetrates into the pores. As jojoba closely resembles  your skin's own oil, moisturizing with jojoba oil sends the message to your pores to stop overproducing the sebum that causing the oily skin.", 10100, "fldSA7X9aa", 1],
