I have looked through my wife's Fifth Ed, and I do not see a format for this anywhere. The Psychologists are tough, and if you cannot quote from the original paper, it SEEMS as though you can't use it.  Do you have an APA Pub Manual?  Chapter 3-34 shows to block off quotes of more than 40 words, without quotation marks. I don't see anywhere quotes within quotes. I will check with my wife in the morning as she is sleeping now. She will be working on her doctoral dissertation and can probably tell me. I will abridge this if I get a better answer for you.  However, if you are going to be writing to APA standards, you really need to get a handbook. You can order one at www.apa.org/books/ or at 800-374-2721.

You were being more than reasonable to try to accommodate her when you didn't have to and she doesn't want to compromise so put him in daycare for that day and Grandma will have to get over it. It's a nice offer but not really. She is doing it for selfish reasons not to help you out since she knows it will cost you more money then daycare to drive there and back twice the day she watches him. Plus gas is going up so it's only going to get more expensive. I would say thanks for the offer but we are going to stick with his daycare. It's more economical for us right now. Explain that it's an hour round trip and back so two hours of driving when you can just drop him off a few minutes away and currently cost the same as his daycare for gas plus there is no guarantee that the price of gas won't go up while your daycare will stay the same.", 10341, "D8x0w6FMaa", 0],

Equal time for McCain would have surely helped Republicans during the Democratic primary. I do not know if I am against it since we have no idea what it would be. There has been one sentence said about it by one Democrat and months of the RNC telling people that Democrats plural want it. It is not even clear if the one Democrat really wanted a fairness doctrine back. They just said it one time. Maybe it was a joke.

	113175 : ["Oh, I LOVE these questions. I worked very happily in my local libraries and in Borders until I had to take a job that paid more. Here are some books that your daughters might like: 1. Anything by Marguerite Henry. All her books are very age appropriate and are about horses. Try Misty of Chincoteague first. It's about a boy and a girl (siblings) on the Eastern Shore of MD/VA who want a horse very badly. They take part in the pony roundup (which actually happens every year) and their adventure starts there. You can also try the King of the Wind, which is the story of a legendary Arabian stallion. 2. Try How to Eat Fried Worms by Thomas Rockwell. It's about a boy who makes a bet that he can eat 15 worms a day for 15 days. If he does it, he gets a brand new bike. It was required reading when I was in elementary school, but I loved it! It sounds gross, but there are some good life lessons in it.  3. The Henry and Ribsy books by Beverly Cleary are great. They are adorable books that I loved when I was a kid. She also wrote the Runaway Ralph and the Mouse and His Motorcycle, which are very fun books! 4. If your daughters are more advanced readers, they might like the Brian Jaques books...he writes a series about talking animals who have various adventures. The first one is called Redwall. There must be well over 20 titles by now. The setting is quasi-medival and there IS an element of violence in these books, but the good guys always come out on top. 5. Eragon and Eldest by Christopher Paolini are both very good books. They have the added draw of being written by a 15 year old...well, he started the books when he was 15... They are about a boy (suprise, he's 15) who finds and befriends a dragon. 6. Bruce Coville has written a number of books that might be worth a look. I thoroughly enjoyed Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher, when I was younger. Again, it's about a boy who finds and befriends a dragon. Bruce Coville also wrote the \"My Teacher is an Alien\" series of books, which are a lot of fun.  7. The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis. I'll be suprised if nobody else suggests these. I know they're in vogue at the moment, and that they are heavily laden with Christian overtones, but they are wonderful books. Very empowering for kids.  8. Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is another classic book. It's about a boy who survives a plane crash in the woods. He is alone and lost and manages to survive until he is rescued. This one is more intense - there is a scene in which he sees a dead body that I still remember all these years later - but it is an EXCELLENT book that teaches kids just how tough they can be when they have to be. Again, very empowering. There is a sequel to this book, but it's not as good as the first. 9. The Harry Potter books - they really are good reads. 10. Roald Dahl wrote a LOT of wonderful books for younger readers. Try Matilda, Witches, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are good for starters. :) I hope your daughters get to read some of these this summer. I loved all of these books and always like to see them passed along to new generations of young readers!", 10338, "AA10021946", 1],
