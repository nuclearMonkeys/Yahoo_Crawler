We got a blow up owl (found at bird stores, camping stores ect...) we put it on the corner of the deck right by our window and it did the trick.  I really don't know why it works but it does, I think maybe because it is bigger than the birds and it is a top preditor.  Good luck!

	127972 : ["No.  The only reason *I* can see for castration is if there is a health issue or if the owner is too much of an idiot to make sure the dog doesn't reproduce. Most of what you're going to hear here are a bunch of people tell you that you're imagining any change.  As someone who has had a LOT of adult and older dogs spay/neutered I can HONESTLY say I have never had a dog spay/neutered who did NOT have some degree of personality change (yes, calmer *IS* a change) and who did not require LESS food with the same amount of activity (1 b*tch who I worked in agility I spayed at age 4+ years - she went from eating 2 cups of kibble a day or a lb of raw meat to 2/3 of a cup of kibble or a 6 oz of meat).  In double coated dogs the change in coat amount and texture is extreme for some dogs - ask any long time Samoyed breeder about \"Spayed b*tch coat\" if you want to hear a bunch of expletives. My opinion - The average person SHOULD spay/neuter their dog.  BUT they should be going into it with their eyes open and knowing what possible changes there might be. I just spayed nearly 6 year old Dora 3 months ago.  She now has more coat than she's ever had in her life and I've cut her food intake by half to keep her from getting fat (no change in activity level).  Only real personality change - she's become a food driven maniac because of the \"diet\" to keep her in good weight. Sure - its anecdotal \"evidence\" - but since I've had it occur with multiple dogs I tend to see it as a side effect that I must take into consideration.", 10962, "None", 1],

I don't think there is a problem with your dog's activity level & there is certainly nothing wrong with his brain.  I think the problem is with your attitude & perception of things. There are plenty of neutered top performance dogs out there. I see them everyday. There has been no change in their drive, their intelligence, nor their working ability. Your dog isn't any different. Quit whining, get up & do something with him!  A lazy dog is the product of a lazy owner! If you want him to do more, get busy!!!!! Neuter or don't neuter your dogs in the future. Doesn't matter to me. It's a personal choice. All I care about is if people are going to keep intact animals that they are responsible enough to manage those intact animals. For the average pet owner......let's face it, they aren't reponsible enough! That's why people preach spay & neuter!", 10962, "None", 1],

For those who have a hard time with reading comprehension, the first statistic on health risks is the only one that deals with juvenile neuter. ----------------------------- On balance, it appears that no compelling case can be made for neutering most male dogs, especially immature male dogs, in order to prevent future health problems. The number of health problems associated with neutering may exceed the associated health benefits in most cases.
