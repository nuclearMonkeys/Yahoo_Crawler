This made Frannie mad and she told Casey that \"I created you and I can destroy you\". To do this Frannie told Evan that Casey was going to dump him after he cheated on her but that she stayed with him for his last name and the power of it not because she actually loves him. Frannie also told Evan that Casey is still in love with Cappie.  Evan confronted Casey about it. After Evan asked Casey if the time she slept with Cappy as revenge for him sleeping with Rebecca was the last time anything happened between her and Cappie. Casey admitted that she and Cappie kissed while working on their paper. Casey told Evan it didn't mean anything and that she loved him and was planning a future with him. He told her that she only loved herself and now that she was the sorority president she didn't need him anymore. So they broke up. Rusty was at a party and found Cappie and Rebecca Logan in bed together.  At the end they show Rusty waiting for a bus to the airport as he had missed his flight. Cappie comes along and brings up the night before (him and Rebecca in bed). While they are standing there Casey drives by on her way home. She sees Rusty standing there and backs up. She asks him what he is still doing there. He says he missed his plane. He asks her what is wrong with her. She tells him it's a long story that she promises to tell him on the long drive home. He gets in the car and they show Casey looking at Cappie as she is leaving. End of season. I can't wait for the new season to start. I love Greek!", 8319, "AA12281535", 0],

	66068 : ["Ur pitching is about 7. Dan Haren and brad penny are amazing while Bobby Jenks is a good closer and Bronon Arroyois gonna be better. Pedro will be healthy but I dont think Perez will have a good serason, but Blanton might. Accardo is average. Ivan Rodriguez has good defense, but his offense hasnt been very good the last few seasons so dont excpect many points from him/ I wouldnt excpect Pena to have the same year he had last year so not as much points as last year. Cano is solid and always will be. Same with A-Rod. I wouldnt excpect a big year from Cabrera either, but I'd still choose him as a starter over Hudson. Carlos Lee and Ichiro should have good years next year. Aaron Rowand may have a better year than he did last year, but not as many RBI's. Ellsburry will need to prove himself, Hudson will be good incase Cano gets injured. LaRoche is an average player as well is Cameron.

Growing up in West Virginia, I loved the splashes of brightly colored leaves painted over the former canvas of green. The first time you step outside onto the porch in the early morning, the crisp, cool air carries with it the scent of high school football, band bus rides and hot chocolate in the stadium stands with friends.  It reminds me of simpler times filled with the sound of crunching leaves under your feet during a walk and the curiosity of why people would rake them up and away when they were so much more fun to shuffle through and look at. It gently nudges me with the reminder that the first snowfall is right around the corner. Ahhh... Nice question. Have a great holiday.", 8319, "qCLSJEU7aa", 1],

You don't have a second round pick on your team...closest thing is V-Mart, and he shouldn't be taken until the end of the third at best...therefore, this team could have been a ton better.  Your infield is decent, but you really shouldn't have Pedroia as a starting 2B in any league, unless it is a 20 manager one or something.. Your outfield is pretty bad, altogether. As a Jays fan, I really hope Wells returns to old form. Saying that, even old form doesn't warrant being a #1 OF-unless you have another stud, which you don't. I say you don't because I think Hunter is going to blow this year. I am using the \"first season after signing a huge deal\" reason for this, ala Vernon last year. And Franklin Gutierrez? Even if he DOES make the team, which he isn't guaranteed, I don't know that he is even a serviceable player to have on your roster, yet alone on the starting roster... Your bench is pretty lousy too. Get rid of the Rockies staff...you should NEVER plug them in. I am not sold on the Cleveland staff either, what with having to face the best lineup in baseball 18 times, in the Tigers.  Casey Blake was a good pickup. Actually, he is probably the only serviceable player on your whole bench...look to the waiver wire to fix that. On the whole, I'd rank your team a 5 out of 10. Your offense is nothing special, and your pitching will likely hurt you more than it helps you.
