	91230 : ["Since you've only had Koda for less than a week now, don't worry too much, there's no long term damage.  :-)  I've got a hunch that your little sister might be the youngest? Ergo, she's probably been used to having some attention that she's going to have to give up because Koda is there.  Even though she's small, a pup of eight weeks couldn't have hurt your sister, by any stretch; my guess is, she was standing, the pup jumped up taking her off guard, and she lost her footing and when she fell, Koda probably thought she was playing and jumped on top of her, which freaked her out.   Unfortunately, when folks don't have dogs in the family normally, those kinds of things aren't foreseen, and therefore, nipped in the bud before they happened.  If your parents had given it some thought, they may have considered telling your sister that puppy would get excited and might jump up but that Koda means no harm. Because she wasn't forewarned, your sister now wants to believe (yes, wants to-- she's realizing Koda is getting some attention) that Koda is mean-- giving her an excuse to scream at the dog (yelling at something that can't defend itself is a way of feeling in control).   My recommendation -- discuss with parents that letting sister yell at Koda is not going to teach Koda anything but fear, which you don't want. Sister supposedly has the higher intelligence and will have to learn that a puppy is part of the family, get used to it, treat puppy gently and with respect.  You certainly don't need a dog that grows up frightened and wets itself whenever a certain person comes long (your sister and any other kid she teaches to do what she's doing--screaming at the poor dog!).   Labs are one of the top ten intelligent dogs; they learn quickly and well (I know, having had one)-- they're loyal and loving and will do anything for their family.  Sister needs to learn to chill, and if she doesn't want to be near Koda, fine-- but to quit the needless screaming.   If you're able to convince your parents to speak with, and correct Sister's behaviour, keep an eye on Koda, so that Sister doesn't provoke Koda-- pinching or kicking, just to get the attention she had before.    As suggested by others, the sooner you begin a walking regime with Koda, the better; if you have the means to do so, ($) invest in a good trainer that adheres to the \"get them to obey out of love and respect, not fear\" principle.  Labs grow up to be large dogs, Koda will need daily exercise--which will, in turn mean he'll be easier to train.   All the best-- good luck with sister-- and here's to having a wonderful friendship with Koda; many happy years!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~", 9386, "x8djdj1maa", 2],

Once your vet rules out medical conditions such as flea or food allergies, there are products that you can add to his food, like DreamCoat, NutraCal, or even a couple Tablespoons of fish or olive oil.

I am skeptical of poll that aren't scientific and I am skeptical of polls that don't spell out exactly what the questions are, who they questioned (exactly) and what the results were exactly.  It seems we only get a generalized summary from these polls which is meaningless.   I still don't know what the consensus is.   Is it, humans emit CO2 and it likely contributed to the warming in the last hundred years.   Is it, human emissions of CO2 has caused the warming trend in the last 100 years and we are all going to fry?  I pay attention to this more than most people but I still don't know what the consensus exactly is. You try to reason with these people yet they are seldom reasonable.  It is all about exaggeration to push a political agenda.  I have maintained that for over a decade and they constantly prove me correct.

These are just what I have seen in my own experience. - One problem that CPS people often see with Kinship care is that the family caring for the child allow unregulated contact between the abusive parent and the child. In one case I know of, the child was placed with a grandparent, and then the mother moved into with the grandparent in direct defiance of the court order. - Another problem is that (where I live) if a child is given to family, that family receives less support from the state. Since it isn't officially 'foster care', many of the benefits and support foster parents receive do not apply. For example, some foster parents get daycare support, but children in kinship care are not eligible. This makes it very hard on the family. - Finally, I have seen this be a big 'wedge' between family members. (This is the flip side of the first issue above.) The birth mother may feel angry toward the family member who has custody, especially if that family member adheres to the rules laid down by the courts and CPS. I have seen birth mothers acuse family members of abuse and neglect, and even make physical threats when the family member refused to violate the rules and give them more contact.
