It is a dual issue so you have to scan past the first issue with it's table of contents to get to the second issue and it's table of contents to find the article. (I know that it's confusing.)  They and Obama are not Muslim however, they describe Louis Farrakhan as \"The Honorable minister Louis Farrakhan!\"   Again, go there and read for yourself so you can draw your own conclusions.      Personally, Farrakhan and honorable are two words I see as difficult to utter in the same breath.  I see him as a minister of radical racism and hatred.  Now come back to Obama's religious beliefs and ask yourself what you can expect from him….   ", 10549, "None", -1],

	118677 : ["Theory of relativity: The theory of relativity, or simply relativity, refers specifically to two theories: Albert Einstein's special relativity and general relativity. The term \"relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to emphasize how special relativity (and later, general relativity) uses the principle of relativity. Special relativity Main article: Special relativity Albert Einstein's 1905 paper \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\" introduced the special theory of relativity. Special relativity considers that observers in inertial reference frames, which are in uniform motion relative to one another, cannot perform any experiment to determine which one of them is \"stationary\". This is actually Galileo's principle of relativity; Einstein's contribution was to explicitly include electromagnetism within this principle, which required that the Galilean transformations be replaced by the Lorentz transformations. The resultant theory has many surprising consequences. In particular, it requires that the speed of light in a vacuum be the same for all these observers, regardless of their motion, or the motion of the source of the light, since the invariance of the speed of light is a consequence of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. General relativity Main article: General relativity General relativity was developed by Einstein in the years 1907 - 1915. General relativity replaces the global Lorentz symmetry of special relativity with a local Lorentz symmetry in the presence of matter. The presence of matter \"curves\" spacetime, and this curvature affects the path of free particles (and even the path of light). General relativity uses the mathematics of differential geometry and tensors in order to describe gravitation as an effect of the geometry of spacetime. This theory is based on the general principle of relativity, which requires all observers to experience the same laws of physics, not just those moving with uniform speed, hence its name.", 10552, "AA11529729", 5],

Im not voting in the election because no matter how many debates and etc I watch I just cant understand politics, so I dont feel im wise enough to make the decision of who should run our country but I just think its a little odd to say what you did....its like you ask why arent women voting for her then say \"Im not saying she should be voted for just because she is a woman\" I guess the best answer I can give is maybe most women dont think she's well enough qualified perhaps? Also some women dont think a woman should run the country (not my opinion but we had a HUGE debate recently in a college class of mine and a LOT of the older women said they feel a woman would be too emtionally attached and couldnt make hard decisions with war and etc) so i donno", 10549, "olMJz5uEaa", -2],
