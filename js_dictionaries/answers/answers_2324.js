Obama will incorporate more of these elements, which includes greater redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor, greater support for labor unions, partial nationalization of the health insurance industry (this includes all means of production associated with this industry such as infrastructure, computers, printers, etc so the person who suggested that the Obama would not bring additional means of production under government control has not done his/her homework)", 10675, "X1D7xnKXaa", 1],
	122015 : ["most americans, primarily those on the right, have little understanding of socialism.  chalk this up to seven decades of anti-communist propaganda.  remember at one time the fight against unions and collective bargaining was driven by this fear of communism, to the point of beating, and in some cases killing, union organizers.  that feeling lasts today, as has recently been shown. no Barack Obama is no socialist.  he unfortunately made a televised comment that many jumped on as proof of their twisted ideas (\"spread the wealth around\").  an unfortunate choice of words. no, he's no socialist.  in fact, many of my close associates, and i, watched with horror as he slid farther and farther to the \"center\" during the campaign.  believe me, we would have loved to have had a full blown socialist in the whitehouse.  as it is, we have only one admitted socialist in the senate, Bernard \"Bernie\" Sanders from Vermont. btw, good to see you happy again :)", 10675, "None", 0],

	122020 : ["I'm going to be very blunt, and I hope I don't offend you. The “most of it” you still believe—that's your flesh talking. The teachings of the Watchtower Society are designed to appeal to the flesh. That “another part” of you—that's the Holy Spirit of God. He is the One you need to listen to. Believe me, this is not derogatory toward you. We have all been through being led by our flesh. Any Christian who tells you they don't have ongoing struggles with their flesh is not being honest. As long as we're in it, this will continue. (Come, Lord Jesus!) The best advice I can give you is to seek Jesus. He said, \"You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.” (John 5:39-40) John 11:25-26: Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?\" Jesus said, \"If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it” (John 14:14) See, Jesus is the One who has the words of eternal life, not some organization.

	122022 : ["I would think not.  The boxer has to pay for the medical costs out of pocket, and they actually don't get paid enough to visit the hospital.  There is no health plan,  I read somewhere that the neurological testing is keeping many guys from getting started.  When the brainscan costs more than the purse for a prelim fight, there's no point. 2 guys that can't exist in today's fight game are Larry Holmes and Marvin Hagler.  Both men made very little cash for their early fights.  If either Larry or Marv had to pay for a brainscan for each fight, they would have hung up their gloves to work at a carwash or bowling alley where the overhead is zero.

As you stated clearly he conquered 7 weight classes and whipped everybody in his path. He is the P4P best at the moment not Mayweather who only fights for money not the love of his country or the sport.

	122031 : ["The best thing I can say is find a King James Version Bible and start at Genesis 1. I'm suggesting a KJV because I just don't trust the translated versions, because they seem to change the meanings of some things. Also, don't skip the book of Acts. Here you'll find the most important scripture in the whole Bible: Acts 2:38, the plan of salvation. I know most \"Christians\" will tell you that all you have to do to be saved is just believe, but many scriptures in the New Testament tell us that you must be born again of the water (babtism in the name of Jesus), and of the spirit (being filled with The Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking with tounges). The book of Acts makes it very plain that this is the only way to be  a true Christian, because faith without works is dead.

God called me to be born again and receive Jesus as my personal lord and savior, and that is what saved my soul and saved me from the panic.I think you should also become a Christian. JWs have a history of false prophecies and have edited their Bible in such a way that virtually no scholar of the original Biblical languages beleive to be appropriate  If you want to have a personal relationship with God, I'll guide you through what I did. We surrender our lives to Him, promising to live for Him and die to ourselves, putting away our sins and old ways of living.  Tell God the father that you repent of your sins (we all sin) and that you want to change. Tell Him that you believe Jesus died to take the punishment you deserve (we all deserve) and that you believe He rose again. Ask Jesus to be the lord of your life, and to make you the person after God's heart He wants you to be. Ask Him to cleanse you of you sorrows and misery, and to bring wonderful people into your life. Ask Him to deliver you from all sin and pain. Pray that the peace of God that surpasses all understanding would guard your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.

Think about staying on good terms with family as much as possible Think about the possibility that God is leading you to Truth that you have not  yet discovered Ruth in the Old Testament left her family to follow the True God of Israel It comes down to a choice between the Real Jesus Christ and the jesus of the Watchtower.   When you see the difference, and you realize that Jesus really is God the Son, incarnate deity, will  you go the way of false teaching about Him. or be brave to follow the Jesus who said He is very God ? That millions follow a false Jesus does not make it the right way..........think about it Another thought to consider......Scripture teaches you can know Christ and be assured of Salvation.  The Watchtower has taught that you must be out \"doing the will of Jehovah\" to maybe be worthy of surviving Armegeddon. Total opposite concepts.  One (WT) is a hope based on works.  The other is that Scripture teaches by Grace you are saved through faith (a trusting belief in the work of Christ on the cross/stake) and it is not of works , lest you should boast\"  (Eph 2:8-9)  John wrote that you can know here and now that you have eternal life through such \"belief\"  ( 1 John 5:13)  Johns use of the word belief  is more than simple recognition , it is an acquiese to complete trust in, reliance upon, acceptance of the work of Jesus  as Savior and the cross that secures your salvation.
