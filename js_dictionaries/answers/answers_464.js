If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the StatueofLiberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (TheMostHolyTrinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbringsthemupalevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put thesewreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints.

	25765 : ["The key here is to change things gradually and stress the fish as little as possible. Fish can go into shock if there's sudden changes in water parameters, including from very dirty to very clean water, and that can kill them. It is very easy to lose all the fish when you try a sudden huge cleaning. So I'll detail how to do each step in the process safely. You should start with partial water changes of 10% to 15%, during which time you will also gravel vacuum. You can leave the fish in the tank during partial water changes. Do that each day until the detritus has all been sucked up by the gravel vacuum, which may take a few days. Also, if you already have a filter don't throw it or the media within it out. That's where the beneficial bacteria that keep the tank cycled and stable live, and if you throw them all out there will be dangerous spikes in nitrogenous wastes. Instead of throwing them out you can clean 1/3 of the filter media at a time. To do that, use dechlorinated water or old tank water in a ziplock bag and clean the media in there. Then put the cleaned filter media back. If you want to switch filters, it would be best to run the new filter on the tank in addition to the old filter for a month or so. That way you can basically clone the cycle so that the new filter is eventually full of enough bacteria to keep the tank stable. You will want to clean out the intake tube of the old filter, though, which often becomes clogged with detritus in dirty tanks, keeping the filter from working well. Assuming there is lots of algae on the tank walls, you might want to go ahead and get an algae scraper with a metal razor. That will remove lots of algae from the walls of the tank very easily. Seachem makes a nice three in one algae scraper that includes a razor, you can get the short version since your tank is small. Now that I've found out about metal algae scrapers I don't see ever going back to another kind. It should make cleaning the tank a lot easier. Do be careful, of course, as it is sharp. As for the decor, plastic plants, rocks, etc. can be cleaned with a 20 parts water to 1 part bleach solution outside of the tank. Soak them for about 10 minutes in that solution, then rinse them thoroughly until you can no longer smell any bleach. Then you can soak them in a container with heavily dechlorinated water - 5 times the recommended amount. Rinse them thoroughly again the next day and the decor should be fine to go back into the tank. Make sure never to use soap with any kind of aquarium decor or other equipment, as if you use soap it will never again be safe for fish. Substrate is nearly impossible to clean, so that is likely going to just have to be changed out. There is, again, some beneficial bacteria in the substrate, so only change 1/3 of it out a time. I would wait to change it out until you've sucked up most of the gunk in the tank, though, so the new stuff doesn't get too dirty right away. You may have some hard water deposits on the lid and light. That should be cleaned outside of the tank with vinegar. The vinegar will soften the deposits, then you can scrub them off, rinse the lid, and wipe everything down before putting the lid back on it the tank. Allow the light to dry off thoroughly before plugging it back in.  Keep an eye on the missing eye for any signs of infection - bacterial or fungal. Keeping the water clean will help from now on. If you've been having trouble doing water changes because of carrying buckets back and forth, you might want to invest in a python water changing system that hooks directly to your faucet. That should make water changes easier so you will be more likely to stick to the habit of changing the water each week. 30-40% water changes each week should maintain things after you've gotten everything back in order. You should also check about whether the fish you have need larger groups or not, and plan on addressing that once everything is stable again.", 4074, "LMflh3C4aa", 1],

As for the lid it actually has been cleaned so that's already looking new and fresh. I don't currently have substrate, but I may look towards investing in some once everything's in check. I will be thoroughly cleaning the plants next weekend, and am going to invest in some new tank mates once I'm sure that I've got a mini paradise in my tank.

Your ph level will remain the same as your tap water, it is not effected by how many fish you have, though it may bounce during cycling and return to the same ph as your tap water, or sorce water.  Unless you add chemmicals, or sea shells, or other ph changing items.  It is ammonia, nitrite and Nitrate that you should monitor.   And if you keep up with normal weekly 25-50% water changes in a cycled aquarium, 6 x-rays should be fine.  The one guppy should be fine too.  But make sure your tank is cycled before adding more fish.", 4083, "AA11606260", 0],
