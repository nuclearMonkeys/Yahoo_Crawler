	46218 : ["I don't know exactly what's going in their minds, here's my guess. In spirituality they say the closer you're to God or Source, the lighter you want your food to be. That's pretty much how people transition from being carnivores to vegetarians, then to vegans, raw vegans, fruitarians, breatherians.. whatever... Think of it like gaining power. Many experience healing, awareness expansion, maybe they even see light bodies in the air, hear crystals, lol And the more power one has, the more he thinks he is God. Somewhere during that journey people reach a point of plateau, and if no further personal growth happens, they turn against themselves and experience side-effects.  By now many have heard of raw foodists gaining weight, or being suspiciously skinny, others begin experience digestive problems, mental fog... suddenly not enough microflora, although it was enough in the beginning! Well... what happens in digestive tract, may also happen in the brain. Everything is connected.  Happiness takes mental work. If we are cleansing and detoxing our bodies, let's remember that thoughts are also need Law&Order to stay sharp and clean. To Love  is a verb. Loving animals is recognizing their uniqueness created by Nature/God who is the creator of everything else. I'm pretty sure everything is alright with Nature's self-esteem and sense of value, unlike with average mortals. Just look what people dump mindlessly into Mother-Earth. Nature takes it all, transforms and give us back green forests, beautiful gardens, food and so on. Therefore Nature doesn't have time to waste on a draft. Instead it creates PERFECT ANIMALS capable of living in the wild without humans. I remember seeing in the news that after hurricane many cats ended up homeless. After a while these cats suddenly remembered how to hunt again and they form groups as lions and tigers do. I hope no one thinks about feeding a lion in zoo rabbit food.", 6580, "lAGatG40aa", 0],

And when I'm doing the 7/10s thing, not only do I simply not have time for games then, it takes me a week or so after that ends before I find them enjoyable again.

People who become depressed have a harder time focusing, or even doing the things they know they love to do, leaving them questioning WHY they dont like it /cant enjoy it /cant focus on it/ etc, anymore. It could also have something to do with exposure to something that affects your brain health. My recommendations are treat yourself for depresion, try taking a teaspoon of turmeric daily for depression, you can take it in milk if the taste is too much fo you, and get fresh air as often as you can, as well as dealing with the stuff in your life thats making you depressed and / or stressing you. Treat yourself well at home, do what you can to alleviate stress and depression at the end of the day. Also, note that even depressed people may not FEEL depresed but will show signs of depression like what you have described. If its a purely physiological (physical) issue, start by detoxing your body daily, as toxins do affect your attention span, and irritability levels, and also cause depression.
