Writing is the same no matter what I'm writing about.  It's creating my own universe.  The memoir I'm working on, however is very real and recalls the loss of my daughter to cancer.

And being famous (and/or rich - the two usually come hand in hand) opens a lot of doors - you could practically go anywhere you wanted... and you would also have a hell of a lot of money, and could help other people out - because frankly, Â£2 every six months doesn't help that many starving kids.", 9089, "None", 0],

I use writing when I feel creative, sad, depressed, and other emotions that make me feel that I want to be alone, but with company. Writing is that company. Writing has always been there for me has always been my best friend, when I had no friends in elementary school. I was always the outcast, and writing never let me down. Even in middle school, which I graduated from on June 15th of this year, I held writing tightly close, even when I gained friends and even a best friend, which I had never had before then. Writing will always be a part of me, no matter what. :) As for reading, I only started to like reading when I became obsessed with Greek Mythology in 4th grade. My interest in reading was still very low, but when I read the Mortal Instruments series, I began to love reading. Because of the Mortal Instruments series, I have read books like Matched by Ally Condie, Beautiful Creatures and Beautiful Darkness by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton, In The Forests of The Night by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, Token of Darkness by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, Paranormalcy by Kiersten White, Intertwined and Unraveled by Gena Showalter, Shiver and Linger by Maggie Stiefvater, Clockwork Angel (Prequel series to Mortal Instruments) by Cassandra Clare, Hush Hush and Crescendo by Becca Fitzpatrick, Maximum Ride series by James Patterson, GONE series by Michael Grant, Unwind by Neal Shusterman, 13 Days To Midnight by Patrick Carman, Beastly by Alex Flinn, and Willow by Julia Hoban.", 9093, "pAvLARLiaa", 1],

I have finally gotten...well, old enough to realize, I don't really know why I write except that I have to. It's in me, and the only relief is to get it out of me. And to do it well. I write because I love to, and I read because I love to. That's it. That's all there is.

I think you are \"too much in your head\" about it though and causing yourself alot of undue stress, but this is a normal part of growing up. I know what you mean about awkwardly quiet and not outcast quiet.  I'm pretty sure that's going to evolve into a really endearing quality;  Every girl I've ever known that was awkwardly quiet turned out to have really funny senses of humor and really good at contemplating what people are saying so they are really fun to talk to because they think alot and can add alot to the conversation. Maybe you are just at the start of finding where you fit in.   I would say, stop worrying so much, learn to relax (maybe take up a hobby to get your mind off of it)  People can tell when other people are nervous and that's maybe why you feel awkward so learn to be a little more laid back and just join in conversations a little at a time.   Keep doing the acting stuff, there is no such thing as a small part :)  I would be pretty happy if the teacher chose me for any role, that's a pretty cool deal, that means he/she sees something in you, and you should have a little esteem from that.", 9092, "gcAQ7L8taa", 0],
