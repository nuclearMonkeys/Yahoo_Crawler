	121958 : ["This debate has been going on for a quarter century ( ever since the DOD adopted the Beretta as the standard issue sidearm ) & i'm not likely to solve it by my input. However, as an owner & shooter of several 9mms & 45ACPs, although never the Beretta, i can only suggest that they are much too different from each other, as calibers & as handguns, to be compared or to say one is decisively better than the other.  The cartridges alone are too distinct. Although both were developed in roughly the same time period, + or - a dozen years from the beginning of the 20th century, they each have merits of their own. The 45ACP, as you know, is a large, heavy bullet which is under lower pressure & exits the muzzle at approx. 1100 fps. The 9mm, is smaller, lighter, operates at a higher pressure & exits the muzzle faster. This accounts for the felt recoil difference; snap of a 45 or the milder jerk of the 9mm.   The only thing i have been able to solve is which one i'm willing to carry on my person out-of-doors & that is a subcompact 9mm.", 10679, "a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa", 1],

See:   There is no set amount of time that it takes to get baptized; what is important is that you have accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings, that you are displaying faith by living in harmony with those teachings, and that you really want to dedicate yourself to Jehovah. It is a serious decision that should be carefully considered. What you should do is speak with your local elders about it and they'll help you out. Dedicating yourself to Jehovah is the best decision you can make in life. I'm very happy that to see that you are interested in taking that step. :) Agape, TJ", 10680, "e9cFB6I0aa", 12],

We use a book called 'What does the Bible really teach?' - if you study this book and agree with the teachings of the Bible, then bring your life into harmony with it - start to preach to others with other brothers and sisters and are sure that you have dedicated yourself to Jehovah then you can be baptized.  The steps are  KNOWLEDGE - studying the Bible FAITH - which you gain from studying the Bible, this moves you to witness to others REPENTANCE - sincere regret when you see that some things that you did weren't in harmony with God's will TURNING AROUND - not going back to your old ways DEDICATION - in prayer to Jehovah, that you want to serve him whole-heartedly BAPTISM - in water, this is just a public declaration of your dedication If you're going to meetings regularly then ask for the Watchtower that we're studying on Sunday's at the moment, the first article has some paragraphs about these steps and dedication. For some this can take years but for others a short time.  I started to go in ministry after 2 months of studying and was baptized after 6 months.  I had no contact before with Jehovah's Witnesses, I was just very ready to hear the truth.  10 years later I'm happier than ever that I got baptized.", 10680, "9agMsmCyaa", 8],

	121989 : ["Well the Civil Rights movement failed in redistribution, but it wasn't in reference to wealth, and anyone who says that listened to something other than the source. Even so, I could care less whether he's a socialist or not.  What I have seen is that clearly he's not an ideologue. None of the socioeconomic systems formulated have an answer for each area of human endeavor.  Free competition does not work well in the hard sciences where cooperation provides faster progress and the incentives are mostly internal--that is, genius does because genius IS.  Corporate feudalism which kicks in when the Pareto ratio falls from 80% of the wealth in the hands of 20% of the population to 85% of the wealth in the hands of 5% of the population stifles innovation pretty thoroughly in most heavy industries, with perhaps electronics and software being immune to some extent to the suppression. Free competition ceases to be a motivating force when it turns into corporate feudalism, and that seems to be an inevitable result. What I would expect from Obama is application of the structure that works best for the situation.  It is pretty obvious that with our status falling to 49th healthiest country in the world trhat our medicine is not geared to be efficient, so some other approach is appropriate Socialism as a pervasive approach is doomed to failure, but then so also is capitalism. or anarcho capitalism, or communism, or any of the other socioeconomic systems proposed. There are those who raise their fright levels at the mentoion of certain terms or keywords; for example 'redistribution' who would find the same plan non-socialist or non-communist under another name e.g. 'reform', and there does not seem to be much point in arguing with them.  They believe what they believe, and they can reiterate those beliefs at length and in detail.  Whether they understand the detail or the definition of socialism is irrelevant. So, Obama is a socialist because a fair number of people believe he is?  No.  We shall see what his socioeconomic thinking is in the next few years, and I would expect it to be eclectic, with the witch hunters identifying any term applied that can possibly be contrued as socialist or communist as proof positive that socialism rules Obama, but ultimately meaning nothing.", 10675, "lWZi2p70aa", 0],

The Government will be the \"owner\" of numerous banks and businesses...and as we all know, State owned banks and businesses is a Socialist type process - which has always failed in every country it has been tried in. In his campaign for the Illinois senate, Obama was endorsed by the New Party (NP), a coalition of socialists, Communists, and other leftists. According to the newsletter of the local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, whose members were said to constitute 15 percent of the Chicago New Party, “Once approved, candidates must sign a contract with the NP [which] mandates that they must have a visible and active relationship with the NP.” Apparently, Obama signed such a pledge.

Are you talking about Feb of this year or last year?  If last year, then I am surprised that you do not already know the answer.  You see, your progress would be noted by your study conductor, who in turn will guide you through the process.   If you have been visiting since this Feb, then, although I commend you very much for your zeal, I wonder if it is a bit early for that?! I am not going to say any more because I really think you should talk to your teacher about how you feel. I have a strong sense also that you are really young, am I right?  Not that that should go against you, and it certainly doesn't, but I just wonder about your history. If you could give out a little bit more information on how you came to be going to the hall, that would be great. I do not want to discourage you - that would be a mistake - but on here it is in the dark really, so one has to make sure. It is lovely though that you are soooo enthusiastic - especially with some much bad we get thrown at us, so well done for that. A sister in France, Suzanne Edit:  I am sorry but I am still confused!  Why is your study taking so long?  Why do you feel rejected?  Are you have difficulties with the sister? Sweetheart, it is highly commendable that you are so determined to serve Jehovah, but I just do not understand why your own hall cannot answer your questions? When we study, we automatically get to know what happens when we are baptised.  We have to answer some questions - not like as in school, but more to see how much you understand and agree with.  You see, it is easy when we have a book in front of us and answer word for word, so your teacher should be trying to draw on your own thoughts! I know that you have tried to follow up with more explaination, but all it has done is got me to ask more questions. If you like, you can email me.", 10680, "zXJWV7eCaa", 7],

Our Lord Jesus Christ was opposed, spoken against, persecuted, and finally killed.  Becoming a true servant of God will not make you popular. As you can see from some of the strident answers given here, Jehovah's Witnesses are opposed and spoken against just like Jesus was, and for the same reasons.  Not everyone wants the truth, and not everyone wants to see people serving God loyally when they themselves do not. So, becoming one of Jehovah's Witnesses will not make you popular with the world, nor with opposers. But in doing so, you will make the heart of your Heavenly Father joyful.  And you will be following the faithful example of our Lord Jesus Christ, who always did his Father's will and glorified his Father's name.
