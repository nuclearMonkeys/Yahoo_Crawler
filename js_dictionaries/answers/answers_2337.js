That's the only way to find the energy you need to make your blog a success. Choosing a name for your blog is probably one of the most important — and toughest — parts of starting a blog. I went through so many names until I finally came up with Viva Fashion. I knew I wanted it to represent my Hispanic background, so I was looking for a mix of Spanish and English words, which is how Viva Fashion (or Live Fashion) came about. If you're having a hard time coming up with a name, try jotting down some of your favorite words and then pairing them together.”  “Try to keep the layout of your blog simple and organized. Having too much going on can be distracting. You want your readers to be able to find what they are looking for, easily. I personally love a white background with black text.

	122672 : ["What kind of dizzy is important.  Dizzy like your going to faint or blackout?  Or dizzy like the room is spinning or things seem off balance.   Orthostatic hypotension can happen when changing position from lying to sitting/standing or from sitting to standing.  A simple explanation of this is, Your body can't get the blood to your brain quick enough, so you feel dizzy and/or faint.  This type of dizzy makes you feel \"light headed\" or like your going to faint of blackout (also known as syncope).  This can be prevented by changing positions slowly. Vertigo is a fancy name for the type of dizzy that makes you feel off balance or like the room is spinning.  This has to do with the balance centers in your ear and can be brought on for lots of different reasons including an ear infection. Don't worry, both are pretty harmless and easy to treat when you find the underlying cause.  However, I would have to know alot more about your health history and other symptoms that you may be having to make an accurate diagnosis.

'Placebo' has been used here as if it's some kinda worthless avenue. In reality, the 'placebo' effect is widely used within medicine. This is because, even western medicine recoqnises the human bodies own innate healing ability. It matters little what avenue is used to kick start that, so long as healing takes place, in many ways.,  check out some kirlian photo's of Reiki treatments at   .  Also, Reiki is widely used within western hospitals. I done it myself there (Reiki teacher). ANd know of nurses whom are taught Reiki, in local cancer ward. I've also personally treated doctors who've came to me. Check out   for instance. Reiki isn't something 'conjured' up by america, lol. Jeez. I devote immense time to researching Reiki, so i guess my lineage, and the graves in Japan of the early teachers are all american lies? I expected more substance on here, hehe.  About energy healing in general. anyone even vaguely familiar with quantum physics will know of things beyond which they can see past the end of their nose. Reiki practitioners emit an energetic frequency within the schumann resonance.  I've a question, if all in existence is energy, then how does energy healing not exist? Probably need to explain what energy healing is... energy healing is having the ability to access what is already around us. In Reiki, this emits most notably from our hands, eyes & breath. A Reiki practitioner enables another to begin theri own healing. This is the response to what some term as Reiki 'energy'. For instance, in Quantum touch, a practitioner raises theri own vibration as high as possible, and mantains that, thereby enabling the client, via resonance & entrainment, to meet that level, it's here that healing takes place.  It's prob best that folks study how all healing works in the body, then how science tells us quantum physics is, and see how those two, and spirituality converge, thereby giving a more fuller picture.

Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin.
