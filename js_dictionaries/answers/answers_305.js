There is a long history of mythicising etymologies, such as the twelfth-century Historia Regum Britanniae asserting that the city's name is derived from the name of King Lud who once controlled the city. However, in recent times a series of alternative theories have also been proposed. As of 2017, the trend in scholarly publications supports derivation from a Brittonic form *Londonjon, which would itself have been of Celtic origin\"", 2584, "cbMTODDZaa", 2],

	15275 : ["A method actor is someone who so psychologically puts themselves into the shoes of their character that they utterly immerse themselves in the role and become that character, actually abandoning their own identity, like brainwashing themselves. That's why many method actors end up having psychological problems and/or so often require months of recovery after doing a roll, because they lose themselves in it and have to find their way back to their own identity. Meryl Streep is an example of a method actor, Marlon Brando probably being the quintessential example. Jamie Dornan is an actor who used to be a method actor but then switched away from method acting to a more classical technique after being cast as a serial killer in The Fall and his method acting leading him to suffer a full-on mental breakdown afterwards that he says took him years to recover from, but then you see that his quality of acting has suffered as a result because what we see in The Fall is absolutely amazing and what we see in 50 Shades of Grey, his next big project, not amazing at all but the opposite of amazing, stilted and stiff. He does seem to be finding his way, though, as his acting has been improving, his latest film Wild Mountain Thyme, costarring Emily Blunt, being clear evidence of that. A character actor is someone who plays a stock character, a specific character trope, like a fool or a hero or an ingénue or whatever, and because that character is what the casting director is looking for, the character actor generally always plays it the same way. Character actors tend to become character actors by being typecast, often because they have a specific look or manner that lends them to that character. Steve Buscemi is an example of a character actor. To be clear, this is not quite the same as actors who always appear the same way because they lack acting skills and are always just playing themselves, and so likewise get typecast. Character actors are not playing themselves but are deftly playing a fictional trope character, like Steve Buscemi isn't actually a fool, isn't himself anything like the character he continually gets cast to play. A character actor theoretically could be a method actor, but generally speaking, it's evolved into just being a schtick, albeit sometimes a very well-honed schtick, like in the case of Steve Buscemi.  ", 2574, "None", -2],

You could call yourself Bunny, of course. It's not a particularly popular name at the moment, but it's a name. Dustbunny isn't. Or how about Dusty? Again, a real name, not especially popular now. Edit: \"Enby\" is an affectionate way to spell out NB, non-binary, sometimes called genderqueer. Non-binary people don't identify as specifically male or female. Some say they have no gender, others that it's fluid and changes from female to male and back again. They're more likely to use non-gendered pronouns, they/them, or have their pronouns change as they do. But once you get past the labels, they're all over the place. Some are bisexual, sexually attracted to both genders. Or trisexual, both genders plus other genderqueer people. Or asexual, attracted to nobody. Their romantic interests may align with their sexual interests, or may be completely different, i.e., sexually attracted to men but wanting romantic relationships only with women. The Wikipedia entry on Non-binary gender is pretty decent, worth reading to educate one's self. These people have always been around, but they are increasingly visible.

	15286 : ["The basics of acting, like analyzing a script and building a character, are the same whether you're on stage or on screen.  And trained actors know how to adjust their movements and voices for the medium they're working in.  So it's similar that way. The difference is that with stage acting you're able to tell a story from beginning to end in one performance.  There are longer rehearsal time since you're performing live.  And an actor has control over their performance. With screen acting, everything is broken up and often filmed out of order.  You can do the same 2-minute scene over and over to get different camera angles and the like.  And the final product is in the hands of the director and editors, not the actor.   Having done both screen and stage acting, I find screen acting more monotonous.  A lot of time is spent waiting around as they set things up and doing the same scene over and over.  I prefer stage acting because of the energy from a live audience and the control I have over my performance.", 2571, "4dIdBbOhaa", 1],

In detail...as fact Hitler's line can only be traced back to his grandmother, an unmarried Austrian peasant girl (Maria Schicklgruber) no one can go back farther than that because no one knows who the father of her child was.  He could have been German (that's what the Hitler family believed) or Austrian. At any rate Hitler/ his parents/ step siblings... all identified as...German. Also Austria used to be for 800 years a state of Germany before it became technically a separate country only 80 years before Hitler was born, so in Hitler's day many people in Austria were considered/ considered themselves and were in fact 'Germans'.  The countries Austria and Germany were closer than US and Canada (same language/ people) and more like the US and Texas if Texas suddenly became technically separate (exact same people/ same language/ history).   ", 2555, "oxjgA8c5aa", -1],
