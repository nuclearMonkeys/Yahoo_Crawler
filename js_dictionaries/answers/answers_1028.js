	56911 : ["This case echoes that of tragic Steven Stayner and Timmy White in so many ways. There are so many questions, but at this very early stage - with little information forthcoming - answering some of your questions would be pure speculation.  I'd suggest you search for Steven's story on the Net and read up on what happened to him. He was taken by Kenneth Parnell, an evil, sadistic beast with a history of sexually abusing young boys. When Steven got too old for his sick desires, another young boy, 5-year-old Timmy White, was kidnapped. Steven didn't want the young boy to go through what he had so he took him away. Parnell served a disgusting 5 years for what he did to Steven and Timmy and even at the age of 71, he was still trying to procure young boys. He is now in prison and will die there.  I think it's fair to say that in this case, a grown man doesn't kidnap two young boys in the space of 4 years for altruistic reasons - it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out what his motives were...and what he probably did. All I've been hearing and reading is 'why didn't Shawn escape or ring the police etc?' - the boy was obviously severely traumatized and I wouldn't be surprised if Stockholm Syndrome played a part here. I don't even want to imagine what he must've gone through.   The important thing is that both those young boys, particularly Shawn who was with that \"kidnapper\" (can't call him by the 'p' word as he hasn't been charged with those kind of offences....yet), get the counselling they'll need in order to move forward. They must not be judged by people around them in any way - they didn't ask to be kidnapped, held in captivity and lord knows what else. I hope they'll be able to come to terms with their ordeal.

I don't know what Shawn has done these past four years and I bet that psycho kidnapper hurt him. Child predators are lower than the scum of the earth! I bet he is so happy to see his family because he hasn't seen them in so long and now he can! HURRAY!  I bet Shawn saw his parents on the news and maybe park benches, his picture is everywhere and he is found! Kidnappers take people for strange reasons. Maybe he was interested in younger boys and as Shawn got older, he kidnapped a younger child. They should put the kidnapper in prison for the rest of his miserable life!
