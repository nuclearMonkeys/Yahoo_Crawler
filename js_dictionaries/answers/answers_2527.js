	132175 : ["Well sweetie, it sounds like you're the adult here ! Answering your question...ABSOLUTELY !!! You should always tell your  spouse or b/f g/f when you leave the house. I always tell someone where I'm going. What if GOD forbid...something happened and nobody knew where you were ?  It's called common sense and common courtesy. Dad didn't like it when mom did it. Now he knows how she feels when he hits the road without telling her. What if dad were on his way somewhere unknown to your mom and he ended up ...........GOD FORBID AGAIN....... in a car accident that sends him flying off the road out of sight of passersby ? If he were hurt she wouldn't have a clue as to where to look for him. If he had told her where he was going at least she would have some idea as to where to look and or tell the police where to look. And although mom was trying to show him how it felt.......to not know where she was......2 wrongs don't make it right. It makes 2 wrongs worse. So, my advise to you is....get dad a box of courtesy for  . Maybe he'll get it then. They are very lucky to have you for a daughter. It's so sweet of you to care enough about them that you went somewhere to try and find a solution to their problem. I hope this helps. Good luck sweetie.", 11132, "AA12273714", 0],

	132193 : ["Why worry about what the baby will look like?  I know it seems important, but once the both of you lay eyes on that precious baby, it's not really going to matter if he or she has his skin or your darker skin.  I personally do not have any mixed babies (and I have four kids) but my second child was born darker than the others.  He is NOT Mixed.  He is completely caucasion, but I have been asked by many if he had a different father because he was more olive skinned than the rest of the family.  My husband at the time was, believe it or not, perfectly fine with it because he KNEW it was his child.  The thing you two need to remember is that no matter what that baby looks like, you created it out of love right?   although I don't have any kids with my second husband (who IS hispanic btw)  we do eventually plan on it.  Do you think I am worried about what the child looks like?  No way!!!!!  The fact of the matter is that regardless of what a child looks like, it has your genes and it feels your love.  The baby does not need to look like iether one of you to be loved by you, at least it shouldn't be anyway.   As far as his feelings go, you need to sit him down and talk to him.  Explain to him that his constantly saying that the baby will look black bothers you.  So what if it looks black?  Didn't he know when he was making love to you that you were dark skinned?  Yes he did.  If he didn't want a black baby, he should have thought about that before he got you pregnant.  If he can't accept this baby, regardless of looks, then he just isn't a good father or boyfriend.  Im sorry to say that, but if the skin color is the biggest thing for him, then he needs to grow up and learn what true unconditional love for a partner and a child means.", 11130, "None", 4],
