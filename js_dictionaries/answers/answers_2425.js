Michael Jackson was a humble, friendly man who only wanted peace on earth. His songs represented that. All these rumors you hear about him being a pervert/pedophile isn't true. There are even other rumors that are completely false. Please research before anybody tells you something. Saying MJ is a terrible person is ridiculous and one of the many reasons why people will always have a natural habit of hate.

	127094 : ["Some people are just ignorant. Who cares about his face? It's his face, if he didn't feel happy with his looks, then he has every right to change them. I can almost promise that many of the people who hate him, if they had the money he had, they'd change something about them to. Secondly, I don't think he had much surgery to begin with. He obviously had his nose and chin done but his eyes, lips, cheekbones, remained the same. I think it was his many different hairstyles along with lighting, makeup and age that contributed to his different appearance. The Molestation Scandal: Look I wasn't there for any of it, Not sure how much of it's true, but both accusers and their families seemed very suspicious. The 1993 Case: Now Michael had finally realized that the family only wanted money and cut them off. The father, hungry for money and a career made the allegations up and was later heard on a phone conversation that proves so. So, they had the option to fight in court or take a settlement and they settle. No justice for their son. So now Michael gets to continue to be the big pop star he always was. Something tells me that's strange. Why except Money from this man when your son has been molested? I seriously doubt the credibility of that family. The 2005 Case: So now, another young boy steps forward and claims Michael molested him. His story changed every single time he took the stand. At first, he claims that Michael molested him after the Martin Bashir interview, then claims it was before. Next, his Brother Star, claims that he witnessed Michael engaging in sexual behavior, then later claims to have saw something different. Mind you, this family has been known for a history of Welfare fraud. My question to that family is, knowing what he was accused of before, why would you send your child over Michael's house alone, knowing your child could get hurt. Furthermore, Michael never slept in the bed with this accuser, he slept on the floor. Something they both agreed on. Michael, I believe was innocent, was his judgement the best? No, but he wasn't all there. He longed for a childhood he never had. It was truly sad. I love Michael, the only thing, I did not like was the fact that he often lip-sang. Check out the History World Tour. 82 concerts with almost 20 songs, and only 4 sang completely live.", 10922, "EVzBb9Pzaa", 1],
	127095 : ["It's all the things people believed from the media that's why MJ is viewed & known this way, unfortunately. They believed he had tons of plastic surgery when he only had 2 on his nose and one on his chin. They believe he bleached his skin when really he had a skin disorder he couldn't control-I mean you can't darker with a skin disorder like vitiligo, so since MJ was pretty wealthy he had no choice but to do a little bleaching to even out his skin tone, he just couldn't control it. They believed he molested kids when on both counts he was found not guilty & the FBI continued their investigation on him after the 2005 trial and still to this day they hasn't found nothing. They believed he was weird because the media states he slept in a oxygen chamber, bought the elephant man bones, etc; Idk, people are just really simpleminded when it comes down to the media and tabloids. Once they hear the stories from the media they just run with it & don't care to hear from the horses mouth. Michael Jackson was treated really badly by most people when he was living. He was the most beautiful person I have ever laid eyes on he was so humble and SOOO sweet, I don't think there would ever be a superstar as humble & selfless like him; I'm glad he's resting because he was way better off than living in this world, people had no mercy for him. All they did was backstab for him for his money. MJ was just a hardworking man who needed his childhood back. & based on these personal YouTube videos of him & his timeless music he was a pretty decent ordinary man.", 10922, "None", 2],

	127102 : ["This quote of Jesus in regards to the end times is found in Matthew 24:34; Mark 13:30; and Luke 21:32. Jesus said, \"Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.\" The key to understanding what Jesus means is the context; that is, we must understand the verses that are surrounding verse 34, but especially the verses prior to it. In Matthew 24:4-31; Jesus is speaking of future events. The generation of people living when those events occur is the generation that Jesus speaks of \"not passing\" until He returns. Jesus had already told those living during His earthly ministry that the kingdom had been taken from them (Matthew 21:43). Therefore, it is imperative that Matthew 24-25 be seen as speaking of a future time. The word “generation” refers to the people alive in the future when the events of Matthew 24-25 will occur. Another possibility is that Jesus was giving a prophecy with a \"double fulfillment.\" Some of what He was predicting was going to occur during the time of the generation to whom He was speaking. Some of Jesus' prophecy may have been fulfilled when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. However, other aspects of Jesus' prophecy did not occur in A.D. 70; for example, Matthew 24:29-31.The problem with this view is that it does not harmonize with Jesus' statement that \"all these things\" will take place in \"this generation.\" Therefore, it is best to understand \"this generation\" as referring to the generation in which the end-times events occur. Essentially, Jesus is saying that, once the events of the end times begin, they will happen quickly. This concept is echoed in many other Scriptures (Matthew 24:22; Mark 13:20; Revelation 3:11; 22:7, 12, 20).", 10920, "CmLDcfMfaa", -1],

I have watched MANY videos and read MANY articles and I ended up crying bitterly one day when I realised how much misunderstood this man was.  Believe me, no other celebrity has affected me the way he did. Even now I get sad and angry when i see the media treats him as some messed up celebrity because of THEM I never realized what this man was worth, and he was not just some celebrity but one of the most  AMAZING human beings to have walked on this planet. I was even more shocked when I read up the cases, MJ was not guilty of ANYTHING at all yet I remember Media still referring the allegations till his death and they said NOTHING about the obvious lying accusers.

There are still IDIOTS who are accusing him of things. I cry even harder when I watch This Is It and see him saying he wants to remind the world that LOVE is important and to take care of the planet. He died trying. The world killed this amazing man. They choked him to death. -_- And his surgeries is the last thing that comes in my mind because the man itself is such a magnificent person.
