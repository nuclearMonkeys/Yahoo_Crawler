The cheering, the music, the cussing (hockey fans do it fluently, I know this), the goal horns, the fact that you're going to get extremely uncomfortable sitting there for three hours with your hands over your infant's ears...there are so many things working against it that there's no point trying. Hockey is not a game for small children unless they're already really into the game and the environment (like I was...when I was 5), and I would think trying to pop a pair of earplugs into the baby's ears could be dangerous for their hearing (their ears are so small!!) You can only do so much...I get annoyed when people bring their 8-year-olds to the game sometimes...an infant is going to be a thousand times worse. The only good news I can give you is that the Isles rank last in the NHL in attendance, so if you have a seat closer to the back, you may have an easier time.

	102200 : ["I am a veteran and I remember well how people treated us back in the late seventies and early eighties.  There was even talk about talking away our rights because \"everyone knows only veterans go postal\", another Liberal Democrat stereotype much like the stereotypes against the \"right\" that are propagated in this question. Writing up some BS e-mail and circulating it does not make up for the time at Stoney Creek Metro Park back in 1982 when I was spit on for being a veteran and wearing an old fatigue shirt from my service as a jacket. It does not make up for the brutal attack on WW1 veterans back in 1932 either. Go ahead, keep spreading the stereotypes and keep attacking those that disagree with you. Your actions epitomize the only accurate stereotype I have ever heard.  That Liberal Democrats spread hatred of and stereotypes about those who oppose their ideas.", 9798, "None", -1],
	102201 : ["speaking without non-public bias, Christians don't have self assurance that those are 'Paul's words' yet God's. they suspect that God gave the writers the certainty they mandatory whilst writing a e book of the Bible that became into secure interior the unique canon. In a million Corinthians, Paul is preaching to the Church at Corinth. which means, this letter is going to those who're already seen Christians. additionally, the translation seems a sprint off. NIV - \"yet whilst that is preached that Christ has been raised from the ineffective, how can a number of you're saying that there isn't any resurrection of the ineffective?\" and then in case you nonetheless verse 13 and 14... NIV - \"If there isn't any resurrection of the ineffective, then no longer even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has no longer been raised, our preaching is ineffective and so is your faith.\" for that reason, showing who he's speaking to. for this reason, the individuals receiving this letter won't have a reason to dispute it interior the 1st place or no longer have self assurance what he became into claiming. BTW, for those of you claiming Paul became into no longer an apostle, he's seen one. He became into no longer between the unique 12 yet whilst Paul became into on a thank you to Damascus he had a private bump into with Christ. So, he's seen an apostle by using Biblical pupils. (: replace: The context of this passage is extremely key to nicely known-the way it. The context of 'ineffective' or 'resurrected' isn't which means Jesus (he's purely an occasion, of types). The context means sinners and unbelievers. because of the fact whilst somebody is baptized into the Christian faith, that is believed that their soul won't purely 'disapper' or despite yet will upward push and be resurrected. In verses 22 and 29... NIV - \"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all would be made alive.\" \"Now if there isn't any resurrection, what is going to those do who're baptized for the ineffective? If the ineffective are no longer raised in any respect, why are human beings baptized for them?\" P.S. no longer each Christian believes each thing that the Bible claims or says. it rather is purely one reason there are maximum of diverse denominations. the translation of the textual content fabric is likewise some thing. i comprehend some Christians that have self assurance interior the great-Bang theory, evolution, and that Jonah became into never interior a great fish for 3 days.", 9798, "wbGRthzQaa", 0],

	102211 : ["If there was one, it would already have come out. Obama may have one on standby, but he is the only one that could. October surprises only work if the person behind in the polls is close enough to catch back up and overtake the leader when the surprise comes out.  McCain is just not that close. Even if something were to come out, it just would not drag Obama down enough for McCain.  McCain is too far out of reach, so if he had something to drag Obama down he'd already be using it. He has to slow down Obama's momentum to be able to do anything, so if he had something he'd be throwing it out there to just try to keep up with Obama.   If he hasn't used it, its because there is nothing to use.  Obama may have something, but to avoid looking negative he'll avoid using it unless McCain catches back up.  I really don't see McCain catching back up anymore, so Obama should avoid using an October surprise (provided he actually has one). I don't think either has one.  If one does, it would be Obama and not McCain.", 9805, "aTAUOI8caa", -1],

	102213 : ["quite honestly I think Michael Jackson was cute in the Jackson 5, okay in the Jacksons, hot in thriller, still hot in bad, cute in dangerous, still cute in history, okay in blood on the dance floor, still okay in invincible, but in previous months he was looking pretty ill...I think all the crude things that people were saying really brought his spirits down, which affected his appearance...the way you look on the outside, tells a lot about how you are on the inside.... im sorry but I think Michael was just a poor soul who needed someone to heal him and make him happy. His kids did a good deal of that, but don't you think he needed a woman in his life? At some point he needed the feminine opinion. But he had a beautiful heart throughout his entire life time and he meant well. Perverted people just took his actions the wrong way. The people who accused him of child molesting, you can tell, were perverted because only they would think of Michael's closeness to kids as disgusting. I think it was beautiful the way Michael finds kids as precious and great. When I heard him say those words, or something along those lines, I took a look at my younger cousins and found out that i's true. Everything Michael says about children is true. I wish I could be a child forever. I just don't understand how people could believe that Michael would do such a thing! I watched this show today where this man molested his own daughter! and to compare Michael to that...THING...is just wrong and dehumanizing!", 9806, "None", 2],
	102214 : ["I hate writing long answers! You ask HARD *** questions! Seriously! Lol I will say my answer in 200 words or less. Michael Jackson was beautiful because he loved unconditionally. He loved the ones the world chose to forget. He loved his enemies and tried to help them. He even felt that he could make Hitler change his ways. He strived to see the best in people, and he was untainted by the corruption and wickedness of this earth. He saw the Earth as a Heavenly divine creation . (Though It's Plain To See This World Is Heavenly Be God's Glow -excerpt fro Michael Jackson's Heal The World) No matter what he did or how much fame he achieved he never forgot about his roots, and appreciated them. He devoted his life to making people happy and he burdened himself with the problems of this world , even though he did not have to. In fact, if Michael had not been so giving, he might have lived longer. They took his kindness for weakness. He didn't hate people, he didn't go right and left suing them like people do today. He tried to emulate Jesus. (But I will never stop helping and loving people the way Jesus said to. -Michael Jackson) He was a shining beacon of light to the hopeless, joy the joyless, and help to those in need. Michael Jackson is a superhero. Even though he was ******* HUMAN. People treated him like ****. A normal human would have lashed out and turned angry and bitter, but Michael Jackson was so very lovely until the day he died. He still is. “In a world filled with hate, we must still dare to hope. In a world filled with anger, we must still dare to comfort. In a world filled with despair, we must still dare to dream. And in a world filled with distrust, we must still dare to believe.” -Michael Jackson And the last thing that upset me, was actually someone on this website, LOL!", 9806, "eaDSPylOaa", 4],

	102216 : ["How COULD Ron Paul have had the heart to simply drop out? Was the sincerity that was written all over his face a ruse? Is he an actor? Did he only act like a patriot? Did he milk us for presidential election dollars, only to use them to benefit this new, so-called \"grass roots\" movement, so he can watch it while our whole country gets washed down the toilet while he argues in the House? What has that man done? He sure gave all of us, in my opinion, a sucker punch below the belly, and he is a doctor!   What he should have done with all our contributions was to declare himself an independent candidate, because then, he could have won, because everyone was just beginning to learn about him!  And if he had done that, part of the battle would be started towards the TRUE change, which is going back to Constitutional law, the one thing that sets us apart from all the other nations on this earth.   \"We, the people\" (as louiegirl always says), deserve to live under what is correct and what is ethical and what is right in a REPUBLIC, which we know in our hearts to be true and just.  It is, as Ron Paul stated, all in the Constitution.    That doctor sure did break a lot of hearts.  I feel like he sold me, and our country, down the river.  And I also feel he is a coward.  And I also think we should be damned mad at what he pulled. What will he do with my contribution dollars and yours?

	102218 : ["I trust Ron Paul with his decision. Let's be realistic, people. There is no need to panic. Most of you must have known that it's going to happen eventually. The people of today are too blind to elect such an honest, intelligent man into the White House. There was no way for Dr. Paul to win this election. He held on as long as he could because he felt obligated to keep running as long as we support him. When he ended his campaign, he didn't forget his promises to defend our Constitution. He had a plan to continue The Revolution and I am absolutely sure that this plan will have a bigger impact and will continue to spread the message of Ron Paul and the people. The Campaign for Liberty will last for as long as we, the people, work together to defend the Consitution and to educate the uninformed. Please continue to support Ron Paul in his cause to spread awareness. He did NOT give up on us. We should not give up on him and America. FYI, I'm still writing in Ron Paul.

My own doctor even advised me that: \"If it feels like they have stop working, come back and see me ASAP.\" I was on mirtazapine for about 18 months, which worked brilliantly at first - helped me sleep and took away the bad feelings to help me concentrate on sorting my life out, but after a while it was more of a hindrance than a help. It made me so groggy, unresponsive, I'd eat way too much and still be hungry, and I gained loads of weight, which brought my old issues with eating back to the surface. I ended up in almost as miserable a place as when I started on them! I took myself off them about 7 weeks ago, and will never, ever go back on them. It's never a good idea to just not take them, or wean yourself off them unsupervised because as you've already discovered, your mood can really plummet and drag you right back to square one, but it worked well for me. Maybe it was just the mental thing of doing something positive and moving on with my life. I'd highly recommend speaking to your doctor, it's what they're there for.
