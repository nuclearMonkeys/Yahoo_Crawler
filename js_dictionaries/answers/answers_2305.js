So to answer your question directly, no, liquid oxygen is not air, though neither is it air in its gaseous state. With regards to your question about the contair. Will it explode? well yes and no. More like a pop I would say.  There would not be an explosion inside the container because there is no fuel in there. Fire needs three things, heat fuel and oxygen, so you'd only have to of the three. The container would likely pop under pressure though.
