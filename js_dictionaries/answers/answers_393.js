	21417 : ["The loudness is related to the output of the amplifier and the handling capacity of the speakers and whether the speakers are matched to the amplifier. It is not related to the brand of loudspeaker. If I put an 8 ohm, 1000 watt speaker on a 5 watt amplifier that requires an 8 ohm speaker, the loudness of the speaker will still only be 5 watts. Actually, the wattage is a little misleading because doubling the wattage does not double the volume. Sound level is measured in decibels, not watts. Our ears are far more sensitive at low volumes so the volume of sound increases at a slower rate that the increase in watts. Different speakers of the same power rating (watts) and impedance (ohms) will have a different output measured in decibels for the same input wattage, depending on the construction of the speaker. I do not know of a comparison chart and that doesn't really matter because our ears are unlikely to hear the difference anyway.", 3467, "gYPV2W02aa", 1],

Although some satellite components such as remote displays might still not work. But if you're looking for custom fascia plates then you'll need to approach a specialist fabrication company as the numbers of M45/M35 models sold were pretty low and there are now so few 2006 examples that manufacturing and stocking fascia kits will leave them hogging valuable shelf space gathering dust until many get thrown away or sold rock bottom at a loss dealers specialising in NOS (New, Old Stock). The good news is that custom fabrication can now be *vastly* cheaper than it once was due to the widespread use of 3D printers and 3D scanners.", 3468, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],

	21526 : ["Anyone can sue anyone else for anything.¬† A tenant could sue a landlord for \"routinely creating a disturbance\" that disrupts their \"quiet enjoyment\" of the property and demand a full refund of the entire rent paid for any month in which they can prove that occurred. Of course, the landlord will have his own defenses and counterclaims for damages, and can immediately serve the tenant notice of termination for non-payment, so that it does not appear to be \"retaliation\". It is not normal for a landlord to \"bang on the door daily\", since a single certified letter is all they generally need to send as proof of a lawful demand for rent and notice of termination for failure to pay. In many states they don't even have to hire a process server to 'bang on the door' in order to consider the tenant \"served\". ETA: It never ceases to amaze me that people think a tenant can't win a lawsuit against a misbehaving landlord because tenant \"hasn't lost any money\".¬† Sure, unless you consider RENT to be money. If you're paying rent for something you're not actually getting (quiet enjoyment, the parking spot they promised, working appliances they showed you, etc), then you can ALWAYS sue for a full refund of the RENT MONEY.¬†", 3503, "VjgqZetcaa", 0],

A lease is a contract, not a prison sentence. The tenant can absolutely move out whenever they want, leaving only the question of how much rent they still owe after giving notice and then moving out.¬†¬† Worst case, the landlord sues you for the rent after you move out and stop paying, but most places require that they show proof that they have taken steps to rent it to someone else, after you gave notice.¬† Otherwise, they could sit idly by and sue you for rent they could be collecting from a new tenant.", 3506, "VjgqZetcaa", 0],
