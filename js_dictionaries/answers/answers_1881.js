I happen to be dual military, hubby and I are both army and I can tell you that I couldn't think of any better career than one working side by side with him. We go to pt together, we stop by each others jobs, we know each others soldiers, we know what each of us goes through on a daily basis....and even better, we're deployed together:) Granted, a deployment sucks and yes it does suck, but going through it with him BY FAR beats staying at home stressing about how he's doing, wondering what he's going through, is he ok, does he think about me often....Him and I have both lost friends out here and to know the heartbreaking feeling when you hear \"commo blackout\" over the loud speaker is a feeling that no matter how hard you try, you will never understand unless you here it for yourself. Everytime I hear it I literally run to my office and call to find out \"now who was it?\" To be able to understand the pain felt when sitting through a memorial ceremony, to know how much different it is when you lose a battle buddy versus anyone else, is something I wouldn't trade. Even the near-paralyzing fear I feel when the IED first goes off is something I wouldn't trade and don't regreat having volunteered to do, because when hubby tells me stories from OIF 1, I finally understand all those feelings. You may want to reconsider that approach, even if it's just one term of 2 years. I guarantee its something you won't regret!!!! HOWEVER.......if you choose not to go that route, definitely go to school while hubby does the army thing. When you get your degree, it'll be so much easier to market yourself that way. If not, if you get married right out of high school (which by the comment you made about not being legal I'm assuming is what you're doing) you'll get stuck working the register at AAFES, at the commissary, or any other job you can get straight out of high school. Take advantage of all the benefits available to you as a military spouse, including the school benefits, have him do the paperwork to let you use his Montgomery G.I. Bill, and take all the classes you can. I would recommend the medical field, because wherever you go, there's always medical positons open......Good luck!", 9709, "None", 1],

	99830 : ["This is from my notes, hope it helps.. Always work out what your needs are and buy a laptop to suit. Choosing a laptop ============= You have to decide on weight and battery criteria. 1. Weight - If you are going to carry it to and fro to school/office then consider getting a lightweight model.  An external CD drive may be an option as if you not into burning disks or watching DVD then you hardly use the CD drive.  Something about less than 2 kg is a lightweight. 2. Battery Life, -  if you never going to use it on batteries then you can go bigger processor and larger screen.  You can consider not buying the battery if appropriate.  You can have two power supplies; one at home and one in the office is good for large heavy laptops. If you want to use the laptop on batteries then you may have to choose a smaller processor and a smaller screen so you can get the hours required out of the battery.   3. Minimum specifications – Games will require more specifications – more ram and –more video card specs – more processor power. Generally though: -a decent video card (for projection of power point presentations) -Wireless networking -Ethernet -Consider a high speed hard drive - Consider 80GB Hard drive or larger  - Consider an external DVD drive or an Internal Burner -depending on your needs -Consider 1 Gig RAM for XP or 2 Gig RAM for Vista -Software able to update from their websites -Internet security and -Antispyware (free from net) is a must for internet use. -Easy accessible USB ports - built in webcam  - A Mouse - a keystone lock -A carry bag.  Sometimes the manufacturer's bag is the best buy Consider getting the hard drive partitioned to C: and D:  The C drive can be 30 gig for a laptop  D drive is extended across the remaining.  When looking at laptops in the shop do this: In Vista click start >control panel >system and support  >system Go through the results you can see what hardware and what Microsoft products are installed in the laptop/ computer. Google luck!!! Vista versus XP: All laptops are sold with Vista on it, it may be wise to get a higher standard Vista eg premium as it may network better. If you want to install your own XP disks on it first you have to find out if XP has drivers to suit the hardware on your laptop. Since you paid for your Vista, keep it. In a couple of months it will be the norm and it will be running sweet.  There is due a service pack issue in March 08. If you want to load XP consider partition the Hard drive and dual boot.  Google “dual boot vista xp” for step by step instructions but don't forget a third partition for your files.", 9713, "pDxFOekIaa", 1],
