	33013 : ["Well Haaland won't be that expensive. He has a release clause that activates next summer for 75 million i think only but the number going around is that Dortmund would take 100 million for him this summer, which is still a bargain for a player of his quality in my opinion. Obviously it will be great to wait until next summer when he's cheaper but all the big clubs will be trying to get him this year and Dortmund might be tempted to cash in. Yes 75 million is a lot but 100 million is still 25 million more and remember they never got as much as a cent for Lewandowski when he moved to Bayern so Dortmund might take the money this season.  Anyway Haaland would be the more affordable target but why go to Liverpool if they'll be playing in the Europa League at best next season? Same with Mbappe. I personally think that Haaland will end up at Man City, same team his dad played for, this summer as a replacement for Aguero. Mbappe will sign for Real Madrid either next year or the year after. Remember this Aces!", 5049, "q1BX2eXuaa", -1],

	33016 : ["Goalies, talent a bit thin on the ground even including Pickford. Defence, Stones seem to be in form, not much confidence in the rest. Maguire is still awful. Midfield. Foden is in a different class to the rest. Lingard is on form but he's hardly world class. Don't rate Rice at all, but Ward-Prowse always seems to do a good job and his free kicks are pretty good. Forwards . Kane isn't the same without Son,  Calvert-Lewis's form has gone downhill so much even Everton fans are saying he's rubbish, Rashford and Sterling are reasonably reliable. Could have done with Vardy though they'd still stick him on the bench.", 5050, "HdLKZwkyaa", 1],
	33017 : ["Agree with your points about the full-backs.  Usually in a tournament year, these games would be friendlies against teams similar to those we'd be playing. Not possible at the moment, but they should be ‘easy' enough, and gives us a chance to experiment. For instance, we don't need Kane to play against San Marino and risk injury, so we can use someone else.  ", 5050, "AA12299134", 1],
	33018 : ["I'm quietly optimistic for 3 decent performances and results. At least they are not friendlies or that nations league thingy. It should warm us up nicely for the summer.(even without the main man Grealish our only hope. He should be nicely rested by June and raring to go) I agree Shaw the most interesting selection, well pleased for him he could be our next Stuart Pearce this Summer he looks like he would run through a brick shithouse for England. Overall a good solid squad and what a chance for the Goalie(3 good lad's there)but most of all what an honour to play for your country and I will always support whoever pulls on the shirt.", 5050, "e99lvSBxaa", 1],

Between Real and Liverpool, Real Madrid will win in the went game and in Liverpool they will equalise at least. I'm convinced that Borussia Dortmund will pass the round.

Win quadruple.?,  think about what you are saying it only takes a few moments of something unexpected happening and it's all a pipe dream, yes of course they can do it, but i still wouldn't say the odds were favourable, what odds is that happening been given by the bookies?,   be amazed at this stage if was better than even money, which is 50/50 or a flip of a coin literally.....I know they are capable, but it also depends on what  the opposition do....It wouldn't be the first time you see a more dominate better  team lose the footall match, i think Brighton have had a few games like that already...so it remains to be seen, just remember people have asked this question before and it never happened imho and statistically it's much harder than a nation to win the world Cup....and we know how difficult that usually is for anyone... Yep we simply need to focus on whatever the next task is at hand...and yeah it won't be easy, but it's always good to have some luck, within the game, or not have bad luck, depending on whether someone is a glass half-full or half-empty person, granted with VAR this probability is lower than it used to be, but as we have all seen this season it's still there LFCYNWA.", 5039, "UY8ny1vFaa", 0],

	33041 : ["I don't know if he will, he's always linked when the role becomes available and has been interviewed at least once before in the past.  Do I think he should? No. As interesting as it would be to see him in the job and as much as I'd like to see him have another crack at management I just don't see it working.  He has only had assistant roles in the last 10 years, only one of them actually worked out. Didn't last long at Forest or Villa as assistant. He spent 5 years with Ireland and most would agree he and Martin O Neill had some success there apart from the collapse at the end. Keane is very old fashioned in his view of football and management. He sees football as get from back to front as fast as you can, always look for the forward pass. Even I was brought up with this when I played as a kid. People think the guy is harsh but he was literally punched in the face by Brian Clough as a teenager for a misplaced pass, and he thought that was perfectly fine. This is the era he came from and I can't see him changing his ways in how harsh he can be to players which could be a problem. I am one of those who agrees players are too soft these days, but by knowing they're soft is it going to do any benefit to them shouting in their face how crap of a player they are? Most likely not and I can't see Keane changing his ways. I think he could bring some success back to Celtic but I can't see any long term benefits of him going there. They could get a good season out of him like Sunderland did and the guy isn't an idiot but if relations break down between him and the players it could be worse than any collapse under Neil Lennon.  Of the names linked none of them really jump out. You can rule out Benitez he doesn't seem interested in the challenge and would probably not take a pay cut. Eddie Howe and Frank Lampard seem to be the best options. Lampard still unproven but at least he's fresh out of jobs at Derby and Chelsea where he did well enough. Howe's Bournemouth played some nice football and stayed in the Prem for longer than they should, people will be hopeful he'd have a Brendan Rodgers type influence. Jesse Marsch then must be Red Bull's most favoured employee he'd probably even be worth more of a punt than Keano that's how unsure I am of Keane at the minute ", 5032, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],

But then that Tournament was the one where Greece went all the way to beat Portugal.  May not see a minnow win a major international tournament for some time to come. 1998 World Cup was another big disappointment. 2004 Euros and 1998 World Cup disappointments were largely caused by Man United players (Rooney and Beckham). 2014 WC must have been so p*** poor and shyte for us, that I don't even remember what we did in it lol so for that reason, 2014 WC gets good mention as well.  Did we even win any game in that tournament ?? But you could argue that United players proved to be overrated average in comparison to the best in the world at that time because if they were any good we'd have not been so fecking laughably s*** in the 2010 world cup and the one four years after it.  The reason we were so s*** in both world cups was because of Mr Ferguson and his cheating manure teams conning refs into decisions to win titles at the cost of developing our game properly.

	33055 : ["I wouldn't put Carlo there. I think Moyes and Rodgers deserve to make the list looking at where both are in the table. Correct me if I'm wrong but only Man City have collected more points in the last 5 than West Ham and Leicester have and West Ham's only loss in those games was a narrow 2-1 loss v City.  So I would have Guardiola, Tuchel, Moyes, Bielsa and Rodgers. Probably in that order as well.  Guardiola is self explanatory. I've out him here based on this season and past seasons but we have to admit he has it easier than others with the amount of money City have at their disposal. Still I'm going to give him my number one spot even though I wouldn't have him winning any manager of the season awards though we all know his quality, other gaffers are doing great things with smaller and weaker squads.  Tuchel has to be included because look how well they're doing defensively only 2 conceded in 12 games he's been there I think it is now. His attackers have let him down they need to work on their finishing. I've put Tuchel so high because he was at Dortmund and PSG previously and performed well there and has now come to England and is proving himself as a top manager there too. But yeah 0 losses for Tuchel so far in all comps so he has to be up high at the moment. Moyes as I mentioned has West Ham in good form and competing for top 4 the Moyesy way having spent little and signed only a few players.  Bielsa for keeping Leeds mid table. His style is a bit suicidal but look at Fulham and West Brom in comparison fighting for survival while Leeds are all but safe and challenging for top 10. Leeds form isn't very good right now but the position they are in you can't leave Bielsa out. Rodgers sneaks in because he has kept Leicester in top 4 and they're in good enough form.
