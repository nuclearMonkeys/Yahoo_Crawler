	140743 : ["1- Sleep Deprivation: Your judgement is impaired by lack of sleep (just like alcohol does), so you probably THINK that your guitar-playing is better. Most drunk drivers think they are driving more safely than usual. You've probably been asleep many times in the last three days, but you can't remember any of these 'micro-sleeps'. Parts of your mind are staying (hyper) active, and waking the rest up before very long. This happens more and more as people sleep less, until it becomes an almost continuous cycle of 'dozing' and imediately waking again.  Try doing something that needs intense concentration (like reading a textbook or technical magazine articles, while lying in a very restful position (prop your chest up with pillows while lying face-down, so that you can rest the literature in front of you). Be prepared to perform the activity for several hours, because micro-sleeping can be a hard habit to break. Intense concentration can beat your overactive brainparts at their own game; they can't keep it up forever. When they 'give in' and briefly allow you to sleep, your relaxed position should help you to achieve deep sleep very quickly, making it difficult for the rogue brainparts to 'bring you back' before you've had a restful spell of proper sleep. 2 - The Milk: Milk can last for quite a long time when frozen, but just like alcoholic drinks, the parts can separate. It was probably close to 'turning' when you froze it. It is watery because you drank the fatty parts first (they float), and tasted nasty because many of the 'sour taste' molecules prefer a fatty environment; basically, freezing and thawing has concentrated the 'off' taste in the cream.", 11480, "b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa", 0],
	140744 : ["Weirdly enough I always relate issues like this in relationships to a wrestling team I was on. When training we all had to stay with each other. We had to push ourselves to grow stronger independently, while sticking together. We had to go for runs, and we set our pace to the tune of the slowest of the pack. This kept everyone going strong, without making the slowest stick out and feel bad. When it comes to things like this, you have to set the pace for the slowest person. In a relationship respect is a huge issue, and I know you want to push forward, but the fact is you can wait, and perhaps he cannot move forward. You have to respect that. Communication is also key. It can seem kind of corny always discussion everything, but in the long run it becomes the glue that holds relationships together. Discuss why you want to go faster, and let him discuss exactly why he wants to take it slow. As a couple, you'll find a pace that works for both of you.", 11479, "d36609d36eb192e2a54217c2c42209a2aa", 0],

The reason I say this is because after 36 hours of being awake your brain begins to shut down. You lose motor function and your common sense begins lacking.

	140762 : ["The 55-200 is equivalent to about 80-300mm in 35mm format.  It's designed to be used for taking candids, portraits and outdoor sports. The maximum aperture is f/4-5.6 which is not very good for indoor shots using available light.  You'll have to use an external flash with this lens in just about any indoor situation. A better lens will be one that has a zoom range closer to around 18-55 and with a maximum aperture of f/2.8.  You need that extra-large aperture to allow in more light so that you can get shots with the motion stopped.  You can save some money buy getting a f/4-5.6 zoom lens that has vibration reduction (VR).  VR will reduce your hand motion and prevent camera shake. This will allow you to shoot still subjects in low light with much lower ISO settings.  However, VR does nothing to prevent motion blur of your subject's motion.  For that you must use a faster lens and/or higher ISO settings. Overall, the 55-200mm is not well designed for backstage photos because it's too strong and it's maximum aperture is too small.", 11483, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],
