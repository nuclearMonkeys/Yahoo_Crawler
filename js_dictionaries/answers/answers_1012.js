They were beginning to follow paper trails and finding valid evidence to point out government corruption, and why we should learn to see past all the lies and forms of social control.  The government, doing what it's been doing in the middle east, decides to socially balkanize the truther movement with bad apples and paid actors to delegitimize them. They sent people into truther circles to make them argue over what they disagreed with rather than what they agreed with. Then they infiltrated them with Flat Earthers, Nazis, Marxists, and just plain idiots.  They've been doing this with everything. They infiltrated the alt right with the tiki torch nazis. They infiltrated Black Lives Matter with George Soros paid protesters. They infiltrated the police with KKK and IDF, and taught the police to infiltrate protests to cause problems, make them violent, and give the rest of the police excuses to fire upon the crowd and delegitimize the message.  They've been sending CIA and Mossad to get mercenaries and infiltrate small militias in the middle east into western backed terrorist groups, to serve as proxy armies for balkanizing the middle east and making Islam look bad.  There is a long history of false flags and agent provocatuers if you pay attention. It's to hurt people into giving up their rights, freedoms, and morals, and turning on their fellow man.  They're afraid of you weaning yourself off of them. They know they need you more than you need them, but they don't want YOU to know that. They don't want YOU to know your true power.  And they're doing everything they can to attack and delegitimize the truth.  See, a lie will get around the world 2 times before the truth can get it's pants on. But with the internet, the Truth can start to catch up. Whether it was net neutrality a few years ago or the inquisition style purging of \"offensive\" content by big tech, they are trying very hard to get rid of information that shows the world who they really are.  They weren't worried about getting rid of Pizzagate videos until Jeffrey Epstein made the news.

Government spending has a higher multiplier than tax cuts, because directing money to people who actually need it means that the money will be injected directly into the economy, not just stored in a bank. \"The multipliers showed that increased government spending would have more of a multiplier effect than tax cuts. \" \"In congressional testimony given in July 2008, Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com, provided estimates of the one year multiplier effect for several fiscal policy options.

What you haven`t mentioned is whether you smoke or not ?. I personally still do, and have no intention of giving up. I came up against difficulties with this issue with the N.H.S.. What people/sufferers are not aware of is that if you change G.P. you may have difficulty in finding another to take you on. C.O.P.D. is one of the most expensive ailments for the N.H.S. to treat because of its longevity and cost of treatment and care. I have severe mobility problems, and have carers in 3 times a day, but still try to maintain as much of my independence as possible. No doubt you will suffer the odd bout of mild depression, when you begin to find simple everyday chores so perplexing. You are aware of what you have and the progressiveness of it. Just be aware of your limitations, pace yourself, and try to map your life out to make things easier for your self while you are still capable. Please realise that there are many different medications for use, but i`m afraid in some situations it`s trial and error till one is found suitable for your metabolism. There is no cure for C.O.P.D., like i and other sufferers are fully aware of, and there is only one end to its progression. Live each day as it comes, enjoy life, even though your quality of it may be diminishing. The right help is out there for you, exert your right to life and demand it !

Also, while masks significantly reduce transmission they cannot be 100% effective. So you would still expect some transmission. Plus the virus can be transmitted from person to person in situations where you would not expect to be required to wear a mask. This is compounded by the fact that some people in such situations will not have been wearing a mask when they should have been. I am fed up of trying to tell young people without masks that your age may be of benefit to you but it doesn't mean you won't end up killing your granny by passing on the virus to her. What is really going to be effective is take up of the vaccines by enough people. saldy, there are a lot of myths out there and for reasons I don't understand people seem to think family and friends who are not scientists or healthcare professionals and social media are far better sources of medical information than the leathcare services and science.
