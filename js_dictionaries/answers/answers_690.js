If you are going to a care rental agency, like Hertz, Avis, Dollar etc., and no driver comes with the vehicle because you are the driver, then you are renting the car. If you called a taxi, cab or \"livery service\", then you are hiring a care. If you are using something like Uber, Lyft or any of those \"not a cab, but a person is paid to pick you up and drop you off for a fee\" companies, they are ride sharing (even though sharing has nothing to do with the business model), then that would be \"ride sharing\", \"ride hailing\" or any of a number of other \"not a cab, but a person is paid to pick you up and drop you off for a fee\" companies, then it seems you can call it whatever they want you to call it, except not a cab (or taxi) company.", 5663, "HySNnkXAaa", 3],

The body produces chemicals that encourage the person to reproduce and rewards that person with feelings of pleasure after he/she does it. The body does this as a result of millions of years of evolution and natural selection.  The body triumphs over the mind in most cases. Of course, some people who get married may choose not to have children. Sometimes the mind can triumph over evolution.  Curiously, there are people who do not get married because of religion, not science. Even so, many of these same people still cannot triumph over their body.
