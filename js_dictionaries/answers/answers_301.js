In fact, I wish they got rid of the Trending or Discover section (whatever that was!). That way, everyone can get an EQUAL noteriety and the site would have probably gotten a better chance at helping people with their life's problems!  People are so stupid they don't know what a good question is and what isn't usually!  Also, I didn't like it when they got rid of the comments option.

	15075 : ["\"Is “women's rights” a feminist euphemism for female privileges?\" It is today.  And it has been since women received their full equal Rights to men after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.  This is why we often read now how full equality is no longer good enough for feminists.  They either demand more without any reference to their equality here in the first world, OR they deny that they have equality with all sorts of semantics that usually really on some kind of magical \"power and privilege\" that common men supposedly have in order to proclaim a victimhood status on all women. In reality, feminists are just disrespecting women's ability to actually compete on a proper, level playing field with men.  They instead demand legal privileges that go way beyond equality, and then defend those privileges by yelling and screaming that men, or society are \"taking away women's rights\" whenever we discuss their privileges. .", 2540, "aSm9xSn3aa", 4],

During this activity, librarians read to groups of children. Your kids will be surrounded by other kids, and they will figure out that it is not just adults who like books.  Other children their own age like them as well.  Until such time as your local library has such activities, you can no doubt find people online who read children's books out loud for kids to listen to.  It is not as good for your child as being in person, but it is still a fine thing to try.   Hope this is helpful!", 2548, "rPdBoondaa", 4],

Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children, and elders.
