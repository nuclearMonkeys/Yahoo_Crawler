Having to repeat myself over and over after I've already answered the question 3 times.  People who tell lies and think you're that gullible......they actually make a fool of themselves, so I tend to calm down quickly when I think of how they're going to come undone all by their own doing.  4 minute ads during a 1 hour show coming on every 5 minutes, sometimes less, especially when you're tired and really just want to go to bed but forgot to set the recorder....lol!  I could go on and on, but for fear of typist's cramp, best stop here......LOL!!!  :))   Nearly forgot tailgaters.  You're going along the Pacific Motorway doing 110 kph and some clown is right up your back side trying to get you to go faster.  That really makes me soooo angry as they're the kind of impatient fools that cause so much heartbreak for innocent families when they lose their loved ones because of idiocy.  Copped a few of them yesterday coming back from the Gold Coast.  They just don't think of anyone else but themselves and then abuse you when they overtake in the other lane.
