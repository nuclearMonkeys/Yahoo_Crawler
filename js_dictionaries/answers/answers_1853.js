Dont get me incorrect i admire Disney, How might desire to you no longer yet I see Disney as quarter-hour of attractiveness. You get your coach and one mistake your achieved. it incredibly is why i might desire to by no ability paintings for Disney. I pray that Miley Cyrus escapes from that because of the fact i admire her yet I dont like the Hannah Montana image because of the fact this is pretend. yet Miley Cyrus as a individual is truthfully fairly cool.

	98408 : ["The fairest way would be to increase the tax of foods that are higher in fat or salt than others - the more you eat the more you pay. If you choose to live on takeaways fast food and processed meals which increases the chance of weight related disease you pay more tax than someone who lives a reasonably healthy lifestyle.   Ok it would mean that most of us pay slightly more for a pizza or the occasionally Maccy D's but the real cost would be borne by those who live on crap food. EDIT - Whilst what some people are saying is true about obese people having genetics the underlying fact is that most people choose the wrong foods and dont excercise.  Also some thin people also will have health issues due to poor diet and lack of excercise, by taxing bad foods you are not telling people they cannot eat it nor you are not penalising heavy people (some people have already pointed out that sports people have a higher BMI than the average person yet eat healthy food)  What you are saying is that if you do the chances are you will have health issues and you must pay for it.  Smokers and drinkers have been treated this way for years.    I also dont buy into the arguement that healthy food is expensive.  Tonight we are having lentil burgers and salad for dinner.  Cost less than £2 to feed 4 of us.  And no we are not screaming veggies just people who choose to live a healthy lifestyle.   We also grow vegtables in our garden to show our children where they come from.  Packet of seeds £1.50 produces over 100 pieces of vegtables. Haz -  I still dont buy in to your arguement that you cannot do healthy food cheaply.  My family could  live on £30 a week eating healthy if we had to - and if I dont get a bloody job soon then we will be putting it to the test!!!!  The problem is people cannot be arsed to cook or learn to cook because they are not incentivised to do so.  A packet of lentils costs £0.88p at Sainsburys and will make about 20 burgers, add in a couple of onions and garlic or chilli, 20 burgers for under a quid.   If people dont have a garden how many have their names down at the local council for an allotment, rent £16 a year?  Probably not many. The health of our children is something I care about and there can be now excuses. To put your theroy to the test what would I spend £5 for two days on for a family of 4. Day one -  Breakfast own branded weatabix and milk - cost £0.33p Lunch - smart price tuna sandwhiches on brown bread  - cost £0.55p Dinner - Lental Burgers and Salad - cost £1.79  Day two Breakfast own branded weatabix and milk - cost £0.33p Lunch - Egg and salad cream sandwhiches on brown bread - cost £0.57p Dinner - Home made vegtable currey and brown rice- cost £1.51 Total spend £5.08", 9655, "AA12349988", -3],

Anything else should be introduced slowly after 6 months with breast milk still making up a great majority of calorie and vitamins and everything baby needs until a year. Your baby should be breast fed for a minimum of two years or longer as long as you and baby both desire. That is what the World Health Organization (WHO) says", 9660, "OFTJXUOaaa", 7],

	98414 : ["When the heat index is over 100 degrees all animals should have a choice of being outside or in. I live in Florida.  My dogs go outside and hang mostly in the early morn, just after a thunderstorm and late evening.  My yard is fenced and the doggy door allows them to make the choice. There are certain breeds/mixes (Pugs, Shih Tzus) that cannot handle heat.  There are dogs than can handle it better. As far as I am concerned where I live they should have the air conditioning. (We put in a huge generator 3 years ago in case of a hurricane.  Mostly to keep our dogs comfortable when we loose power.)", 9654, "GSf09ALBaa", 2],
	98415 : ["Dogs feel heat the same way you do, except that they tend to have heavy coats on. If you think it is too hot for your dog, you are probably right. She would probably like to come inside. However animals and people have been around for a long time and air conditioning has only become widespread in the last 80 years.", 9654, "DXygiw77aa", 3],
	98416 : ["Yes they can live without air conditioning, and in some cases it's better for a dog NOT to live in air conditioning.  Hunting dogs need to be acclimated to the climate of where they live. If the hunting dog lives in the desert, they need to be able to tolerate heat, if they live in the arctic, they need to be able to tolerate the cold. Air conditioning (or heating) the living quarters of a hunting dog makes them not become adjusted to the climate. If it's hot, and they are air conditioned, then when they go out hunting they won't be able to stand the heat and could die from over-heating (some with cold.) Some breeds (pekingese, bulldogs, etc.) cannot survive in hot weather and require air conditioning. Other breeds can easily live without it.", 9654, "RNqHUNgEaa", 1],

Using the BMI as a measure is stupid. Edit: I wouldn't mind fat people getting taxed but the \"obese\" classification shouldn't be based on the height/weight alone.  The BMI puts personal trainers that excersise in excess of 15 hours a week in with the \"fatties\". Tyson, Arny, Johny Wilkins all obese.", 9655, "Q8coTUJfaa", 0],
	98421 : ["I don't know the exact number, but it is huge.  Even healthy weight individuals are paying higher premiums for their obese counterparts.  I can only imagine what it's costing taxpayers when the gov't has to pick up the tab for this.  There will likely never be a \"fat tax\", though I think it's a pretty good idea. ADDED: Sorry if I seem rude about this, but there is absolutely no reason any man, woman or child in this country should be obese.  None whatsoever, unless they have a thyroid problem or are on a medication that could cause drastic weight gain.  People who overindulge & let themselves go in this way deserve what they get, but I don't feel I need to spend a dime of my hard earned money to bail them out when they develop diabetes, high blood pressure, have a quadruple bypass, etc...", 9655, "6eaad547daf3f0d56e9d2157c70a2765aa", -3],
	98422 : ["No need to be offended, but no need to listen to their incorrect advice either. Not the first or last time bad advice has been given to a mom. Baby does not need vitamins in addition to breast milk - you are correct that baby gets the vitamins she needs from you (as long as you don't have any significant deficiencies). The possible exception is vitamin D - some doctors do recommend supplements for breast fed babies as many moms these days are deficient. Pediasure is a synthetic concoction of processed garbage, and should not be given to any infant (or, some would argue, anyone at all). Breast feed exclusively for 6 months, and keep on breast feeding as long as you can.", 9660, "BriXvoImaa", 4],
	98423 : ["In theory breast feeding provides enough nutrients, though there are rare cases where infants aren't getting enough nutrients. Like I said, its rare. If you suspect your child isn't getting enough nutrients visit your pediatrician. The only concern should be that your child is eating often enough. You know whats best for your child, no one else. You and the pediatrician are the two people whose opinions mean the most.  The grandmother might be working on outdated info. Accept her input but also note to her that things might have changed since she had children. You're the mother. You're the person in charge. 50 years ago she might have had the correct info, but now we know that things are different. Besides, 9 weeks is WAY too young for anything besides breast milk or formula. No juice, no water, nothing besides those two things.", 9660, "XCRpmOhmaa", 1],

Breast milk provides baby with all the vitamins she needs, with the possible exception of vitamin D: evolution has not yet caught up with the fact that we live indoors, wear clothes and use sunscreen, so depending on latitude, climate, skin colour and habits (how often you take your baby outside) you may need to supplement vitamin D. Obviously your pediatrician can tell you if that is the case for you.", 9660, "jyy3hdGhaa", 5],
