	89520 : ["1. Marijuana is much healtheir than alcohol.  It is also better than cigarettes.  Most people just smoke 1-3 joints a week, equivelent to 4-12 cigarettes.  A cigarette smoker generally smokes a pack a day.   2. It is not the government's place to ban things because they're unhealthy.  I know the health risks.  I think I can decide for myself.  And by the way, it is not because it's unhealthy.  If it was, tobacco and alcohol would be illegal.  And if we ban things out of health reasons, we'll have to ban McDonalds.   3. It is my choice, and only mine, what I do with my own body.  Not yours, not my neighbors and not Congress.  Doing drugs does not hurt other people, it does not damage property, it is not stealing and it does not endanger other people.  If you smoke a joint in your room, that's fine.  Nobody was hurt.  Why would that be a crime?   4. It is illegal because it could replace major industries.  Hemp can be used for rope, paper, fuel and many other things.  It would put those industries out of business.  It is also safer than tobacco and alcohol, so they would get shut down too.  They use their money to keep it illegal.  That's why it's illegal.   I have plenty of other reasons, all well thought out.  I won't go into detail, because there are just so many questions about this.  But it will lower crime, cut taxes significantly, allow cops to catch real criminals, save prison space for dangerous criminals instead of potheads.  If you want details, email me.", 9327, "None", 1],
	89521 : ["There are many reasons, for example, the government can control and tax  MJ just like they do tobacco and alcohol. The prisons are full of people who sold it, and I suppose the people who need it for pain or whatever they need it for, want it legalized as well.  Legalizing it  would be a boost for the economy  in tax dollars but bad for the drug dealers who we want to put out of business anyway.   Personally, I don't use any of those three substances but I don't think they are harmful if used in moderation.", 9327, "LMgUpEgjaa", 0],
	89522 : ["Try the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series by Laurell K. Hamilton. They really suck you into the story. There are 18 books in the series, so they will keep you busy for a while. A friend gave me the 1st one a couple of years ago, and now, I have them all. They are the kind of book where you have to know what happens next. I am reading the twilight series now, and they seem kind of similar, except that at first Anita doesnt want to have anything to do with the Vamps, werewolves, ect. and there is lots of sex.", 9329, "GuQ8Gg6saa", 0],
	89523 : ["If you don't like dark, why do you like vampires? That's contradictory in and of itself. The books you've read are pixies disguised as vampires to give a normal, uninteresting romance a \"supernatural\" twist to boost sales. That's it. However, you could try Vampire Diaries. It's basically the same thing as Twilight, except it came first and the narrator isn't a flimsy, spineless jellyfish who thinks she's ugly - she's a self-absorbed, strong-willed girl who's used to getting any guy she wants because she's \"hot.\" You might enjoy it if you liked Vampire Kisses and Twilight, though, I guess.", 9329, "None", 1],

The way things are now, extra money will help with paying bills and medical supplies. wou This is the USA and people working at an older age are not punished. Older people are likely to be more savvy at adding things up without the aid of a calculator. When I went to grade school and beyond all of us kids were taught to use our minds and not a gadget. What does this have to do with your question? Prospective employers are likely to hire the older person for a job that requires a knowledge of math.

	89534 : ["lets get this thing straight, how do you know its bad for your health? because the government told you that. think about how many people die from alcohol abuse a year, either direct or indirect. now lets compare that to those of marijuana. the difference is that marijuana is one of the safest drugs on earth. you cant overdose on it, it doesnt affect your lungs nearly as much as smoking tobacco, and it doesnt make you incapacitated like alcohol. I believe we are told marijuana is bad because the government are hiding the truth. if it is so bad, wheres the proof? marijuana sales evade tax, thats why its bad. but if the government legalise it then all those pot smokers would be pissed because they would be paying taxes on there pot.  its not bad for your health, its bad for your governments pockets.", 9327, "BtrqbiLsaa", 0],

	89538 : ["God! It's like saying, I'm writing a book about a wizard. Ooh God... not another Harry Potter book...  Believe it or not people, vampire books were being written long before Twilight! Simply because one story caught the public so strongly (e.g. Harry Potter... rolling of eyes...) doesn't mean that people who choose to write around the same subject are copying that one persons idea! If that were true Stephanie Meyer would be copying Bram Stoker (look him up)!  Anyway, seriously, don't listen to any of these people because if everyone thought like that, not one aspiring writer would have the mentality to write another book! And that would just suck.   So here's a few of my ideas: -The Crimson Element (haha, you got it)  -Web (because of the love triangle) -Blood, So Cold -Blood, So Sweet   (or you can try the french word: Sang to replace ‘Blood'. So it would be like Sang, So Sweet or Sang, So Cold/ gives it more of an artistic feel and sounds kinda neat too!)   Or try and find something that most sticks out in your story. Something that means ‘something' or is a metaphor for something. Anyway, hope I helped some. And again, don't listen to all this negativity. For all we know they've never lifted a pen in their lives. You're actually doing something!  It's like I always say, if you must write, do so for you and then later, if you want, tell the world.", 9329, "08XkgB0Saa", 1],

	89545 : ["First of all, Congratulations, Grammy-to-be! :) I was going to suggest the Bingo game another answerer suggested - it gets your guests talking to each other, plus, it's being played while mommy's opening her gifts.  Another one I've played that's kind of fun is the memory game (but there's a twist!) Have mommy walk around to each table for 30 seconds or so with a tray of baby items: rattle, pacifier, safety pins, a diaper, bottle, spoon, baby food, etc. - just a bunch of stuff. Then have her walk out of the room.  Tell your guests then that what they need to do is write down everything Mommy's wearing. They get so sidetracked by the tray, they don't pay attention. That's a fun game.  We've also played \"price is right\" - where you have to guess the price of baby-related items at previous showers.  And I always get thumbs-downs for this, but I'm going to say it anyway - the \"Guess How Big Mommy Is Game!\" is not fun. Seriously. I have a great sense of humor, I really do. But if I'm being honest, by the time I was 8 months pregnant, and my shower rolled around....the LAST THING ON EARTH I wanted was to take a piece of string and measure how big I was, and then to have my closest friends & family size me up and guess how big THEY thought I was, and then to have a visual cue of it all? Yeah. Not so much with that. If you're leaning towards that game - get Mommy's thoughts on it first. :)", 9333, "AA12358335", 0],
	89546 : ["Of course not.  I don't think we should be penalized for working at any age after starting to receive Social Security benefits, but we are.  This December the limit to how much I can earn at my job gets significantly raised.  Right now I have to keep my earnings from my job below $14,100 a year or they will take one dollar for every two you make in Social Security.  In other words my own government is intentionally keeping me in poverty.  It wasn't my idea to go on S. S. early, (62) but my company moved it's operations to China and Mexico, I had no choice.  Now I have a part time job but if I was allowed to go full time I could make so much more money.  I paid in to S. S. for 50 years.  I started working when I was 11, and before that I worked on the farm.  So I don't look at S. S. as a hand out.  It is an entitlement.  We have earned it.  I'm not asking for anything more than what I'm entitled to under law.  I'm just asking for the right to earn more by the sweat of my brow.", 9328, "AA10227498", 1],
	89547 : ["It's actually not all that bad at all. In fact, its much less harmful than alcohol, and even less harmful than smoking cigarettes.

	89549 : ["No one has the right to tell anyone else what or what not to do with their bodies. You own your body; it is yours to do with as you deem appropriate.  Think about it this way for a moment. If in America you believe it is just for the government to say you can't smoke pot, just because they deem it \"immoral\" or \"unhealthy\" or whatever justification you give it, then in the same sense you are saying that the Chinese government is just in telling a woman she has to abort her second child. They too can justify it by it being ''unhealthy\".   It is the same in that you are giving up your right to your own body and the decisions you make about it to whatever government or \"moral majority\" happens to have control of whatever country you live in.

The law was changed so that when a person reaches full retirement age (65 for those born before 1938, and gradually increasing to 67 for persons born in 1960 or later) and continues working, there is no deduction from SS for earned income. The old law stated that a person had to wait until age 70 before there were no deductions from SS. When I turned 66, my full retirement age, I could collect SS, continue to work, and earn as much as possible without any deductions.
