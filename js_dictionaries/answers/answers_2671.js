	139393 : ["Lol for goat's sake! LMAO! To answer your question: Death Metal is a genre where melody and beauty will be hard to find. It focuses on speed, rythm, technicallity, dissonnance and gore lyrics. The vocals are growled. So it's obviously not a style made to appeal. There are still some bands that are original enough to create their own distinctive style in the genre, but sadly too many of them are just plain old generic stuff, and you can't distinguish one song/band from another... That's probably why people tend to hate it. They consider it as noise. I personally like a few death metal bands, like Behemoth, Born of Osiris, the melodeath bands and some others....

	139408 : ["Troy Smith is very underrated. But as an OSU fan i am glad hes going late. I feel that the type of personality and drive that Jim Tressel instilled in these guys is to drive to succeed. Him going later will only push him harder to do good. As for the arguments against Troy Smith. His height isnt a problem the average OSU lineman that he had to pass over was 6'6... This is on slightly less than the average height of a pro lineman, and to top it off hes a mobile QB and he wont even be spending alot of time in the pocket. Troys \"off the field problem\" wasnt that big of a deal and was immediatly corrected by Jim Tressel at the end of his Sophmore season and since noone has really considered that a big deal. As for being surrounded by talent, I am not 100% sure but i think that most NFL players are better than college players(exageration if you didnt catch it) So that leaves the only problem being an average passing accuracy, but even at that if you watch when Smith gets in rhythm he rarely misses. I believe accuracy problems can be corrected withing 2 years in the pros.  Lastly i wanted to add that i notice alot of the people who are strongley against Troy Smith havent posted on this question... Correct me if im wrong but I believe that is because its past their bedtime. This is for the 1 idiot so far who is against Troy, and again he knows nothing about football (why else would he hate Troy?) and he proves it by not doing any research and spitting out random pieces of information that arent even correct. First off Steve Belisari was a horrible QB, he came into OSU as a Linebacker... Enough said. Also Joe Germaine played under John Cooper. Lastly if you want to use that logic, then look at the #1 pick JaMarcus Russel, he had 2 WR's taken in the first round, and still lost more games than Troy Smith by far, especially in big games. In Smith's entire career the only big game that he lost in which he started was this years National Championship. He won 3 years in a row in the what is arguably the toughest rivalry in College, he won every bowl game (exlcuding the National Championship) and he won at Texas this year. If that doesnt show you what kinda player this is then nothing will. (because you are obviously nearsighted and ignorant)", 11427, "DbB2yCJ7aa", 0],

Everyone thought that in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, he would lead them into the win but fell greatly by about 40 points. He wasn't even talked about at all during the ESPN or NFL Network special on the draft. And he had incredible numbers with the Buckeyes.

	139410 : ["I think Troy Smith was extremely overrated as a college QB.  I think the pro teams are looking for players that can help them win as soon as possible.  Ohio State is a very good program in a conference with two or maybe three other good teams.  They dominate the Big 10 with Michigan but got blown away when they played a really good team like Florida.  Ohio State is a very good program but is itself overrated which leads to their players sometimes also being overrated such as Troy Smith.  Some great players have come out of Ohio State in recent years, Troy Smith (despite the Heisman) is probably not one of the best to come out of Ohio State.", 11427, "AA10740319", 0],

	139428 : ["Prog Death, by a lot. Why?  TBH, it is much more imaginative, creative and free than Tech is.  Tech can be brutal, but it relies too much on technique, and the vast majority of bands in the Genre, especially the posterboys, Necrophagist and Cryptopsy, tend to be little more than repetitious pinch harmonics and super precise scales, to way too many blasts and some of the worst Death Vocals EVER. Far too  often (but certainly not always) manual dexterity and technique is viewed as good songwriting, which I totally disagree with.  I think a lot of guitarists like it, because it is something where one's relative \"skill\" is measurable... but I would rather have a sloppy and imprecise, but imaginative and soulful guitar lick that a machine precise one that reveals no feeling, any day of the week (same reason, as a rule I don't like Neo-Classical.. all technique, no personality). Again, so as not to offend, this is not universal, but pretty dang common. The God Father of Death, Chuck not only gave us Death Metal, but he went Progressive Death, and one thing that never happened was a dull moment.  Prog brings in myriads of influences, and is very free form, in terms of \"rules\", techniques, and song structures, it truly is a fertile playground for fevered imaginations. Cynic, mid-career Pestilence, Atheist, Extol, and with each album, more and more, Obscura, the music scape is so lush and unpredictable, it just keeps ones attention in the way that tech simply does not.  I find that Tech is something that appeals to accountants, baseball fanatics, and the numbers people, because of the precision and measurables, whereas IMO the somewhat looser reins of Prog appeal to the right brain crowd BQ- DEATH but old Atheist is not far behind, and when you add stuff liek Obscura, Gojira and others into the mix, it just gets hard to choose! BQ2- Psycroptic BQ3- Well, this month ain't over yet!   And IMO April is and was better than May looks like.  I still got the new Primordial to get Tuesday for one thing.

It can't hurt, though, to add some plants to the tank when you add the betta.  Bettas like thick cover and he'll feel less harassed by the tetras.  Anyway, he'll settle in quickly and be just fine.

So I can say that from my own experience your betta should do great with the fish you have. I've noticed that bettas seem to really like the space to swim (despite the tiny tanks sold for them), and even like playing in filter currents (even though they are from still water.) The tank was originally set up for another male betta, and the above were fish my LFS recommended as compatible (among a few others) - they have similar water and temp requirements, and are peaceful. Fish like danios nip at fins too much, and would damage your betta, and anything with longer fins (guppies, long-fin tetras, etc) might be mistaken for a competing male by your betta, and should be avoided. Another critter that I really like, but that I've found is problematic with bettas is the ghost shrimp. These are the really inexpensive clear shrimp found in many aquarium stores. While they are generally peaceful, they apparently will chew on your bettas fins while he sleeps on the bottom (as bettas seem to often do). This ends up with chewed up and torn fins...didn't actually seem to bother my betta much, but looked awful. My LFS was actually surprised, so I don't know if this is uncommon, or just an uncommon enough combo to have not happened alot, but I'd recommend against ghost shrimp with a betta.
