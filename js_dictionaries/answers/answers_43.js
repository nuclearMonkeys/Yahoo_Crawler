That softail isnt a small light motorcycle.Not saying dont get it as your first ride . Also not saying do get it. If your a big strong guy you might have no problem. My first ride was a 71 T110 Triumph 650 triumph and it was a chopper. Narrow Z bars and a stupid choice for a first bike. But I never crashed it, In fact I still own it.

You need to understand how to apply basic principles and work up to what you are designing.

This can happen for a number of reasons, the drug itself can be neurotoxic (ie. MDMA, alcohol - look up wernicke-korsakoff syndrome, seen many such patients, even THC (marijuanna)), you often don't know what ingredients and impurities are present in the drug (ie. poisons such as strychnine, etc. people die like this all the time!), some agents like the inhalants ie. nitrous oxide, butane, propane, etc. displace oxygen in the blood and it is this hypoxia that gives you a high. The \"high\" is basically your brain crying that it is not getting enough oxygen. Hypoxia kills brains cells very quickly. Yes they can cause permanent brain damage, memory problems, balance problems, mood disorders, etc. as well as damage to other organs such as the heart, liver, etc. DO NOT DO IT! If you or anyone else you know is suffering from problems with memory, balance, etc. Please see a doctor and they will refer you to a neurologist who will better assess their condition.
