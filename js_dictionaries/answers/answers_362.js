	19314 : ["By the standard of reasonable doubt, he should not be found guilty on the charges of 2nd and 3rd degree murder.  On the 2nd degree manslaughter charge, it's extremely possible given his profession at the time.  There's a technicality you're missing in legal cases like this. The technicality is called an elevated standard of care, which applies to trained professionals while performing their jobs.  Cops are no exception to that rule, and you can bet the prosecution is pounding on it in the courtroom.   If you or I (assuming you're not a cop) got into an altercation with George Floyd and he ended up dying, we would probably not be facing the barrage of charges filed against Chauvin.  That's because we don't have the training and certification a cop has, and because we didn't agree to the \"elevated standard\" of anything when we went to work that day.  When the police take an individual into custody, they (the cop(s) at the scene, the police force itself, and the jurisdiction they work for) are legally responsible for that person's safety.  Chauvin knew that when he wrote the exams, he knew it when he got hired on the force, and he knew it when he put his badge on that morning.  If the prosecution isn't hammering that over and over into the jury, they're idiots.  Elevated standard of care means there is less room for reasonable doubt. While I don't think Chauvin should be found guilty of the first two charges, I think he probably will be.  Not because of any legal technicalities, but purely because of pressure from the threats of mass \"peaceful demonstrations\" from the dindu community and their trained seals.", 3224, "M0akEw8Vaa", 1],
