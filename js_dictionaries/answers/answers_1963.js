	103905 : ["im just going to tell you straight up pioneer and alpine are the best brands for car audio but if i had to choose which one is better i think i would choose pioneer. not just because thats all i buy but because its one of the more respectable brands that are reliable, and durable. yes Alpine is also an excellent brand for car stereo, because that is all that alpine does, but the thing with alpine is its a little more expensive than pioneer. but its really up to the buyer to choose, whether you buy pioneer or alpine it doesnt matter because neither of them will let you down. now for speakers you should try and keep them the same brand as the head unit but it doesnt matter too much unless your looking for the best handling output and sound. search this head unit model on google because i have used this for about  2 years and its never gone bad and i have 5000watts shaking the car and the head unit does not skip or anything. DEH-P6700MP this one is the one i use and it is soo great and has so many funtions. it has a built in equilizer to where you can set the bass and treble to adjusting your high, mid, and low frequencies to where your car sounds best. it has loudness control to give you a boost of loudness. you can adjust your subwoofers from the head unit too even turn them off you have 7 or 8 different display functions. it reads all types of cds including mp3s and wma and supports text so you dont have to guess the songs name if you forgot. those are only a few features this unit has and its ridiculous because im am still,after 2 years learning more about my settings.", 9864, "8075ac2a9db310b911937c89854348efaa", 0],

In standard factory configuration you have a great rifle,   but if you want to tune it up like everyone else who owns one,  its EASY to do.   There is as much aftermarket support for the 10/22 as there is for Camaros and Mustangs.   First suggestion would be to get on MidwayUSA.com and find lots of great replacement parts.   Tearing down a 10/22 is one of the easiest gunsmithing projects ever.  Two screws and the stock is off,  two screws and the barrel is off,    push out a few pins and you can gut the receiver.

A 27\" board will have an unstable wheelbase and will be fun just to ride but not any distances. I think you should get a nice Landyachtz ripple ridge. I can carve really well on my 38\" and I can pump it with my Paris trucks. As Comment on the answer above, don't say things you have no clue about.
