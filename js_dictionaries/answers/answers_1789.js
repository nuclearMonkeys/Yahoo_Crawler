	95154 : ["Donkeys were used by Thomas Nast to represent the Democrats because they did useful work. He used the elephant for the republicans because in the U.S. they were just large freaks at the circus that consumed copious quantities of food, produce copious quantities of manure and aside from some slight entertainment value were of no practical use whatsoever.

Your downloading itself is likely showing KB or MB (KiloBYTES or MegaBYTES per second (8-10x difference between bits and bytes) The mb and Mb are case sensitive...  capital letters is BYTES (eight bits = 1 byte and when referring to downloads and such, there's usually \"crc\" bits added, so it's a good assumption to round to 10 instead of 8.) As such, 256KBps = 2560kbps or 2.5mbps I know it may sound confusing and for that I'm sorry, but it's a VERY common misconception and you're hardly the first to inquire.  Feel free to contact BSNL and they can likely explain exactly what your plan includes and describe into further detail the KB/kb differences. Hope this helps and good luck!", 9535, "YFhuHlYZaa", 1],

The only way to get high speed download is to go for a good package. Additionally, most ISPs promise high speed, but do not offer it on a consistent note. So, all depends on the time of access of the internet. Generally, after 12 am in the night till 6am in the morning, you get good high speed internet. During day the speed varies.  Sometimes, due to hairline cracks in your ISP wire line, data loss and speed decrease is observed.", 9535, "hk0I0YYzaa", 0],

Maybe prez Obama will change the way other nations see us from now on cz dumb bushie made a mess of things and made more enemies than you can count.

There might be some illogical resentment toward the college types who get the good jobs, that they think they're smarter than we are.  I've seen kids from recent immigrant homes, where the father resents them graduating high school because he never did, and it makes him feel inferior, particularly when it's a daughter.  I've heard kids say it's no use trying to do well in school, because even if they do, the \"system\" will stop them from succeeding in life.  Kids from uneducated homes come to school with a lot less information than kids of educated parents.  The former group is daily reminded that they don't know many things and often feel they are stupid. They can't go home and ask their parents for homework help.  Among the poor and uneducated, there is a lot of insecurity because life has been hard.  I really applaud those parents who push education as the key to a good future.", 9537, "rU6nh42Eaa", 0],
