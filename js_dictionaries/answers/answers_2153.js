I am sorry to hear that you want her to get an abortion, life is a gift from God, even though we don't see it that way sometimes.  If she can't handle being a mother at that young age, then maybe consider adoption.  There are lots of loving couples out there dying to have a child of their own, but can't due to medical reasons, so adoption could be the right answer.  I know she had to have sex the night she went to the movies 5 months ago and came home at midnight, it is the only answer that makes sense.  But can sh love the child like a child needs love?  Will she get up at 10:00, 12:00, 2:00 every night and still go to school?  Just something to think about.", 10352, "AA12039846", -1],
	113436 : ["Wow!!! I hope you didn't opt for an abortion just because your daughter is pregnant. If I were you, I would've made her have an abortion. Twelve is way too young to have a baby. I had my first one when I was Eighteen and I struggled through it at that age which is a lot more mature than twelve. Telling her how it is, is a very good idea, but on the other hand, it is extremely difficult to know exactly what it is like until you are there. She may not fully understand exactly what it is like. What happens if she has a baby with colic? Do you think she will be able to cope with that? I think that no matter what you say, she won't know what it is really like until the baby gets here. I do believe that the novelty will wear off and you will end up raising this baby yourself. For the first while, she will be ga-ga over the baby because lets face it, babies are cute. Wait until she is deprived of sleep and is changing dirty diapers. How responsible of a Mother is she going to be? I'm sure you will be forking over the money to buy diapers etc. I think you are terrific for being so supportive, but be careful. Do not let your daughter dump the baby on you so she can still be a kid. She needs to learn to stand on her own two feet. If she believes she is old enough to be having sex in the first place, then she should have the majority of the responsibility with raising the baby. You can be there to answer questions and give her moral support, but she should do all the work. Good Luck!!!!", 10352, "OAeuEgm2aa", 4],

This is what they look like:  It looks more like a spider than a bed bug to me, but there are also many different kinds of bed bugs -- some might be fatter than others. I suggest you read more on them, and Google some more pictures of them so you have a better idea of what they look like. Also, bed bugs usually bite in 3's. When I say in 3's, I mean that you will most likely find 3 bites, usually in a row, and if not in a row, still fairly close around the same area. Their bites are also pretty small, but of course, itch like any other. Spider bites and mosquito bites are in most cases much bigger, and you'll probably spot only one. You should look into extermination, just in case. Bed bugs need to be taken care of immediately or else the problem is nearly impossible to eliminate.

All you can do is let her know that it isn't easy being a mom and having a baby at her age is going to be so hard. She really needs to think this through before it's to late to do anything about it.

You, as a single mother of three, know how hard it is as an adult, much less being a single mother at 12. I hope you and your daughter realize that at this point, it is advisable for the baby to be placed up for adoption and given the chance at a better life than what you and your daughter can provide. Use the time and effort you would use raising her baby as time and effort to teach her and guide her. I am sure you are a great mother, and your daughter will be too, when the time is right.

Is it possible that she is more strict at home than she is willing to be in public, for fear of seeming too harsh, or seeming less than perfect?  Moms get such intense scrutiny and criticism that some are afraid to discipline their kids in public (including around relatives).  If this is this case, it might just be that her kids have picked up on it and know they can get away with bloody murder in front of other people.  If your sister gives the impression that she really believers her kids are perfect angels 24/7, I wouldn't broach the subject. (I have one sister like that.  The only issue I ever raised with her was when she, on 2 separate occasions, brought kids with the flu to our parents' house when our father was very ill.) However, if your sister expresses her own frustration, and/or sometimes asks for your opinion/advice, maybe she's giving you an opportunity to discuss it.  Go easy on her.  Make sure she knows you think her kids are wonderful, but since she brought it up. . . . Something else that might be a factor in what you decide to do is whether you have kids of your own.

She'd tell him 15 times to stop doing something and would threaten but would never actually do anything.   Like you said you do, I would make comments to her now and then.  Nothing 'in your face' and nothing to get her to upset with me.  It always fell on deaf ears for the most part. Eventually his behavior got really bad and she realized that what my mother and I had been saying was true.  She finally learned how to discipline him. It sounds like you have the same type of relationship with your sister that I do with mine.  And, in that case, confronting her isn't going to accomplish anything.  Other than causing tension between the two of you.  You and your husband may need to spend less time with her and the kids.  That kind of sends a message without being mean.

Now she's 4 months, and at that age, being a child they don't understand the responsibilities of being a mother. At the age of 24 she will have a 12 yr old. Please try to make her understand what she has done is wrong, but it's not going to be her baby, that's your baby. Some kids can do it, but its very hard to stay focused because after the baby comes, she's going to think that she is grown. She will continue to have sex, and thinks it's okay. Because she has a baby already, and just like she sneaked around and had the first one. She won't care about having another one. So just be very careful. And try keeping her close under your belt for now one. Make her realize  that she just made it harder for herself. Her education and being a mother is all she's has time for.

Unlike a few people here, I refuse to jump to the conclusion that you're a bad mother or irresponsible because of this situation.  The truth is sometimes, parents can do ALL the right things and it still doesn't keep their children from making the wrong decisions.  Peer pressure (especially from a guy they really like) will sometime weigh more heavily with them than doing what they know is right.   You're daughter might think this is great now - but the truth is, she'll learn soon enough that midnight (and three a.m.) feedings are not fun and when you have school or work to go to - they're even less so!  One day, probably soon, she's going to wish she would've waited - unfortunately she won't be able to undo what's been done.

Its never too late to start what you can do now is support her in anyway you can.  It is going to be hard but it is a part of life.  Let the young man and his parents assist as well.  You can seek the advice of a counsellor in your area.  Get pamphlets on teen pregnancy.  It may also be good if you could get family and or pastoral counselling to heal the wounds.
