	38169 : ["Considering how men create new sperm cells all the time, while women only have a limited amount of eggs? Of which one matures and becomes eligible for fertilization every cycle? I'd say no. Because actually, based on my understanding of biology, the egg will have existed for much longer than the sperm cell, anyway. So based on that..? You could say we were in our mothers first. Although of course technically speaking, before the sperm and the egg met, it wasn't really us, to begin with. As we are the combined result of BOTH. And if the egg had been fertilized by a different sperm cell, say..? It would have turned out as a very different person. ..Hopefully now you can stop obsessively asking this question again and again. Although I won't get my hopes up. :S", 5642, "KwkgVbUfaa", -4],

	38172 : ["You can think of an inheritance, there is even a parable called the prodigal Son. The Son received the inheritance and then he went away and squandered it. When we are baptized and believe we receive an inheritance to God's kingdom but we can still lose it through serious sin and losing faith, etc. Before we die we can still return to God (as the prodigal Son did). The point of the story is some Christians will receive the inheritance but they will squander it away and never return. Saint Paul says “I have finished the race, I have kept the faith”, meaning he didn't squander his inheritance. Why is Paul calling it “a race”? Because the end of the race is death. You have to keep the faith till death", 5656, "4GYdeV1Baa", -5],
	38173 : ["Nowhere does the Bible say that you \"are expected to do things to keep that free gift\".  That is a lie.  A gift is a gift.  It is free, totally free, before and after salvation.  Believe in Jesus, and you're saved. And that's why not everyone is saved.  Because not everyone believes in Jesus. Nobody can be good enough to avoid hell. The truth is that death leads to immediate heaven or hell, depending only on whether the person believed in Jesus for eternal life, or not. . The truth is that Jesus loves you and wants to bless your life freely :) Most of all, Jesus wants you with Him forever, and not in hell. The truth is that every belief except one will lead to eternal torment in the lake of fire for every person. Because nothing pays for our sins except the death and blood of Jesus, the sacrifice of Jesus that is already accomplished by Him . Jesus loves you! The truth is that Jesus is God, and Jesus died on the cross to pay for all of our sins in full, and then Jesus resurrected from the dead. Nothing else pays for our sins, not works, not deeds, not religions. So the only way to heaven and to avoid hell, is by believing in Jesus for eternal life (John 6:47), without adding any of your own works (Romans 4:5). Believe in Jesus to take you to heaven, and you will be in heaven, no matter what, guaranteed. That easy, thanks to Jesus! Tell Jesus that you thank Him that you will be with Him in heaven when you die, because you believe in Jesus! It is too late to be saved, after death", 5656, "None", 2],
