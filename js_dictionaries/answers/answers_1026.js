I am sure that Shawn wasn't left alone with a computer and phone right away, and had he been he would have probably called his family or the police. However from my past experience  I know that it is a lot easier to \"brainwash\" a child into thinking anything you want them too if you spend enough time on it. There is no telling what this man was telling this child. All I know is I am glad that this psycho is behind bars and BOTH of these children are where they need to be. I am sure it will take years for Shawn to undo some of the damage this man has caused.

In practical terms, it is not obvious whether or not \"infinity\" truly exists.  We cannot know because the act of knowing would make a limit and thus make it not infinite. Infinite density means that it is so dense that we cannot say how dense it is because whatever number we come up with, it will be smaller than what actually is, somewhere in there. However, the problem might not actually be a matter if unquantifiable mass per unit volume, so much as we cannot quantify it.  That is not the same thing.  The density clearly is going to be something if you could only look and see.  But we have no idea what it might be, and we cannot put a limit to it based on what we know.
