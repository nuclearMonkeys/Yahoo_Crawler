	11054 : ["I agree with almost all of what you are saying first of all. Wholeheartedly. In fact when you look at the cop's own body cam stills you can see that shot where the kid has his hands up and he's illuminated by a blindingly bright flashlight attached to the cop's gun. He's lit up so well that it's so obvious he has absolutely nothing in his hands. That much is clear.  So many people on here are always blaming civilians who get shot by cops because they didn't “comply”. Here is a situation where this child dud everything he was supposed to do....stopped fleeing as he was told, put up his hands as he was told....and he STILL got shot in the chest and killed.  And if he had kept running who's to say he wouldn't have been shot in the back? And possibly been killed that way? I'm sure it would've been a very likely scenario. Regardless, he did as he was told. Every step of the way. I wish other people would have the same insights and observations into this type of an issue that you have.But I was wondering where you got the information that this 13-year-old was a “criminal” and was involved in a “shooting”?  So far I have heard no reports that this child or even his companion had any criminal record. From what I understand, the neighborhood where this occurred has an audio monitoring system where the sound of gunshots can be detected 24/7, recorded and the location of the shots immediately relayed to the police.   Apparently that is what happened in this situation, that eight gun shots were picked up by this monitoring system and a police officer or officers was/were immediately dispatched to the location and arrived within two minutes apparently.So again, there's no evidence thus far that the 13 y/o child had a criminal record. In fact, they are saying that he had wanted to become a cop when he got older.  For all we know it might just have been a situation where this child was being influenced by this older 21 y/o who had gotten the gun somewhere, maybe a parent left it lying around at home (?) and maybe they were just fooling around and shooting it because they had nothing better to do with that particular moment on that particular  morning. Maybe they just wanted to make some noise like kids will do when they are bored and decide to light off fireworks for example. Who knows?", 1823, "None", -1],
