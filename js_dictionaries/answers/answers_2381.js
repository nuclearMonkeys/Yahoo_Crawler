	124867 : ["Yes, the NEC requires sizing fixed heating at 125%, and allows multiple heaters on a circuit up to 30A circuit size.  3000 watts on a 240v circuit requires a minimum 15.6A overcurrent, so a 20A breaker, which requires a minimum #12. No need to upgrade wire size, #12 is already 30A wire that is derated to 20A. No need to run 40A #10 wire for a 15.6A circuit.  Generally the best way is run an extra 12/2 from the hot side of the first stat to the hot side of the second stat. If the stat you use just has screws then you need to pigtail the first connection. You will need a junction box with at least 18 cubic inch for the first stat (6 circuit conductors +1 for grounds, +1 device yoke, 8 x 2.25 for each #12 = 18). ", 10812, "mEQbJbhnaa", 0],

Also, they put on one or more plays a year. A friend of mine got into acting when he was 50 via his community theater.  He performed the father on their production of \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and was hired to perform that same roll in a theater in Chicago the following year.   That would be the skill side.

At the end of the 2nd century Christianity had begun to blend Greek philosophy —human speculative reasoning, with the teachings of God's Word. Such words and phrases as ‘continuance of being', ‘perpetual existence', ‘incapable of dissolution' and ‘incorruptible' began to appear in so-called Christian writings. These had come straight from Plato, the Greek philosopher, all those years before Jesus. An ever-burning hell has remained a commonly taught doctrine of the Christian religion to this day. It was not based on the Bible but on philosophy. Bible verses were later sought to uphold the ancient philosophies of the Greeks, and added to the teaching.", 10811, "cIHYVzH0aa", -1],

	124910 : ["What these non-JW sites don't what you to read are the following quotes: Russell wrote on pp. 5367, 5368 of the 15 Dec. 1913 WT (republished from an October 1, 1907 article): \"A dear Brother inquires, Can we feel absolutely sure that the Chronology set forth in the Dawn-Studies is correct? - That the harvest began in 1874 and will end in A.D. 1914....?\" \"We answer,\" Russell continues, \"as we have frequently done before in the Dawns and Towers and orally and by letter, that we have never claimed that they were knowledge, nor based upon indisputable evidence, facts, knowledge; our claim has always been that they are based on faith. We have set forth the evidence as plainly as possible and stated the conclusions of faith we draw from them.... \"Many have examined these evidences and have accepted them; others equally bright do not endorse them.... \"We neither urge nor insist upon our views as infallible, nor do we smite or abuse those who disagree; but regard as `brethren' all sanctified believers in the precious blood. \"On the contrary, it is those who differ who smite us and speak evil of us .... They are our critics who always claim the infallibility. We go humbly onward following the Apostle's example and words, `We believe and therefore speak,' whether others hear or forbear to hear. Is not this in accord with the Spirit of Christ? .... \"But some of those who come to a trifling point on which they disagree seem to imagine that the entire harvest work must be overthrown, or at least stopped, until they get their little jot or tittle satisfactorily adjusted.\" - p. 5367. \"But let us suppose a case far from our expectations: Suppose that A.D. 1915 should pass with the world's affairs all serene and with evidence that the `very elect' had not all been `changed' .... What then? Would that not prove our chronology wrong? Yes, surely! .... one of the strings of our `harp' would be quite broken! \"However, dear friends, our harp would still have all the other strings in tune and that is what no other aggregation of God's people on earth could boast. .... \"If, therefore, dearly beloved, it should turn that our chronology is all wrong, we may conclude that with it we have had much advantage everyway. If the attainment of our glorious hopes and present joys in the Lord should cost us such disappointment as our friends fear, we should rejoice and count it cheap!\" - p. 5368. And in the Jan. 1 1911 WT, Russell wrote: \"Suppose that our chronological calculations (never set forth as infallible) should prove to be fallible and in error. Our conclusion would merely be that the error could not be very great .... \"If, then, it should prove eventually that the crisis of earthly government will not be reached by the end of 1914, should we not be very faithful anyway, and remember that had it not been for that alarm clock which helped awaken us from the worldly stupor, we might not have been sufficiently awake to appreciate and enjoy the wonderful spiritual blessings which daily crown our lives?\" - p. 4743 . And in the Oct. 15, 1913 WT, Russell wrote: \"We wish still, however, to reiterate what we have said from the first respecting the date of the close of the Times of the Gentiles; namely, that the calculations as we presented them in Vol. II, Studies in the Scriptures, are the truth to the best of our knowledge and belief. Nevertheless, there is enough uncertainty about the matter of chronology to make it a matter of faith rather than of positive knowledge. We remind our readers that our consecration to the Lord is not to October, 1914, nor to any other time except that mentioned by the Savior - `Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.' - Rev. 2:10.\" - p. 5336. Attempting to determine dates of future scriptural events in order to encourage fellow Christians was important to Russell (and Rutherford). If they did it honestly and publicly (which they did), it was a part of prophesying (in the sense of speaking out publicly), but it was obviously never considered as (nor promoted as) infallible inspired prediction!
