He was not home when we arrived at his farm, so this was the first I'd seen of him.  We had our clothes on, of course.  So did Grandpa.  The old man started yelling at us because we were kissing, passionately - and told me he was going to throw me off his property for acting like a harlot!  I looked at Dan, and asked, \"What is a harlot?\"  And the old man started yelling some more.  Then, my guy stepped up to the older man, looked at me, then looked his Grandpa in the eye and said, \"Sir, this is S_____, she is wonderful and I love her.  You can't do that to her - it's my fault; I can't leave her alone!\"  Or something very close to that.  The old guy (in his 70's) was silent.  I think everyone was afraid of him, and didn't talk back.  I was silent because this was the first time Dan had said LOVE about me!  Then G'pa started laughing, and that was it.

	106207 : ["\"Honest answer\" would imply you think you are the only one capable of telling the truth. It's your belief, you are not authority and the laws and physics of life. If this judgmental controlling God exists who wants to punish the very children he created in all forms and variety of DNA then let him do it. If you have a viewpoint then free speech allows you exactly that but it is only a viewpoint, not a fact.  Yes sometimes people are over sensitive and delete questions, happens to me sometimes, silly really because they are questions, not statements of truth, I don't know if I'm right and just ask to provoke debate and opinions. If people are immature enough to delete, report and sling mud without attempting to answer a question then they shouldn't really be here.

	106208 : ["The problem arises whenever anyone's core beliefs are attacked.  Homosexuals desperately want to validate their lifestyle as loving, wholesome, and normal. They want to be accepted and not persecuted. To this end, many are willing to force their beliefs onto others just as strongly as those who oppose homosexuality.  Neither will ever convince the other to accept their beliefs.  The result is a schism which prevents peace and love which was Jesus's message.  My feeling is that Christians should let God be the judge and quit trying to take on His responsibility.", 9949, "7ROY3tfyaa", 1],
	106209 : ["I've never seen a movie that I would considered better, but there are three that come to mind, that are probably equal. Gone With The Wind is an excellent book and movie.  Probably the best out there in both catagories. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was such a good book, and the movie was so great.  It would probably be the only movie I would say is better than the book, but only because of Jack Nicholson's amazing performance.  It gave such life to an great character.   The last one is the miniseries that was created for the novel Lonesome Dove.  It was great, although the book was better.   Pretty much what I can say about those three movies, is that although they aren't better, they do their novel counterpart justice.  Which I guess is all that matters.", 9953, "None", 2],

I have a father who is an alcoholic and honestly allowed us to do some pretty bad stuff when I was around 4years old. I would love to change the fact that I think people who drink are going to do the same crap my dad did. But honestly, I am an 18 year old who is one of those people in the world who does not drink smoke or do any drugs. Also would love to change the fact that I can be really really quiet at times when it comes to socializing but when I get to work I am talkative. Its wierd and honestly dont know how to explain it. Personality wise I am mostly quiet among some people and some friends and family I open up easily to. I guess you can say trust more people than I have and allow more people to get to know the real person I am instead of just seeing the quiet person I show. This causes alot of stress in my life since I honestly dont have many friends, and the ones that do get close I have a problem with allowing them to be part of my everday life. Also last but not least education, well my sister dropped out of High school and is having troubles finding a job and also has a child. Me, I descided to go into a different path Graduate High School and will be going to college in the fall. ALso work two jobs as of right now.Also don't plan to be a parent till I have a stable relationship with someone and have got my degree.

Stone adulterers to death.  So you chose to dwell on only one sin that offends YOU.  If you're following every word in the Bible, you must have no arms or eyes, right???  Cause YOU are NOT sinless, yet you judge others because you feel your sins are less than theirs. Guess what, they're not. Who on this earth is worthy enough to tell anyone they are a worse sinner than they are?  You may not be a homosexual Ernie, but, you are a sinner.  Make sure your own soul is sweet smelling for the Lord before you judge and tell others they're sinful.

	106230 : ["I am a reader also and prefer books to movies. In movies they have to leave out so much of the description which gives the reader the feeling they are in the story. It's hard to picture what is going on in the mind of the author this way.   In movies they have a time limit to establish the characters in the book. Sometimes the smallest part of a person mannerisms, nature, and quirks are the most important, books give you this.  Movies have to limit where the characters are physically in the story. For instance streets, beaches, dark alleys. If action is involved in the story a movie will limit some of this to accommodate the chase so to speak. In books you are there in the dark ally or the beautiful moonlight beach feeling what the character is feeling.  I thought  \"The Client\" was true to the book as well as \"Kiss the girls\" to name a couple. \"The Beach\" was one of the worst in my opinion.

I know what you're saying though, about just the sun signs.. not alot of people know there's actually more than just a sun sign.  Most people don't even know that it's even called a sun sign, that they just read their 'horoscope,' and run with that. It's all in good fun, I think, though. It's fun to think you can organize what you know about why someone does something. The good thing about astrology though, is when you start, you can't stop. Lol. You actually WANT to learn more. Ahh, it is hard to answer questions when people just ask based on a sun sign, but we can't force 'em to learn any faster. Though I'd like to, trust me. I see what's her name always trying so hard to explain that there's more than just the sun sign.. but I wonder how many people ACTUALLY listen.  Still, though.. this IS the horoscope section. I mean, if I wanted to complain about my life and upbringing, I'd do it in THAT section. But I do that enough all day, every day, LOL, horoscopes are just so much easier to handle when I need a joke.
