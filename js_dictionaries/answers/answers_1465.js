	78902 : ["Yes.. unless you know the policy of the place you can't assume that the driver gets the delivery charge..   I worked as a driver we had a $1 to $3 delivery fee (depending on area), but we were only given $.75  each delivery.    Being late is not always the drivers fault, so that doesn't normally bother me..  but, if the driver does something to screw up the order.. then I tip less..  but having been a driver I always give at least $4. If I can't afford the tip, I pick my order up..", 8968, "XF1ctbrkaa", 0],
	78903 : ["A tip would be greatly appreciated, as the delivery charge goes to the business to pay for the driver's gas. Often times, food workers who might get tips are paid less than minimum wage as it is assumed that tips will make up the difference. Too, this is the guy who just brought you a yummy dinner so you didn't need to a) cook, b) drive somewhere for fast food, and c) miss any of the game on TV.

	78908 : ["I grew up in a very small town and High School was were all the activity was except for getting drunk and making out. I even did some of that at school. LOL It's hard to believe I survived High School and I was an \"A\" Student. School is were Girls were and were I played Football so I had a blast. It didn't hurt that by the time I started High school my Dad had quit drinking (He was one of the worst alcoholics I have ever seen) . Mom was still a pain but Dad and I became best friends, So I guess my view of my High school years is a little biased. The School Dances were big events in a small town that had one movie theater with just one screen, no fast food restaurants and no malls. We didn't get Rock Concerts coming within 150 miles so I didn't see my first Live Concert until I went away to college unless you count local bands playing at the Dances.", 8969, "M1gUkugNaa", 2],
	78909 : ["I went for a year left, took a Ged passed it. High school was one of the worst experiences of my life middle school was cool I had friends I did well in the classroom and I can remember having a good time with friends,  but when I went to high school there were a lot of black and Mexican gangs it was like walking into the hood it was really weird. All my friends from middle school were there but I never saw them except for in the hallways a quick \"hey\" and that's it. I didn't make one new friend for that whole year so I just stayed high on weed and stayed in my own world. If I wouldn't have left I think something bad was gonna happen maybe I would made the headlines being one of these dumb kids that shoot up their school but who knows thank god I left it was a living hell for me.", 8969, "IJP4Zh8aaa", -1],

	78918 : ["ALWAYS tip the driver. When you go to a restaurant you tip a waitress who walks your food from the kitchen pick-up window to your table and gets a large tip.

	78923 : ["I'm a freshman in high school so I can't say my opinion as an overall experience but I can tell you about my opinion of the 1st year. Hell to the no do I enjoy high school, it sucks! I changed schools and I hate it so much, I miss my friends, teachers and the freedom I once had. On top of that, there's tons of work.

My private school experience was very good. I was always an inbetweener socially, and somewhat of an underachiever though. Going to a private school was enriching, but going to a large suburban HS sucked.  My last years at the ghetto HS were actually fun.  i ran into some trouble at the douchy suburban school when they denied my credits of 2 semesters for missing more than 3 f**ing days of school. (Tardies were counted as absences) I left private school because it was my home school, and my parents were getting fisted w/ school taxes anyway, and my private HS was almost an hour commute.  After being fed up of that shitty suburban HS, i switched school by myself. Since i had a car, and my parents owned a rental house in the hood, i self enrolled in one of the most infamous HS in TX.

You can go to any home store and purchase a submersible pump for about $70.  The output of the pump will attach to a regular garden hose.   for filling your pool tape a scrap of window screen to the bottom intake so you don't suck up any critters and keep the pump above the bottom of the river.  If you can wade in I'd just drive a stake into the bottom and then tape the cord of the pump to the top of the stake to hold it in place.   you could also make a more permanent mount for the pump and use it for watering your lawn to cut down on water and sewer charges.  the river water will also be better for your plants than city water.", 8967, "Hebog1mGaa", 0],

Their plan goes awry when the girl accidently swallows the jawbreaker, choking to death. The cool and calculating Courtney tries to cover the crime but is found out by school geek Fern Mayo.
