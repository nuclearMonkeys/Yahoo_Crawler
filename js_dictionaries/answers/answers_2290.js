Just FYI:  Call the creditor and give them the information about the fraudulent account, but don't give them your phone number until you send that police report b/c those dirt bastards gave my number to a collection agency even after I informed them that the account was opened illegally.

	120316 : ["I have been writing to around a dozen prisoners for the past 7years or so. The number varies for several reasons-including one having been found innocent and released from prison. A lot depends on how you write. I have never had anything other than genuine friendship, care and respect from anyone I write to either male or female. A lot of them , due to the way the American justice system operate have not actually been the killers themselves but have been there when the crime was committed. Sure they are not saints- who is? And it is very difficult when one of your friends is executed, especially so as you know in advance the time of their death. But it has made me re-evaluate how I view people and hopefully turned me into a better human being. It is a long term commitment. Starting to write on a whim and not continuing is cruel. Have a look at the www.deathrowspeaks.info website. It is very well set up and may give you a clearer picture of why you or anyone would wish to write to someone on death row.", 10613, "9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa", 2],

I send him photos of the town I live in. Tell him stories of amusing things that happen in my day to day life.  When I started writing he asked if I wanted to know about the reason he was there. I said no & he has never mentioned it again except to say when he has hearings concerning a re-trail. He says he is innocent (but then they all do, don't they). I did not want to know what his crime was so that I could not make any judgements about him. He has never once asked for anything other than friendship. I (& he, according to his letters) think that I am in some small way making his life a little easier. There really is no crueller punishment than to tell a man he is going to die & then not do it for years.  I think if a man is guilty without any doubt at all then he should be sentenced, given 1 month to make his peace with whatever God he worships, say his goodbyes to his family & then the sentence carried out.
