	85859 : ["First, I don't give a rat's behind what Tertullian said about women. I can respect other things he said, but no man will make me feel like a second-class citizen in God's kingdom.  As for the verses you quoted: I'll just stick to New Testament and let Jewish posters respond to the Tanakh verses, except for the Job verse about \"he who is born of woman.\" That doesn't mean a man is unclean by being born from his mother but that EVERYONE comes out with a flawed nature because EVERYONE is born of a woman. It's a metaphor for the universal human condition.  Now, the word \"submit\" in Ephesians would be better translated in English as \"live in harmony.\" And you left out the verse that says husbands and wives \"submit one to another.\" If it's demeaning to women then why are men being told to submit to their wives? Because it's saying \"live in harmony with each other.\"  The other verses refer to a variety of circumstances, such as women causing trouble in church, etc. These were individual problems in individual churches and the writer was trying to give advice to those leading the congregations. I will admit, the writings have been used by men to suppress women by trying to apply the verses universally but there is a rule in Christian exegesis: Do not blame the scripture for someone choosing to misuse it.  A lot of people follow Tertullian's teaching that woman brought in sin. But the Bible says that as by the first Adam sin was brought into the world, so by the second Adam (Christ) redemption was made possible.  Most importantly, you have not looked at how Jesus treated women. I see on here all the time people saying \"Jesus was rude to his mother, Jesus called a woman a dog\" blah blah. This is either gross ignorance or the worst kind of dishonesty. Jesus was the best friend womankind ever had. He scandalized his culture by publicly teaching women, publicly speaking to them, and having them as disciples. Martha of Bethany, along with Peter the Apostle, has the distinction of being the first to recognize Jesus as the Christ.  Lots of men try to put me down or put me in \"my place\" in the church. I don't let them. I know who I am, a daughter of God by his love and grace.", 9209, "None", 4],

There is no formal \"job\" of First Lady, despite the social role of hostess.  Mrs. Obama is not the only first lady that wasn't comfortable with the lack of privacy, the pomp and circumstance associated with official functions, or the challenges of raising a family in the white house.

Apparentlt Saddam tried to take out Bush's father. Don't be ridiculous. That's like when people turned the blind eye in which in WW2...they nuked 2 cities...which should be considered genocide and anyone who was a part of it should have been prosecuted for war crimes....but americans see justification in it by saying that it ended the war quicker. So ...even by today...americans have no negative thoughts about Roosevelt....they don't even care or think about how evil an act that was.  It's funny....african americans whine and whine about slavery that existed over a century ago.....and present african americans were not even victims of it....and their own ancestors in Africa enslaved southern europeans for 800 years back before the 15th century as well as sold them to the europeans....but are ready to forgive war crimes committed to other races and people that are more recent? Look Bush is not a good man. He lied. Twisted the law. His people or he was responsible for the CIA leak...his greed in oil let the oil companies suck the life out of the economy.....      but you want to forgive this guy if Iraq builds themselves up? If Bush cared...he would visit Iraq for the next few years and try to help. But he won't because he doesn't care. He can also chip in some of his retirement pay that he gets for the rest of his life for events and parties for the soldiers that are over there now....or pay for operations for kids who were disfigured by bombs and etc. The man does not care in my opinion.

	85884 : ["Well, if you think that giving the Iraqis freedom, and allowing women to participate in society a good thing, then I would have to concede that it is a spectacular success.  In Iran woman can't even attend a soccer match. But from MY perspective, Bush was a terrible President. Bush and all those evil Republicans should be severely punished for liberating Afghanistan and Iraq from oppressive dictatorships. Why are we liberating brown-skinned people from tyrrany? Who cares about them anyway? Shouldn't liberty and democracy be reserved for Whites? By spreading democracy, we are helping to ensure that the kind of backwardsness, ignorance, intolerance, and festering ethnic hatreds that have characterized the Middle East are replaced by nations where people participate in government, have guaranteed civil rights, and can be proud that they are advanced enough mentally, socially, and emotionally to not have to be ruled by an iron-fisted dictator....  I really hate that !  I love reading about unfortunate people being pummelled by a dictator.  Face it, it's funny. Even worse, is that their ideas about implanting democracy are spreading like a virus.  Lebanese leader Walid Jumblatt said this: \"It's strange for me to say it, but this process of change has started because of the American invasion of Iraq,\" explains Jumblatt. \"I was cynical about Iraq. But when I saw the Iraqi people voting three weeks ago, 8 million of them, it was the start of a new Arab world.\" Jumblatt says this spark of democratic revolt is spreading. \"The Syrian people, the Egyptian people, all say that something is changing. The Berlin Wall has fallen. We can see it.\" Shoot !!!  Bush & Co. not only will succeed in depriving me of the guilty thrill of reading about the wild excesses of the Iraqi dictatorship, and the even more hilarious nightmare world of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but now it looks like totalitarianism is doomed in the entire Middle East.  I am so blanking mad !!! And what about all those women who now have constitutionally guaranteed rights? I don't much care for that either. I mean, it was fun reading about how these Afghan women had to walk around in stifling burkas in 110 degree heat, and be virtual slaves, without any hope of education or self-determination. I'd laugh for days about that. How much vicarious fun can I have at their expense now? They've been freed from servitude, and are able to attend school. That is not my fantasy. How about Bush forcing teachers to actually be accountable, and for schools to be graded on progress? I liked it better when High Schools could just churn out semi-literates by the busload. I'd walk into burger joints and laugh at the High School graduates. Guess I can't have fun at their expense anymore either. Those sneaky Republicans are a real buzz-kill. By forcing positive change, they're depriving me of all my sources of enjoyment, which mainly consist of people less fortunate than me.  How about that Patriot Act? I know not even one innocent person has been affected by it, but still..... why should I have to endure some governmental act with a corny, old-fashioned word like \"patriot\" in the name? That's so 1950s. I mean, should we be watching \"Leave It To Beaver\" now too? Then those rotten Republicans have prevented any further attacks on U.S. soil. That really upsets me. Watching huge devastation on tv is fun, and now they've wrecked that too! What a bunch of jerks. Perhaps worst of all is Bush's commitment to getting Israel and Pelestine to finally sign a formal peace treaty, establishing the permanent Palestinian state. Now they've gone too far! I love this blood feud. It's great reading about suicide bombings and endless acts of terrorism against Israel. Now, that's all going to stop... and it's Bush's fault. I used to be proud to be American. But those Republicans have no idea about how much entertainment value they have destroyed with their so-called progress. Liberty and Justice for all?
