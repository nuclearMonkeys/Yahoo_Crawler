All roads lead to heaven except not excepting God as your savior.

	76963 : ["I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and you can't possibly say that Catholics never say anything derogatory about us.  Catholics say we're not Christian because we don't believe in the trinity doctrine (which, by the way, even the Catholic Church acknowledges wasn't a doctrine until 300 to 400 years after Christ and was not a teaching the apostles of Christ supported); they say we're a cult (we don't follow any man except Christ Jesus, so by the Catholic Church's standards for cultism every Christian denomination would be a cult); I live in a predominantly Catholic area and I have to say in my years of going door-to-door I've encountered so many absolutely rude Catholics who have honestly said \"Get off my step, I'm Catholic!\"  Seems to me that a true Christian would be a little more polite to people since the Bible says to love even your enemy.  But then, Catholics don't use their Bibles much at church (I know...I used to attend).  If you've never heard anything about any other religion, you must not have been listening. Regarding Catholics praying to a statute of Mary - according to the scriptures, specifically Exodus 20:4, 5 and Deuteronomy 5:8, 9, we are not to make carved images or a form like anything in the heavens, on the earth or in the waters and then bow down to them.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't Catholics bow down and pray in front of statues of Mary?  Additionally, according to scripture (1 Timothy 2:5) there is only one mediator between God and mankind, that being Christ Jesus.  Therefore praying to Mary or anyone else isn't going to get your prayer heard by God. Regarding the discussion on \"cults\", the important thing is what God considers us to be.  Jesus sets out in the scriptures the identifying factors of his followers and mentioned that those who would follow him would have to endure unjust persecution.  History shows that it has quite often been the Catholic Church on the giving end of persecution toward other religions. Here are just a few other things to consider:  Do you think Christ would be happy to see his followers fighting in wars against others claiming to be Christians?  Do you think Christ would be happy that his followers have mixed their worship with paganism, nationalism and traditions of men (you should consider doing a little research on the origins of the holidays and traditions you observe)?  Do you think Christ would approve of his followers getting involved in politics?  If you say yes, you may want to re-read your Bible. As it pertains to Witnesses coming to your doors often, sorry that it offends or annoys you, but as in the days of Noah, we (Christians) have a commission from God and Christ to warn everyone of his impending judgement against those not living life in harmony with his word.  We go door-to-door to encourage others to look to the Bible since its God's kingdom that is the only hope for mankind.  It wouldn't be very loving of us to not let you hear the message because your Catholic.  As Paul said at 2 Timothy 4:5 we have to \"do the work of an evangelizer\" and \"fully accomplish [our] ministry\".  Further, 1 Corinthians 9:5 shows the importance of doing this work:  \"If, now, I am declaring the good news, it is no reason for me to boast, for necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!\"", 8865, "None", -2],

I don't think the epidemic proportions of the abuse scandal have really registered with the majority of people, particularly Catholics - for all the usual reasons, the same reasons the priests were able to get away with it in the first place.  You attach the Jesusâ„¢ brand name to anything, and you can get away with anything.   But what's been exposed in the Catholic Church should by all rights have been its death knell.  Thousands upon thousands of children were raped by priests in practically every diocese, and the bureaucracy covered it up to save face.

	76976 : ["Because routers differ as to details, I can't be specific about how to accomplish these actions, but they're almost all done from within the router's administration web pages. Note: It's best to do them from a computer cabled (even just temporarily) to the router rather than wirelessly, especially since wireless administration will be deactivated by action #1. Generally, to access your router's administration pages, hook up a computer directly to the router and enter the router's local IP address into a browser's address window.  See way below for details on finding your router's IP address. 1.	Deactivate wireless access to your router's administration web pages so only a computer connected via an Ethernet cable can reach them.  This won't affect wireless use of the Internet, just wireless administration of the router. Even if you don't want to leave a computer connected via a cable, leave the cable there for when you need it.   2.	Turn off the SSID (network name) broadcast from the router.  There's no need to advertise your network's presence.  You're not running a hotspot; everyone who should be on your network should know its name. 3.	Change your SSID from the default.  Hackers know that routers come with default SSIDs and look for them.  Even if the SSID isn't being broadcast, if a hacker knows its name, they can hop on board. 4.	Set up encryption with an encryption key.  The longer, the better. WPA (if your network and all your computers can support 802.11G) is better than WEP.  WEP is better than nothing.  Each of your wireless computers and devices will need this encryption key.  Wired computers will not. 5.	(Optional) Limit access to only the computers you want on the network via MAC filtering. (MAC refers to unique NIC (Network Interface Card) addresses, not Macintosh computers, and not IP addresses.)  This isn't a defense against hardcore freeloaders -- it's possible to fake MAC addresses -- but it keeps out casual interlopers. 6.	(Optional and only partially effective) Change the range of and/or limit the number of automatically assigned IP addresses (DHCP) to reduce the chance of extra users.  Again, hackers know what ranges routers come from the factory with.  Changing them makes it a little harder to hop on board. Here's how to find your router's IP address: 1.	Click on the Start->Run button. 2.	In the text box, type cmd and press Enter. 3.	A black \"DOS box\" will pop up.  In it, enter ipconfig /all A bunch of gibberish will fill the box.  Next to \"Default Gateway\" an IP address will appear.  This is your router's IP address.  That should go far toward hardening your wireless network.", 8871, "FBQZ06vraa", 1],
