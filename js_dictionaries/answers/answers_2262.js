You can also unlock more characters and vehicles that way, but the requirement will be a little bit higher. The Wii does not come with a memory card but it has built-in flash drive which can store about 2600 blocks of memory if I remembers right.  It does accept SD cards for additional memory where you can move your saves there to clear up the internal flash drive.  Know that you don't have to buy the Nintendo SD card though which cost you $50 for the cheapest.  Any standard SD card would work and they are way cheaper than the Nintendo Brand ones.

You cannot complete 3/4 stages and go back to finish the 4th stage.  I really like this game almost as much as Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii.
