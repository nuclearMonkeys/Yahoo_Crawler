This was written in Aramaic Bible in the Aramaic language at the time things were happening. What formed into the Eastern Orthodox church used that Aramaic Bible. when Constantine I adopted the Western Orthodox church they attempted to have the Eastern orthodox church and the Aramaic Bible eradicated. Constantine was not successful and the Aramaic bible survived. The Greek and Latin were translated from Aramaic. However the people translation did not have a fluent knowledge of Aramaic, hence a lot of \"Guesses\" were made. Those that followed the Aramaic Bible never Blessed the Greek version as well as those that were hebrew did not bless the Greek translation of the OT. It is interesting to see what a direct translation from Aramaic to English produces. To answer your question: the Stories about being translated to Greek later are true, But that fact the original Aramaic text written in Christ time was suppressed and talk of it was considered heresy. I have put a link to one such translation", 8809, "XacKfXcBaa", 1],
	75714 : ["I've always wondered that, myself. Possibly it is because he was too busy with his travels and his ministry to put his ideas down on paper, planned to do it eventually, and was executed before he was able to actually do so. His actual ministry only lasted 3 years, after all, and according to the Bible, it wasn't exactly uneventful. Or perhaps the son of a carpenter (or, more accurately, builder, since trees aren't exactly abundant in the Middle East) wasn't literate at all, and it was said that he was later to make him appear more wise. He could have passed down his teachings in an oral tradition, and it wasn't until later that someone felt the need to write them down.  Or (bring on the thumbs-downs) maybe he didn't exist at all. I believe that he did, simply because there is historical evidence outside of the Bible that points to his existence, but that doesn't mean that I (or the historians that say so) are correct. A great many people believe otherwise, after all. Either way, I don't think that Jesus was magic; merely a wise teacher who got a little too involved in politics and was executed for it.", 8809, "48NU7xXKaa", 3],

The new one was HEAVILY based on the book, and I've read the book and the new one follows it almost exact. The Coens didn't even think about the 1969 version before they made the movie. They both read the book and then made the movies from what they read in the novel. Yeah both movies share some exact lines (obviously because those lines were in the book), but trust me, the new one is more true to the novel. Plus Kim Darby seemed to perky and nice in the 1969 one. Mattie Ross is supposed to be headstrong, annoying and bratty. I thought Hailee did wonderful.

Heavy periods run in our family, and I'm taking Mefenamic Acid for stomach cramps (which also help heavy periods) so hopefully they'll settle down. Try eating something, you'll honestly feel better. Even if it's really naughty, just go for it, or you'll get low blood sugar and feel faint. Not nice :D   Wait for a few more cycles and see if they get any lighter. If they don't you may not be consuming enough iron. Iron rich foods include OxO and Bovril, eggs, lamb, game (birds), corned beef, beans and pulses, curry powder, rich fruit cake, ginger biscuits and CHOCOLATE!! Yes, chocolate is a life saver.   If this doesn't help, you may need to speak to your mum about going to a doctor. It's nothing to worry about and you aren't ill, but they may be able to help you. Bearing in mind you may be slightly overreacting, as I probably did, but you know for sure if your period soaks through a night pad and knickers in less than half an hour. Just keep wearing as high absorbency pads as much as possible, and change them whenever you get the chance.   Hopefully, the eating will even up soon. I am STILL off food, but I don't know why. Just try a little of whatever you fancy. Plus, I've found that I have a craving, not for food, but fizzy drinks. They just sound so much better to me at the moment! See what you think.
