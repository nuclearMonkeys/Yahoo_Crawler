I will admit I haven't followed the guide exactly. I'm not sticking perfectly to the listed foods and meal plans (but mostly) and doing very little exercise, but the weight keeps flying off.  It clearly works and if I'd followed it exactly I think it would scare the living daylights out of me because of the amount that I'd lose. So thanks again for the information.

I can't picture a WR having the size and strength to play offensive line, but I suppose you're still young enough that the overlap in positions isn't gigantic if you're a big athletic kid. My suggestion would be to talk to your coach, and see what he has to say. Make sure you make it clear that you will play wherever he can use you. Can you tackle? Perhaps safety or linebacker would suit you better because of your lack of hands.  The best option may be to do a little of both - if you use a tight end in your offense, try out that. If you're honestly good enough to play o-line, and you have the speed and skill set of a WR, you have more than enough skills to play there.", 8695, "e4ekb1amaa", -1],

	72806 : ["Yeah, I agree with I live in paradise. It was a bad challenge but I think it was just mistimed more than anything else. You could obviously see there wasn't any malice in it and that he did feel sad about the whole situation. I don't think people are making \"excuses\" for him there's no doubt that it was a foul and he shouldn't have gone in on Ramsey like that. What's done is done and the only thing we Arsenal fans can do right now is wish Aaron Ramsey a very speedy and full recovery.  It really was a horrific injury, however Eduardo is great proof that he can make a full recovery and get back to playing football.", 8696, "erfnULPQaa", 1],
	72807 : ["I feel sorry for both Ramsey and Shawcross, for different reasons. I feel sorry for Ramsey because he's suffered a potentially career-threatening injury. He'll be in a lot of pain, it'll be a long road to recovery and he'll miss months of football. I feel sorry for Shawcross because he did very little wrong, and none of it intentional, but he has to live with the knowlege that all those reasons why we feel sorry for Ramsey are because of a collision with him. The incident itself happened in a fraction of a second, and Shawcross is going to be replaying it in his head, desperately looking for things he should have done differently, and feeling guilty for every decision that lead up to the incident. Also, he'll have to live with being vilified by various members of the Arsenal staff, the media and the public. In addition to that, the memory of his first England call-up will always be tainted by the fact that it happened on the same day as Ramsey's injury and Shawcross' first ever red card. And the fact that he's been called up for England means that the whole country will be talking about him and that, potentially, his first appearance for England will involve his every move being scrutinised, critisised, and compared to the incident with Ramsey. In my personal opinion, it wasn't a bad challenge. It was a high-speed 50-50 that 98 times out of 100 wouldn't have injured anyone, and 1 time out of 100 would have injured Shawcross himself. As far as I'm concerned, it was a collision, with horrific but accidental consequences.  There is a difference between a horrific injury and a horrific challenge. As for Ramsey reading these responses, I don't know him but like to think that he'd understand and approve. Showing sympathy for Shawcross does not lessen our sympathy for Ramsey, or our sincere wishes that he makes a full recovery. Football, like life, is not so simple that there is always 'the victim' and 'the villain'. I agree, though, that Whelan was an absolute star. Massive respect to him for looking after Ramsey.", 8696, "xUcjzYPdaa", 0],

	72809 : ["USC would win that game going away.  Florida under Urban Meyer has trouble matching up with pro-style offenses.  While Tebow would give them trouble, because USC has problems with mobile QB's, like they did with Vince Young.  But Young and Tebow were 2 different types of running QB's.  Young was fast and elusive, and usually ran when the play broke down, while Tebow tries to take on tacklers and is really just a RB playing QB.  90% of his runs are designed running plays for him.", 8694, "PnyVjBRlaa", 2],
	72810 : ["That USC team would destroy the Gators. I don't think it would be close. The Linebackers the Gators has are great but they have no speed at all. They are more like Ray Lewis. Big and slow but can hit hard. Reggie would run around them all day.", 8694, "tvK1byh1aa", 3],

Eat less than 2000 calories and less than 20 grams of fat and the weight comes off pretty quick. And drink green tea. I'm 5'7\" and have gotten up to 218. I just started a regimen because I may have liver damage. It only requires a little life style change. To keep it off you just have to stick to the diet and exercise routine.

You are likely to get very hungry, binge, then get discouraged and end up losing nothing. Why not lower your goal a bit? Try for 8 pounds a month which would put you at a 40 pound loss from now. You can still go ahead and lose another 20 pounds, if you think you need to do that. But you would certainly be feeling great about yourself from a 40 pound loss. That is still fast losing. I never set my goal for more than 5 pounds a month. I don't like getting discouraged. Good luck!", 8692, "None", 0],
	72814 : ["First, 220-60= 160. All it takes to lose weight is to eat less.  Cut down or cut out the snacks and second helpings,  lose the junk food when you're bored.    Food is fuel, fat is stored fuel.   You lose weight by eating less than you need to power daily activities.  Your body turns to stored fat to make up the difference.  Exercise can help the process by increasing your fuel requirements. There are no magic numbers for calories or exercise.  How much exercise CAN you do?  An hour a day? Two? Eat less than you do now, exercise more than you do now.   If nothing happens after a couple of weeks, eat a little less and exercise a little more.     Rearranging your life to eat odd foods for some period of time doesn't make a lot of sense, because you can't maintain it.    All of the fad diets, paid programs, whatever work for one and the same reason - they result in you eating less than you did before.   60 pounds in 5 months is probably a bit on the optimistic side.   1-2 pounds per week is more realistic.

As for choosing WR or OL, those are two VERY different positions requiring different size, different training, and different skill sets.

However in the 2010 season that will all change unless an agreement is reached. Jerry Jones has been locking players up through 2010 with hopes of probably going on one of the biggest spending sprees in football history next year.

	72823 : ["I agree with Luke, the Cowboys are more like the Yankees. But there again, Jerry Jones is one leisure suit away from being Al Davis's twin brother. You can't build an NFL team the same way due to the salary cap. Therefore Jones and Davis think they can hit it big with one or two big stars and the rest of the team being barely fair. The NFL recipe that seems to win is more like New England or Pittsburgh. An excellent system that you can plug almost anyone into (like Matt Cassle) and win.
