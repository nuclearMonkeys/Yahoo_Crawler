Mechanics don't adjust ignition timing and fuel ratios because it's automatic now.   These days  a service involves changing the oil, changing some filters and some other parts that are inclined to wear out.  If you keep the oil changes up, that's the most important thing everything else isn't that important.  ", 10188, "84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa", 1],
