While the practice of buying 1-2 year old cars can offer significant cost savings over buying new cars, the flip side of that is that when selling off what is then a 4-5 year old car, one has in that period lost almost the greatest possible depreciation, so that the money you get for the 4-5 year old car will be a low one.  Thus, while your plan gets you cars for less than new cost, it also loses you a LOT of money when selling the cars off. And, those losses multiply with each such cycle.  The far better plan to save money is buy a 1-2 year old car, and drive it until it is at least ten years old. Most modern cars can provide good service through such a period without major repairs.", 6148, "BZnWmkofaa", 2],
