	15721 : ["I would much rather teach in person than online.  Students learn much better by not only interacting with the teacher but with their fellow classmates as well.  Sometimes a student needs the teacher to sit beside him/her to further explain the concept which doesn't happen over the internet. In addition with in-classroom teaching the teacher can readily gauge by the students' faces, questions, answers how well the lesson is going and if necessary restart the lesson using a different approach.   It has been my experience that if a student is having difficulties in framing a question or understanding the concept another classmate can readily understand the student and often provides a better explanation than the teacher.  Teaching is much more than presenting academics.  Classroom instruction also provides opportunities for students to develop the interpersonal skills they will need when they enter the \"real\" world.  Some of my neighbours are teachers all and all of them say that students do better with in-class learning than they do online.  If you think you are being a guinea pig then one of your options is to quit.  Another option is to get vaccinated.  Do keep in mind that if everyone follows the rules the pandemic will end sooner rather than later.   ", 2678, "6Whuc4WXaa", 0],

	15739 : ["The last separate Queen of England was Queen Anne in the early 18th century. She was also Queen of Scotland, but these were two separate titles. In 1707 she became Queen of Great Britain with the acts of union. Subsequently Kings and Queens (including Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth) have been monarchs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Queen Elizabeth II is Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. She is also Queen of  Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. As head of the Church of England she is bound by the rules of that church, including the church's rules on marriage. And these rules are derived from the words of Jesus in the New Testament. Jesus taught against divorce on a couple of occasions. For instance Matthew 5:32, \"But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.\" But Jesus also taught that death ends marriage. Even in the afterlife they are no longer married (though I expect they remain friends). Matthew 22:30, \"For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.\" So the monarch of England may not marry a divorcee during the lifetime of the former spouse, nor may they divorce and marry another spouse during the life of their former spouse. This rule is the only reason that Queen Elizabeth's father, George VI, became King. Her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated to marry a divorced lady. However (to answer your question) a widowed monarch can remarry, because death ends the marriage. Queen Elizabeth II can legally re-marry now that prince Philip is dead. But at her age it is unlikely. The last King to have married after being widowed was James II in the 17th century. His first wife died, and he re-married before his accession to the throne. Queen Anne and Queen Victoria were both widowed during their reigns, but neither re-married.", 2647, "sppePx0gaa", 0],

A good studio recording on VHS on a good black oxide tape lasts the longest. You can tell which ones are black oxide by looking at the tape, if its brown, its not. The brown, or red oxide tape only lasts about 15 to 20 years. The black oxide I think can go for about 35 years under the right conditions.

	15750 : ["Whom do I contact about Jews and freemasons (aka homosexual devilworshipping Jew-masons) killing 70 million in Soviet Union by gulags, famine, or shooting squads? How can Russian Orthodox get some justice?  Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Ioann Snychev was poisoned/murdered by Jew Putin (aka Shalomov) because he refused to work for Jews. KGB poisoned Putin; Putin died in 2007; now doubles (who wear latex masks) pretend to be Putin. Medvedev is David Aaronovich Mendel. Jews murdered Tsar Nicolas 2nd's family; Jews bled them for six hours according to ritual. Tsar Nicolas' family was sacrificed by Jews (they bled 6 hours); their remains were burnt; their blood drank; ashes from remains were sprinkled onto 50 hard-boiled eggs (dish called scido Amafreikis) [50 egg shells were found outside the place of ritual murder]. Also, decapitated Tsar's head (which was grey ... hair turned grey when he saw his kids being knifed).. Ritualistic murder... (blood libel is same thing as anti-Semitism ... a lie by Jews to flee justice). Jews came up that Tsar's family was shot. Tsar appeared to warn that whosoever worships false remains will become possessed by demons (this just happened like a decade ago ... maybe less)… Jews collect heads of leaders because they believe in reincarnation. How about Jews coming up with a mocking holiday April 1st because resurrection of Jesus happened on that day? Jews came up with mocking holidays 23 February (Day of Soviet Army) which was capitulation by cowards in Tsar's army… or March 8 (international Woman's day) which celebrates lesbian/prostitute Klara Tsetkin and Rosa Luxembourg. Three biggest saints in heaven (in this order): Theotokos Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and Tsar Nicolas 2nd Four biggest sinners in hell (in this order from the bottom of hell moving up to our level): Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin You could joke that Marx is a bigger sinner than Engels because Marx fooked Engels but how is Lenin a bigger sinner than Stalin when Lenin was fooked by Zinoviev (even by Bronstein once)? Lenin's brain was the size of walnut. He had syphilis. Was alcoholic. Born from incest degenerate family. Was in insane asylum. Wife Kruspkaya was probably lesbian 'cause what normal woman would stay with him? According to Russian Orthodox researcher Grigoriy Klimov, three stages of degeneracy are 1)sodomy (69, anal, oral, masturbation, pedophilia, incest, necrophilia, beastiality, orgies, hand job, bj, even all non-missionary positions between husband and wife, etc.) 2)insane asylum 3)physical deformities in kids (eyes looking at different angles, wolf jaw, rabbit lip, horse foot, different length limbs, etc.) all these accompanied by drug/alcohol abuse; 4 percent of total population is gay; 9 percent of prison population is gay; prisons don't make you gay; gays go to prison because they're more violent Jews have like six times more degenerates than other nations because they don't have monkhood. Jewish degenerates become politicians (or similar high rank in society). In Germany during Hitler time, it was eight times. Hitler, Stalin (aka Jugashvilli which means son of Jew), Roosevelt, Churchill were all Jewish degenerates. Hitler had many Jewish coworkers as homosexual partners. Stalin was expelled from seminary for sodomy. A few centuries ago, angel appeared to Orthodox Christian community and said not to buy from Jews at bazaar because it's sprinkled with blood (something like that) Those were facts… and now for some Conspiracy Theory: Elimination of comments on Yahoo Answers means that Project Pogo is completed.
