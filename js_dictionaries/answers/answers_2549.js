	133284 : ["As Miss USA she will face a lot of interviews and part of the art of interviewing is to answer incendiary questions in a non incendiary manner.  She clearly failed that test.

I completely disagree with her opinion, but lets face it, the woman was screwed no matter how she answered. If she had said she was cool with gay marriage, she would have been eaten alive by the above talk show hosts and more. And she would have been praised by others, and we would see some Christians and fundies on here saying how dumb, or hypocritical she is, for being Christian and \"not following God's word\". That said I don't feel super sorry for her either. If you are a celebrity of any kind, and you make a strong opinion like that known, you have to be prepared to take the heat. But part of me thinks she sort of got caught between a rock and a hard spot. Had she not been asked the question in the pageant, she may have never made her opinion known.

But I pulled myself up out of that without help. A lot of the stories I heard were not what you would actually think of a homeless person. So, I learned very quickly not to judge anyone.

	133297 : ["Yes. They should have done it sooner. Was it allright to try to destroy Israel? Israel tried in every way possible to live peacefully with its neighbors. They are surrounded on all sides with countries that harbor terrorists. From the day Israel was established, the attacks began. The Israelis even bulldozed their own settlements and gave the land to the Arabs, but nothing short of the annihilation of Israel would satisfy them. The suicide bombers got on Israeli school buses and went into the market places. Missiles were aimed at resorts and cities and hundreds more were poised on the border. Israel even built a wall but it didn't keep the terrorists out. When 2 soldiers were kidnapped, Israel had enough. The did what the US should be doing; they went after the terrorist's headquarters and training grounds. These are the same terrorists that attacked us on 9/11 and have attacked Britain, India and other countries. Israel is the only ally of the US in the Middle East and the only democracy in the region.

	133310 : ["MBC,  there will always be collateral damage.  No matter what, you will blame Israel for something that is the pals own fault.  I repeat the PALESTINIANS own fault. There is no way you can condemn Israel for what it has done, unless you seriously think daily kassams are no big deal. I would love to see your expression if Mexico ever decided to lobby rockets into your suburban neighborhood. The fact that you are here 'trying to understand Israelis' is a perpetual puzzle to me.  Does this imply that you 'understand' HAMAS?  Do you understand the pals who support HAMAS?   Maybe you should be explaining that to us instead of asking us to rehash over and over what should be common sense to you. (Anita P---What color is the sky where you live? How many moons?  This is Earth, welcome.) Thanks---my 'heart' isn't converted, for your information, but I understand the (prejudiced) confusion.  The only 'darkness' is the self-righteous hypocrisy in your post.  You don't live in Israel or in Palestine so I can imagine the real angst you are going through.  I am very sure that you are NOT, as you are reading this, sitting next to a Palestinian having tea in the old city disagreeing about who is better, Obama or McCain, so these issues are surely relevant to your everyday friggin' life. In the real world, all of that dribble you spout will get you slapped back to the Carter administration.     There is nothing but stubborn pride that keeps Kassams coming over haphazardly.  It is not effective except for drawing exponential punishment.  If you want to call self-defense murder then your family also raised a fool.  Stop the d*mn rockets and get a leader that can negotiate (my answer). MBC - I asked my palestinian friend this question and I am quoting: Jim-Khayo says it is not justified (to destroy a neighborhood).  His opinion is \"any military action (against Israel) is not justified and any military retaliation is not justified.  The solution is free and clear negotiation on matters that concern both sides, without having biased negotiators\".  He says that you need a negotiator who cares about the welfare of both sides.  Addendum: he also says that he does not feel Hamas will last long (we greatly disagree on this but I hope he is right and real leadership replaces it).", 11173, "None", -3],
	133311 : ["It is not secret that the Palestinian militants have been and still are using innocent civilians (including children) as human shields. They bring them onto battlefields and everyone is surprised that a child has been killed in battle, when they should not have been in the vicinity in the first place. This is unfortunately no different. The militants have been using neighbourhoods to fire rockets from and hide them. Israel always gives fair warning about buildings ans neighbourhoods being demolished, to lessen the loss of life - which I'm afraid the militants are not curteous enough to give when they bombard Israel with rockets every day.", 11173, "GFAj4oILaa", -1],
	133312 : ["I would never say never but the threshold in my opinion is certainly high. The United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan that killed tens of thousands of people though most historians justify the action by pointing to evidence saying that if that did not happen the war would have dragged on and far many more on both sides would have died. In the case of Israel if destroying a neighborhood would result in a significant reduction of hostilities then over the long term it might be justified.
