	27351 : ["In general, yes, if you take precautions. You would have to watch out for hazards, such as broken glass or sharp metal. You also have to train gradually. Start by walking on asphalt. Do a little at first, and gradually increase the amount. This is to toughen up the skin on your feet. You also need to gradually train your bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. You can start with some running on grass. (But, grass can conceal sharp objects.)   When your feet are toughened up, start training on your regular surfaces. Again,  start with a little and gradually increase the distance. If you are currently a runner, do your regular workouts in shoes. When making the transition, take off your shoes near the end of a workout and finish barefoot. Gradually lengthen the barefoot distance and shorten the shoe-wearing distance. I'm assuming you have no biomechanical or other issues that will increase risk of barefoot running.  If, for example, you should run with an orthosis (orthotic), running barefoot might not be safe, since shoes are needed to hold the orthosis in place.  An alternative is minimalist shoe running. Minimalist shoes are very light weight. Running in them is close to barefoot running, but they offer a little more protection. And, they might be able to hold orthoses. If you do use an orthosis, you might need a different one when using minimalist shoes. Comment: Abebe Bikila won the 1960 Olympic Marathon running barefoot. Comment: I tried making the transition from running in shoes to barefoot a few years ago. But, there was some sort of weakness and I was unable to train my left foot to not crash the heel onto the running surface. Comment: There was a surge in barefoot running popularity about 15 years ago. Barefoot runners do run on the street. I talked to a barefoot runner when we were near mile 20 in a marathon. The course was mostly asphalt. ", 4283, "k7hBT7MGaa", 2],

	27353 : ["The 10,000 meter run is about 6.2 miles. A race of this distance is often referred to as a \"10K\". Common longer distances include 20K, half-marathon, and marathon.  The 20K is, as you expect, is 20,000 meters. The full marathon is about 42.2 killometers, or about 26.2 miles. The half marathon is about 21.1 kilometers, or about 13.1 miles. There are distances longer than the marathon, and are called ultramarathons. There are hundred kilometers, hundred miles, and other distances. Some ultradistance runs are measured by time. The winners are those who go the longest distance. For example, there might be a 24 hour run. Running organizations may keep records of races at standard distances, but they are not inclined to keep records for odd distances. Whatever distance the longest race humans have run is, there is no prohibition against trying to run one longer.  If you want to try to run longer, I suggest you consult Guinness Word Records to find what the record is for the longest known distance run without significant breaks. Comment: World Athletics keeps records for standard distances up to the marathon. Ultrarunning organizations may keep records for selected ultramarathon distances. Comment: I said \"without significant breaks\" because in road races, it's typical to offer stations with water and sports drink. Although efforts are made to allow runners to receive the refreshment while running, many runners slow down at aid stations. Some may even pause, confident they can make up for it. Longer races may offer porta-potties on the course. Of course, in a race, as long as a runner stays on the course and follows the other rules, how the runner uses his/her time is up to the runner.", 4281, "k7hBT7MGaa", 2],

	27367 : ["There is a whole field and theory about this, but you don't need to know about it to improve your form. All you need is running drills and to keep running.  The best drill for form is high knees. And counting your cadence occasionally can be useful (steps per minute). Just like cycling, you don't want your turnover to be too sluggish. You should be getting your feet off the ground as quickly as possible. Not all running drills improve form, and are just for mobility (like kick butt).  There are a lot of people that told me when I was younger that I should be running on my toes, but I only knew one person that actually did that (and he was called “twinkle toes”). Frankly, I did not even understand this concept until I had a back injury and did some physical therapy. They showed me the “wall lean”, and after doing this exercise for awhile, I immediately understood what was meant by toe running.  It is not that you are literally never contacting your heel with the ground, but that your weight is unevenly distributed toward the front of your feet, like you are leaning forward. It really does make you go faster, but it takes some practice.  Here's how to get the feel for it by doing “wall lean”: Stand facing a wall so you can't quite touch it with your hands forward. Lean into the wall and place your hands to it, bending only at the ankles. Make your spine very erect, lifting from your head by engaging your abs. You can lift your heels if it helps, but try pressing your toes downward, from the hips or abs, without flexing the calves. Once you get where the fexion is coming from, you get it. But if you don't, try leaning forward without a wall, without falling. Observe what muscles you use. While leaning into the wall, hold the flexion for 20s for a few reps. When you run and utilize this method, it will feel like you are falling forward, and your feet will have to move quicker, to keep up.  Good luck. Hope this helps!", 4285, "mLrcQx2xaa", 0],

If a runner burns K calories / mile at one pace, the runner will burn close to K calories / mile at another pace.   However, walking is more efficient than running. So, walking a distance will burn fewer calories than running the same distance. If they do not weigh the same, the difference in caloric consumption will be in proportion to their difference in mass.
