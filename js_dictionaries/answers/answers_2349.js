Tell your parents (preferably your mother), if you can't ask a friend or a friend's mother.  Keep track of what week you get it and prepare for it.  I really don't like using medication unless nessesary, but you could use Midol.  For cramps try soaking your feet in warm/hot water (it works).   2.) I have been tring to figure that out for 6 years, lol. Seriously, you can't.  And if you do try to you will just end up hating men because they don't have to go through it. 3.) I think so, especially in the first few times it's wacky.  Normally you get your period its heavy for three days ish and then it tapers off and ends in 4-6 days (no longer than 7-9 days). Oh and one more thing it differently gets easier, so don't give up hope.", 10740, "Sg4OfAiVaa", 1],

	123264 : ["The Bush Doctrine is about letting everyone in the world be free, not about ruling the world.  Everybody should be free to determine how they live, not be dictated to by religious fanatics wishing to completely curtail freedom.  Your analogy about the Germans under Hitler is the exact opposite of how the situation really was.  The Germans did not stand up to Hitler because they lacked the backbone to do so.  Their claim that \"we didn't know what was going on\" is just their way of drawing attention away from the fact that they didn't resist.  Those few who wished to resist did not have the means, since they had allowed themselves to be disarmed by the government.  The whole point behind our 2nd Amendment to the Constitution is to allow citizens the means to keep a Hitler from taking over their country and to protect themselves from criminals when the police are unable to do so.  A few courageous souls actively tried to resist Hitler and were executed for it.   Perhaps your Political Science teacher needs a history course.", 10745, "None", 1],
	123265 : ["This isn't new.  This isn't a Bush Doctrine.  This is a Skulls and Bones doctrine.  Bush, like many CEO's or religious leaders, is a member.  The group made it clear back in the 1800's that they were the educated elite and would be running things, that this special club would seize control of Government, Religion, and Media.  This three pronged approach would assure their rule.  Do we forget the heritage of Bush?  Do we forget that his grandpa, a member of the US Congress at the time, financed Hitler (i.e. the family was bankers before oil).", 10745, "yO5tm6e1aa", 1],

I could never be happy as a republican so why do you care that most of the country disagrees with you & thinks you are foolish. So you were self-centered & created a life you love to live. We can all do that but most of us are more generous. Just because someone chooses to take a low paying government job as a teacher or a social worker you think you should show statistics that are based on what people say & as you & I know Republicans are usually lying. The also claim to give more to charity on their taxes yet they don't want poor people to have their money they want them to get out & get a job. LOGIC tells us they are writing off donations & dems are not. So quit your BS. You have not convinced me your happy. You have convinced me that you believe in a party that is extremley insecure needing guns & war & not understanding others or loving thy nieghbor as thyself. You have convinced me you are in a party filled with hateful competitive people who base their life on what others are doing & always needing to measure higher than others in some way. I have no respect for you asking a question that is meant as a way to put others down cause you are so weak you need to feel up this way.

Give it a couple of months and if they're still heavy, go and see your doctor just to make sure everything is fine.

The citizens, weary and emotionally bereft, seized on the leadership of Hitler (say what you will, the man was a dynamic speaker). Add in some class hatred and germany did what it did. Bush has neither the brains nor the rhetorical skills to make this New World Order succeed and those manipulating him are too choked with their own greed to m=have it succeed.
