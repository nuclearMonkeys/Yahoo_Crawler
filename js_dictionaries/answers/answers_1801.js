Really liked this. Great message. Really powerful scenes from David Tennant.  2. Confirmation at last the Doctor really did have a family once. He was a Father so he must have had a child, [a wife? or at least a sexual partner] and his granddaughter from Old Doctor Who really was his granddaughter. A Time Lord and a blood relation.  3. Jenny didn't die. So she must be in the finale. I'm 100% on that. How she finds the Doctor i don't know. How she lived without regenerating i don't know. I suppose the fact she has two hearts and there was one bullet might be it. Maybe just her heart regenerated and that's why just a bit of light came out of her mouth.  4. Really liked Jenny. Didn't think i would but she actually reminded me a bit of Rose.  5. Really liking Donna. Her character is shaping up really well.  I think whatever happens to her in the finale will be weepy. She signed her own death warrent today when she said she would stay with the Doctor forever.  Anyway altogether great episode.", 9566, "ACLIVzy7aa", 0],

San Diego will have defenses stacked up against LT and he just simply will not put up the numbers he did last year. As well, you are giving to much up at WR to make this a good trade. I'll admit this is not a bad trade and while tempting, does not appear to be worth your while. Of course, depending on how many you sit each week. Well, listen to what everyone else says - but my vote is stay put. Of course, you may regret it later - but that happens. Good luck.

	95824 : ["Have I missed something - how do people know she'll be back in the season finale? I thought the basic storyline of people who have been fighting each other for generations that turn out to have only been 7 days was quite good. Liked the Hath and thought they did quite well for a dialogue-free race. The whole business of the Doctor's Daughter was...(shrugs) OK, but not great. Good excuse for some great Child Support Agency gags, and for a peak into the Doctor's past history and family.

	95825 : ["I thoroughly enjoyed it actually, which is really not the reaction I predicted from myself before watching it.  It took me a while to begin to enjoy it, I wasn't convinced by the beginning, it seemed to move too fast. From where Martha helped the Hath however it really drew me in.  What I liked most about this episode was the very different angle of the story to past ones brought out a very different side to each character. We see Martha sobbing her heart out for the poor Hath, Donna really in her element solving a lot of the mystery with her paper and pen and of course the Doctor. For the first time in the new series (1,2,3 and 4) we really see the Doctor's paternal side shine through aswell as the \"fire and ice and rage\" he is so famous for being.  I actually cried when the Doctor held the gun to the Captain's head. Never would you have thought that even over the \"generated anomaly\" that was his dead daughter that the Doctor would have done such a thing. It really gave the Doctor another side which was spectacular.  I did expect Jenny to regenerate, but was slightly surprised when she just woke up. Is that possible for a Time Lord? I'm not sure she will be in the final three episodes, but I am sure she will make another appearance. That episode opened up so many oppurtunities the DW team would be silly not to take them. The Hath - I know Martha (I think) said they were part fish, part human, but they looked more like Brachiosauruses to me. (Sorry about the spelling) I really liked them, but they didn't seem to have quite enough personality to be memorable, unlike the gorgeous Ood.  I especially liked the twist aswell, with the war only having gone on for seven days. It was a real eye opener really as I'm guessing most of the audience thought, as I did, the war had gone on for years and years. It was really quite clever.  Overall, I really enjoyed it, but felt that Jenny could have been given a bit more personality. She really didn't stand out in my eyes. This is one episode I can't wait to see again, just to experience David Tennant's stunning performance.", 9566, "gD2SgMRRaa", 0],
	95826 : ["The idea actually has merit, but thinking you can just ride LeBron is not smart. The Spurs are proving that having a great game out of LeBron is not enough, depth makes a difference. Also look at the age of the Miami team, people for years have kept saying that the Spurs were to old. But what they did was surround their older stars with younger players, while Miami has to play with old support players because their stars are paid so much. Miami actually has a higher average team age than the Spurs. The Heat have placed so much value on three highly payed players that the have forgotten the value of the surrounding talent. Most of the Heats wins come at the expense of riding LeBron, and against teams that lack the talent or versatility to deal with his surrounding players. However against a team as deep and as versatile as the Spurs their flaws are clearly exposed. The older players can't cover the Spurs young guns, and LeBron as good as he is, is just one man. He can't cover Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker at the same time. Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis can't cover Manu Ginobili and Boris Diaw effectively either. The biggest flaw comes with the bigs. Expecting Bosh or Anderson to cover Duncan is just to much to ask on a consistent basis. That is also one of the problems that is beyond logic. Why have a big man on your roster who's paid like a superstar and he doesn't play like one? Bosh is incapable of playing head to head against the star bigs in th  league. Players like Duncan, Hibbert, Howard, and Noah just to name a few, are more than a match for him. If he tries to defend them he winds up in foul trouble. As a third option stretch 4/5 he shouldn't be getting paid like a star center. His salary hampers the team from bringing in a big who can do what they really need, (control the interior and rebound). They also need to bring in a true point guard. As they are currently structured Chalmers and Cole are really just extra shooters who can spot up and shoot. Miami needs a true floor General who can break down defense, distribute the ball, and control tempo. But even more important is they need a man who can defend elite guards in the league. It's actually a liability that LeBron is covering Tony Parker, because then it leaves the team without a true matchup for Leonard. Until Miami addresses these gaping holes in their game they best pray that Duncan retires, because otherwise they will most likely be competing against the Spurs again. Luck and circumstances got then past San Antonio once, but as your seeing right now luck and circumstances isn't enough anymore.", 9567, "keUqPWVuaa", 2],
