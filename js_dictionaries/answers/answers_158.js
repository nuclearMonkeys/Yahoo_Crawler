	7922 : ["Because Liberals are RICH people who try to convince POOR people that they actually give a **** about them. Notice how they complain about increased taxes on the upper middle class, how they discount EXPENSIVE purchases (Teslas) instead of using that money to help people who cannot feed their families. You cannot do both, doing both INHERENTLY is taking money that SHOULD go to helping the poor and giving rewards and incentives to people who are filthy rich. Notice they do nothing to shut down Amazon but cheer as Retail stores (poor people jobs) get shut down. They're the HATERS of the poor. They refuse to pay more money to help the poor and just pass the buck up the chain saying \"The problem isn't the bourgeoisie, it's the proletariat's for not being educated enough... we won't give them free college though (Bernie would but Liberals are rich people not poor, and they HATE Bernie) Even look at how they think all the money that would normally go into welfare should be given universally to RICH PEOPLE and the poor people only get pennies.

	7936 : ["Rolex is greatly-overrated. There are lots of brands that are a lot costlier and better-made. Rolex has 2000 workers who produce 1,000,000 watches each year. That means a worker has only 4 hours to spend on an average watch. Patek Philippe also has 2000 workers but produces 45,000 watches per year, so it can spend 88.8 hours on an average watch. That makes Patek Much costlier and better-made than Rolex. Look at my answer to audrey. Patek's cheapest men's watch is $30,619, while Rolex's cheapest one is $6200. Patek's cheapest is 4.9 as costly as Rolex's cheapest. Richard Mille's cheapest watch costs $132,000, and that is 2.11 times as costly as Rolex's costliest watch. Rolex spends nearly twice as much money on ads as any other brand, and that is why it's overrated so much.", 1285, "tuULGJS6aa", 1],
	7937 : ["You contact the subscription number inside the magazine and let them know.  You know those self-addressed, pre-paid postage subscription cards that are always in magazines that end up falling out onto the floor when you flip through it where all you have to do is fill it out and drop it in a mailbox, not even needing a stamp?  Well, there's a pretty common prank people pull on other people, either trying to be funny or trying to be mean, where they fill those cards out with the name and address of someone they know.  When they're at the salon, they'll fill out five of them.  When they're at the doctor's office, they'll fill out five or six more.  When their own magazines come in the mail, they'll fill the ones in those out, too.  Pretty much whenever they find one of those cards, they fill it out with that person's name and address.  Soon, that person is getting buried in magazines and in unpaid bills from magazine companies.  There's nothing you can do but call the subscription number in each magazine and tell them that it wasn't you who subscribed.  That'll usually work to get the bills canceled so that they don't go to collection, but for whatever reason, it seldom works to stop the magazines from coming, like magazine companies' billing departments don't talk to their distribution departments, so don't be surprised when all those magazines keep coming.", 1271, "NAeE0TtAaa", -1],
