	43155 : ["Hello Keegan, In the Asker's question-details he wrote: \"[...] why are the people of Israel opposed to political correctness and being civilized by rejecting racism?\" While some individuals in any country may unfortunately be racist, there is no evidence of any general racism in, or by, Israel, and also the reader will have noticed that those who make that false-allegation typically-provide for their falsehood:  > No detail,  > no objective-sources;  > Zero evidence. Remember, to qualify to be murdered by a “Palestinian” Arab you must be Jewish and there is no lower age restriction. A reward-pension is then paid to the family of the terrorist out of “The Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund” (see below); (the P.A. in turn funded by the “European Union”). - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “23 August 2019 ... Israeli girl ... Rina Shnerb [age 17 was killed; she] had been hiking with her brother Dvir and her father Eitan near a natural spring outside Dolev when an improvised explosive device blew up.”  Extract source: - - - - End of extract - - - - Thus racism there is, but not of Israel but of the “Palestinian” Arabs. Accusing Israel of racism is therefore reverse-fact, describing rather Palestinian policy. Pro-Palestinian contributors similarly often falsely-accuse Israel of “Apartheid” also with zero evidence. In reality there is no evidence of any “Apartheid” in, or by, Israel, whereas the Palestinians have expelled any Jewish population from all areas under Palestinian control and then falsely-claimed “Apartheid” against Israel ! The Palestinians put to death any Jew that they find near there: Palestinian false-complaints about: “oppression” / “(mis) treatment” / “discrimination” / “racism” / “persecution” / “being treated as 2nd class”: Is Palestinian frustration at Israeli security measures getting in the way of the on-going Palestinian war of ethnic-hatred, targeting Israeli Jewish civilians including children. While there is no evidence that Israel targets civilians, the Palestinians are by their very policies anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish), being taught hatred against Jews by their education system, and seek to take ALL the land of Israel and expel or murder the Jews. No wonder anti-Semites display such emotional-support for the “Palestinian” Arabs ! Once the “Palestinian” Arabs had tricked Israel into giving them autonomy of part of the West Bank and the whole of Gaza under the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians since:  > Do not sincerely negotiate any peace treaty.  > Make an unverifiable false-claim to ALL the land of Israel.  > Want to expel the Jews from the Jews ancestral-homeland of Israel.  > Have expelled any Jewish population from all areas under Palestinian control and then falsely-claimed “Apartheid” against Israel !  > Consider themselves at war with Israel.  > Attack Israeli Jewish civilians as policy including children (see below). Due to anti-Semitism many people do not require any proper moral standard from the “Palestinian” Arabs. The Palestinians cynically whitewash their anti-Jewish hate-war as: “uprising”, “defence”, “desperation”, “struggle”, “resistance: The “Palestinian” Arabs are addicted to ethnic-hatred against Jews, so if Palestinians injure or kill an Israeli Jew including children, and the Palestinian terrorist is imprisoned as a result, the “Palestinian Authority” aka Fatah (the P.A. is funded by the “European Union”) and the “Palestinian Liberation Organisation” pay a reward-“pension” to the family of the attacker: - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “The Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund is a fund operated by the Palestinian Authority for the purpose of paying a monthly cash stipend to the families of Palestinians killed, injured or imprisoned for involvement in attacking, assisting in attacking, or planning to attack Israel [...]” - - - - End of extract - - - - - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “In the Amended Palestinian Prisoners Law 19 of 2013, the payments were actually enhanced for a terrorist who commits a violent act and is jailed.” - - - - End of extract - - - - The “Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund” and “Hamas”, both brought to you by “European Union” funding of the “Palestinian Authority” aka Fatah: Many who demonstrate in European countries against anti-Semitic damage to Jewish tomb stones, have no problem with their governments continuing to fund the Palestinians, thereby also funding the Palestinian ongoing war of ethnic-murder against Israeli Jewish civilians including children. The Palestinians celebrate attack on Israeli Jewish civilians: Here follows some of that inconvenient-information that pro-Palestinian contributors chose to filter-out from their answers when they falsely-complain about Israeli security measures on the West Bank, as: “oppression” / “(mis) treatment” / “discrimination” / “racism” / “being treated as 2nd class”: The following examples explain just why Israel has been forced by Palestinian racist terrorism, to have reasonable security measures on the West Bank: - - - - Start of examples of Palestinian Racist Terrorism on the West Bank: - - - - March 16, 2018, West Bank: A Palestinian rammed his car into four Israeli soldiers standing outside of the Mevo Dotan settlement in the West Bank, killing two and injuring two. February 5, 2018, West Bank: Rabbi Itamar Ben-Gal was waiting for a bus outside the Ariel settlement. Abed al-Karim Adel Asi [...] ran towards Ben-Gal, and stabbed him in the chest with a knife [... who, shortly after ...] collapsed and succumbed to his wounds. January 10, 2018, West Bank: Rabbi Raziel Shevach was killed in a drive-by shooting near the West Bank city of Nalbus on January 10, 2017. The victim was driving when his vehicle was targetted by assailants in a passing car [...] September 26, 2017, West Bank: An Israeli border police officer and two Israeli security guards were killed in a shooting attack in the West Bank settlement of Har Adar [by ...] Palestinian Namir Mahmoud [...] July 21, 2017, West Bank: A 19-year old Palestinian assailant climbed a fence and infiltrated the Israeli settlement village of Halamish [...] and stabbed three of the family members to death, seriously injuring a fourth. April 6, 2017, West Bank: One Israeli soldier was killed and another seriously wounded in a car-ramming attack on a Route 60 bus stop outside the West Bank settlement of Ofra. - - - - End of examples of Palestinian Racist Terrorism on the West Bank - - - - Test yourself: Anti-Semites are: Willing to happily-accept what pro-Palestinians allege against the Jews / Israel, while being Unwilling to demand objective-verification. Palestinian joy at the murder of civilians, extends also to the United States of America - please see source for Palestinian reaction to 9/11: Image: “Palestinian protesters carry a transparent kite defaced with a swastika during clashes with Israeli forces across the [Gaza] border today [web page dated April 20, 2018] - [AFP/Getty Images].”: I hope this helps.

During his Presidency and especially compared to Biden, Trump's pro-Israel stance just comes off as more warm towards them and more beneficial overall. I'm sure many Israelis do like Trump on his own; but, with the context of him being good for Israel, Trump has not only been historically great but actually incredible. Should I point to the THREE nations in the Arab world who now established relations with Israel, with Trump's influence directing it? Israelis like peace btw, and these nations had *strong* stances against recognizing Israel prior to Trump. With Canada, Trump has been.... less beneficial. Trump has modified trade agreements closer to home which are intended to favor Americans more than Canadians, so there is less there in Canada to paint Trump as beneficial to them. Furthermore, the relationship between American mainstream media (which hates Trump) and Canadian MSM is stronger, so a lot of the derangement is broadcasted instead of saner and fairer messaging. Canadians also tend to be on average to the left of the average American, which politically puts them against Trump and many of the people who generally support him.", 6225, "hKgjv1Deaa", 0],
