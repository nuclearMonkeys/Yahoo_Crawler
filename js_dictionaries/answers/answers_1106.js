The vedic method is to receive knowledge from a qualified source. If a five year old child accepts that two plus two is four and simply repeats that knowledge anyone who receives that knowledge gets perfect knowledge. Modern science is quick to accept knowledge acquired through blunt sense perception(empiric knowledge). Because the senses are imperfect any knowledge derived from them is ultimately imperfect. The eye's can only see within a limited range of distance, color, and size. The rest of the senses are limited in a similar way. Knowledge of the unlimited cannot be perceived by the limited. Perfect knowledge must be received from the perfect source. Please read books written and translated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.

The Episcopals, Methodists, Catholics, and most of other Christians do not even like evangelicals! Evangelicals tend to be somewhat hateful people. But they're a few, a very vocal few. Some atheists here have become just like the fundamentalists. I won't mention their names but you probably know who they are. They think ALL atheists should believe one way, otherwise you're not an atheist. They ask questions that aren't enlightening or intelligent but are sophomoric. They act arrogant and pedantic towards christians. But they ignore atrocities committed by other religious people like in Islam. Their target at christians. I don't know why, maybe they had a very strict religious upbringing or had the misfortune of growing up in the bible belt.

Or would you venture to say, that they too are happy, if they only get enough of what they want? CALLICLES: Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of introducing such topics into the argument? SOCRATES: Well, my fine friend, but am I the introducer of these topics, or he who says without any qualification that all who feel pleasure in whatever manner are happy, and who admits of no distinction between good and bad pleasures? And I would still ask, whether you say that pleasure and good are the same, or whether there is some pleasure which is not a good? CALLICLES: Well, then, for the sake of consistency, I will say that they are the same. SOCRATES: You are breaking the original agreement, Callicles, and will no longer be a satisfactory companion in the search after truth, if you say what is contrary to your real opinion. CALLICLES: Why, that is what you are doing too, Socrates. SOCRATES: Then we are both doing wrong. Still, my dear friend, I would ask you to consider whether pleasure, from whatever source derived, is the good; for, if this be true, then the disagreeable consequences which have been darkly intimated must follow, and many others.  ============================== Family and Civilization Written by Carle C. Zimmerman \"Family and Civilization is the magnum opus of Carle Zimmerman, a distinguished sociologist who taught for many years at Harvard University. In this unjustly forgotten work Zimmerman demonstrates the close and causal connections between the rise and fall of different types of families and the rise and fall of civilizations, particularly ancient Greece and Rome, medieval and modern Europe, and the United States. Zimmerman traces the evolution of family structure from tribes and clans to extended and large nuclear families to the small nuclear families and broken families of today. And he shows the consequences of each structure for the bearing and rearing of children; for religion, law, and everyday life; and for the fate of civilization itself. Originally published in 1947, this compelling analysis predicted many of today's cultural and social controversies and trends, including youth violence and depression, abortion and homosexuality...\"", 8089, "None", 2],
	60827 : ["No need to be so tetchy! The single best non-religious reason against homosexuals 'marrying' is the fact that the human race would become extinct if a majority of people did this. This has got nothing to do with 'messed up stuff' in the Bible. Supposed flaws in the Bible do not constitute any reason for objecting to biblical statements against homosexual practise. Nor does the inconsistency of some individual Christians in trying to uphold God's laws. When we are judged by God, he won't ask us to account for other peoples' behaviour or attitudes. We will stand or fall purely on the basis of our own response to God and Christ. And mercy triumphs over judgement, as God has proved by providing the way for everybody to have all their sins forgiven - not just the sexual ones. Edit - No, I'm not supposing that everybody would marry their own gender if it was legal. I would just wave the warning flag that there's a tipping point beyond which continuation of the human species will become unviable. Consider how many baby girls are being aborted/murdered after birth by parents who want sons. Millions of them, every year. Then the grown up sons have a nightmare of a job getting a wife to have children by! If that became a serious enough situation world-wide, a whole raft of dreadful situations would result. Same with same-sex couplings. Get enough of them and eventually a huge imbalance would result. As it's predominantly wealthy countries that are fighting for this, you would discover a significant drop in their populations, with other countries procreating like mad, then mass immigration needed for the wealthy countries to find the work-force they need to maintain their wealth. There would also be serious health problems with myriad same-sex couplings. We've already got them, but they would become far worse if there was no restraint.
