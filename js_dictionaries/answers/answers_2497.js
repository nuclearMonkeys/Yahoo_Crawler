U should quit drugs and drinking and take care of your daughter and the baby to come. Its not about u anymore Its about those kids, because they shouldnt suffer because of the decisions you made so grow up and leave those boys alone because they dont want to be a father. Do it for your kids. Put ur self in this position. What if your mother was always drunk and did drugs while your aunt had to take time from her personal life. She didnt have that baby you did, so u need to take care of her. If you dont she is going to grow up drinking, pregnate, and doing drugs and she wont want to take care of her kids meaning you would have too.

We don't have that anymore, so the driving influence is gone.  When your government asserts its claim over your very life, that it may order you to DIE for no reason?  Yeah, liberty is gone.  We were in worse shape then than we are now, in many ways. Libertarians are probably the current distillation of their main objectives, and we are correctly categorized as 'classical liberals', which is NOT a modern 'progressive liberal'.

They were anti government in that they wanted the \"love revolution.\" \"Hell No, I won't go was the slogan of most Hippies.\"  Liberals don't serve in the nations armed forces.  Hippies had all kinds of ideas of what the government should do for people.  They hated big corporations.  They were evil...much like today.

I graduated high school second in my class with a 4.1 GPA when I was 17 and 4 months pregnant and Kennedy was born on November 4, 2005, when I was 17 1/2...  I started college in January 2006, a semester late, but I'm already through my third year and I'm graduating next June.  I am independent and extremely self sufficient. I work hard, on top of going to school, and my daughter has everything she needs and wants plus much more. Some (including me) would say that she is spoiled... My daughter and I live with my mom, sister and nieces, not because I can't afford a place of our own, but because I think it's great that my daughter is able to be with her cousins everyday... And I love being with my family! Neither my sister or I are living off our mother for free, we both pay rent, we split the bills and food costs... I'm not on any kind of government aid, not even financial aid for school... In fact, if you look at the statistics you will find that there the majority of mother's on welfare are in their 30's... I'm not a **** or a whore, I've only slept with one person, my daughter's father, who I was with for over a year before we decided to have sex... And we did use protection, I was on the pill and he always wore a condom, but one night it broke... I didn't think anything of it because I was on the BC, but then 6 weeks later the stick turned pink...  I wasn't planning on getting pregnant at 16, but it happened and I'm so glad it did... My daughter is my everything and I couldn't imagine life without my little angel!!! I know a lot of older mother's that are a lot worse parents than I am. I know that I'm a great mother and my family knows it and most importantly my daughter knows it! My little girl is happy, healthy and smart and I know I am doing everything right! It's not always easy being a teen parent, but at the same time it's not easy being a parent at all... Now, I don't reccomend it because it is an extremely hard job, but it is so worth it and most of the teen parents I know are wonderful parents... I don't think it's so much the age that matters, as much as the person's level of maturity. I know some 20 and 30 something moms that are still way to selfish and immature... So yeah, that's my opinion on teen pregnancy, it's hard and scary but it is also the best thing that ever happened to me.

She cited the war going on and how unfair the world seemed to her.  I couldn't help but think of how she sounded just like a Liberal of today. She was against a war so she thought killing someone one was a good idea. That made me think of Bill Ayers. He still hasn't apologized for causing someone to die. And all her talk of \"change\", which is again, a popular word.  Now I fear the days of Jimmy Carter will be coming back. If mortgage rates go anywhere back near 21% like it was then a new home will be out the window.  Liberals always seem to just want to focus on how bad things are in the United States.
