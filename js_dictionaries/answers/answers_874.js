	48500 : ["Woodworking takes tools and space.  I starting wood burning.  My husband cut down a trumpet vines and made a couple of walking sticks. Now that they are sanded and the ends are done I am putting designs on them. Knitting is a great hobby. Limited tools and space are needed. Many good books and YouTube to help you learn.  ", 6845, "0WASp0bHaa", 0],
	48501 : ["Woodworking takes space and some tools. While you can do almost anything with hand tools, the process is sometimes arduous unless you have power tools. It's also a great skill to have, as your first answer shows: you can make things you can actually use, sized exactly right. My husband does woodworking, self-taught, and we have shelves and cabinets all over that work for the spot exactly. I'm not a knitter--a few scarves is my lifetime output--but I sew and quilt, and find both useful. Even if your skills aren't advanced, you can make things you can use or give as gifts. A skirt or loose pair of pants with an elastic waist is something you can do over and over, every one different. Pillowcases and tote bags are easy gifts. (Sewing is fairly easy, making it fit close to the body fairly hard.) Quilting isn't just quilts but placemats, purses, table runners, and wall art. Other maybes: etch glass, work or sew with leather, tap or weld metal, do origami, bind books, reupholster furniture, carve wood, refinish curb-find furniture (my favorite, practically free), dip candles, make candy or paper, weave or dye cloth, beadwork, build radios, make wooden boxes, stencil borders on walls, “paint” with moss, or any of a bazillion other crafts. I know a few people whose craft has turned into a business or a work of love, including a bookbinder who's rebinding sacred texts more than two hundred years old, in beautiful leather with gilt trims. Visit Etsy, where people sell what they build and craft, Pinterest where they save ideas for inspiration, and Instructibles or youtube for how-to on thousands of crafts.", 6845, "None", 2],
	48502 : ["Yes, there is a chance that a collection that was last worked on 45 years ago has some valuable coins. There is also a good chance that many are ordinary and don't have any value beyond the metallic content (ie silver or gold). Beyond identifying the scarcer date and mint mark combinations, condition is the #1 factor.  The best way to not get cheated is to know exactly what you have. That means taking on the role a collector does, educating yourself through studying books on the subjects of grading and identification.  Many people who inherit coins and other collector items have zero interest in doing this.  They either try to sell on their own or sell everything to a shop, and if they aren't cheated outright, they certainly do not get the value out of them that they could.  Doing it yourself will get the most value, but hiring a reputable coin auctioneer is a good alternative. You should at least make an attempt to catalog what you have, assemble a list to send to the various leaders in auctioning coins - houses such as Heritage and Stacks-Bowers...", 6840, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 2],

	48519 : ["Does she have access to YouTube? There are tons of crafting videos there. You could probably search for \"senior crafts\" or something like that and find other people her age who are making videos. I sometimes watch Depression Era cooking videos with older women showing how things were cooked back then. There's also Crafsman, he does a lot of really nice crafting videos and he's older, he has grown kids and talks about things back in the 1970s and 80s. Even if she can't do the crafts herself, she might enjoy watching other people make things. There are probably lots of gardening videos on there, too. Has she tried container gardening? Or cactus? Or terrariums? Something with plants but not as labor intensive. If your mom is a bit young at heart, she might like Shirley Curry, the \"Skyrim Grandma\" who is 80 years old and plays video games on YouTube. There's also Two Rocking Grannies, they are older women who listen to rock music and talk about it on YouTube. ", 6841, "22d95a7e1d8c8ef7b693d507be72a13baa", 1],
