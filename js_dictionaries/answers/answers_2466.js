	129132 : ["The mathematical evidence is almost zero, the statistical sample size for aliens being 1 in a population of unknown certainty. The philosophical argument is quite different, and uses intuition rather than logic to describe, either a universe teeming with life, or mankind as the sole intelligent species capable of such contemplation. I think it fair to say most people would opt for a universe with abundantly if rarely distributed alien life forms, because of the possibility of trillions of planets a certain percentage of which would be earth-like. As to whether aliens have visited the Earth, I think the majority of opinion would believe it unlikely. Fred Hoyle, the late great British astronomer was of the opinion that life in the form of bacteria may have visited Earth and bump started evolution here. He believed the universe could have evolved life and seeded vast populations of stars systems on an interstellar and intergalactic level. Are we really alone on such an insignificant looking planet among the countless stars in the countless galaxies in an unimaginably immense universe?

	129140 : ["Alright. This pretty much sums it up for why gay marriage is wrong. If this doesn't open some eyes, I don't know what will: 1. Homosexuals are seeking a SPECIAL right. They already have the same right to marry as the rest of us have---->the right to marry a person of the OPPOSITE sex. Limiting marriage to one man and one woman doesn't discriminate on the basis of sex or sexual orientation.  2. It denies the self-evident truth of nature that male and female bodies are designed for and complement each other. Opposite-sex marriage is the natural means by which the human race reproduces.  3. Granting same-sex couples a license to marry will not create true marriage. Neither two men nor two women can become one flesh. Licensing the unnatural does not make it natural. It would be a state-sanctioned counterfeit, a sham and a fraud. A licensed electrician cannot produce power by taping two same-sex plugs together. Homosexual sex is dangerous and destructive to the human body and powerless for human reproduction. 4. Homosexual marriage will always, you hear me, ALWAYS be an abomination to God regardless of whether a clergyman performs the ceremony. When God calls something unholy, man cannot make it holy or bless it. 5. Homosexual marriage is as wrong as giving a man a license to marry his mother or daughter or sister or a group.  6. Homosexual marriage will harm children by denying them the love and nurture of a mom AND a dad. The only \"procreation\" homosexuals can engage in requires that a third party must be brought into the relationship. 7. Granting a marriage license to homosexuals because they engage in sex is as illogical as granting a medical license to a barber because he wears a white coat, or a law license to a salesman because he carries a briefcase. Real doctors, lawyers and the public would suffer as a result of licensing the unqualified and granting them rights, benefits and responsibilities as if they were qualified.  8. Homosexual marriage will DEVALUE your marriage. A license to marry is a legal document by which government will treat same-sex marriage as if it were equal to the real thing. A license speaks for the government and will tell society that government says the marriages are equal. Any time a lesser thing is made equal to a greater, the greater is devalued. For example:  A. If the Smithsonian Museum displays a hunk of polished blue glass next to the Hope Diamond with a sign that says, \"These are of equal value,\" and treats them as if they were, the Hope Diamond is devalued in the public's eye. The government says it's just expensive blue glass. The history and mystery are lost too. Get it? B. If an employer uses a robot as an employee and treats the robot the same way it treats human employees, human employees are devalued. By doing so, the employer says, \"A robot can do your job, you're no better.\" What will you and the public think of your job and you?  C. If the government issues a license to babysitters that grants them the same rights, protections and responsibilities as a child's parents, parenthood is devalued. The government is basically saying that parents are just babysitters. D. If government grants professional licenses to just anybody, every profession and qualified professional is devalued. The government would be saying that an uneducated panhandler can do brain surgery.  9. The assumption by many is that marriage is just two people with a license who have sex and wear rings. Homosexuals do that, why not give them the license? Because engaging in sex doesn't equal marriage. Adults involved in incest have sex too; should government call it marriage and license them? Certainly NOT!  The biggest problem we have in getting people, especially younger ones, to understand why marriage is devalued by the existence of a counterfeit is that much of the public does not value marriage at all these days. Adultery is no big deal (sarcasm). Divorce is tolerated because so many married couples can't hold true to their vows. Absentee fathers and mothers devalue marriage. Unmarried pregnancies are common. Fornication is \"normal.\" When we make the case against homosexual marriage, we need to speak against these other problems that devalue marriage as well. As we acknowledge these problems we can emphasize that legalizing homosexual marriage will compound the problems, not solve or lessen them. So yeah, it IS my right and every other opponent of gay marriage's right to fight for the sanctity of what marriage truly is. Most homosexuals feign ignorance that God loves all. But it is clearly stated in the bible that God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.", 11007, "None", -3],
