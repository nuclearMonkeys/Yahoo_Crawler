	81507 : ["1.	Too many characters.  When more than just a few characters are introduced in the first few pages of a book, it's difficult to keep their names and roles straight.  2.	Can't get into the writing. If your prose doesn't appeal to your target audience, you might lose your readers. For example, those looking for fun and feisty chick-lit might be turned off by a heavy literary style. Write for your intended audience instead of trying to please everyone.  3.	Sterile characters. If your characters are flat, if there's nothing to set them and their struggles apart, we won't want to cheer for them, and might not care enough to keep reading.  4.	Unrealistic dialogue. Overuse of speech tags like “she hissed,” “he snapped,” “she stammered,” get irritating fast. Likewise, reading a character's name too often in dialogue can be a turn off. Avoid more than the occasional “um” or “well,” or “er,” and keep dialogue realistic, but more coherent.  5.	Inconsistency.  Your writing style, tone, character motivations, or even plot might begin one way and, unintentionally, change at some point in the book. Be especially aware of small details like names, occupations, physical descriptions of people or places, which can all fall prey to inconsistencies over the course of 300+ pages.  6.	Experimental style. When a writer experiments with style or structure, the result can be refreshing or irritating. Your ability to pull off something out-of-the-ordinary depends on your skill as a writer, and your ability to connect with readers despite your unusual style.  7.	Unclear character motivations. Have you ever read a book where a character does something, and you say, “Why on earth did she do that?? She would never do that!” Ensure your characters' actions are in line with their motivations, and if they don't appear to be on the surface, your reader must understand why not.  8.	Poor character description. Try to let the reader to imagine characters for themselves with a few minimal, relevant details. If you have an exact image in your head, space it out throughout the novel, don't throw it all in one go. Sometimes this works though, so be careful here. 9.	Info-dumping. Heaping a lot of  back-story on your reader all at once stops the flow of your story. Instead, try to subtly weave in necessary details throughout the book.  10.	Deus ex machina. Deus ex machina is a plot device which introduces a new character or thing out of nowhere, to solve an otherwise unsolvable problem. Your reader will know immediately if something doesn't ring true.  11.	Offensiveness. Any sort of gratuitous foul language, violence, or sex is going to alienate a portion of your readers right off the bat.  12.	Hackneyed plot. If your novel features an often-used storyline, be sure you present it in a fresh way. Readers are used to seeing similar plots, but unless there is something that makes yours stand out, they may not bother to continue reading.  13.	Unnecessarily long. If your story is well over generally accepted word counts for your genre, think very carefully about whether you're adding too many unnecessary scenes or details. Use fewer words; choose better ones.  14.	Ineffective structure. If all the good stuff happens at the beginning, or if nothing exciting happens until the end, your reader will be frustrated with the rest of the book. BQ: I was five when i began writing. I am now ten years older than that. My writing, grammar, vocabulary, context, plot. . . everything is a lot more sophiticated and generally better. BQ2: Yes. My plots are a lot more sensitive and my vocabulary impoves ten-fold. It's not that i don't know the words, i just don't use them in my day to day life. I am very secretive naturally and i think this is put into my writing, but i am very loud and random and crazy in person and this aspect isn't placed into my writing. BQ3: I'll go with Evra. She's enjoyed shining more than Rune (the major MC), and isn't going to give it up yet a) Yell out to the sea. Then find food. Then try to escape. . . build a boat maybe. Evra doesn't waste time b) Slam the door in his face c) \"HA. You think i believe that. Come near me and I'll kill you with the power you gave me.\" Slams down phone d) Pet? Evra has no pet e) Go grab Darien by the neck and yell at him. Kick him where it hurts. In Rune's case, she'd just glare.", 9063, "gzRX4e5caa", 2],
	81508 : ["• Don't spend time rereading what you've written. Just push ahead, and keep writing. It's tempting to want to reread, but it's time wasted that could be spent writing :D • Don't try to get it perfect (like you said). There will be revisions. The only editing you should be doing is the decision making of \"does this decision make sense?\" \"is this true to the character?\" \"is this the way I want my story to go?\" \"should this character be in this scene?\" Do NOT edit your sentence, trying to find the right words, or trying to make them flow perfectly. It's a waste of time, for the first draft, focusing on flow and precise word usage. First drafts are for telling the story; Second drafts are for telling the story well. • Write often. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and it requires a lot of pushing through. Some days writing is amazing, but most days it's just plopping your @ss down and doing it, without feeling very magical. • Focus on small goals. Don't see your work as a whole book. Take it chapter by chapter, scene by scene. It's like a road trip... enjoy the journey, and focus on the obstacles in road you can see ahead of you, not the miles and miles of road and potential obstacles that you can't see. • Write even if you don't feel like it. Your mood has nothing to do with your ability to write well. Feeling \"inspired\" simply means it's easier that day, not that you're producing anything more or less brilliant than you normally would on any other day. ------- BQ1: Look back at your very first stories, and now return to your newest ones.What has changed through all these years concerning your writing abilities ? Are your plots and characters more interesting, realistic and developed ? If not, what will you do to change this fact ? I have a lot of Mary Sues. I also have a lot of unnecessary description and melodramatic moments. My plots have always been fun and unique, but my ability to create characters and descriptions has developed a lot. BQ2: Do you act differently when you write ? Like, for example, you become more sensitive, preoccupied, conscious ? Do you think that writers' personality is split in half ? \"The real me\" and \"the other me\" ...? Nope. Writers are pretty normal, I think, even though some may think we are crazy for spending so much time passionately doing what we love. I think sometimes writers like to fake being strange or odd or quirky because it makes them FEEL more like a writer, but it really doesn't do anything. BQ3: Pick one of your Main Characters and describe in three words what would they do/feel or how would they react if : a) They awoke in the middle of a deserted, unknown island somewhere on Pacific Ocean ? He would think \"I guess I woke up with teleportation powers today!\" b) A stranger (male) would knock on their door after midnight, with a smile on his face and red roses on his hands? He would call for his mom or stepdad, probably. He's sort of a fraidy cat. c) The villain would call them on the phone, apologizing for everything he/she had ever done to them, and then asking for a place to go with them ? He would say no. He's only 10 years old and knows better than to go meet up with the villain, even if he's professed that he's changed. d) Their favorite/most lovable pet would pass away in front of their eyes ? :( He would be in anguish. It would be something that affected him for a long time, that's for sure! e) They had their birthday but no one remembered ? Oh he'd be pissed. He already feels like the left-out one in the family, and people forgetting his birthday would be the last straw. He might even run away to his friend's house for a couple of days.", 9063, "AA10015648", 3],

	81515 : ["Your brother may feel like he's doing fine financially now. However, he's leaving himself wide open if he becomes ill or has an accident.  Even if he's saving money towards future health care now, that can be wiped out in an instant. Once you're already sick and don't have insurance, you're deemed \"uninsurable.\"  It will be difficult to nearly impossible to find coverage to help with mounting medical bills. Is it possible that your brother will be perfectly healthy until he drops dead one day without needing medical intervention?  Sure...but somewhat unlikely.  And he's backing himself into a corner, with very limited options for the future, if his estimation is wrong and he *does* get sick. But, that's certainly his choice to make.  (Personally, if I were in that situation, I'd purchase my own HSA plan...save money towards future expenses tax free, yet still keep premiums to a bare minimum.  Also, you'd be keeping some sort of coverage, so that you aren't considered \"uninsurable\" if you happen to need it in the future.)", 9073, "457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa", 0],
	81516 : ["He doesn't need unsurance unless he gets sick or injured, but that is exactly what insurance is.  Protection in case something bad happens.  My daughter was in a quad accident last year.  She fell off and had an internal injury.  If I didn't have medical insurance, the hospital/doctor/surgical/etc bill would have exceeded $100,000. Your brother could also get ill, need a transplant, or any other thing that could get him in the hospital and he will wish he had insurance. If he is married and has kids, he is just being irresponsible, especially since he makes good money.  He can afford it and his company probably pays half or more as a benefit. Life insurance is also cheap and will allow the people he leaves behind to take care of his funeral expenses and settle any debts he has.   Again, if he is married with kids, the insurance would allow them to continue living as they are without having to make major changes.  How would he like his wife and kids to not only have to deal with losing their father, but also end up losing their home, cars, possessions etc. because their income is gone.  That's a lot to deal with. I hope this helps you put it into perspective for your brother.", 9073, "2c32cbb48cd4b929ea4b822f1b6f3baeaa", 1],
	81517 : ["I don't judge if other people do this. Health insurance is a serious matter, and all it takes is one minor illness to put a person deeply, deeply into debt from which you can't possibly recover. If you choose to file the paperwork before your wedding, that's your private decision. But I would advise you do two things: 1) Make sure your chosen officiant is okay with this, because on the actual day he/she will not technically be performing a wedding ceremony, and won't be signing the marriage license. 2) That you keep this to yourselves. Friends and family do not need to know your personal business, because it is none of theirs.", 9070, "None", 1],
	81518 : ["Wow, that's a big question--one that we had to answer about a year ago.  We wound up cobraing my insurance.  I had to move, so since I technically quit, we had to pay full price, but if he's being let go, he can only pay 1/3 or something for a while...i don't know the full rules. We discussed getting married and certaintly if need be we would have--we love eachother drastically.  To me a wedding is emotional, and true there's a legal aspect to it, but that's not why you throw the big party.  We would have gotten married on paper, but still carried on like engaged in every other way--ie no ring, no husband/wife calling, etc...  A piece of paper only changes a relationship if you let it.  Otherwise, it is what you define it to be.   I hope you wouldn't resent your hubby to be later--i am sure he's depressed and scared to death right now.  If you didn't have insurance, and you had a condition that needed treatment, youd be too.  Be careful not to make him feel like less of a man because he needs to rely on you to help him.   Just remember that if the two of you are engaged, you should both be able to talk about anything and decide on how to handle things together--be there for eachother and i am sure the right answer will come into fruition.

I mean let's face it - you don't sign the license the second you say \"I do\", no, you wait until after the ceremony and go into the officiant's office or at the back of the church or, I've also seen where the officiant had to bring the paperwork to the reception, because the couple took off for pictures too quickly. So technically, what you're suggesting is just increasing that length of time between when you say I do in the ceremony and the licesence is actually filed. If your officiant has no problem stretching that time frame out, then I don't think it's an issue at all, and certainly no one else's business.", 9070, "7yadbkmlaa", 0],

For example, if he needs to have an MRI done and can shell out the $250+ that might be needed to execute this action than he is good.....a majority of people don't have this luxury so insurance is made for them. Basically it makes money off of the fact that a lot of people that are paying for insurance won't use it that much, so they basically get paid for nothing, and your brother doesn't like the idea.

I know it won't be the wedding you have been dreaming of since you were 10, but adult life is full of unpredictable things like that. I am not saying you are immature as someone else did, just that life doesn't always go as planned and we have to learn to let go.

Wear a nice dress which isn't a wedding dress that costs thousands and needs all kind of fittings. Prom season has just ended, so you can get good deals, and some dresses are white and look very bridal. Get a real bouquet for yourself, and boutonnieres for your attendants. You can have a garter too, even if there won't be a toss, your husband will see it. Those details will help you feel like a bride.  When you go get your wedding license, ask if it's possible to have a family member do a few readings, and to bring a CD with at least a song to walk down the aisle. Some courthouses allow it, some don't. Ask a talented friend or relative to take pictures. Then all go for a nice restaurant meal, or cake & champagne in your parents' backyard.  That kind of wedding can take less than a week to plan, since you don't have to spend a year DIY-ing invites, centerpieces and pew bows, and booking venues and DJ.

Like why can't we learn about Europe!!! Religion: Okay this is complicated!!! My dad grew up Jewish and my mom converted ( catholic before)  before I was born... So I guess technically if someone likes labels I am a jew... But the thing is I don't like organized religion and rules and that we should be afraid of god... like we can't do this, that... and blah... ten commandments. I like   for the tradition of family coming together and buying presents is fun!! But I hate the whole original sin thing!!! How can anyone be born bad??? I have nothing against jesus!! I think he was a real good person but I think there were a lot of good people. I think you should just look at peoples intentions in most cases and try to focus on the NOW. So that is why I like practicing Buddism!!! Everyone thinks I am weird for it... But I like how they live in the \"now\" and be compassionate to others.", 9076, "zkOWYYdmaa", 0],
