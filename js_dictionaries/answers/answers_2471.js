He is so transparent. I resent him treating the American people like they are stupid. Take the SAVE act. It simply requires that The law be followed by ensuring that all workers are legal. Reid wants to add a rider to the bill granting 5 year Visas to 20 million illegals. Net effect of the Reid plan? it castrates the SAVE act because he in effect made everyone legal. How is that \"fair\" to taxpayers? Who is going to pay to issue Visas to 20 million illegals. Practical to implement? The Government can't even process the LEGAL applications they have now. How are they possibly going to process 20 million? If Reid's lips are moving he is lying. We have been promised enforcement before in exchange for amnesty. We know better now. Amnesty nullifies any attempt at enforcement. Once you make everyone legal, what law are you going to enforce?", 11028, "None", 0],

	129387 : ["No, I don't, because there is no good reason to believe and many good reasons not to believe it. Life forms bending space-time is only fictional. You should study the real science involved and not just read badly-written fantasy. Space-time is bent by large masses, so to do it significantly takes a star. A spaceship can't carry a few stars to bend space-time, because they have inertia, and it's impossible to accelerate them to any noticeable speed. Using wormholes to travel is like using hurricanes but much more difficult. Many people make many absurd claims, so that proves nothing. There's no real evidence that ETs have ever visited our world. What crashed at Roswell in 1947 was a Project Mogul balloon made in a top secret project of the American government to spy on Russia. There are no ETs in Area 51 that's a top secret area for American government projects.

Area 51 is a highly secretive Military installation that deals with research and development of classified airborne platforms such as the SR-71 Blackbird recon plane, and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth attacker. The wreckage of the Roswell incident was recently examined by a non-Governmental body for a documentary, and they confirmed the Air Force's official story: It was a high altitude balloon, used for surveillance on the Soviet's nuclear program. Because of the sensitive nature of the balloon's mission, the military reacted heavily.

	129394 : ["I have lived in Mexico, so let me clarify one thing. Whites and the government of Mexico are not to blame for Mexico being poor.  It's the average Mexican, who refuses to complete their schooling.  While some Mexicans are forced to drop out, the majority voluntarily leave school because they hate it.  I'm 24 but most of my Mexican friends my age didn't even complete the secundaria (equivalent to middle school here), not because they couldn't, but because \"me da flojera\"  which pretty much means they're too lazy to do it. In conclusion, white Mexicans and the government are not to blame for Mexico's failings.  It's the average Mexican's own fault for refusing to continue their education.  The Mexicans I know who did complete their education have high-paying jobs and little to no intention of coming to the United States.  In order for Mexico to advance, the people must overcome their hatred of education. Edit for seongjun: you're Korean aren't you?  I believe the average Mexican hates Asians more than they hate whites.  Go ask the average Mexican what they think of whites.  I did to several people, and they said that we're a little arrogant, but relatively harmless.  Then ask them what they think of Asians...you aren't gonna like the response. edit part 2: then seongjun, I have no idea what you're talking about when you say whites hate brown Mexicans, cause I didn't see any of that either in all the time I lived in Mexico. edit part 3: if ever there was a racist society in existence, it would be most Asians.  As a 외국인 Koreans tend to treat me like I'm a lesser human being.  I'm not racist towards Koreans, but any Korean who acts like that towards me is a definite 개새끼. part 4: well that was the past, get over it and stop holding grudges part 5: one other question: are you not living in a white-majority nation?  if you hate white people so much, why don't you leave?", 11036, "XQGp32noaa", -4],

Now since you brought up hypocrisy let's talk about O'Bama! O'Bama added $5 trillion to the debt in 3 years after he called Bush unpatriotic and irresponsible for adding $4 trillion in 8 years? Did you know that in the 2008 presidential campaign flip flop O'Bama was against gay marriage?! A year ago O'Bama said he could not unilaterally change immigration laws because the constitution doesn't give him that power and then last month he unilaterally changed immigration laws? In 2008 O'Bama said that Bush shouldn't hide behind executive privilege and that the american people deserved the truth and a transparent government and then last week he hid behind executive privledge? These are all recent flip flops which would seem to indicate that O'Bama is the worst in history! Edit.... That isn't what happened!

The Republicans have wanted mandated coverage since the 1990s.

As I have said countless times before there is a problem with racism. Why do Americans feel if they speak english and are white then they act (some) like they can control and state who should and shouldnt live within its borders. It is sad the constant barage of racism against the blacks the mexicans and even the asians. It is out of control. Americans resent the suggestion that they learn to speak spanish yet why not? The population is certainly there so why not benefit by learning a second language? As a Canadian I do not feel I \"own\" Canada, my neighbours are welcome and they could be from the middle east, they could be any nationality and any color and personally I welcome them. So I would say too many redneck attitudes. Also American glorifies money, hollywood stars make so much money one has to wonder how they can actually spend that much. They bring the stars up on pedestals and then the media brings them down to their knees at will.
