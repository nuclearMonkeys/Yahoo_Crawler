	61083 : ["I think a LOT of these guys need to think more carefully before they ask questions. Unfortunately, even more need to think carefully before answering. As has been said already, there's not much you can do if you are \"incapacitated\". JBulldog (or whatever his name is) is reading from the same dictionary I am, apparently. Once you are incapacitated, it's already too late, man! Now, there are martial artists out there teaching how to fight off attack if you are disabled. One socalled teacher out there has vids on YouTube, where he is defending himself with only one arm (because he apparently HAS only one. The techniques look really weird and off and ineffective most of the time, but he's out there. I think he claims to teach Kensei-ryu or Thunderbolt Kenpo or some other fake art).  Vladimir Vasiliev, the Systema guy up in Canada, has a couple of vids on fighting when you are injured or down or in water or in trapped in your car. Even then, however, you HAVE to be able to move to defend yourself, whereas your question pretty much indicates that you are no longer moving. One of my old instructors down in Louisiana was badly injured in a car accident when he was T-Boned and had a femur broken. He had to modify his Kajukenbo from that point on, first to teach from a wheel-chair and then from crutches and then from a cane and then from a permanently altered kicking ability. Even in his his case, however, he'd not have been able to fight off an attack right after that car accident, since his leg was broken and the muscle contracted the bone out through the skin... so he was completely passed out from what they call psychogenic shock from the pain (if not from the sudden loss of blood). You got me?  There are lots of other places to do your research for this kind of answers. Look on YouTube with some CAREFULLY selected words, and you'll find much better answers than you will here.", 8099, "None", -1],
	61084 : ["jwbulldogs gave you the only possible answer. Incapacitated means that you can't do anything. If that is so then no martial art of weapon will make any difference.

	61099 : ["Incapacitated?  As in unconscious or tied up?  Not much you can do in either case.  If you're all tied up in Hojo Jitsu (samurai art of binding) you're not getting out - period.", 8099, "None", -1],
	61100 : ["A wrong choice of word.  If 'incapacitated' then you are unable to move and so cannot defend.  I take it to mean that you are groggy; exhausted or wounded, but not unconscious. A) Under a 'sudden attack' on you, you will react as you have (at length) trained, tempered by your own natural reactions.  If you are in a bad state then the coming attack would not be a sudden one as you would have already have to have been attacked to have been damaged.  So, for a sudden attack (you yet to be hurt) your natural habitual reactions take over.  If his force collides with you then you will be damaged, so first you must avoid the attack by block and/ or body movement.  He must come towards your center to damage you: so don't be exactly there when he arrives.  It is Usually natural to fling your arms up to protect your head and face when startled, so for instance, whatever technique you use in that situation should be one you selected with a rising arms beginning.  As well I would recommend that, when startled you breathe out (so an impact on your chest won't incapacitate you) and drop your hips (bend knees), strengthening your balance and power base.  An Immediate crouching changes your profile froma higher one that the attacker planned to overcome, into another that he has to waste time adjusting to.  With no time to think, to escape or maybe even to block, you need to lash out (explode), striking the nearest target on him with your nearest weapon (fist, elbow, knee, etc, etc).  Of course in a surprise attack your attacker will be very close, if not on top of you.  If you have trained for reality attacks, and trained to stand in balance and move in balance, including keeping a sweeping awareness of your surroundings, then you won't be such a pushover.  You will need to learn methods of coping with FEAR (not taught often enough), as all attacks on the body are also attacks on the mind.  Often the mind is attacked first by yells of abuse, or other intimidation.  From your training you need to be definitely confident in your abilities; only use what you thoroughly know.  In close fighting grappling or locking techniques are handy. B) Now we come to the second issue, that of 'incapacitated' or an attack on you when you are nearly helpless (but not yet fully helpless).  Obviously in this state you cannot do much, so don't waste your limited energy in trying to do big movements, do little movements instead.  Try to control your breathing and stay loose and relaxed.  Whip your tired limbs out using sudden twists of your hips.  Keep twisting your body or turning the targeted area whenever a strike comes in or hits it, to minimise the damage.  When you can, you will have to arouse your animal instinct to hit fast and hard only to his vital targets such as eyes, throat, groin and knee, even feet.  If he strikes at you he has to expose a target. Know that you are training in Martial Arts in order to be prepared to meet the worst case scenarios, but skilled or not, try to stay out of possible dangerous situations and know your limitations.  Your school should include a Self Defence aspect, that is, teachings that are not under sporting rules, but are simple killing counter-strikes etc to meet deadly street attacks (not less dangerous scuffles).  Train with care for your partners safety. There is a lot to learn and a lot to practice, but life is worth fighting for, most all life forms fight or lash back when under sudden assault.  Living and training are hard; it is not-caring and dying that are easy.", 8099, "AA12388139", 0],

	61102 : ["Depending on how I was attacked (front, behind from the sides) and the size of my attacker (bigger or smaller) and if they had a weapon and what type, is how I would respond.

So he began questioning and wandering and ended up in Holland and stumbled on Amsterdam. city of Sin the position each now and then each little thing is going, so after puffing away contained in the coffeeshops for a lengthy time period he stumbled on the openly gay section in Amsterdam. He nonetheless would not understand what he's all about he informed me, yet he loved the life-style so he stayed. i must admit that his properly oiled eco-friendly scales regarded very fetching with the bottomless tight black leather-depending pants he became wearing.

	61113 : ["lily,  I have been playing Rock Band on Xbox 360 religiously ever since the game was released.  I started out playing Guitar Hero, but quickly began playing Rock Band in its place. The reason Rock Band is a good game is not only because it has increasing levels of difficulty which adequately trains you for the next level and increases your hand-eye coordination, but also because the game is excellent for parties or groups.  There is at least one instrument on the game that everybody can relate to.  The songs are excellent and the game allows you to download new songs from online, so that the game is virtually endless entertainment.  As instruments have worn down, the support team has been quick and efficient in sending replacements. Whatever the price is, it is well worth the money in the amount of time you will play and be deterred from other spending.  Just be sure you are getting the game with the instruments and all in one package because usually it costs $170, unless you already have instruments for it.
