	81271 : ["In otherwards When David displeased God by numbering Israel, 2 Samuel 24:1 says God moved him to do it, whereas 1 Chronicles 21:1 says Satan caused him to do it. Also, in 2 Samuel 24:9 the sum given is 800,000 Israelites and 500,000 Judeans, whereas 1 Chronicles 21:5 numbers Israel's fighting men at 1,100,000 and Judah's at 470,000.  How can these differences be harmonized? God is sometimes spoken of in Scripture as doing what he merely permits to be done by another. Thus in 2 Samuel 24:1 it states: “The anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.” But Jehovah was not the one that moved David to sin. It was Satan, as 1 Chronicles 21:1 states: “Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.” God was displeased with Israel and hence permitted Satan to bring this sin upon them, and for that reason 2 Samuel  reads as though God did it himself. Rotherham's translation shows it was by God's sufferance rather than his doing: “The anger of Yahweh kindled against Israel, so that he suffered David to be moved against them saying, Go count Israel and Judah.” The Septuagint in its English translation goes so far as to insert “Satan” in the place of the pronoun “he”. The marginal reading in the King James Version gives “Satan” instead of “he”. Regularly enlisted in the royal service were 288,000 troops, divided into 12 groups of 24,000 each. They served under a rotation system whereby each group of 24,000 served one month during the year. There were an additional 12,000 attendant on the twelve princes of the tribes, making a total of 300,000. Apparently the 1,100,000 of 1 Chronicles includes this 300,000 already enlisted, whereas 2 Samuel does not. (Num. 1:16; Deut. 1:15; 1 Chron. 27:1-22) As for Judah, 2 Samuel apparently counted in 30,000 who were in an army of observation stationed on the Philistine frontiers, and which were not included in the 1 Chronicles figure. (2 Sam. 6:1)  We note that in 2 Samuel the record does not say “all they of Israel were”, as it does in the more complete summation in 1 Chronicles, but just “there were in Israel”, not using the all-inclusive expression, since it did not include in its numbering the regularly enlisted forces. Again, in 1 Chronicles the account does not say “all they of Judah were”, as it did in the case of Israel, but only “and Judah was”, since it left out 30,000 and hence was not all-inclusive. So when the entire picture is brought under examination, when we remember that the accounts were written by different men, who had different views in mind, we can harmonize the two accounts without difficulty.", 9064, "AA11026013", 0],

There are still competitions based on this concept where someone needs a fixed number of smaller tasks to complete the main task.

	81287 : ["Census~ I am now in Chronicles so I'll explain it from here: The census of David in this chapter is also recorded in 2 Sam, but there it does state that it was because God was angry with Israel that He moved David to take the census. The account of the census has been problematic because God does not cause anyone to sin, and because it is not apparent why such a census was wrong. (Numbers 1:2, 3 26:2-4). The problem is calrified by comparing these two verses. God did not directly incite David to do something for which He would turn around and judge him(v. 14) rather, He allowed Satan to influence David to do what David had probably already had in his heart to do (James 1:14, 15). This is similar to when the Lord allows Satan to trouble Job or when He permitted an evil spirit to torment Saul.", 9064, "Rlfk0l5Yaa", -1],
	81288 : ["All the books of the bible were compiled from oral traditions long after the facts if any occurred by scribes of varying talents, styles and agendas  The book of Ruth was added to legitimize marrying gentles at a time when there were a lack of eligible nice Jewish girls.

	81289 : ["I want to encourage you to learn all about the start screen. I know it seems to be geared toward touch initially but there are a ton of keyboard shortcuts that make getting around easy. Win to switch from desktop to start screen. Win+D to return to the desktop. Searching for programs is easy. Win to Start, then start typing. Search results appear as you type. Results are divided into three groups Programs which is the default, Settings, and Files. Win+W to search Settings and control panels. Win+F to search Files. Ctrl+Tab while on Start to see all programs. I personally don't use many apps. They're kinda simple. I expect that most people will just use their regular programs instead, which is fine. But you should know how to get around in apps just in case you want to use them. Win+C opens the Charms bar. It's a universal menu for apps, though not all apps use all the charms. So if you want to, say, search for games in the Store app, open the Store app, then open the Charms bar and click Search. Type the word games and press Enter. Printing from apps is done via Devices on the Charms bar. Though the easiest way to print from any program, even non-apps, is to use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+P.  If you need to adjust the settings for an app then open the charms and click Settings, and so on. When you want to shut down the PC, press the power button on the computer. Really, that's the simplest thing to do and it does the exact same thing as opening the charms, going to Settings, Power, shut down. Though you'll need to go to Settings on the charms bar to restart. There's this cool secret where you can restart in the pre-boot environment, where you can select safe mode. Open the Charms bar, click Settings, Power, then hold the Shift key and click Restart. When Windows restarts you'll be able to select safe mode or do other repair functions. Win+X opens the quick access menu. Another way to trigger it is to hover your pointer over the very bottom left corner of your screen and right click. You'll have all the admin functions right there. Programs and Features for uninstalling programs, Power Options, Command Prompt, Task Manager, etc. It's super convenient. Another cool trick is to put the desktop tile as the first tile on the top left on Start. Pressing Enter will flip you to the desktop and pressing Win will flip you back to Start. It's much faster than a touch screen or trackpad could ever be. So there's a lot a ways Windows 8 lets users move around just by the keyboard. Most of them are much faster than swiping fingers across a laptop's trackpad or using a touch screen. Which is why I think people who say it's geared for touch got it wrong. Touch is a nice new feature but no where near as fast as a keyboard and mouse. But if all else fails then installing a start menu replacement isn't out of the question. Of all the ones I've seen, I think Start8 is the best. Sure, it's $5 but it's features are well worth the price and it blends in a lot better with Windows 8 than any of the others. - Dominic", 9065, "TxHLcJ57aa", 1],
