However, details for my stance are necessary to insure that you understand why I say this. #1. I am a believer that freedom is a must, and all people have the right to train their dogs as they see fit, so long as it does not bring harm to an innocent person/people, or ANY dog/animal (with the exception of hunting game) #2. most people would state that a family dog is the only dog for PP (personal protection) otherwise you have an attack dog, and there is a big difference between a PP dog, and and attack dog. A personal protection dog is one that has a family which it loves, and has been trained all basic commands. it can be trained to do just about anything, but the main lessons it has received are based around how to treat strangers ( they should be trained not to be aggressive, or overly friendly) in other words, they should be quiet, and reserved with strangers. a PP dog is not taught to 'attack' he is taught to defend. some people teach their dogs to attack on command, this is both impractical, and detrimental to a dogs psyche (which is something reserved for a different time.) #3. a person willing to put the time and effort into learning how to appropriately train their dog should have the right to do so, they should not have to spend all the time and money on books (which they should read plenty of) and lessons (how they receive these lessons is irrelevant) and then have to go through some government agency to get 'permission' to train their dogs. also, not all breeds are good for PP, anyone smart enough to train their dog right, knows this to be fact. I'm not saying that you are doing anything wrong, as you didn't specify exactly how it works. I am just saying that you need to be careful, creating laws is a messy business, just be sure your not taking away a persons right to their property. some people will spend years learning about how to train their dogs, and I can tell you, many of them will not/would not, ever think to ask uncle same if its \"okay\" to train their dog this way.", 11272, "6OnEHC93aa", 2],

Unemployment did peak at 10.8 in 1982.  It took him a lot to turn around the HUGE mess that Carter left him.  BTW, It was around 9.8% in Jan 1981, and it went down QUICKLY after the tax cuts took effect. 3.  Reagan did cut entitlement programs...This forced them to rein in waste and fraud.  Pretty good idea. 4.  He did try to cut FRAUDULENT claims. 5.  Reagan's other major problem is that he allowed Congress to spend more than he increased the federal revenues, causing the deficit and debt to rise. 6.  He did raise taxes, but this claim is a manipulation.  He raised a few taxes and cut a lot.  It is kind of like Obama claiming that he has cut taxes for 95% of Americans by cutting payroll taxes.  While factually correct, the fact that he as raised taxes MORE on a100% of Americans than he cut them for the 95% nullifies the truth of it.  Reagan raised a few taxes and cut a lot more. 7.  Taxes were dropped from 70-28%, and unemployment DROPPED because jobs were created through those tax cuts. 8.  Who cares if he was in business when his career started.  What is your point? 9.  Reagan did not oppose civil rights.  He opposed government telling individuals what they must do. 10.  His two main themes...You are right.  DAMN WE NEED ANOTHER REAGAN! 11.  Reagan told them to QUELL the protests, the protesters became violent.  Check your facts. Defensive actions from the police.  Those protesters made the radicals who were throwing rocks and bottles at the AZ 1070 protests look like alter boys. 12.  He had to do something, the protesters were now beyond violent.  They were destroying property.  Peaceful protests are allowed.  Radical violence and destruction are not. 13.  But he didn't do it.  He JOKED about it.  Again, what is your point? 14.  Mistake #3.  Therapeutic Abortion Act....Liberals should have loved this one. 15.  GREAT MOVE on the Air Traffic Controllers.  They wanted to shut down the country...he stopped them. 16.  Again, a great move.  He realized the difference between a bunch of actors striking and a group who wanted to shut down the country. He also had the balls to let Iran know (even before elected) that he was coming after the hostages, and they were released immediately upon Reagan taking office.  He dropped the bomb on Libya, effectively de-nutting Qaddafi, he won the Cold War without firing a shot.

If a dog does protect his family in a sticky situation, then more power to that dog, because that dog, obviously knew the difference, but I still feel a dog should not be trained to do so by the average person. That's why there are certain breeds being trained correctly by professionals who know what they are doing. I do feel that anyone is capable of basic training & obedience, however when it comes to a dog being used for protection, people need to be aware that not all dogs can be trained to provide protection & certainly cannot be trained by just anybody.

Here is an example of a dog who has the desire and is being trained to do more than just retrieve:  As far as the trainer, I think most people who are actively involved with personal protection training have some sort of mentor or are involved with a training group. There are many seminars held dealing with how to properly train your dog and I think in the end the owner/trainer is the one training the dog, but the mentor is the one training the trainer.
