	137806 : ["WQ: I'm not a Cena hater, I'm a Cena fan, so I wouldn't know Considering votes don't decide winner, I'll skip that, it only takes space I could use for promos. But I will vote for a Last Man Standing Match for the main event. Promo: You thought that it was gone. But ladies and gentlemen, here's a shocker, something you probably never expected - for one night, YGWA returns! The FINAL show, where it will go out with a BANG. So lean in close and make sure you drink that coffee, because you don't want to miss a second of this action! Video tape it, record it, because tonight truly is a historic event. And on this monumental occasion, I find myself with the honor of main eventing the show, where the final World Champion will be crowned. And you can be sure, I will do everything I possibly can to make sure that honor goes to me. My journey to claim the World Title was a bumpy one. From the moment I debuted, my intentions were clear. I wanted the richest prize the company had to offer, and I would settle for nothing else. I failed the first time around, due to there being four other men involved in that match. But I didn't lose hope. I knew once I got my one on one opportunity, that World Title would be claimed. And so I persisted, destroying anyone and everyone management threw at me, until I earned myself another title shot. And finally, after climbing my way back up, I achieved what I had set out to do since day one. It took longer than expected, but I finally became the World Champion.  But it turned bittersweet, because my time as champion was short. Rather than a long, length reign where I would PROVE my dominance and reign supreme, YGWA ended, and I was unable to make my mark in the title's history. The only thing to console me was that I would be looked as the final World Champion, that I held that belt until this company went under. But now, I find that honor in jeopardy. I find myself having to defend the title that I worked so hard to attain, against that arrogant upstart PD. Our debuting moments couldn't be more different. When I debuted, I made my presence, and my intentions for the World Title, known. But PD? His big moment was him cowardly turning on his team in an 8 man tag match, and running away, leaving the rest of his teammates outnumbered. But it's personal, because I was one of the members he abandoned. PD, there's no running away tonight. I get my hands on you, and I make you pay for your cowardice, you two timing snake. The fans choose which in which manner I make you suffer. Will it be a TLC Match? I get to hit you with chairs, smash you through tables, and throw you off ladders. And with my strength and power PD, it means there's a serious possibility of your health and career being in jeopardy. But there's also a choice for a First Blood Match. Where it means I'll have the pleasure of making you bleed like a pig. Where it means I'll leave you a bloody, broken mess in the middle of the ring at the end of the match. Or will we face off in what I personally would love, a Last Man Standing Match? Where I beat the holy hell out of you until you're no longer able to answer the count of ten? No matter which stipulation is chosen, you're in big trouble. Why does the advantage lie with me, no matter which match type is chosen? Well for one, you've got no spine or talent, so that basically ensures you won't be winning anything tonight. And for another, my strength and power far surpasses yours. I have a size advantage over you, but despite my size, I'm still quick and agile. And perhaps most importantly, I'm smarter than you. I don't just have brawn, and brute force. I use my brains also. You're outmatched in every way possible by me PD. I'm simply better than you in all aspects.  But it's not only that. My resolve to never quit, my determination, far outstrips your own. You can't break my will PD, but I can, and will, break your bones, your body, and your spirit. Face it PD. Tonight's going to be a disaster for you. You may dream of becoming the World Champion but your hopes and dreams are shattered tonight. There will be no happy ending for you. Simply a nightmare. The last image YGWA will ever offer to everyone watching is ME, down on one knee, raising that World Title in triumph, as darkness falls over the arena, the gongs and bells sound, and the crowd roars my name. . .

Alas the YGWA Reunion Show, with members old and new participating in the grand finale and the perfect send off. But tonight is no different to any other night. It's back down to business. I have six different opponents, all with their own wrestling ability. Risky and his never say die attitude, SEP with his straightedgeness, Dylan Klein and his trend setting and attention getting, NVD with slowly rising credibility, Mr. Blood and well his first aid box and all his bloodiness and JW with his uniqueness in a way in which only he understands. But the point i am trying to make is that each and every one of these men have their own way of doing things and that is what they will bring to the table tonight. Any one of them could walk away as the YGWA Hardcore Champion, but as always there is that one element, that feature that will deter them from the righteousness and the glory. I am referring to my awesomely skillful self. Indeed, i dominated, i was part of Wolfpack, YGWA's greatest stable. I defeated a veteran in Fabian Phenom, i battled through the early days of YGWA when i was barely even used and somehow, just somehow i worked my way to the big time and i cashed in at the right moment and i received that all important push that gave me this very title. The title that will be contested in this very ring, amongst seven of the finest athletes going round. We will battle for ultimate supremacy but the cold harsh truth is that there can be only one winner...and well we all know that one winner is going to be none other than ME. Yes, you heard 110% correctly. If i have to break backs i will, if i have to shatter spines i will, if i crush skulls i will and if the only way to win is by cheating, then cheat i will. It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game. Indeed, how i play the game will be very interesting. So if you know what is best for you, i wouldn't go out to grab a souvlaki, i wouldn't order a pizza, i wouldn't dash round the corner for fish and chips...i wouldn't even run outside to the Mr. Whippy van to get an ice-cream. I'd glue my bloody *** to a chair and watch me show these losers who's the real boss, the real and rightful YGWA Hardcore Champion. If that's not cool with you why the f*ck would you even tune in to watch this damn show?! It's all about me and MY Hardcore Championship.

Votes: Justin Time Prasdana Shaun Cold Justin Windgate Simply Edgehead The Funking Punk King Cliff and NVD Draw E&C Connection Siberian Wolverine Deadman 4 Life in a Last Man Standing Match!   Promo: and my send-off as well. YWGA was a great E-fed and I was proud to be a part of it and call it my home. I'd had so many things happen to me but I never forgot about YGWA and everything that it means. I hold YWGA dear to my heart and I'd be very happy to help give it a great send-off. E&C vs Dark Demon. Hell in the Cell. This has dream match written all over it and may very well be the toughest match I have ever competed in around the world. Demon is so dangerous and inside a Steel Hell he can be much tougher than usual. He is barbaric and frankly to survive Hell in the Cell you must be barbaric, brutal and hold NOTHING but 100% of the time, if you fail to unleash your full potential you may wind up at best on a strecher and well at worst you could even die from all the injures you may sustain. I'd like to believe that YGWA has been easy for me but obviously that is FAR from true. I have had to train so very hard for all my matches and sometimes I come up with the results that I want and other times I am not so lucky. The losses actually help me more than the wins do because I learn from fatal mistakes. Demon I know you probably have the intellectual abilities of a 7 year old girl but I implore you to listen to a man who knows exactly what he is talking about. You are pretty tough with a lot of brawn Demon but you do not possess any brains from what I can see. Your best factor is your strength and brute force doesn't give one immortality in wrestling. It is an absolute honour to face you Dark Demon but I can't help but point out an opponents weakness if it is so obvious in front of my face. Maybe you need a mask demon. I brought this from the local supermarket yesterday and gave it my own little touch. I hope you like it! *Shows mask to screen*  See the words \"Loser\" well lets just say they don't represent me or the peeps. You don't hail from Toronto, Canada Demon and you don't even hail from New Jersy.  Dark Demon, from what I see you still haven't shown up to give a reason why you are the better man and why you should win Hell in the Cell. I bet you are fully aware I've been here and talking about you but the reason you haven't talked is because you have NOTHING to say. I've exposed you as a weakling, somethig that many other people were unable to do. You beating me inside that Hell in a Cell is like Funaki pinning Edge in WWE. IT AINT HAPPENING! I can use the cage to my advantage Demon. I can ram your head into the steel and then deliever an unprettier, spear or spinning unprettier all of which will deliever serious damage to your neck. But ramming your head into the steel is probably the LEAST violent thing I can do to you Demon. We can go up on the top of the structure and I will show you absolutely NO remorse but throwing you off the Hell in a Cell to the floor below. I'll then cover you for the victory. You seem to not know what is going on Dark Demon. This is the most dangerous and unpredictable match of YGWA's Final show, you should expect an original like me to go all out and thats exactly what I am going to do. I am going for a training session in my locker room to be at my peak of technical and wrestling ability so you and I will have no excuses if we lose this match. I possibly may lose but I won't take a loss. E&C Connection loves to win and win convincingly. I want to bloody you Demon and look completely dominant and on YGWA's final show you'll get the best from me.  I can't wait to get my hands on you Demon because it will be your death day. All this will come at the hands of me- E&C Connection. My peeps are all rooting for me and I cannot dissapoint them. So... HOW DO I KNOW I'LL WIN? BECAUSE MY PEEPS SAID SO!", 11369, "PxNAj0ONaa", 0],
