Coming from a great champion in reference to another great champion, it was not only a tribute but a testimony.  I think though Jeffries was crude compared to Baer, JIm possessed the natural speed, power and athleticism to overcome whatever limitations he had in term of skills and sophistication vis a vis the more suave Baer. I also think Jeffries had the capabilities to knock Baer's lights out early or late in the fight.", 8737, "IPKPRL7qaa", 1],

The Democratic Party has some excellent candidates for the job of President, with the best being Senator Joe Biden.  Actually, it's hard to choose, because they are all qualified.

Making such claims has gotten him money deposited in his account and the fun of spending your day in an interview room telling lies. What is the downside of making this claim?  Nothing.

If ever you've seen any of the documentaries with the voice recordings from the White House which serve to document his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I think that one crisis in itself proved his leadership.

He had to call in a lot of favors and do a lot of talking to get certain programs passed in the Southern states and it cost him his career.  So, one could say he must have thought highly of JFK or had a guilty conscious. Most of us were not born or very young at that time but, I watch the History channels and Biography which show a lot of actual film coverage. That was were I got this information.

They were both aggressive, and were always moving forward, unloading bombs, physically out muscling their opponent.  So none of them would have taken a backward step.
