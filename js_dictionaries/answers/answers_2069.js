	109219 : ["Gays should be allowed the right to marry. There's nothing morally wrong with it! If too people are in love then why not? If they're happy together and are already going to share there lives together, why not give the same rights as everyone else. Everyone who's so against it needs to just back off. If you're so against them, don't go to a gay wedding. Pretend that they don't exist like you normally do. Go bury your heads under the covers and read your precious bible. Believe it if you will, but don't ruin other's peoples lives over it. Does the bible preach about loving thy neighbor or something like that? Then why are christians and the like so close minded? If they have an all accepting God, then why aren't they? Let the gay people have their marriages and their lives. It isn't hurting you any!", 10085, "AA11099554", 0],
	109220 : ["You make a good point, America may say it's the land of the free, but having a christian, etc. majority it tends to be shift towards their ideals. I mean we say 'under god' in the pledge, our money says 'in god we trust' and most protest (aside from the one about immigration rights and such) are between the group that's different and the religious groups.  I say to each their own but until tings can be looked at with an open mind or the major religious groups learn to lay off or leave the rest of the people alone, this country can't ever be free. In my opinion true freedom and rule of majority will forever clash because the minorities will have to live under the rules of the majority never really having their freedom.  I don't think the government should have a say in who can and can't get married. Most of that issue is a moral one and how do you place laws on morals.  Sorry, I seem to be rambling. Anyway I think the only reason gay couples can't be aloud to get married is because too many people would be offended(that may not be the right word). Though I wouldn't be, I think there is nothing wrong with gay marriage. Sorry, if none of that made any sense.", 10085, "AA11585952", 0],

	109231 : ["well theres no if about it being gay is agenst the Bible. some states do alow gay marrages, some don't. the reason it not alowed in all the states is the same reason any of the other laws people would like to get passed haven't. the voting proses, the senate and the house of representatives. all 3 are based on peoples opinions. a majority of the people in this country are Christian or Catholic and as such beleive its wrong. I my self am a Christian. I have never said its right or wrong about Gays because I beive in the power of choice that we were given by God. what Beleive is that no one has the right to make decicions for anouther. so as far as being gay or gay marragee i have no opinion, other than if that is what a person decides to do its not our responsability to get envolved,its between them and God. i came to this conclution also because the bible says to stone gays but yet it also says not to judge if your a sinner your self(every one sins)this  not judging if your a sinner was actually mentioned in a case where a woman was going to be stoned for being a whore. My boyfriend beleives much different then i do he beleives in the stoning and thats it as he puts it - find a map of the middle east see if you can find the cities of sodom or gamora theese cities were so filled with homosexuals bi sexuals and animal moelesters that were so perverted they tried to make gay passes at angels if you read that part of the bible and what happened to thoose two cities it explains gods opinion of his view of\"*******\" compleatly take some time to look up romans chapter 1:24- the end of the chapter it clearly state they are an abomination un to the lord but back to the subject its not legal because of how the law making system is created.", 10085, "AA11078094", 0],
	109232 : ["Do you not understand that laws are human creations?  There are only two possible bases for a particular \"right\" to do something.  Either the people (by majority rule) grant it to you, or else God grants it to you regardless of what the majority of the people think.  Now obviously, if the majority of the people want to deny gay folks the right to get married, just exactly who do you think you are to tell the majority they can't have what they want?  On what grounds?  Who are you going to appeal to, when you lose a vote?  God?  I think not.  The constitution?  That was written by human beings too, and the people have every right to interpret it the way they see fit.  The same thing goes for putting references to God in any other situation- money, courts, or what have you.  If the majority of the people want those things, in a democracy, you don't have a lick of credible defense against that.  You can try to convince a majority of the people to accept your viewpoint, and that's what democracy means.

A homosexual lifestyle is a perversion of nature.  We fought a war for freedom of black people because it is right.  Being homosexual is against nature and can not reproduce itself. NAMBLA says that little boys should have sex before 8 years old, if this freedom?  are there no limits to freedom?  Homosexual and marriage are two contradictory terms, Marriage is between a man and woman to establish a family, children.  Homosexuals can not reproduce and to establish a family must take children from a family (man & woman)  You can say it is the Bible or Religion, but it is natural or nature for a man to be with a woman.

Those who try to use the Bible (or any other moral justifications) to discriminate against gays seem to think that they can use their religion to make laws, because they are in the majority.
