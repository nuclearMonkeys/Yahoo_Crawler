Many studies have shown that all kinds of vegetarians have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attacks), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer. Try getting some mock meats. I like Morning Star and Boca. But trust me on this one, Full Circle is nasty! Anyway.... DIET TIPS TIME! -PROTEIN Plant proteins should provide for you enough, as long as you make sure your calorie intake is high enough for your energy needs. -MORE AMINO ACIDS If plant proteins simply aren't enough, try eating whole grains, nuts or seeds. -IRON If you're not totally vegan, egg yolk provides iron well. However, dried beans, dried fruits, and spinach are good sources as well. -VITAMIN B 12 This only comes naturally from animals. It can be found in some fortified (not enriched) breakfast cereals such as Total and some brands of nutritional brewer's yeast, or in supplements. -VITAMIN D You will need a reliable vitamin D source. If you don't get a lot of sunlight, you'll probably need a supplement. -CALCIUM Studies have shown that vegetarians absorb and retain more calcium than meat eaters. Cool, huh? Calcium can be found in greens such as spinach, kale and broccoli, and some legumes and soybean products. -ZINC Grains, nuts and legumes are good sources. If you chose to take a supplement, be sure to pick supplements containing no more than 15-18 mg zinc. Supplements containing 50 mg or more may lower HDL (\"good\") cholesterol in some people. --And some more tips-- Keep your intake of sweets and fatty foods to a minimum. These foods are low in nutrients and high in calories. Choose whole or unrefined grain products when possible, or use fortified or enriched cereal products. Use a variety of fruits and vegetables, including foods that are good sources of vitamins A and C. If you use milk or dairy products, choose fat-free/nonfat and low-fat varieties. Eggs are high in cholesterol (213 mg per yolk), so monitor your use of them. Limit your cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg per day.", 11096, "iXx9SWceaa", 0],
