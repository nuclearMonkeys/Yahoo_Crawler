	116784 : ["I worked in Saudi Arabia for several years and they may have got many things wrong but one thing I do know is that I could walk around with a wedge of money in my back pocket and know that it was almost certain to stay there. Unfortunately the UK is now being run to ruin by so called do gooders and is handcuffed by Brussels. Life should mean life after all the victims of those murdered have to endure a lifetime of misery. Carrying a gun or a knife should be an automatic 15 years with no parole. The same for drug dealers no matter how much they are carrying. Rapists should be castrated. Men who beat women should get at least 10 years. Those from a foreign land caught commiting an offence should serve time here and then be deported back to their homelands no matter where that is. Drink drivers should get a lifetime ban Basically if you don't want the consequences don't do the crime. As for prison overcrowding all I say is TOUGH they are there to be punished. If they are so overcrowded then run a shift pattern for the inmates and have a hot bed system. If things don't change in the UK soon then I can see people taking things into their own hands like that poor farmer who was defending his properrty but got locked up himself  few years back. All he was doing was defending what is his. Those on his property should not have been there. 50 East Midlands so that makes me old enought to know right from wrong.", 10469, "nUW4oioxaa", 1],
	116785 : ["Actually it depeds on the sentencing. From what I can understand when the DA puts in a 25 to life sentence, it means that the CONVICTED felon can expect a sentencing of anything between 25 years and life in prison. Basically 25 to life is usually what they say before the defendant is convicted. After he or she is convicted, the jury can 'advise' the judge as to what the sentence should be. The judge then takes the jury and the DA's sentences into advisement before the judge makes a ruling to how long the convicted person/s should stay in jail. So if the DA requests 25 to life it means that, s/he wants the convicted felon to be in jail for atleast 25 years and at most life in jail. The judge can go ahead and pick some random number like 44 and it will still be ok, but the judge can also pick a lower number if s/he feels that 25 is too much. It's all up to the preception of the judge, the jury, the DA and the defense. Usually convicted felons don't normally serve out their whole term. Usually only about a 1/3 or a 1/4 of their term is served in jail and the rest is what we call parole where they have to go and check in with a shrink and the police every so often. But life in jail usually means that they serve life unless parole is granted where then the convicted felon would serve out the rest of his or her sentence outside jail. But life without parole is usually when the felon cannot appeal for parole but can appeal the decisions. This is my interpretation of the life sentence. I may be right or wrong it really depends on so many factors, good behavior and the such. The death sentence is different because you get sent to prision and then death row, this process is so slow you can rot in prision/death row forever and never actually be killed. Usually inmates on death row die from the atrocious living conditions.", 10469, "LJckaSQaaa", 0],
	116786 : ["Age: Old Where: US It's the same here. 'Life' is reduced based on conduct and overcrowding. I personally don't think it that important to interpret a life sentence so literally. When the court system says 'life' we all understand that means 'a really long time' that MIGHT include the rest of your life. Some life sentences come with the qualifier, \"without the possibility of parole\", and that literally means life, so we do have a 'life' sentence, it's just not the same thing as the 'other' life sentence. The greater issue here is, why is prison overcrowding such a continuing and always escalating problem? The statistics suggest the number of people we incarcerate is always growing. Why is that? If we are shoving 'life' sentence prisoners out the door to make space for prisoners convicted of less serious crimes, doesn't that suggest we're doing something wrong? I would guess we're either incarcerating too many people or we're giving them too many reasons to break our laws.", 10469, "None", 0],

	116792 : ["The only reason I can see to have the tests is if you intend to terminate, which you don't. That makes the tests sort of moot. I know four women who have children with DS well enough to have talked to them about their pregnancies. One of them carried her child with DS back when there were no tests available. Of the others, only one opted for the tests. She told me she really wished, by the end of her pregnancy, that she hadn't had the testing done. The positive result was so stressful to her that she had a lot of problems during the pregnancy. She had anxiety attacks which sent her BP and heart rate through the roof, so they also affected the baby, and the anxiety attacks always happened when she was reading up on DS and how to care for a child with the syndrome. Her doctor sent her to a specialist to try and teach her relaxation methods, and he finally told her she absolutely could not continue to read up on it to try and prepare herself. He was worried she would miscarry because of her extended periods of anxiety, and he couldn't give her medication for them. She ended up having to do relaxation exercises and having to drink a glass of wine twice a day to calm herself. As I said, the other two didn't have the tests. Neither of them was over 30 when they had their child with DS, and subsequent pregnancies were fine. They told me they got so much support from doctors, friends, family and from books that they felt empowered to handle the baby's needs.  If you were going to terminate based on the results, then it would make sense to have the testing done. But you aren't going to terminate. The screening is notorious for being incorrect (I have never had kids but I know that part), so there's really no reason to do it unless the doc thinks something is seriously wrong and really, really believes you need to have it. And even then, I'd get a second opinion.  Look at it this way. If you have a child with DS, every child is different. You're going to have to learn about the child's needs after he or she gets here, anyway. Why subject yourself to the nerve-wracking experience of testing when it's already a fact. The child inside you either has it or doesn't, and you're going to keep the child and love the child and care for the child no matter what. So read up on it a little bit, but not much. Get familiar enough that you know what the main problems are which face a family with a child with DS, and then let it go. Focus on taking care of yourself, your husband, and your baby. Prepare yourself to welcome your child, but don't worry too much. There will be time to worry later, when the baby can't sleep and is crying at 3:00 a.m. and nothing you do seems to help and you feel like a zombie anyway since you haven't been sleeping at all :) And by the way--the women I know with kids with DS? None of them would trade the experience. All of them have really neat children, all of whom are grown up now. They have all told me, usually more than once, that while it's a challenge, the pay off is definitely worth it. Take care of yourself. Bron", 10479, "AA10246871", 1],

	116801 : ["Law is pretty universal from country to country as most people are familiar with 'life' being meant up to a standard year commonly set for that culture and gender. For example if a caucasian criminal is sentenced to 'life' he or she will be staying in prison from 1st day arrival to the moment a parole, if allowable, is set in motion. It also is decided by life expectancy of the caucasian ethnicity, usually 77.? years for the average healthy non-smoking, non-drinking male and roughly 9-14 years later for the same but female of same ethnic background.  But it is fairly consistent between states and countries that sentencing of life means anywhere between that 1st day and the average expectancy added to current age. If a guy or gal goes in at 20 and average life expectancy is 77 years old, then this person can be in prison till they reach 97, which is highly unlikely as justified by their crime, may not see the next day let alone next year !  It is appalling criminals 'get out' released back into society without finishing their sentence but it is even more despicable when they deserved just a fine or slap on the wrist instead they are sentenced to time in prison where the wasting of taxpayers money is given a rude awakening ! Yet they still complain if not given a steak dinner and a television set in their 8 x 8 cells ! Can you believe that crap ! I am in Ohio.

	116802 : ["Legally, you're missing the finer details of what's going on. Life normally has a set legal meaning (99 years in most places here in the States). So, a \"life\" sentence is a \"99 year\" sentence. Then, you may get our early for time served, probation, good behavior, blah blah blah. But that all comes after the fact. They ARE sentenced to life, but mitigating factors are then applied that reduce the actual time served after the sentencing. As an outside observer, we often only hear only the initial and the final calculations and not all the details and finer legal points that went on in-between to create the difference in the two. It is no different than sentencing someone to 20 years and then letting them out after 12 for whatever reason. Should we change EVERY legal sentence to mean exactly what it initially states and do away with reductions for any reason ever? Or, to see the same effect in a wholly different context... This is like saying to an employee \"Your salary is $1000 per month!\" But then you only pay them $682.17 because you take that original $1000 and subtract various state and federal income and social security taxes, health care, 401k contributions, etc, etc, etc. But *technically,* *legally* your base and reported salary is still $1000 per month, even if you only *receive* $682.17 per month in actualized monies. Normally, if you want \"life\" to mean \"life,\" then you sentence to \"life without parole.\" Just \"life\" is understood to meant that there is a possibility of parole. This would be the equivalent of saying \"pay\" versus \"pay without taxes.\" We can talk about redefining life, but it already does come with a specific, clear, purposeful legal meaning most times. The meaning may seem disparate with reality to a layperson, but lay people aren't the ones in the courtrooms practicing law every day. To lawyers, the term \"life\" DOES carry a specific meaning that they can then work with.  This is a situation where I say we let the professionals who deal with it handle how their own profession defines a thing and recognize and admit that--as outside lay people--we not only shouldn't try to have a say, but we shouldn't think we know better than they do about a thing we understand less about. (I'm not a lawyer, but I work in a profession in which outsiders are constantly wanting to redefine our workflows and terminologies to things they could understand easier, but that would make our jobs harder and less efficient.)

A diagnostic test on other hand, gives you a firm diagnosis Ultrasound can also be done to look for markers indicative of Down Syndrome.  Every one is different in their opinion.

You yourself are not classed as at risk at 30 ( in the UK that is), you would be classed as higher risk at 35 and above. This is when the risk increases with maternal age. Blood tests give you a risk factor, such as 1 in 500, or 1 in 50,000 but this is only a risk factor and someone will be that 1.  In my experience as a midwife, those who are expecting a little one with Downs seem to cope better than those who were not expecting it.
