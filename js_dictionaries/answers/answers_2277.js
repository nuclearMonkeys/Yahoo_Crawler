For instance, when I was at Yokota AB (in Japan) the PACAF band was stationed there (actually, it still it).  They used to have a concert band, a rock band, and a touring band.  Those were cut/combined to just a rock band. You need to contact the band recruitment office directly.  Check out the Aif Force band's web-site for direction.  Don't think the average recruiter  knows anything about getting you in.  They only care about their numbers.  Don't take them at their word and don't sign anything unless you read and re-read it.

Those that do insult constantly call the women whores because of the way they dress and because many participate in premarital sex.  They definitely generalize too much and in the process say nothing about the many Muslims in other countries who also dress provocatively and have premarital sex.  They wouldn't call all Muslim women whores because of the actions of a few.  Perhaps another reason why Americans see Muslims as their enemies is because of 9/11.  Not only the actions of the terrorists, but the actions of hundreds of thousands of Muslims who danced in the streets after hearing the news.   Even your last sentence here \"it happens when ever there is western injustice 2 the 3rd world.\".  What about the injustices of others at the hands of Muslims.  You see how you make judgment on Americans, but not Muslims.  In the world today who are the terrorists?  The answer is Muslims.

Then, when Julia Roberts became popular, I noticed how much she looked like Barbara, and people seemed to think Julia was \"beautiful\". Funny how time and styles change, and how people's perceptions of things are always different. There is no truly \"ugly\" person. If you're ugly on the outside and beautiful on the inside, your \"ugliness\" becomes less obvious.

Obama was speaking about the ideology of Osama which they misunderstand to represent 1.5 billion Muslims. So many of them think all Muslims are their enemies while the truth is not.
