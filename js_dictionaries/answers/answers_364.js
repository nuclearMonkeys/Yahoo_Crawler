It was a time when citizens having their own weapons was the only way to quickly raise a defense if attacked by another state or foreign country.  That simply is not the case today and infringes on the liberty of being able to shop or go to school without the threat of gun violence. The pro-gun lobby and their supporters want you to concentrate on the “no law infringing on the right to bear arms” and not on the opening words “A well regulated militia, necessary . . .”no longer applies to conditions today.  Extremists , especially anti-government groups, think they need to join a militia to protect their rights and use the words of the 2nd Amendment to promote their aims and undermine our democracy. The NRA and the gun lobby encourage this interpretation to simply sell guns and ammo. They try to say you are safer owning a gun when every serious study shows you are not. I'm sure the 2nd Amendment would be written much differently if Franklin and Jefferson were penning it today.
