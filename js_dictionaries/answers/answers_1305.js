	70845 : ["& India narrowly missed the 2nd ranking in tests today as England somehow managed to draw the test match against NZ & hence saved the series. With some exceptional players like Pujara,Dhawan & Kohli in the team,and if that can be backed up with a strong fast bowling attack with players like Umesh Yadav,irfan pathan,etc then I won't be surprised if India climb further up in tests after the South Africa & NZ series. P.S.if u think India is going to be whitewashed in South Africa in the test series,I think pujara alone is enough to ensure that's not going to happen.Also note that pujara was not the part of the Indian team when they were whitewashed in England & Australia.I strongly believe pujara will make a huge difference.But also it's important that our captain gives him exposure to such foreign conditions even before the South Africa series by playing him in champions trophy in England & triangular odi series in West Indies.", 8596, "qAZS4WUIaa", 5],
	70846 : ["most of the critics says its a flat tracks heroics or rank turner wickets were provided to the oppositions to win matches and we didnt win enough matches outside subcontinent,But when our team goes to ENG , AUS or SA we also gets Green and Bouncy wickets wich was made for the Advantage of home team than why these people not complains,ENG just mange to escape narrowly otherwise IND would have jumpd to no-2 in tests.IND have played consistntly good Cricket in ODIs thats why they are no 1 in Tests we did loose few matches but other than those we have played well and deservs to be rankd in top 3 in TEST and in  T20s i feel we should have been no 1 currently we are 3 but in very near future IND will rank 1 in all formats.", 8596, "aq5mkVFBaa", -1],

	70853 : ["Hi Sosu, Rice Divine is delicious!!! There is also Rice Dream, which I don't like as much. There are many soy brands. Someone else mentioned Tofutti. But I'm pretty sure their little sandwhich cookies have egg in it so watch out for those.  Soy ice cream is also really easy to make on your own. 1 package silk tofu, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup soy milk and about 3/4 cup granulated sugar. I added 1/3 cup green tea macha to mine to make green tea ice cream. Toss everything in a blender. Blend til smooth. Then toss it in the freezer. Take it out and mix it a little here and there til it freezes up. Then take it out, let it thaw for about 20 minutes, put it back in the blender and blend well.  My next batch will be with powdered espresso and Wax Orchard fudge sauce. See link below. Wax Orchard fudge sauces are all vegan and diabetic friendly. After your second time blending, you would pour the ice cream back into the container - spiraling the chocolate sauce (and nuts if you like) in as you go. Some of you folks need to do some homework. Fasting does NOT necessarily mean abstaining from all foods. There are levels of fasting. Fasting means to remove something from your intake - as a sacrifice. It can mean you are skipping one item alone.  Some Christians fast by having one meal a day. There are some fasts that are just from an item we love, such as coffee. Catholics abstain from meat on Friday during Lent. Orthodox Christians fast from all dairy during Lent.", 8602, "AA10920670", 0],

	70855 : ["Tofutti is the best! Soy delicious is also wonderful Rice Dream is another kind You can find these at Giant Eagle and Acme, so I would assume other major grocers have them.

Tofutti also has vegan (no dairy or animal) cream cheese, sour cream, cheese slices etc. etc. etc..", 8602, "10103552f3da1ce76bd522ae0a42a4d3aa", 3],

	70861 : ["This year in order to go green I took the following steps: 1) Did not send any   cards - I told my friends and work colleagues for weeks before   I was not sending any cards as it is a waste of material and money - no one minded, I think people are so worried about looking like a scrooge they feel they have to send cards.   2) Did not get a   tree and am only this morning (  eve) putting up any decorations (this does not include lights) - I know people feel lights make things more cheerful and pretty - I do not feel like I have missed out at all - especially since the electricity bill will not be a surprise in the new year. 3) I only went one one shopping trip and brought 3 friends along in the car so we could all get the presents in one go. 4) bought most of my presents on-line from only a couple of sources. 5) limited present giving - I asked friends not to buy for me, I would rather spend time with them than receive a present which will on most occasions not get used.  Instead we all got together and had a night in. 6) did not go over board on the food front only buying enough extra food to cover   dinner (16 people) - there will be very little waste and any food will be divided between the guests and used after. 7) instead of expensive nights out in restaurants which involves taxis and loads of money on dinner my friends and I had a night in to which everyone brought a dish and an instrument - We all had a blast Those are the main steps I have taken - I don't think any of them have lessened my   experience - it is about friends, family and giving (that can be time instead of money).

	70862 : ["The best   present would be to commit to living a more sustainable lifestyle all year round!  There are lots of things you can do, a lot of them have already been mentioned but recycled paper and cards (that then get recycled) are a must - or make a donation to a good cause instead and send an email to friends saying, I am thinking of you but I decided to donate the money I spend on   cards each year to X, Y or Z. No novelty plastic rubbish that as someone already pointed out, gets put in a drawer by the end of January and in the bin by February. Buy locally produced food (if you can) and shop organic (if you can afford it). Make your own bread and mince pies - really simple and fun to do. Don't leave   lights on and use LEDs. Don't leave anything on standby.  There's holly everywhere at the moment, make some homemade decorations for free and re-use plastic decorations, don't buy new each year, just reinvent them! If you're buying something that needs batteries for someone you know doesn't use rechargables, get them a recharagable unit and batteries as part of the present! That way you won't look too preachy but you're gently encouraging them to be more green!  Compost food scraps. If you buy a real tree, you can compost it in the garden (we use the needles for frost cover and the wood for burning). Commit to buying less presents and do homemade vouchers for each other (washing up, back rub, clean the car, dinner for two, cinema trip, walk the dog).
