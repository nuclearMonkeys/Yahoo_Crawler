Adventure - Atari 2600 * Controversial Content: Programmer's Name hidden in a secret room that required the player to pick up a hidden & secret item to find said room. * The Fallout: While Atari was pissed off at the programmer for a while.  This was the first conception of the \"Easter Egg\" in games & future games added a \"Credits Reel\" at the end of the game. GTA: San Andreas - PS2 / PC (+ XBox 360 & PS3) * Controversial Content: A hidden sex-based minigame as part of a dating sidequest.  This was uncovered by PC modders by reverse-engineering the game to find the commented out code & created the \"Hot Coffee\" mod to re-enable it (effectively removing the comment tags in the game code). * The Fallout: A Congressional hearing was performed, the ESRB changed the rating of the original version to AO (Adults Only; 18+).  Rockstar, as part of a settlement regarding this, provided a cash settlement & perform a recall of the original version of the game, where Rockstar sent back an updated version of the game with the offending content removed to comply with the ESRB M rating. Tiger Woods PGA Golf '99 (PS1) * Controversial Content: A digital copy of \"  vs Jesus\" video (the precursor to the hit animated series South Park), which a staff member snuck onto the disc ILLEGALLY (due to copyright laws). * The Fallout: EA had to recall the first pressing of the game discs & removed the offending file on subsequent pressing of game discs. Some older (most 80's PC) games had some programmers hide some various rants within the game files & code that can be considered controversial that hackers & reverse engineers have. In modern times, with the ability to update games.  Developers & publishers can patch out & remove offending content, which makes finding such content even harder to discover.", 2470, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 2],
