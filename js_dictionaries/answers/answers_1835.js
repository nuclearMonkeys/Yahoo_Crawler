	97493 : ["My favorite Tokio Hotel member...? Hmmm...well I hate picking favorites, but I really like Bill Kaulitz. Not because of his looks, although he is a pretty good looking person. He appears to be a level headed person and he has good morals. For someone so famous, you would expect them to be selfish and conceited. And he doesn't seem that way at all. He seems truly dedicated to the fans of Tokio Hotel.  I don't get why people pick on him at all. Sure, he wears make up and dresses like a girl. But people don't need to judge him or make assumptions about him because of that. He stands out and is himself no matter what anyone says. That is confidence. Ignoring all the comments from people (around the world for him) and keeping your head held high. I can't imagine working in the entertainment industry as being easy. Therefore I applaud Bill Kaulitz. He is himself, no matter what anyone says about him.", 9623, "DRi1anUxaa", 2],
	97494 : ["I feel that Valentine dinners should be special. Choose your sweetie's favorite foods and surprise him or her with a wonderful romantic meal and a special table set for two. If you have a fireplace, set a small table close by, and use your most delicate china and crystal. A few candles and a small, low bowl of fresh flowers will complete the atmosphere.", 9621, "1FseteW0aa", 1],

	97497 : ["My joint is Right Hand by T-Pain. The concept would be him on the stand in a courtroom full of ladies(im talking the judge, the jury, and the spectators are all women), trying to explain why he cheated on his girl. I would also have flashbacks of him picking up the girl he cheated with and ish.", 9620, "4SO4AeeUaa", 2],
	97498 : ["The video for \"Bring On The Dancing Horses\" is simply too rattling lovely. My favorites are: \"Beat Box\" - Art Of Noise \"Never Let Me Down Again\" - Depeche Mode I could say Lips Like Sugar however I'm now not definite if the variant he directed is the only I consistently watch. The time I spent looking that video is in poor health.

	97499 : ["I would do a video for sticky fingaz's song \"Why\" It would start off with a man getting a phone call from his wife to pick her up, along with his children. He'll be on the way when he looks to the side of the road and sees one of his old friends. (Who happened to be locked up for the past 10 years) They would talk for a minute, when his friend asks him for a ride. The man says no at first, but eventually caves in, and he drives the way oppsite from the direction he had been going before. (Little bit of foreshadowing) On the way to the store, his friend abruptly asks him to stop beside a car. The music would stop for a little interlude. The man would be thinking to himself about his wife and children (maybe a flashback or something) when his daydream is interrupted by a gunshot. He figures somethings wrong with his friend and attempts to drive off, he speeds off. In a second he looks over and sees his friend next to him. (startled for a minute) As they drive the man is expressing his anger, and a picture of his family catches on fire from an ash that drops from his friends cigarette. (while hes counting money he got from the robbery) The man would act like hes attempting to pull over, while his friend grabs the wheel, and the car crashes, and flies over a bridge into the water.

	97504 : ["i love them all for different reasons. I don't think you can compare them to one another so it's hard for me to choose a favorite. at first when i got into the band i was madly in love with Tom and blinded so i didn't notice any of the other members but after going to my first concert i realized they're all amazing and have their own special quality that makes up Tokio Hotel even if the media highlights Bill and Tom the most. so favorite wise i don't have one anymore. but in the case of who i'm attracted to the most i'd say Tom. though i think their all sexy. some days i lean towards Tom and other Bill or Georg or Gustav. but Tom has always been the one i first noticed in a picture or etc.", 9623, "None", 1],

	97513 : ["Please don't say anything. Do you really think your son is stupid? He's probably figured out whether she was faithful or not, and he chooses to raise this child as his son, whether the DNA is correct or not. Frankly, blue-eyed blond children can come from dark parents. I have a friend who was exactly as you described: platinum blonde and blue-eyed as a child, with three dark-eyed, brunette siblings and parents. She's a dead ringer for her great-grandmother, and her hair darkened as she hit her teens. Stay out of it. A child is a child is a child, and deserves to be loved.

Since legally, I'm guessing, your son is the father, and you are the grandparent, you could really hurt that child's life if you stir things up now. My guess is that in a decade or so your grandson will be the one asking his parents the tough questions and that's how it should be.
