Given that, I know of only two fighters who could have done that in theory and in practice---Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali. With their physical gifts and ideal physique and enormous fighting talent and skills, these two could have emerged and fought in any division from flyweight to the heavyweight and emerged at least among the very best. Behind these two guys are Henry Armstrong, Roberto Duran, Mickey Walker, Benny Leonards, Harry Greb, Sam Langford, Charley Burley and Sugar Ray Leonard who all fought very well in different weight classesa nd/or won at least two legitimate and undisputed world championships in different weight divisions especially at the time of one world champion for each of the then just 8 to 11 weight divisions.

	122342 : ["A reception is reserved for the day you marry so you can be received in public for the first time as husband and wife.  After your wedding day/elopement is over, so is the opportunity to call a party a reception.  However, a wedding celebration is certainly an acceptable name for what you wish to do. So, on a tight budget, you can have a lovely wedding celebration.  You will save lots of money if you change the way you think.  Forget \"wedding\" and concentrate on \"party\".  There, you just saved a few grand!!  Now, plan a cocktail celebration where you serve substantial appetizers.  Serving appetizers rather than a buffet or a meal is oh so cost effective and just perfect for this type of celebration. Have some signature drinks/punch, soft drinks and maybe wine, if you like.  Set out a spread of easy one bite appetizers so you do not have to buy plates and utensils.  Napkins are so affordable.  You can get a huge cheese wheel and lots of variety in crackers, cut up veggies, olives, nuts, fruit kabobs on pretty toothpicks and other one bite goodies.  Avoid chips and dips as they are good for Superbowl Sunday, not your celebration.  You may want to check out local restaurants to see if they have a catering menu.  Often you can get some really great deals on delish appetizers trays.  Do look into that. If you set up a cocktail party atmosphere and have the drinks over here and the food over there, people will mingle between the two and have a great time. See if someone you know can host the party.  Ask friends to help out with whatever else you need.  Decor is optional, but if it is outdoors, buy a few flats of annuals and plant them in the ground or in pots for a lovely and VERY inexpensive display of color.  Either that or buy cut flowers at your local grocery store or florist.  If you do not have a green thumb, ask a friend to grow cut flowers in her garden for you to cut and use.  You have to be practical and creative with your resources.  You can do this.  Good Luck.", 10694, "Gf9Vt3Iyaa", 0],

How small of a budget are we talking? $500? $1,000? $5,000? A small wedding can be done on a budget. You just need a place to have it (could be a backyard, a park, a hall, etc), someone to marry you, a license, and food.  For example, get married in a backyard garden - if you have a short ceremony in the afternoon(less than 15 minutes), you can get away with only a few chairs for the elderly guests.

We are both moms and normally I run around in sweatpants and a tshirt..But, If I am going to the salon..I go ahead and primp my hair before hand to give my stylist an idea of how I like to wear it. She also knows that by simply giving me a quick style wont do. Now if someone goes to a barbershop or fantastic sams, or costcutters etc..no I dont think it matters.
