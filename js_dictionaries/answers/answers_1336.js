The longer your baseline, the better off you are. To be of any value, your time scale must be significantly longer than the duration of individual fluctuations [I would estimate a good 2 orders of magnitude larger would be about minimum you'd want for any sort of statistical significance.] You need a valid and accurate baseline to have something to compare your results to. This can, however, be a very well-known segment of the data series. For example, in climate studies, baselines are often chosen during the times we've had good temperature records, or where we've had multiple proxies giving similar results.  *When you are looking at climate, a long-term phenomenon, average hourly temperature does not give a better result than average daily temperature.

You are: heeltap Your Answer: Listen to Jim Hansen on the topic at  Dr. James Hansen THE THREAT TO THE PLANET How can we avoid dangerous human-made climate change Dr. James Hansen is one of the few scientists who have consistently warned that the impact that humans have on the climate is bringing about changes that are faster than we ever believed and may be irreversible if action is not taken now. Hansen is Director of the NASA Institute for Space Studies in New York City, and he teaches at Columbia. Since the late 1970s, he has worked on studies of the Earth's climate. He has run afoul of government censors since the 1980s. Repeatedly his testimony before Congress was suppressed or re-written.  Hansen says that the unprecedented and rising amounts of greenhouse gases added each year AND the speed at which we are altering the energy balance of the earth are completely out of the range of proven earth history of hundreds of thousands of years. Hansen fears that we may soon be reaching feedback mechanism or tipping points such as the melting of the ice sheets that has already begun on Greenland and West Antarctica. In part one of this program Hansen gives a fascinating account of the earth's climate history, in part two he talks about solutions. Dr. Hansen's work - including the slide projections for this talk, can be found at <  For a broadcast quality mp3 version of Part ONE click HERE For a broadcast quality mp3 version of Part TWO click HERE For a PODCAST of Part ONE click HERE For a PODCAST of Part TWO click HERE Hansen will tell your the conclusions are based on the compositional and isotopic analysis of the tiny bubbles of gases from ancient atmospheres enclosed in ice core samples (columns or tubes of ice going back 400,000 yrs). The ice cores were obtained by drilling down through the ice of glaciers located in Greenland and Antarctica. The mountaintop glaciers have also been sampled ,like Kenya's Mount Kilimanjaro, and that data from those places backs up and confirms the data from Greenland and Antarctica. The demagogues who claim GW evidence is fiction are for the most part people who quote as sources scientists paid by the industries who want to maintain the status quo as long as there is profit to be made selling fuels from fossil carbon fuels made from petroleum and coal. These energy sources are finite and eventually will run out. But as of right now, demand is beginning to outstrip existing reserves. That's why you see the incremental barrel of oil of 42 gallons priced at 100$/BBL. That price is telling us this: The reserves left to be found are marginal oil and coal fields and will not be brought to market fast enough to keep energy costs stable much less reduce them. The coal and oil industries know this but they, bottomline, only serve the interests of their investors(that the mantra of all megacorporations who rarely do more than pay lip service to social responsibilities we in as individual have. These corps do things only went given tax credits at taxpayer's expense. What's this to do with GW, you say? The changes that need to be made will not come fast enough from for-profit corporations making money selling and using coal and oil, and it must be the get, the people's government who compels them. and everyone else in the fossil fuel consumption chain including us \"addicted-to-oil-&- cars\" consumers, to do the right things to slow and reverse adverse global changes due to GW. Soon before we all turn this planet against us! I really wish people would listen to the experts who care about the truth and not personal profit.  Keep the faith ! Stay the course ! The scientific facts are against the amoral ne'er-do-wells disputing the reality of the GW problem, much as incompetent oil industry backer BUSH43 did for the last 7 years, posting misinformation in the environment categories.

Or more people will be turning elsewhere. Whoever said: \"w/ each rotation(sic) around the sun, the Earth moves closer to it, & it tilts a little more\", I know you meant to say \"w/each revolution \". Would you or any anti-GW person espousing this as a factor to explain the recent increase in the last 10 yrs (I believe it's 0.8 degrees C) pls be more scientific and quantitative by telling us exactly by how many years or annual revolutions it would take to raise the the avg temp of the Earth 0.8 degrees Centigrade(1.4 degrees Fahrenheit). If the # of yrs is around 10, I would consider your explanation. I think you are right that the angular momentum of the Earth is decreasing and Earth's orbit is decreasing causing us to slowly move closer to the Sun causing some temperature increase but I need to know if that fact explains the magnitude of the temperature increase due to GW. Thanks! Why do you think it was inadvertent, I thought your Q dovetailed with this Q nicely and wanted to link the Q's w/o getting deleted.

As a general rule, when your trend depends that much on what your starting year is (1993 as opposed to 2000), you're not looking at enough data.

Think I'm wrong? *Would the question of gay marriage even come up in 1841? No *Now in 2010, we do not even debate the moral problem of slavery, all agree it is wrong.", 8680, "fL0wHyNNaa", 6],
	72438 : ["Neither one. It is heading towards a plutocracy. The rich have been bailed out over and over again. The Federal Reserve has bailed out banks that are \"too big to fail\" over and over again. After they failed, the US government bailed them out again. The Fed is bailing them out again as we speak. The Congress wants them to keep the Bush tax cut. After all, they are doing such a great job, and it isn't like we need revenue or anything..... The gap between the rich and the poor is increasing at an astronomical rate. When the economy grows, the rich get nearly all of the growth and the poor get pennies. When the poor complain about having a hard time making ends meet, they get smacked down by the supporters of the plutocracy. They only want to help the rich get richer. The poor could all become homeless for all they care. It is much more important to them that the rich get another million dollars in their pocket. The poor are wrong to complain about having a hard time making ends meet without government assistance, despite working two or three jobs in their view. Bailouts are not for the poor, only for the rich.", 8680, "7Am24jgsaa", 1],
