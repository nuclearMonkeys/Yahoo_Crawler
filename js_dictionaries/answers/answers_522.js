Wood's experiment from 100+ years ago was about GREENHOUSES, not about the atmosphere--claiming that it proves anything about the atmospheric greenhouse effect is a LIE.  Then he \"answers\" his question with some irrelevant whining by Roy Spencer. It has been well known that the RSS measurements were low and needed to be fixed, and they were. The satellite measurements, including Spencer's, are error prone and have had to be fixed numerous times since their inception. Regardless of that, every measure of global surface temperature has shown temperature rapidly rising this century. It is great that Yahoo Answers is shutting down. Ignorant liars like Solar Wind do not need a forum to spread their lies. Ignorance cannot be used as a long term excuse, and Solar Wind and other deniers have refused to learn a whit of science over their time here. Good riddance to their lies. \"The alarmist hockey stick graph temps have moved sideways for twenty years now.\" Are you on drugs? The Earth's temperature has risen extremely rapidly over the last 20 years. Even the UAH temperature shows this, although it is NOT a measure of surface temperature, it's too model-dependent and is very volatile.  Anyway, go ahead and look at the last 20 years, if you dare--you'll notice that the right (recent) side  of the graph is dominated by warmer than baseline temperatures and the cooler than baseline temperatures are mostly on the left.  In other words--YOU ARE LYING!!", 4518, "RhM1p6axaa", -3],

What I often say to people who complain of depression is this -  If you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow and the arrows were free, what would you say to someone who asked you, \"How many arrows do you want?\" You wouldn't say, \"Which is the best one?\" You'd say, \"How many can I have?\" I'll tell you about some arrows and you can discuss them with your therapist. I can't tell you exactly what you need. There's no one size fits all solution. I can tell you though that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. You're welcome to click on my name and read. Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods. Basically, therapy for phobias, explained in The Feeling Good Handbook by psychiatrist David Burns, is making a list of situations, ranking them according to how scary you find them, and using that ranked list as your objectives. Imagining a situation can be an objective. Start with something really, really easy. The thing to remember is never go from objective A to objective B until you feel completely confident with A. Things that give you confidence are experience and slow breathing. There's enormous laboratory and clinical evidence that slow breathing is effective for calming people down quickly. Two psychiatrists, Brown and Gerbarg, say a 10 or 20 min slow breathing exercise - 5 breaths a min - is good and 20 min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, 6 seconds each. This breathing thing is good for stress, and whatever is good for stress is good for depression -especially as preventative medicine.", 4520, "oc4ZyRBLaa", 1],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find.
