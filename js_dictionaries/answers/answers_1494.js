Plasma is a type of gas that when heated to certian tepurtures creates diffrent colors. Plasmas have deeper blacks and brighter more vibrent colors then any lcd tv by far. You will see a big diffrence in dark type scenes in movies and games. And bright scenes in movies and games like raceing games and stuff. The only downside to a plasma is the \"Burn in affect\" This is when a the plasma tv has one sill image on it its \"Burned\" into the display and there is always a dark shadow of that image. Like lets say your watching fox all the time and the FOX logo is on the bottem right hand corner. This could potentialy burn into the tv This all can be avoided.. and if it gets burned in there are ways to fixing it.

If they don't listen to the coach to begin with, in what way can they put the blame on coach. BCCI needs to tell the players to get in line, and give coach full command.

This was no big deal to stay with our version, but they stopped our program from being able to bill invoices by email (which was why I had updated to the version we use), I called headquarters and could not get anything changed. I think they need to have a class action suit for this type of trickery to make you update. We found a way around it, but that is no way to treat customers. I have had them since the the early 90's.

	80378 : ["Lets not get to technical or be one sided on the subject.  Both types (LCD and Plasma) will have a great picture quality.  Lets break this into simple categories.  (They are very different technologies.) Power Usage (energy consumption): LCD uses a constant power output and is rated lower than a Plasma.  However, Plasma technology does not have a constant power output.  The rating on a plasma is if you ran the TV with a white screen all day.  You would actually save power using a Plasma at the end of the day.  (for about the same time of usage, a Plasma will use about 2/3 as much power but really only equates to a few dollars extra a month on your bill) Picture Quality: Plasma is a different technology that allows for less motion blur and darker black levels.  This means you will see a better picture overall.  The downside that Plasma has is that it will usually have a reflection but they use a special type of screen to minimize this. Sound Quality: Typically, televisions are not designed to have great sound.  This should not be a factor when buying your TV. Price: Plasma over the years have come down in price a lot and they can be found to be cheaper than LCD televisions.  You should always shop around for a good deal and compare yourself. Weight: Plasma televisions are really heavy compared to a LCD television.  This is because the front screen is glass on a plasma and the LCD has a more fragile front screen. Screen Burn In: LCD does not suffer from this symptom very much.  Plasma is typically a temporary problem and is really only a concern early in its usage (first 100 hours).  At least Panasonic Plasmas have built in features to minimize this and a wiper (scrolling white bar) that is used to erase these problems.   Life Span: LCD and Plasma both have the same probability of breaking.  Newer Plasma televisions however have a longer half life (about 100,000) hours.  Half life is how much usage the TV has to go through to have HALF the brightness of the TV compared to when you purchased it. Personally, I prefer Plasma televisions but both will give you a great picture and you will not regret spending the money.  You should have enough info here to help decide.

	80382 : ["Can you use a normal HOB filter with a saltwater tank? Yes. I have a 125 gallon reef tank with a sump/refugium system but no HOB filter, and also have a 55 gallon seahorse tank with a HOB filter. Overall, my 125 gallon reef tank looks best full-time. My seahorse tank normally looks okay, but if I slack off on water changes, it is a true eyesore. You need to have plenty of filtration on these tanks. If you can replace the pumps on your filters to higher flow pumps, that'd be great. If you want to stick about 2-3 filters on one tank, that'd also be great. To give you an idea about water flow and filtration, I currently have a Powder Blue Tang in a 30 gallon quarantine tank. On this tank, I have a filter reccomended for a 25 gallon tank and also one for a 75 gallon tank---Enough filtration for a 100 gallon freshwater tank, all for a 30 gallon tank. There are some methods on taking a large size HOB filter, and modifying it to add in a better pump, and you can find them online.  The difference between salts is this: Some salts have some reef minerals that others don't. I use Instant Ocean Reef Crystals on my 125 gallon reef. But, it is a REEF tank, and requires those minerals that their reef crystals brand includes. Since reef crystals are much, much more expensive and will have no more positive effect than their other brand, I recommend you use Instant Ocean Sea Salt. It's the same stuff without the reef minerals and is much cheaper. Fish cost can be pretty expensive or cheap. In my honest opinion, easy fish are more expensive, and harder to keep fish are cheaper. This isn't always the case, and is just an opinion, so don't use this when choosing fish for your tank. Here is a list by a very trusted online vendor for fish:   . And, please, be honest about aquarium sizes. Follow the guidelines they give regarding aquarium sizes. Do NOT buy a fish for your aquarium that is simply too large---remember, fish grow. I hate seeing places like Petco market Regal Blue Tangs alongside Finding Nemo images, and sell them to parents planning to put them in 20 gallon aquariums for their kids. Don't think that because a fish is small and adorable now, you can put it in your tank. Fish like Regal Blue Tangs can grow to a foot in size, way too large for your tank. And, don't think that you can just sell it back, or give it away, because what happens if you can't sell it back or give it away? Also, always do research on a fish before you buy it. Don't make the mistake of an impulse buy, because normally buying a fish you know absolutely nothing about turns out bad. Best of luck to you.", 9023, "sHAi3hCMaa", 0],

	80390 : ["No one can say that LCD are better than plasma's. They can say I \"prefer\" LCD's over plasma's. But when it comes down to plain FACTS the plasma will always win. Every television's picture is going to be determined by a few main things. Resolution, contrast, veiwing angles, and response times. Besides resolution, the plasma will beat the LCD in all categories hands down. Resolution: Both types will offer the same resolutions, 720p and 1080p, so as far as picture clarity goes they will be equal. Contrast: Plasma- 40,000:1 Native contrast  LCD-5,000:1 Native contrast Veiwing angles: Just step to the side of any LCD and watch the color become washed out. With plasma's it'd be difficult to notice any difference, even from extreme angles. Response times: Plasma- 0.001ms response times  LCD- 2ms response times at the fastest (between 4-6ms response times are much more common, which can cause a trailing/ghosting effect with much fast-motion.) Burn-in is not an issue. Sure it's still possible to get brun-in on the newer models, but it's also POSSIBLE one of us will win the lotto..... Ok maybe the odds aren't as steep as that, but I would say it's like buying a scratcher and winning the grand prize for it. Glare is becoming an equal problem amongst both technologies. With LCD's trying to match the color depth that plasma's can provide, many brands have turned to a glossy finish on their screens which pick up as much, if not more glare, than their plasma counterparts. Also brands such as Panasonic have Anti-reflective filters and much brighter pictures which help combat glare greatly. Power consumption is pretty much equal now, its a non-issue. Life-expectancy actually tips in favor of plasma's now. There really is only one reason someone would choose LCD over plasma, and that is they like a brighter picture. And it's not that plasma's picture isnt bright enough, theyre more than bright enough. It's just that LCD's picture happens to be a little brighter. BUT there is a sacrifice to that brigtness, colors and blacks are much more washed out. So is it worth sacrificing all the benefits that plasma's offer over LCD's for a brighter picture? We're all entitled to our own opinion on the matter, but for me the answer is a definite NO. Get a Panasonic plasma.", 9024, "VSRMDT5caa", 2],
