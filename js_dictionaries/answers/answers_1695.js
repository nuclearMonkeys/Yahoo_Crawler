	90417 : ["Lincoln makes good book on welding. It is \"The Procedure Handbook Of Arc Welding\" (by Lincoln Electric) Or you could get \"Modern Welding\" (by Althouse/ Turnquist/ Bowditch). The latter book is hard to find but both are good to learn the principals of welding.  You won't learn welding itself from a book, it take practice and lots of it. Stick welding is good but hard to pick up as a beginner you have to deal with the slag left from the welding process it will weld through paint and rust. Mig is easier because you can see the weld with no flux or slag build up on the weld deposit, but the material being welded needs to be absolutely clean, no paint or rust. Gasless mig is junk! Fluxcore (gasless) mig was designed for gas but the \"hobby\" welders found that it could be used without gas. It is not as strong of a weld without gas as it will have porosity but when you add gas it is very good. Trailers are usually made of 1/8\" material or thicker so stick welding would work fine it is cheaper to get into than mig and with a lot of practice you can weld sheet metal. I know nothing about the cds on ebay and could not find what you were talking about, sorry. I would get a good mig machine (not the cheaper 110v machines). Stay with Miller, Hobart, Thermal arc and so on, or what ever good \"name brand\"you have in the U.K. they are more reliable and less frustrating. Here are some sites you may like and also try youtube enter the type of welding you want to look for they have many videos on there, Good luck!", 9360, "ZVtfLtUHaa", 0],

	90438 : ["Unfortunately, the wedding gift giving just does not stop, one is now expected for every event. Engagement parties, bachelorette parties, now  a present is expected for them, too. And you are right, it is all for the same occasion. If it were me, and and knowing people are splitting their budget between four or 5 gifts, I would yell stop! And tell those that are close to me to cool it, one or two, that is enough. Or get me something that costs next to no money, like a collection of tried and true recipes.  And I would want artisan gifts, I got a towel for   with a crochet border on it, you hang it up in the kitchen for pretty or handy purposes. I love it.  Traditionally, if the shower is for the bride, the present is for the bride. The gift  used to be something to decorate or stock up her household, something that only she would use. Occasionally, it would be something just for the bride, like her favorite perfume, or a basket with soaps and bubble baths. Since the bride did not have a household of her own, gift giving was easy. The gifts might have been hand crafted, or artistic, or creative, but were never expensive. That would have been rude, you did not show up at the shower with a Cuisinart, when everybody else gave artisan gifts..  Now fast forward to 2010, there are couples showers, where a present is expected for  both the bride and groom. Or the bride wants a lingerie shower. Or she already has a household, and only luxury items are on her/their registry list. And brides and grooms expect presents of the caliber of the wedding present. And brides do not want hand made artisan things.  So to answer your question, since the bride opens her shower presents at the shower, a present is expected, and will be noticed by everyone if one is not offered. And yes, a wedding present is expected too. Figure out your budget, and split it up between the presents.  Sneaky trick: some people spend the lion's share or all of the budget on the shower present, where people are there to ohh and ahh over it. And give the lesser gift, or no gift at all for the wedding, when maybe only the bride will see it.", 9357, "AA10927032", 2],

Since you are such close friends, it's possible it's a simple mistake or someone dropped your invitation on the way to the post office or it got delivered to the wrong address or who knows?! If this isn't a very small wedding and your friend normally understands basic etiquette, I'll bet it's a mistake. I would NOT make a big deal about it (even if you're hurt).

My thoughts will be with you on your wedding day and I can't wait to see the photos!\"     Whatever you do, don't be PETTY.   It's possible you might not be invited.

Let me know if you need anything, and if I don't see you before the big day, best wishes!\" If that's too passive aggressive or anxiety inducing, ask her mom or one of her bridesmaids to double check, phrase it the exact same way as in the email above, that you understand, but want to double check for their benefit.

When she switched high schools we were still VERY close but after we both went away to college, we basically stopped talking (but not because of fights or anything - we just slowly went our seperate ways and had new friends away at college). Now she is getting married and I hope to be within the next 1-2 years and, just like you, I am invited to her bridal shower this weekend, but not invited, personally, to the wedding. She is the daughter of our pastor (this will be relevant in a moment). She was talking to me last week about coming to her shower and (out of impulse, and it was an accident - I spoke without thinking) I said, oh, yeah, I wasn't invited to your wedding! (which is in 1 month). She said, oh, well everyone at our church is welcome to come, I thought you knew that and didn't need an invitation.  I went home thinking about it and started to get bitter because I realized that she wanted as many people as possible to come to the shower because she would get gifts but she didn't invite me because I'm just another \"mouth to feed\" or chair to reserve at her wedding and then I realized how far we have actually drifted. Like you, I was hurt and a bit angry about it for a few days until I realized.. what if it were me? Would I want a distant friend to isolate me during my time of joy and refuse to get me a bridal gift because they were not on my top list of attendees? No.. but it still seemed cruel. Although everything inside me tells me not to go to the bridal shower this weekend and not to get her a gift because she \"actually\" didn't invite me (she just saved face in a very quick response when confronted), I know that I really should go. We were once really great friends, like sisters, and just because time has come between us, doesn't mean I should begrudge her a gift on the happiest day of her life.  If I were you, I'd put her on your list. I wouldn't give her any VIP treatment or anything, just treat her as all your normal guests, but don't strike back because you weren't invited to your wedding. I'm sure you know that weddings can be quite expensive and maybe because of the time between you two, she would have rather spent the money on a guest who she has been spending more time with RECENTLY. I know that hurts as well but just try to be positive, put her on your list of guests if your budget allows and then just forget about the whole thing.
