Fasting is not healthy and your parents are right about it.  New converts are first taught the “beauties of islam”. They are told that islam is a religion, a religion of peace, of equality and worship of a single God. They are led to believe that islam is accepting of other religions, especially Judaism and Christianity that are monotheistic, and only disagrees with the believers of these religions in that they have corrupted their faith. They are then led to believe that islam is the only religion that has not been contaminated. Because of that it is the only religion accepted by God. Those who do not believe in islam reject the truth (deny God) and are doomed sinners. Eventually they are old that Isa and Musa of the quran are not the same as Jesus and Moses of the Bible. New converts gradually come to think of people of other faiths as the enemies of allah and will start to hate them actively. Then they are taught that only muslims are brothers to each other and that everyone else is out there trying to “get them”. Jesus or Mohammed. Of the two Jesus performed many public miracles with a multitude of witnesses, acknowledged that he was God, raised the dead, was himself raised from death on the third day, said he would be our ultimate Judge and said that no one comes to the Father except through him. There is a wealth of historical documentation from contemporaries (in the New Testament) and near-contemporaries of Jesus (Early Church Fathers and others) supporting these biblical claims. Mohammed, according to his authoritative apologists, did nothing comparable to these things. Of the two, then – Jesus or Mohammed: 1.  Which one would seem more credible in his claim that he spoke on behalf of the Almighty Creator? 2.  Which one would seem to be in the best position to keep his promises to us in the hereafter? @Sara Apples - since when is islam a race? Not racism - just honesty.", 10835, "None", -8],

However, when the first man and woman disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden, they lost that nature, and took on the nature of sin. From then on all of mankind multiplied in that same nature. Hence, we are all sinners.  You see, we are not sinners, because we've sinned. Rather, we are sinners, because it is our nature, and for this reason we all have the tendency to sin. Making us slaves to sin. This is why Jesus Christ gave His life for us on the cross paying the debt sin brought onto us all. Because of His sacrifice, we all have the opportunity to be spiritually reborn, restoring us back to our originally intended nature...bearing once again the image and likeness of God in the earth.

And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\" Satan IS the master liar !

The meaning: I have given you this title; I have conferred on you an appellation which indicates a greater nearness to God than any other which is bestowed on men - an appellation which implies that you are God's representatives on earth, and that your decision is, in an important sense, to be regarded as his. And all of you are children of the Most High - Sons of God. That is, You occupy a rank which makes it proper that you should be regarded as his sons. Overall Psalm 82 means: We find God assuming the government into His own hands. He had set up authority in the earth and especially in Israel. Directed by His word in judgment and armed with His authority, the judges in Israel had born the name of God (Elohim). But none would understand or deal righteously. All the foundations of the earth were out of course. All magistrates had received power and authority of God — the Jewish, His word also; but even these would not know or understand. They were men, and would die like men, and fall like one of the uncircumcised princes of this world. God who had given the authority judged among the gods He must have righteousness.

While the word “tradition” is frequently used in contrast to Bible truth handed down in writing, it is not limited to such precepts.

This is the reason we can have all kinds of churches with different forms of worship -- for instance you can sing the Doxology if you want to, but you don't have to.
