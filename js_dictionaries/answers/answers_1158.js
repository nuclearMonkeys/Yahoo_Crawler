Vengeance?  That is extreme.  But, from what I understand, if God allowed such, it was because those people were unrepentant and violent.  Even if it was Isreal, because they were also quite stubborn at times.  That was back in the Old Testament when judgement was severe and final.  Like Sodom and Gomorrah.

	63400 : ["DID evolution occur?? Just look at the fossil record. How much more proof do you need? Science continually revises and improves on previous theories because new advances in technology allow us to study these theories with greater detail.  But I have yet to hear of any modern scientific discoveries that completely turn darwinism on its head. Only an open-minded individual would analyze the evidence, connect the dots and come to the logical conclusion that evolution is the correct 'theory'", 8202, "ZyKMnfpoaa", 1],
	63401 : ["No...what YOU don't seem to get, is that people who understand and accept the theory of evolution have perfectly open minds.  Our minds are open to ANYTHING, as long as it has some evidence to back it up.   Not accepting someone else's claim that God \"made\" evolution, isn't because our minds are closed, it's because there is NO evidence to suggest that such a thing as \"God\" even exists.  If the day comes that there is some evidence to show for it, then we will accept it. If you want to believe that \"God\" guided evolution, or that \"God\" MADE it happen, then fine.  But we are not going to accept that as a fact, or even add it to the theory of evolution as a possibility, until there is some evidence to show for it.  It's just the same as we wouldn't add someone else's belief that evolution was guided by aliens, or that a magical invisible sky gnomes \"made\" us. The theory of evolution is based on observable evidence, not on conjecture based on religious beliefs, wishful thinking, or \"I don't understand how ELSE it could have happened, so a magical being must have done it!\" Sure, maybe there was a magical being involved.  But we're not going to include it in our discussions with any level of seriousness until we see some evidence for the magical being.", 8202, "7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa", -1],
	63402 : ["First of all, evolutionary biologists are called biologists, not \"Darwinists\".  \"Darwinism\" is a philosophy from Herbert Spencer, not a science from Charles Darwin. Quit deluding yourself into thinking that scientists view evolution as unquestioned dogma.  It's you, the religious zealots, who claim to have the unquestioned dogma, not scientists.   Evolution is certainly open to debate, as is gravitational theory and the periodic table.  But so far nobody has been able to come up with any good counter-evidence to these things.  All I've seen are weak attacks from creationists that are based on dishonest and fallacious misrepresentations on what evolution is.   Unlike creationism, evolution is a science and there are hypothetical situations that could potentially falsify it.  If somebody were to find a poodle skeleton radioactively dated to be 1 billion years old, or fish that give birth to rabbits, or foxes spontaneously generating from quartz, then you'd have something.  Alas, nothing like that has been presented.  And if it does, it will end up coming from a scientist, not some armchair theologian. >>“ Did man evolve from ape-like creatures?” Yes.  The information is out there if you bother to go look for it.  Funny how biologists like Ken Miller are also Christians and don't find evolution to be a threat to their faith.

No just the animals of the region in my opinion. But many other peoples have flood hero's also its likely that god had people in other parts of the world doing what Noah did.the bible only speaks of the 8 that went on to become isreal did Noah go to the north pole to round up polar bears?

	63420 : ["Psalms 137:9 \"Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.\" \"So this sounds so course and hard, but it is detailed in Isaiah 13:16-18; \"Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.\" 17 \"Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.\" 18 \"Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.\" Historically it was the Medes that did this to Babylon. We have one rock that we are to stand on, but what are the stones that shall not spare the children of Israel? It is God that will sling the stones that will end this earth age, and look at the true value of that is said, for there is not regard to silver or gold, for God created it all, and men cannot buy their way out of the vengeance that shall come on this world to end this earth age. The men and women of this earth age are going to find out the hard way that God is real, alive and the Rock that can crush anything that they put against Him. There needs to be no more said, for that system will be destroyed.\"", 8204, "AA12056343", -1],
	63421 : ["Not all the Psalms are in praise of God!  This one (\"By the waters of Babylon\") is a bitter lament spoken by one of the people who have been dragged away from their home after seeing Jerusalem destroyed and their children, evidently, killed that same way.  Now they're being asked to sing an entertaining song for their captors!  This Psalm is probably the song they would LIKE to sing.  It seems that their grief is too fresh for them to forgive those who have treated them so terribly, and they can only wish for someone to do to those people what they have done to the Israelites.   You may notice that when this Psalm is on a daily schedule of readings, the last verses are optional.", 8204, "R5UIMBvcaa", 1],

	63423 : ["\"How much contrary evidence must exist?\" I'd say 51% is a nice figure, wouldn't you? Better get to work. You have a LOT to do. BTW, just a thought, you might just try to propose an alternate theory which explains the ocean of facts explained by the theory of evolution. You can't really expect anyone to change their minds without a viable option, can you? Also, we welcome RATIONAL critical examination and evaluation. There a difference. Saying \"Goddidit\" is not a reasonable examination or evaluation, nor is it a viable alternative theory. Until you have something better to offer than that, you will not be taken seriously. In order to seriously debate something, you must first have a genuine logical position, and verifiable facts with which to refute the other side's position. What exactly IS your position anyway? You never said. Please provide the logical and coherent alternative theory which you believe washes away the ocean of facts explained by our preposterous theory and provide the irrefutable and voluminous evidence in support of said viable scientific theory...

	63424 : [".................there are no words in the English language to describe how I feel. why is it you God wads always assume evolution and creation are mutually exclusive? it is possible to believe in creationism AND evolution, the simple answer: God made the microbes that eventually evolved into modern life. it says right in the bible \"let the Earth bear forth all creatures\" in my opinion, that means he wanted Earth to create it's own people, he merely planted the seed, then he let it grow on it's own. and you're not going to see the question “DID evolution occur?” for the same reasons you'll never see \"is gravity real?\" and \"is the earth flat?\" because we've already got past the point of knowing it's real, now we're seeing exactly how it happened.", 8202, "CHwnDp3Caa", -1],
