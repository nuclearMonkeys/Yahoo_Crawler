	100044 : ["So here are 6 steps to the easiest free way to make money online 1) DECIDE ON WHAT TO SELL Of course, to make money online you've got to have a product or service. You need to know what you're going to sell. You might focus on selling one product, or a range of different products. Strike an arrangement where you are selling something that you are passionate, yet has a hungry market looking to buy what you may have to offer. There's no profits in selling solar powered flashlight, for instance, even if it were your passion. 2) CHOOSE A VEHICLE TO SELL YOUR PRODUCT If you're serious about your online business, than you'll need to get a website. However, you can still be successful with your own online business even without a website. You might choose to use a free blogging platform such as blogger.com or even sell your products on ebay.com. And if you are an affiliate, than you don't need a site at all. As an affiliate, your primary goal to get visitors to your affiliate link. So theoretically, you can still be successful with an online business by simply directing traffic to an affiliate weblink. I personally prefer to have my own site, so that I can capture email addresses, build a relationship with my subscriber, and sell multiple products and / or services to them. 3) GET A FOLLOW UP SYSTEM If you have a site, you're going to need to collect email addresses. For this, you'll need an autoresponder which help to follow up on your prospect morning and night, 365 days out of the year. It's been said that the average purchaser buys after an average of 7 follow-up calls or letters. So follow-up is a very important part of running a successful online business. Why not automate it with the help of an autoresponder. 4) GET TRAFFIC Without traffic, your website is as good as 5 star restaurant in the middle of desert. In other words, you may have the best products or services on earth, but if there are no roads to your site, you'll get no visitors. Without visitors, your business is on the fast track to failure. I've personally found that press release, articles, solo ads to ezines, and JV email partners work best at getting traffic. Experiment for your self to see which one works best for you. Which brings me to my next point... 5) TRACK EVERYTHING With steps 1-4 in place, you must now track and test everything little thing you do. By tracking and testing, you'll be able to hone in on what produces the most amounts of profit for you. You'll also be able to quickly see the duds in terms of your marketing efforts, and drop those quickly by the waist side. 6) ALLOW ROOM FOR MISTAKES Remember, you are sure to falter and fail at times. But each failure is what ultimately moves you in the direction of success, if you'll stop and earnestly look at what really works in your business.", 9721, "None", 0],

When you sign up for the survey sites (The links are below), then all you have to do is take online surveys and you can get paid up to 10 dollars per survey. Most surveys are relatively easy and interesting 	 	1. Opinion Outpost -      This is my favorite site to take surveys with. The surveys are easy, they pay well, and it is very easy to cash out. They send you checks straight to your house. So far I have made the most money with this site. 	2. SurveySavvy -  This is my 2nd favorite site to take surveys with. It is a very professional site. The surveys are infrequent, but when you get them, they pay a lot (usually 5 or 6 dollars). I have made over a hundred dollars using this site. 	3. Global Opinion Panels -  This site is very professional. They have a very good referral program too. I have made over 15o dollars with this site. 4. My Survey -  I have also made a lot of money on this site too. There are a lot of opportunities to take surveys, so you can pick and choose which ones you want to take. I really like this site. Surf the Web – You can get paid to surf the web. This site will pay you to use their service as a search engine. Swagbucks -  Swagbucks will pay you to surf the web. It is kind of like getting paid to search Google. You get points whenever you use Swagbucks to search the internet. Swagbucks gets its search results from Google, so it is very reliable. I have gotten 3 iTunes gift cars from this site already. It is very easy and user friendly. There is a great referral program. Read Emails – These sites will send you emails, and whenever you read them you earn points or money for doing so. These sites send a lot of emails, so set up a junk email account (Gmail is easy to set up) Inbox Dollars -  This is a good site for reading emails. They send 10 – 20 emails a day. You get 2 cents per email you read, and 5 cents once you reach your first payout (It sounds like it is not much, but it adds up very quickly). You also get paid on this site to try free trials of products if you want. My Points -  This site is very good. You get points in which you can redeem for gift certificates. They will give you about 5 cents per email you read. It is very easy to accumulate points. You can also earn money by trying free trials of products (much like Inbox Dollars). Share Pictures 	Share A Pic -  	This site allows you to upload your own pictures to their site and you get paid whenever people look at your pictures. It is very easy to do. The pay rate is very high. If you are a good photographer and you have a lot of pictures, it is very easy to make money with this site.", 9721, "bkREuSXDaa", 0],
