	33310 : ["That would probably be a waste of money.  Antonio Brown was alright on the field last year but not elite, and his off the field antics can be hard to deal with.  They could possibly offer a small one-year deal with good incentives and see how things go. Their passing attack was doing just fine before Prescott was hurt.  They need to focus on defense - stopping the run, getting off of the field on 3rd down.  They just spent a boatload of money on their QB, they need to be super efficient with the rest of their spending if they want to have a chance at making some progress this year - a Super Bowl is probably out of the question. Prescott shouldn't be in a position to demand anything.  He's used what superstar capitol he had to spend getting that massive contract.  But if something seems like a bad idea and a massive waste, Jerry Jones will probably give it serious consideration.", 5078, "oZkGVsMDaa", 3],

	33313 : ["Blackburn Rovers are still the title holders, with Leicester not far behind.

I hope they don't win the CL,  but if they do - they still can't count to six ^_^ no club in England has won the CL 6 times but us.   that make us amongst the European Elites.

	33332 : ["lol, sry man, well to cut a massively long story short, basically because the rules are being schematically imho deviously changed to promote more goals in games...i laugh because it's getting to be ridiculous, and the most ludicrous part of all this is VAR get's the blame, even though VAR is simply an instrument, it can't make any decisions..not 1. Edit @Adam.  Well i hear it's not changing \"back\" next season as such, rather each incident will be  looked at  seperately and make the best choice in that particular situation with logic, but it won't work, because  it needs a basis something that is relevant to make the decision, like hand to ball, ball to hand....but they have other ideas..p Football one game ONE name LFCYNWA", 5067, "UY8ny1vFaa", 0],

LFCYNWA edit i was bit stoned when i posted this..only a few answers but all sensible answers.  @August,  hang on a sec, i remember distinctly, you were not  positive about Bielsa, and i know that was an honest opinion at the time, you've changed your tune...p Footbal one game ONE name .", 5075, "UY8ny1vFaa", 0],

You can't blame the ref here he wouldn't have seen that cross the line we can only tell for sure from the replays. Linesmen probably couldn't tell for sure either and the attacker is going to claim the goal whether it was in or not. The lack of VAR here is ridiculous. In general too in all these qualifiers there have been a few incidents now. My own team as well Ireland should have had a pen vs Serbia and badly needed it LOL. They need VAR asap I know it's a bit unfair to bring it in 4 games into qualifying but we badly need it.  Of course then they'll bring it in but not use it correctly 🙄.
