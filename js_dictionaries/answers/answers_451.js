When he dines in at restaurants, he is genuinely nice to the waiters, which is something not a lot of celebrities do. He's very,,, assertive however, when it comes to chefs that cook food for people in a dirty or unsafe way. When it comes to the well-being of others, I think Gordon has every right to be a bit anal. Although I think kitchen nightmares is staged, when people undercook food or make food in a dirty kitchen, they should get smoked by Gordon Ramsey. When he isn't working on Kitchen Nightmares, he is very down to earth. He is nice to the children on cooking shows, and he seems chill on his home cooking shows. I", 3912, "6S4HKW85aa", 0],

I can think of one good one - if someone gets SSI (supplemental security income which is a federal welfare program) they might want to hide resources.  People on SSI aren't eligible if their resources are $2000 if single or $3000 if married. Another good reason - hiding assets from a spouse you are planning on divorcing.
