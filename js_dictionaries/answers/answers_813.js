Cut off at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) around and below the moldy spot. ... These molds are safe for healthy adults to eat.", 6489, "JAKVhrHRaa", 2],
	45253 : ["The answer is yes. And if it's just surface mold, I have seen chefs wash it off with vinegar and use it. But in the interest of not wasting food, consider buying a vacuum sealing machine. I bought a two pound block of cheddar three months ago, and only needed to use half of it (sandwich slices). I cut it in half, and sealed the unused half with my Food Saver. It's still in my fridge, mold free, and ready to use. We also use the machine to re-seal bags of snacks (especially chips) and staples like brown and powdered sugar. As you are cooking for one, it's easy to vac and freeze the portions of a package you would not consume in a timely manner.  Honestly, I have cooked and enjoyed ribeye steak that was packaged three years previously (in the freezer of our seasonal home). I think it would work for you.", 6489, "98lD3z68aa", 0],
	45254 : ["I've eaten expired cheese, not moldy just expired.  Unless it's something like bleu cheese or gorgonzola that is sold in insured grocery chains, I WOULD NEVER CUT THE MOLD OFF CHEESE OR ANYTHING AND PROCEED TO EAT IT, NOR WOULD I EVER ADVISE IT.  Just the other night, I drank some apple juice that was 14 months past the expiration date.  It didn't smell or look bad but it definitely left me feeling bad and sick later that night.     ", 6489, "TB5ZQPOnaa", -1],

Just like I don't do diet sodas, low fat snacks, fake bacon, margarine, sugar substitutes, etc.  I like to eat real, healthy food and indulge when it's appropriate. I saw some of that vegetable stuff that looks like raw ground meat and it was terrifying.  It really did look like hamburger (which I might cook for my dogs but don't eat myself).  They are doing whatever it takes to make something look like meat which means they are NOT paying attention to making it healthy and balanced. Real food has nutrients in useful and not entirely understood relationships.  By real food I mean an apple. A sweet potato.  A bunch of chard.  A piece of good quality beef or chicken.  A stick of butter.  A carton of milk.  The less that is done to food the better, and if things need to be done to it do it yourself so you understand what has been done to the food before you consumed it.   A plastic package of stuff that looks like raw ground beef but isn't even a meat product?  SHUDDER.  I can't even imagine what it would take to make that happen.", 6501, "09c8f2aa42f6255f80371d12edbfa7f6aa", 2],

It's much more convenient to let animals eat the vegetables and then we eat the animals that's just the way it works.  It is apparent by looking at people's teeth that we are not vegans or vegetarians were omnivores.
