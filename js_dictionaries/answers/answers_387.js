From 2002 to 2012 only 16 people died from flying in hot air balloons.

	21086 : ["Why do the opinions of total strangers matter? I have a friend whose first job as commercial pilot was for a cargo airline.  He had a much busier schedule than many passenger airline pilots as many flights were very short hops indeed and into a very wide variety of airports, many of which “meat shifters” never get to see. Unlike his “meat shifter” colleagues, he'd also frequently have to physically assist with loading and unloading cargo.  He gained loads of flight hours on a wide variety of aeroplane types in a very short time so got promoted to Captain far more quickly than if he'd been a First Officer with a passenger airline. He's since moved on to a passenger airline for the higher pay but now is back flying cargo. COVID-19 has meant that most passenger airline flight crews are now virtually jobless due to so few flights, and many airlines are laying off staff. But cargo flights have continued and demand has even increased.  Rick has observed that cargo pilots moving to passenger flights find it really easy, but that pilots who have always flown passengers find that switching to the demands of cargo flying which is also often well away from any form of controlled airspace is just too stressful for them. So if you insist upon a non-factual opinion: they work very hard and earn every penny. ", 3435, "gjUpsUZAaa", 3],
	21087 : ["When the 747 came out the trend in aviation was a hub and spoke airport system.   They also had fewer flights each day so a great big plane going hub to hub made sense.   Today the trend is for more frequent flights with smaller planes and more direct flights bypassing the hub.   For that the airlines are going with smaller high efficiency designs.   The A380 would have been a great competitor of the 747 when it came out but now it is way too late.   Only some of the big international carriers are buying it.   ", 3436, "54wo5oZhaa", 0],

	21090 : ["No, that would not be a smart approach. Swiveling a nose that supports the engine means that the physical link between the engine and the rest of the aircraft would rely on a hinge which is not that strong, unless it is beefed-up, leading to an overly heavy design.", 3437, "aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa", 4],
	21091 : ["A prop at the front PULLS the plane.  So there would be considerable strain on the hinge and locks on the cargo door.   If you do not get the door closed properly it could simply pull open.   I would NOT design it that way as it is a design that adds additional risk for no reason.  ", 3437, "54wo5oZhaa", 1],

A airline pilot had better be real good at being a aircraft mechanic- they are expected to walk the craft down and spot what is unsafe or not fixed right.
