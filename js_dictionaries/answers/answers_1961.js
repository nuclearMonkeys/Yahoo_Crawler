	103827 : ["I've posted this before, but it should provide you with a some help. The components of a \"banging\" car sound system would be as follows: The source (cd player, in-dash dvd/nav system, radio, tape player, etc.), the speakers, the subs, the amps, the parts/wiring. Also, depending on how big of a system, possibly a new battery or two and an alternator. Here are some of my recommendations as far as good brands. Deck: Eclipse, Pioneer (regular or premier), Alpine, Kenwood Excelon, Nakamichi (not the greatest looking, but great sound). Speakers: Polk Audio, Infinity, Eclipse, Pioneer Rev High end: Focal, Boston, MB Quart, Nakamichi Subs: JL Audio, MTX, Kicker, Eclipse, Audiobahn, Memphis, Hifonics, Diamond Audio, Fosgate (p3 and higher) Amps: all the sub companies, plus, Precision Power, Crossfire, Cadence, Soundstream Parts/Wiring: Monster, Tsunami, Streetwires, even Kicker and Fosgate make decent parts/wiring. Now if I had to choose, here would be my choices:  Deck: Eclipse or Pioneer  Speakers: Polk Audio, Infinity, or Eclipse  Amps/Subs: JL Audio or MTX  Wiring: Tsunami or Monster. But in the end these are just my recommendations (based on quality and sound), like Sparky said only you can judge what you like. Everyone's ears are a little different so what sounds good to me may not sound good to you. Shop around at all the car audio dealers and take a listen, but make sure you take one of your cds with you so you can judge all of them with the same song (one that you are familiar with).", 9864, "c7e2bebb9264667afe559cb1fcf42801aa", -1],

Most drugstores will allow you to return cosmetics you try and don't like - you have to keep the receipt.   As for keeping feet soft and supple, it's a question of moisture.  You should use a heavy cream.  Look in the drugstore for Eucerin and similar products located near it.  Before be, give your feet a good scrubbing - try an apricot scrub to exfoliate the skin.  Then slather on the cream.  Put on a pair of socks over the cream.  This should do the trick.  You may find you don't need to do this every night.", 9858, "01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa", 1],

Their huge eggs are a great source of nutrition and a single one can feed a village, so they are a constant target by human hunters. Foraging for elephant eggs is very risky, as the mothers rarely stray far from the nest, and you would not want to be face to face with an angry elephant mother.", 9857, "None", 0],
