	65113 : ["Your expression \"today's feminism\" is meaningless.  There is no unified philosophy behind feminism. Feminism has always been an arbitrary term to describe any bigoted male/female stereotyping by females.   Whilst it is true that there are significant differences in the average and range of men and women's mental and physical capabilities, it is also true that there is a huge amount of overlapping. The average analytical ability of men and women is almost identical, but there both more male geniuses and more male idiots. It is also possible to be good at doing a job using different methods. For example women working for banks perform equally as well as men at making investment decisions over the long term, by adopting a lower risk strategy. In physical jobs, men's greater strength can be matched by women's stamina and males precision can be matched by females greater attention span.  Most operations require a team of individuals that have different skills. Even the military has recognised that it is advantageous to use women in most units, particularly in observation and communication work. During the Battle of Britain most British radar scopes were operated by women as they usually outperformed the men at holding their concentration for long periods. Had Hitler mobilised German women into his factories as the Russians and Allies did, the increased production would almost certainly have won the Nazi's the war.  For these reason's I do not accept that there is any biological reason prevent women have equal opportunities to men. My issue with feminists is that they they don't in fact want equality for women, they want superiority. Laws passed by the feminists in the New labour government gave women the right to join a company without informing the employer that they were pregnant, then immediately go on paid maternity leave. The woman can now hold a company to ransom for a year, not knowing if  she has any intention of ever working for them. She can benefit from pay that she may never have any intention of working for, whilst depriving someone else from a job and forcing the employer to use temporary staff. Such laws are harmful to both to employers and to young women. All manager's of small and medium size businesses will be far more likely to discriminate against young female job applicants because of the increased risks. Feminists have forced most exclusively male organisations into excepting women and girls and into  changing their names, whilst's women insist on retaining exclusivity for identical female groups. If it is legitimate for women to have sanctuary from men, then the opposite must also be true.", 8288, "dKi2R2oHaa", 1],
	65114 : ["Yes, actually I was listening to a man this morning complaining about feminist movement going too far in America to the point that, children come first, then women then the men's rights are last. I definately do support women's rights in that no man has a right to use physical movement against a woman and no job has the right to refuse to recruit married women because of their 'likeliness' to get pregnant. However, i sometimes view it in that, men were created differently, so jobs are actually a priority for them as opposed to a woman because women give birth to babies and are more subjected to spending and priopritising their time for their children and home. But men don't have that, yes they should priopritise their time for children but to an extent because they literally live to work hard and finance the family. For those who think that men and women are 'both' supposed to spend equal amount of time with their children that's ridiculously not true because, general knowledge, women are the one's who 'need' to spend more time with their children and who understand them more than anyone else. Hence why in Islam it is the mother that comes first, then what? the mother, then what? the mother then what? the father...there's obvious deep meaning in that. I myself, am used to my mother looking after me more than my father. Statistically, even those in so called 'feminist' countries i.e. the West, women tend to spend more time in their homes and doing chores than women. Not because they're lacking rights, but they're following a natural trend to their creation.  Last of all though, we must never forget that there are always exceptions, some women work whilst men stay at home and look after children, I think people need to respect that way of life as much as we respect our ownselves , unfortunately though, in some cultures, people who do that are frowned upon. So it comes this way and that but i absolutely agree with you, modern feminism does not work with Islam and science.", 8288, "Xjekjqmqaa", -1],

For example I recently built a PC for electromagnetic simulation at uni, in this case I wanted lots of ram (I built it with 48GB but it may get upgraded if larger modules become available at a reasonable price) and I wanted to avoid the expensive and hot running FBDIMMs, CPU power was a secondry objective but I still wanted it decently high so I ended up with a system built arround an intel S5520SC and 2.4 GHz processors (fastest that would fit in the budget I had).  Other times performance per core is more important, last time this was the case (a box I was going to use for FPGA work) I went for the fastest core 2 duo dell offered in the range I'd picked (I didn't want to be bothered building a machine at the time), the range was picked for it's support for 8GB of ram (FPGA work is not as memory hungry as electromagnetics simulation but ram is still important).

RAM works sort of in conjunction with the processor so if you have a fast processor, you will want to increase the RAM to help boost the speed.

If you are still running XP, 1GB will be more than enough to keep you happy. Windows 7 is even bigger than Vista, so now you will see up to 12 GB of RAM available in home systems. No normal user - even gamers, will really need this much RAM.
