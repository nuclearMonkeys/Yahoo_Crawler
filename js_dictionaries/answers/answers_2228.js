And when you shut off the engine, and go to start it again, it does the same, and it does this all the time. That is normal, what happening is that when you turn the key to the \"On\" position, all the caustion lights should light up, this shows you that the lights themselfs work, so that if something does go wrong, you know the light will light up. As long as that light does not come on while the engine is runing, you are ok. If I have misunderstood you, please consult your local ASE certified mechanic and have him pull the code if the light comes on during operation of the vehicle, or if you feel that there may be an issue. The vehicle running fine is not any reason to believe there is nothing wrong. I hope this helps, Good Luck.", 10493, "None", 0],

If something elementary, you also could have the kept codes deleted (thereby turning off the verify engine ordinary). stress round somewhat with the ordinary off, and if the project comes again, it will relight the verify engine ordinary, if no longer, you're ok. driving round isn't what resets the verify engine ordinary... some autos, if a short and in no way significant issue, after 3-4 restarts and the project would not reoccur the ordinary will flow out by technique of itself. note that once you've the codes deleted, or you make certain to disconnect the 12v battery for a couple of minutes to bathe the codes, that the vehicle's pc(s) will note that the computers are literally not waiting. you usually favor to emphasise round for yet another 2 hundred miles or so before the vehicle will be waiting again. that is significant to understand if you're only attempting to get rid of the ordinary for a state protection/emissions try.", 10493, "N4owIYkSaa", 0],
