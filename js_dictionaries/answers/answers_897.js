	49903 : ["It could be because in order to be an authorized Nikon dealer, you must buy a certain amount of products, and you must buy certain products, too.  The owner may feel that Nikon products don't sell as well or the terms were not acceptable. Also, if there's a big box store like a Best Buy or Costco nearby, they're likely to have better prices since those stores can buy more product.  If you buy larger amounts of product, you get a lower price.  This hurts the little mom & pop stores and forces them to carry product that is not in those stores.", 6990, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],
	49904 : ["The issues you report are as follows: 1) Sharpness/crispness - This is caused by the lens not the body.  The 75-300 is known to be a rather lackluster lens in both its optical quality and its autofocusing speed.  You can compare sharpness, bokeh, distortion of lenses at opticallimits.com.  I would look at any of the 70-200 f/2.8 models available on the used/new market.  Even an old Canon 70-200 f/2.8L (v1) would be significantly better than the 75-300. 2) AF Lag:  While the 75-300 is not a speed demon in AF world, AF speed is a product of both the lens and the body.  If you're okay with the AF speed of your other lenses, then you know the issue you are having is with the lens and not the body.  If not, which wouldn't surprise me, you need to move up to a body that is design for sports/wildlife such as the 7D. 3) Can't take pictures at night because the quality is bad.  I agree, having to use an in-camera flash produces harsh, ugly light.  You can greatly improve your flash shots by using an external flash along with a light modifier that softens the light.  An example would be Randy Fong diffuser, a Lumiquest, or a Vello.  These diffusers greatly reduce the harshness of light emitted from an on-camera flash.  The results are much more pleasing than direct light. The only way a body will produce better natural-lit scenes for you (since Canon doesn't make a DSLR with IBIS) is by having better high-ISO performance.  The following link will allow you to compare the ISO performance of various bodies:  If you get a lens with stabilization, this will allow for a longer shutter speed at a reduced ISO.  However, if your subjects are moving too much, you will still get motion blur.  Having a body with in-body image stabilization (IBIS) will allow you to use any lens and still get 3-6 stops of stabilization.  Look at the new R5 or R6 instead of a DSLR.", 7001, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],

	49909 : ["Battery HAS TO BE LOAD TESTED.  Wal~mart does an electrical check for $20 and they check alternator output, starter current draw, battery load test and for electrical shorts.  (So they do the whole thing).  There is no SENSOR.   Usually the battery is shot. Lucky for you, you can buy a replacement battery right there at Wally's.  And it is the lowest price in town. .   04 is hardly any years on the starter. I expect that to be good. .  Battery clamps are not on properly(tight).  If you can wiggle off the clamp by hand, then it ain't on tight. . Honda is a good car so it is the BATTERY. always BLAME the battery first. .  Even new batteries are faulty.  A load test will determine if the battery is any good.  They who sold you the battery SHOULD DO THIS TEST FOR FREE as they get paid by the Battery manufacturer and replacement is FREE.  It is not an air sensor thing. You do not have power when you are jumping the car THE NEXT DAY. .  Idling the car for 30 minutes does not charge the battery.  That just wastes gas.  Are you a short distance driver, shutting the car off at each stop? Like Pizza delivery? Sometimes going just a mile to make a delivery?  At night? Then part of the power of running goes to headlights and part goes to battery.  A starter eats up  400Amps of power from the battery (think of it like a Big GULP drink) Every time you use the starter to start the car a BIG GULP of power is taken out of the battery.  Now the alternator P's in a thin weak stream of power to refill the battery(except the headlights take away some of that stream of electricity to turn on the lights, so the power to the battery is piddly....maybe 10 amps(or less) per hour.  But in that time you have made 2 more stop/starts.  The battery when new may hold enough for 20 of those before it is dead(you drank all the liquid out of the big Gulp and the refill process can NOT catch up. So it could be all your fault and the way you drive. 35+ years mechanic", 7025, "None", 0],

	49911 : ["You need the memory card to see any of the images that are stored on it.                   Some cameras have a SMALL internal memory  that will store maybe 12 to 50 images;  others have none at all.   ", 7019, "QsplrZaTaa", 3],
	49912 : ["No, the memory card is the only thing that stored the pictures; where it goes, so do the photos.  It's like asking if you take a roll of exposed film out of a film camera, is there was a way to put a new roll in the camera and get the photos back that were on the old roll that was thrown out.  Obviously, the answer is no, sorry. Instead of the camera, I would look on your gran's computer or facebook account.  The memory card in these cameras were not intended to be used for long-term storage of data.  It's far, far more likely that the images are on some other device like a laptop or desktop computer. By the way, for clarity, the camera isn't a Nixon, it's a Nikon. ", 7019, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
