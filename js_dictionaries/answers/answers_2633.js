Hogan and Bischoff have done nothing wrong Scott Hall and Sean Waltman  are sign to short term contracts. because Kevin Nash was against bringing  them into the company and made it known to Dixie Carter he is not responsible for them. so she listen to be safe the only thing she has done is sign Jeff Hardy and Ric Flair to long term contracts  which is a smart move  Sure TNA change the Six Sided ring that some fans. but the talent on the roster wasn't against    this move and they are the ones who going to be wrestling in it every week. right now  I don't know if Mick Foley is leaving the company yet most likely will unless he decides to stay. bottom line Is yes last sundays Genesis PPV was disappointing  but I've seen worse  BTW TNA Victory Road PPV from last year which showed why TNA needed to change.

	137513 : ["Overall Card...10/10 This is really an amazing show, I'll go into great detail since you go into great detail on all of your answers, and I feel as if you really need an amazing answer as you give other users almost all the time. E&C Connection vs Rob Van Dam in a Tables, Ladders, Chairs match would be an amazing moment in the history of wrestling. Imagine another spear that Edge could deliver as he did at WrestleMania 17 from off the ladder. Or, a Frog Splash off of a ladder, it would be an instant classic. I believe Jeff and Rob would have to pull the win out in this match. The 5 on 5 diva match would be dominated by Gail Kim if it was judged by wrestling ability. She would get the win for her team by eliminating Team Knockout single handedly. Bryan Danielson vs Desmond would be an amazing match. Both going upon wrestling ability, is pretty even. I personally would have liked Angle to face Danielson but I gues that is how the cards fall. Danielson would take this match after numerous failed submissions countered into a submission Desmond cannot get out of. Motor City would dominate the Harts going by their fast paced action for the win. Sheamus and Samoa Joe has botchfest written all over it. But, I could see them fighting in the parking lot, and Samoa Joe runs Sheamus over to get the victory. Kurt Angle vs Chris Jericho has instant class written all over it. Angle would win it after he sits down on the Ankle Lock. Randy Orton vs Mr.Anderson is the best match on the card. Onlt because of the history that these guys have had together. I'd suspect Mr.Anderson to pull an \"upset\" victory off of this one. Kane vs Abyss would end in a no contest after both knock each other senseless is the third fall, Last Man Standing. They burn in a firey dumpster as they are taken to the hospital. John Cena vs Aj Styles would end rather quickly. John Cena would win this barely after Aj misses a high-flying move, reversed into the AA. The Undertaker vs Sting would wind up with The Undertaker as the winner, after Sting gets disqualified for using the bat. Paul Beaer comes out with the Urn, and inside the urn, was Kane's ashes.

I agree once you assert WWE has performed an magnificent job in turning CM Punk turn heel. He did not get a speedy heel turn and he became pushed as a heel progressively which slowly became the followers against him. CM Punk going against arguably the main many times used action picture star in WWE as gotten him over enormous time as a heel. John Morrison has been dealing with some significant eventers consisting of Chris Jericho, area, and CM Punk.

John Morrison nonetheless isn't geared up up sufficient to challenge for a international championship yet. inspite of the undeniable fact that Rey Mysterio seems feuding with Dolph Ziggler and John Morrison could challenge CM Punk for the international championship. i don't think of everyone else can take the spot except its heel vs heel. we can maximum probable see Undertaker enter the main adventure against CM Punk interior the destiny although. the two John Morrison and Rey Mysterio will make great fighters for CM Punk because of the fact he's had some great suits with the two superstars and that they are the only obtainable faces. even although i want Rey Mysterio to be the challenger because of the fact getting pushed too at once is by no skill a competent element. John Morrison desires extra time to recover from with the followers so as that followers will take him heavily and look at him a significant eventer. maximum followers evaluate John Morrison to be a bigger mid carder best now. the two Rey and John Morrison are great wrestlers so we are absolute to be certain great wrestling suits if the two of them challenged CM Punk.", 11357, "None", 0],
