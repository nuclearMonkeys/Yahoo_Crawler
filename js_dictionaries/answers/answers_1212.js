Find something you like to do, and see if there is a career in that.  I got a computer science degree and found that it was really hard and i spent lots of night awake studying and or doing homework.  But i really like computers and logic problems.

The future is full of computers so I'm sure getting a good job in this field won't be a problem for someone with this major. Lots and lots of money indeed. There are so many things you can do. I really wish you luck with your choice. :)", 8321, "add8ff08921a432c115d8e9658306dddaa", 2],
	66103 : ["Do you think that will be too much for you to handle? That is really a decision for you. Don't think of it as credits though. Think of it as courses. Look at your courses and think about how much time you are going to need to study for each particular class. Then think about how you aren't working this fall and how adding one more class than usual really should not hurt you. Really that decision is all up to you. Do you think you can do it? Only you know your study habits and what time you are going to have to do the courses and the studying. If those are the courses you want to take then just do it. I was taking 18 credits while working two jobs, and now I'm taking 15 credits while not working. I just don't feel like taking as many this semester, but if it is going to help you then do it. If you think it is going to hurt you then don't.", 8321, "None", 0],
	66104 : ["I'd rate it about a 6.5. If I were you, I'd have some serious doubts about having the Rockies pitching staff on my fantasy team.  I don't doubt that a couple of their pitchers could have a good season, but playing in Coors Field all the time will kill them as a team, more than likely. I also think you are relying way too much on the Indians, and not even the talented Indians.  Blake could easily lose the starting job at 3rd to Andy Marte and Gutierrez might not be able to hold of Fransisco for the starting spot in right.  Upton is also a bit iffy...you'll have to keep an eye on him, he didn't really show me a whole lot to be confident about last season.", 8316, "vG86R6R6aa", -1],
	66105 : ["you got around a 5 to a 6 on this one the indians pitching is solid but nothing really special victor martinez and albert pujols give u some solidity in the lineup and garret atkins can do his share as well tulowitski is not a power guy but will get on base and drive in some runs i would bring jd of the bench and replace guitierrez tho i think he will have a better year", 8316, "fKSSTcnpaa", 0],
	66106 : ["Well 1st Puljos has a torn ligament.  They are saying it is doubtful that he will make it through the season bc he will eventually need TJ surgery.  Since the Card suck this yr the chances that he packs it in for the season sooner than later are great.  That way they will lose him for less time next yr.  I have never done a fantasy league where you draft a team for pitching so I can't comment on your team without seeing the rest of the league", 8316, "hmsCPzxSaa", 1],

	66109 : ["It was a crazy episode!! The entire cast delivered 100%. Even though some parts were over the top (SWAT would have taken him out way sooner), it was 2 hours of solid entertainment. There was not a dull moment in the show, which I think is pretty rare for any TV show. It was so emotional! I was thinking about the episode all day, and I never do that! I think Shonda was going for over the top and in your face and that is exactly what she achieved. It was shocking at times. It was a fairly dull season, so I hope the finale sets the tone for next season! I especially loved the Meradith/Christina scenes, it reminded me of when the show first started. I hope we see lots more, and I hope that Dr. Avery becomes a main character.", 8319, "None", 1],

When do you think she'll tell Derek about the whole thing? How do you think he'll react? OMG do you think he's going to be in so much shock after this whole thing that he's going to have problems with Mer and his' relationship? Do you think they're going to split? Do you think that Arizona really is going to follow though and have kids with Callie? OMG IM GOING INSANE! will you email me about this? I have sooo much to talk about.

	66114 : ["I have a CS degree and couldn't be happier.  I'm doing what I like and have a rewarding career. A special note though:  In most cases ( in the case of a traditional university), you'll have a LOT of math classes.  Most likely, you'll go through calculus III and on to differential equations, linear algebra, and the like.  You'll do a lot with programming with respect to solving problems such as differential equations, integration, etc numerically. If you love computers and hate math, you may want to look more to the business side, like a MIS type degree. It seems like I took as many math classes as programming classes for the CS degree.

	66121 : ["I was crying at so many instances during this finale. The worst part was when he pulled Bailey from under the hospital bed. I absolutely freaked out! It was crazy.

	66122 : ["I think Izzie is gonna die because she's leaving the show. I heard that George was leaving too but I didn't think he was gonna die also. But anyway I think it's gonna be Izzie because she was on the elevator. And George is gonna stay because he was not on it. I read that they were suppose to have a story line for George to where if he wanted to come back to the show then he could. Either way the show wont be the same.", 8319, "dPtRmxHQaa", 0],
	66123 : ["I know! Why did Charles have to die? He was comedic relief. And Reed's death was really sudden. Yup, Sandra Oh, Ellen, Chandra and many more deserve Emmy's. Even the actor playing Mr. Clark was amazing. Although the whole time I wanted to smack Mr. Clark, the actor did great. Great season finale.

His ego is monumental. Kanye West personality and attitude sucks @rse. He thinks hes the best thing in music. Im sick of this prick pulling the race card. No one is denying him from performing or not rewarding him cause hes black. Kayne needs to get over himself. Hes like a 4 year old throwing a hissy fit when he doesnt gets his way or win all the awards. Im sick of this guy boohooing and complaining about every little thing.

I think it beat out the bomb episode from a couple of seasons ago! It beat out (IMO) the ER episode when Lucy got stabbed to death!  I normally knit when I watch TV and I noticed my hands were shaking while I was watching. My heart was beating all fast. I couldn't believe it! That was a GREAT episode. They have GREAT writers & that totally made up for the whole dead Denny and Izzie and George hooking up a couple of seasons ago too. *** Yes me too.

Presently, we see that past poor economic decisions have all fallen apart and the president is the one who takes the blame.  People don't see that it's incredibly hard for a president to undue years and years of sugar coated legislature.  President George w bush, did what a republican politician does, give incredible tax breaks to the wealthy thinking this will help create jobs.  As we see now, it didnt do anything.  Here is where I find myself to get frustrated.  President Barack Obama is not doing his job, because republicans will not let him.  Its the truth, you see their main objective is to get the white house back and they are fighting dirty.  What people don't see is that when you vote republican one is voting for the enemy, unless you are extremely wealthy.  The republican party has continually destroyed the middle class, this can be proven be proven by facts.  Therefore if one votes republican you have no right to ***** about the current state of this country because you are supporting those who are more interested in the money that their party offers instead of the well being of these countries citizens!

You'd think they could just offer their services at a bargain rate. After all, there are plenty of people who'd love to be able to hire a lawyer, but can't afford the $100-200/hr that most lawyers charge. But rather offering low-cost legal services, these new lawyers are simply accepting employment in other fields.
