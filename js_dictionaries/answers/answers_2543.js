	132987 : ["Yes, they both focus on similar concepts, but in a less confusing way. What I mean to say is that wing chun and judo utilize the opponent's force and either deflect or manipulate it in some way to make it so you have the advantage. Even though they focus on different areas of combat, both revolve around the same mindset. So this combination is quite healthy in my opinion. I have never heard of this \"5 years\" rule, but it's true that people are generally discouraged to \"improve upon an art\" simply because if they have the idea they will change everything and not learn a thing about the style's tradition or cultural value. It's better to really understand the art first, then expand it so it suits you, as an individual. But yes, this cross training should be no problem at all since I can't really imagine you getting confused between techniques. Also, keep in mind that from Wing Chun trapping, you can easily find your way into Judo throws.", 11157, "hdIpKGlSaa", 1],

They'd get the top vote from me only because my uncle retired from the military as a Command Sergeant Major of the Green Beret Special Forces. He sure looked intimidating in his uniform with all those ribbons on his chest. If you'd see him cooing all over his itty bitty poodle, driving all over town with that dog in his car . . . somehow he's not so intimidating.

By taking two arts you will have to split your training time between the two therefore it will take you longer. This is provided that the two arts are not going to interfere with each other. If they are then they will slow you down even more and you will be struggling even more. In the beginning all martial arts are 'easy'. There is not a lot of material you have yet but I found that the more I advance the more there is to keep up with and train in. What was a two to three times a week undertaking at white belt quickly increased in spending time training and now at black belt I train almost every day several hours and I feel I am not doing enough. Every answer raises more questions to research and each answer needs to be incorporated into my physical training it is a never ending task. While I cross train with several teachers my goal is to improve my Karate. I can not even imagine training like this in two styles. Also if I am not mistaken judo does teach striking techniques but they are advanced techniques so you won't get them until you are several years into the training. I am not real sure about Wing Chun but I think it has ground fighting too but I do not know at what level they teach that. You might want to visit a few Judo and Wing Chun schools and do some research on the styles so you can compare and make good decisions choosing good schools. The last thing you want to do is end up in a school that only teaches parts of a style and partial techniques.", 11157, "d503428496b7275f70c66859957bdd07aa", -1],

However, if for some reason you still want to take classes, then next is to figure out if there will be conflicts between judo and WC.  If your considered judo school does not teach strikes, then you are similarly not learning real judo, or a sport version of it, or children's version of it, or another zany concoction produced by yet another instructor. If you decide that the school-calling-itself-wing-tsun has no ground techniques, and the school-calling-itself-judo has no strikes, and you still want to join them both, by all means, toss your money away.

These people are  the NFL probowlers of the military. They are all the best so dont argue about that people. I have decided to join the Marines because even if i do not become Recon like my bro had, i can still be an infantry grunt on the front lines. Still a very badass job. If you join the navy, and fail in becoming a SEAL, like most people do, you will be on a ship mopping floors for 4 years. The same goes for Army too, even though they also have other infantry units.

All are slightly different too, with a slight twist in mission focus, thus comparing them is not really fair. In the marine corps, we maintain that all marine riflemen are spec ops capable. As a marine, obviously I would say that recon factors very highly in my rankings. I also maintain that SEALs are sailors who have enlisted, and realized they would rather be marines (I know this will get some reaction). But, if I was looking to have my tail saved from a POW camp, and was seeking a rescuer, I would pick the Air Force, specifically because this is a mission they constantly train for. All marines are elite warriors however, and if you are looking for dedicated combat missions, I would say that special forces are NOT the way to go. Their mission is not always combat.

If you just want to be in special forces, the Army would be the easiest route  because you can enlist into into the Rangers(I think) and try to move up from there. As far as the air force, why waste your time, the only thing they do is tell good stories. If you want to be in Marine recon or scout sniper you have to enlist as 0300 (basic infantry).

It depends on the instructor as to when these things are taught to the students. My knowledge of wing chun is limited. But I have personally met 2 wing chun SiFu that teach ground fighting. There are a group of black belt that gt together after the dojo closes. We come from a variety of backgrounds/styles. We get a chance to work on our techniques and keeping ourselves sharp. We also get to share knowledge. Normally My sensei or me teaches the class. Then occasionally this one SiFu comes and he may teach some things. He may bring a guest and the guest might teach a few techniques. A few weeks ago we were working on gun disarms. Then we worked on ground fighting using techniques that the guest SiFu teaches his students. I can't speak for other guys but he is not gentle with us when we trained. You are going to feel some pain...lol When I was studying judo we were taught strikes, kicks, wrist locks, chokes. We were also taught how to defend against them and how to escape from various common holds that people do like head lock, full nelson, bear hug, etc. I briefly trained in another place that didn't teach self defense with their judo.

By this time, you've been in about a year, waiting to get E4 while you wait for the next Ranger class to begin. 5. You finally go to Ranger School, and if you graduate, all of those points you have accumulated will mean you be an E5 by the time you graduate.    A pretty good deal to get E5 in less than 2 years, if you can make it. It's easy to get because most of the people don't make it through. If only today's young marine knew what you now know..

Of course there is some waiting time (about 1 year give or take). But you'll always have a second shot at it.  But remember Special Forces ain't for everyone.
