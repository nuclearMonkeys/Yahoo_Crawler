If the scrap gold is Hallmarked all the better..Don't take the first price you are offered though, there are many dealers who will rip you off and tell you it isn't worth anything.  You should get at least Â£20 per gram for 9ct scrap gold.More if the jewellery is repairable. You would do well to invest in a set of pocket scales, these weigh gold/silver accurately and a jewellers loop (magnifying glass) These enable you to read the Hallmark, You can borrow a Hallmark book from the library to check the dates when your jewellery was made.Older gold has a higher percentage of pure gold than today's modern stuff.

See how it works, and just keep trying new things. Hair may work with products from this company and not that company....it's all trial and error.  If I can suggest something, I would suggest you try a hot oil treatment....for a cheaper way to have great soft and silky hair with less frizzies, warm up some olive oil (regular cooking stuff) in the microwave and massage it into your hair while it is dry. Wrap it up in a warm towel from the drier and sit for an hour or so. Maybe give yourself a facial at the same time. Then get in the shower, and shampoo out all the oil (because water won't get the oil out--oil and water don't mix) and then condition your hair. Viola! Beautiful silky hair.  The most key thing to protecting your locks is to stay away from all heat. Yep, that means no hairdrier, no straightner, no curling iron either....It's very hard not to advert to these products but just try it for a week. Don't blow dry your hair for a week....try it. I know it's hard not to but if you stay away from things with heat such as blow driers, curling irons, straightners, etc....you will notice a HUGE change in the feel and look of your hair. It will be so much more healthy.", 9296, "esfliMAlaa", 0],

	88393 : ["Because these \"organs for morality\", looking at history, can be wired up in a multitude of ways and function fine. Just like the \"organs for language\" can be wired up in a multitude of ways and function fine. There's no objective language, and no objective morality. I get the sense this was a bit of equivocating. edit: what am I, chopped liver? I knew the moment I saw this question there was something wrong but it took me a while to put it in words. edit: you insist on perpetuating your eyes analogy because you can't take on the language analogy. Language and morality are internal senses, eyes perceive the external world. And chopped liver is an old American idiom, brought up by your demand for quick answers to a question I needed to think about. Then why are you not arguing there's an objective language? \"Intimidating question, eh? No answers.\" That sort of got my hackles up, right there. final edit: and all moral systems deal with how you handle different situations. Similarities =/= universality, especially given the broad range of both language systems and moral systems. And without wanting to delve too deep into linguistics, all languages *may* descend from some ur-language but that doesn't make it a \"universal language*. And \"universal grammar\" is something that will cause fights among linguistics students, so that is by no means a settled subject. I takes a while to pick apart clever arguments which are wrong. And lack of answers may denote any number of things. Sorry, wrong word. Language. Not universal. What's the english term for where you try to compare apples with oranges? Ah, conflation. Okay, we'll agree to disagree here. Both language and morality deal with real external situations in their own subjective internal ways. You can talk absolute sense and have sensible moral reasoning, in a multitude of ways, and none of them have to agree. By contrast, eyes perceive the external world directly (leaving aside matters of interpretation of what you see). Eyes can work better or worse; this is why we have glasses. Nobody would argue one language is objectively better than another one. Well, not sane people anyway.", 9298, "7btr3zB8aa", 1],

I'm obviously no the proper character to give an explanation for morality to you however then, I additionally suppose you're being greater than quite facetious in you query. Why perform a little Christians hate homosexuals however paintings on a Sunday? Why perform a little Christians be given that the bible isn't literal and use it as a comforting \"advisor to lifestyles\" and a few will argue the earth is approximately 6000 years ancient? using ordinary feel has an extraordinary have an impact on at the ideals that one holds and the process where one lives their lifestyles.", 9298, "None", 0],

My question to you is what proof do you have that any being inhabits the far side of the moon? You talk about the Apollo missions to the moon and use the men who went there as an argument that it is possible, however NASA had to send every thing they needed to live including the air they breathed, at best NASA was only able to stay on the moon for 4 days The space station gets everything it needs from earth, it is in no way self supporting. SO we come to a possible VS plausible argument. is it possible that some as of yet undetected base or colony exist now or has existed in the past on the far side of the moon? that answer would be yes but very very unlikely. Now the question od is it plausible that an as of yet undetected colony or base exist now or ever existed on the far side of the moon? that answer is no. The thing about a conspiracy theory is people take the most unlikely event or non event and invent the logic to support it , it is then almost impossible to use true logic or reasoning as a rebuttal.", 9292, "None", 0],
