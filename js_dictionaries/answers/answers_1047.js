	57838 : ["\"What is patriarchy theory?\" \"The Patriarchy\" is a feminist conspiracy theory that asserts that every society has been, and continues to function under GENDER rule with men essentially ruling over women as opposed to the reality which is that we have always been ruled under CLASS rule. Feminists tend to see a \"male power\" in common, equal men with no such \"power\", just because it is mostly male leaders that are in power. But this would be like children thinking that all adults have the same authority as each other, and wondering why their own parents can't change the world properly to share that \"power\" with them (the children), and give them exactly what they want, when they want it.  This simpleton concept also ignores the very reality that male leaders do not share power with anyone, especially other males.  Men are competitive creatures. Feminists insist that we still live under a patriarchy today in the first world, even though all adult women have the exact same set of legal Rights and opportunities as men do. Also, no man has any authority or dominion over any woman. A feminist defined \"patriarchy\" cannot exist in the West. It does not. \"The Patriarchy\" as a concept was stolen from actual societies that have existed in the past, such as a rule by religious Patriarch as was the case in the Byzantine empire ... and somewhat (not exactly) like some of the Islamic Caliphates of today. But in our Western, representative democracies, to claim we live in any kind of Patriarchal rule of any type at all, is a fool's assertion. .", 8021, "aSm9xSn3aa", 8],
	57839 : ["@James - your post is 100% accurate in every respect. The problem is that most men are 'henpecked'. The actual roles and positions of women can be found in the Bible. Women were only supposed to be paid 2/3 that of a man. And the man was always supposed to rule over a woman (Ephesians 5:22,23, et al). That is ancient history and ancient wisdom. Deviating from those tenets is unnatural behavior. Also, to add to your list, if there is a DV call to a home, guess who the cops either make leave or arrest? THE MAN. The poor man has no men's shelters to go to and yet there are plenty of women's shelters they she can go to. She can get nearly instant government assistance whereas he is lucky to get $100/month for food. Far too much chivalry in our society and laws. Women expect the man to pay for the date/dinner/etc. If he asks for 'Dutch Treat', she condemns him as being cheap. Women also want lots of kids (usually). Reason? CHILD SUPPORT. They use the father's as a 'stock market investment' of sorts with guaranteed income. And that created indentured servitude, which makes those laws unconstitutional. She gets child support but zero oversight as to what she spends the money on. I knew a woman that got child support, bought a new minivan and house and used that money to pay for it all. NOTHING he could do about it. Fathering a child should NEVER mean signing up to be a slave. Oh if a man hits any woman, even in self defense, HE goes to jail. If SHE hits a man then nothing happens to her. There are some exceptions to both. If a man restricts her access to money then he is abusing her and yet she can be a spend-a-holic, squandering his money (yes it is HIS since he earned it). I knew a woman who abused the law. Every time she got mad at her ex, she took the kids to the dr and ran up medical bills HE had to pay for. He had NO choice in the matter. Another woman had to take her son to get a broken arm treated (real accident). Since the ins card was in the dad's name, they sent HIM the bill even though SHE signed for the treatment. Decree was he provided insurance, not copays and deductibles. Another guy I know got hurt at work and was off work for over a year. No child support paid during that time. She took him to court over it. The guy had proof of the injury and a Dr's note saying he couldn't go back to work yet. Judge asked her what she wanted to do. She said THROW HIM IN JAIL! The guy told the judge he had always paid on time and in full for several years and had no problem paying if he had it. Judge told him to come back in 90 days with some kind of money or determination. 87 days later he got what was left of his workers comp payment - she got the lions share before he got a penny. I bet there are many thousands of unjust cases just like those. And yet, women demand even MORE benefits?", 8021, "41vWD9x2aa", 0],

	57853 : ["I am actually in school for engineering and I had this explained to me. The WTC consisted of a 60 X 60 concrete pillar and then light weight steel joist extending all the way to the exterior of the building.  Unlike the Empire State or many older buildings, there were NO INTERMEDIATE SUPPORT COLUMNS.  Currently I am an ironworker, so I have experience in steel construction. At 600 degrees Fahrenheit steel begins to lose it's strength.  Basically the molecules begin to separate.  Steel joists are lightweight welded members that would absorb heat (from jet fuel) very quickly. (Joist:  If you have anything to do with engineering you know that structural steel is actually less effective in a fire than heavy timbers.  Lightweight steel joists, even if fire treated, would be very susceptible to heat and would approach 600 degrees very quickily. Initially a few floors were damaged.  As the jet fuel heated the floors above the impact zone, the joists on adjacent floors became weak and the floors collapsed.  You have to consider how much weight is actually acting on any given member.  Consider file cabinets, computers, etc. After the first couple floors collapsed it caused what is known as a \"pancake effect\".  Simply put, the weight of the collapsed floors was too much for the floors below to handle and they began collapsing floor by floor at lightning speed (boom boom boom boom).  Obviously without it's steel reinforcement the concrete pillar coud not stand and thus the entire building collapsed. Maybe this explanation does not suit you.  Everything isn't always a conspiracy.  I fully believe that the flight over Pennsylvania was shot down, but I believe it was damage control.  There are perfectly logical explanations for what happened to the WTC.", 7987, "None", -4],

When you dream your natural senses are switched off but your spiritual senses remain awake. That is often the root of dreams. I myself have been woken up by three knocks. I researched that and discovered that other people had also heard three knocks at night. After much prayer and seeking the answer I learned that three knocks come from Jesus Christ. It is a sign from HIM that you have left him out of your life and he wants to come inside your heart. He said: Revelation 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. He does it three times b/c it represents the trinity. You don't need to open the door physically b/c He is just asking for that symbolically. He wants you to repent and open the door to your heart. However, you heard only one knock and eerie music. That was not Jesus Christ. That was demonic. Apparently you have nothing cursed inside your house or they would have a legal right to come inside.  Look, demons are real, Satan is real, hell is real. Please, repent of your sins each and every day and ask Jesus Christ to forgive you and come inside your heart. He is the way the truth and the life. You need him to get to heaven. Soon things will get really awful here in America for this nation has forsaken HIM and HIS ways and people have no idea of the consequences. It is coming.
