	118093 : ["Don't run. Running is bad. Don't run for fitness alone. Run marathons if you compete and are willing to take the risk. But, don't run for fitness without a good reason because running is high impact and repetitive and that means risking problems if you run long distances for a long time. Running contributes to or causes shin splints, repetitive motion stress fractures, ACL strains or separations, early onset osteoarthritis, and much more. And, then there's this........ In this book -->   the coauthors make the following assertion. \"The scientific literature is filled with data that strongly make the case that long distance runners are much more likely to develop cardio-vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, cancer, liver and gallbladder disorders, muscle damage, kidney dysfunction (renal abnormalities), acute microthrombosis in the vascular system, brain damage, spinal degeneration, and germ-cell cancers than are their less active counterparts.\" Each assertion is footnoted. They're making the point that most people have \"cardio\" all wrong and don't really understand how to train to be fit. Even the American Heart Assoc. is no longer recommending jogging but \"brisk walking\" instead and they've included strength training as a tool to improved cardio-vascular health. And the problems continue... Build your fitness program around high intensity strength training. You can read about it here -->   . Strength training offers more benefits than aerobic exercise. Here are some. • Stronger bones & increased mineral density (osteoporosis protection) • Stronger body & musculature (improved protection from injury) • More robust organic and systemic fitness (more survivable in crisis)   • Improved cardio-vascular function (better than \"cardio\") • Higher basal metabolic rate (~5-50 cal/day/pound of muscle) • Easier fat loss (more efficient lipid consumption) • Greater calorie consumption (prolonged afterburn) • Supports body sculpting (hypertrophy) • Slows natural loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) over age 30 • Minimal wear & tear The key to fat loss is diet, not exercise. And, if you're skinny, you're probably an ectomorph or near ectomorph. That means your genetically determined body type is thin and slender and you're probably going to have a tough time building much muscle. That said, you still need to train for the totality of benefits. If you want to do aerobic exercise, walk or swim or doing anything that get's your heart rate up to 80% of max (Where: Max = 220 - You Body Weight). But avoid things that are high impact, offer a narrow variety of motion, and may promote wear and tear injuries or pathology in later life. You won't find any good bodybuilding or muscle building websites. There aren't any because bodybuilders train today as they did 50 years ago. And most personal trainers are just glorified gym rats with a cheap cert. That's why you really have to study and become your own personal trainer. The best website and YouTube videos are Scooby's. Google him if you're interested. He gets a lot of thing wrong because he's old school. But he is motivated by public service and not trying to scam the market like all the other bodybuilding websites. Whatever you do, DON'T USE SUPPLEMENTS!!! The bodybuilding and weight gain supplements are all junk and scams. For more about that, read my answer about protein supplements -->   . You have one body and it has to last a lifetime.

	118104 : ["Yes, it is time to admit Obama economics is a massive failure. Already there are rumors of an \"August surprise\"  where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac forgive underwater mortgages held by millions of Americans. And with state and local government jobs having fallen 169,000 year-to-date, perhaps the Democratic Congress and the White House will seek an even bigger spending plan for teachers and Medicaid workers -- on top of the $26 billion plan that just passed the Senate. Or maybe the Democrats will come up with a new infrastructure-spending bill, perhaps for green technologies and whatnot. Or maybe they'll extend unemployment benefits even more. I think there will be a shift leftward inside the West Wing. Businesses are mostly avoiding new hires in the face of the Obamacare regulatory threats and the uncertainty about future tax burdens. The bottom line? Panic over this stalled economy may be setting in. So just like the overall economy, the jobs recovery is faltering. It isn't a double-dip recession. But the story is moving in the wrong direction. And if the Democrats in power push for a big-bang summer surprise that seeks even more failed stimulus spending, they will do much more harm than good. The Intrade pay-to-play investment parlor already shows a 60 percent likelihood of a GOP House takeover this November. That's the ultimate silver lining in this story. With the disappointingly soft jobs report for July, and a faltering recovery overall, is Team Obama getting ready for some sort of new, liberal-left, Keynesian, big-bang stimulus package. o_O", 10525, "yQ0OzEbZaa", 7],
	118105 : ["No, but there is always room for improvement.  President Obama has done fairly well in addressing the severe, dire economic situation that the country was in when he took office.  The Great Recession however was much worse than most economists had thought. Many economic issues have to be addressed more forcefully by the Obama administration. For instance, corporations are hoarding money and aren't hiring.  It is not sufficient for the Obama administration to ignore such an unacceptable situation.  The effort should be to highlight what is going on, draw the public's attention to it and address it.", 10525, "t3QAaSN9aa", 3],

Fact: the leaders of your country have little to nothing to do with the economy.  yet leaders during good times will be remembered for their economic leadership. for example Regan who was the leader after the first economic adjustment (gas shortage and power shortage as well). he is remembered well because the economy bounced back and did well during his stay. fact is the bulk of the american debt came from the cold war arms race which your country has struggled with since. now america is feeling the pinch of the expenses of two wars and not being wealthy enough to be involved in either. compounded by the WORLD economy adjusting you wish to blame the person left to try to fix the problem. silly how short sited people can be when they wish to place blame.  i am not liberal or a democrat so don't dismiss this as party rhetoric just a real 360 view of the situation.", 10525, "0DZeQ6abaa", -1],

	118114 : ["All of them.  :)   This a little subjective because everybody has their favorite overlooks. The big difference in views between the North and South rim is that the river runs closer to the South Rim (which is lower elevation).  As a result, South Rim views tend to be very vertical - looking downward into the canyon.  North Rim views tend to be more horizontal - you look outward over side canyons and buttes.  Both perspectives are breath-taking and I would have a hard time choosing one over the other. Here are a few of my favorite overlooks: Yavapai Point (South Rim) - Has a rare excellent view of the river and good view of the famous Bright Angel Canyon and the Tonto Plateau. Grandview Point (South Rim, east edge of Park) - An interesting different view of the canyon because it shows the more open eastern end of the canyon transitioning into the deep and narrow gorges of the central canyon. Point Sublime (North Rim) - Considered by many to be the best rim view of the canyon.  Long rough drive down a dirt road west of the lodge though. Cape Royal (North Rim) - Another great view with Woton's Throne butte in the foreground (a favorite of painters).  Nearby Angel's Arch overlook allows you to see a small stretch of river through a natural arch. As a poster above mentions, the view (and experience) from down inside the canyon is very different from being on the rim.  Feeling the walls rise above you and the whole canyon surrounding you is my favorite way to experience the canyon.  You don't have to go all the way to the bottom and back (in fact, you don't want to try that in a day).  But going down South Kaibab Trail (South Rim) 1.4 miles to Cedar Ridge will give you dramatic views.  A much tougher day hike is the 9 mile round trip down Bright Angel trail to the famous Plateau Point overlooking the Inner Gorge.", 10533, "AA11523701", 0],
