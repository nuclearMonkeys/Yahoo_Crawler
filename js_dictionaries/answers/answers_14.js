	701 : ["Wearing a mask is considered prosocial behavior. We wear masks because it's an act of common courtesy to do so. Like, say I had the virus, it's supposed to prevent my germs from spreading. Now, the problem is that there are asymptomatic cases, meaning a seemingly healthy person can spread their germs unknowingly when in public. This is why it's safer that everyone wears a mask instead of none at all because you never know who has the virus. It's times like these that you should understand the motives of people because, in my opinion, your coworker does not have a good reason not to wear one. Some people can be self-centered, and if we just cared more about our fellow human beings, this pandemic would have already been over. Hopefully, once most of the population gets vaccinated, we won't have to wear masks anymore, and it's going to be safe to breathe in another person's air again when we're dining at a restaurant and enjoying our food, just like normal times.", 121, "VI0vcUGGaa", 0],

	708 : ["Air. It's already 78% nitrogen anyway. Racing cars need dry nitrogen filling because regular air contains water vapour, and as that gets hot under the extremes of racing it turns to steam. That in turn makes the tyre pressures higher than intended. It has nothing to do with the size of N2 molecules. No normal road going car needs nitrogen filling, but it is a nice little earner for tyre shops, and owners have to just trust that they get what they paid for: unscrupulous shop owners have been known to simply refill empty N2 cylinders with air.  And yes, in response to another answerer, I do mean “tyre”. Not everyone uses American English spellings. Both spellings are correct depending upon where you're from.", 110, "gjUpsUZAaa", -1],

So, of course, people would rather not have symptoms and get the protection man have them and get it", 127, "None", 0],
	728 : ["No and if you follow the logic of stating that side effects are caused by the immune system working properly would imply that if you don't get side effects then the immune system isn't working or the vaccine isn't working.  Quite a few people do not have major or minor symptoms and the vaccine has a very high efficacy rate. This indicates that side effects are not necessary for the vaccine to work.  I got a large bruise about 6 inch square and the shot hurt a lot as soon as the needle went in. I know something was off and wrong. This was my second shot and the first went without incidence.  Any and all side effects are not needed and play no  role in vaccine efficacy. All reactions are adverse events.  In the future better vaccines can be developed where most if not all will not have any adverse events. That is the goal. ", 127, "0nyWiro9aa", 1],

Then came the Cuban missile crisis, when we thought Russian nuclear rockets were aimed at us. We've lived through recessions, 9/11, and other threats to our existence.
