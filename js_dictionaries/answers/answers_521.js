But you are not dealing with reasonable people.   Conspiracy nutters will never admit that they live in a fantasy world and nothing you say will convince them that they are following a conspiracy theory.  The only result of providing facts is that they get angry,  You just have to keep it really simple, as simple as you would explain things to a 6 year old and keep repeating that until they come up with intelligent questions. Sagebrush who kept using \"quotes\" taken out of context  by politicians, reporters, economists etc, needed to be confronted with his own \"quotes\" Kano needed to be assured he wasn't at fault because he worked in coal plants (which are unionized and thus socialist in the mind of JimZ.) JimZ was fighting a war against communism and he associated the green movement with communism, (there is no reason why it should be) Solar wind believes that it is solar activity, even the fact that solar active declined while temperatures continued to rise, didn't get him to stop and think.

Lib(ido)Crusher is an attention seeking troll and that is the only thing he succeeded in.  But even without him YA was doomed.  It is one of the worst question and answer sites I have come across.  Thanks to the pseudoscience spouted by all of the deniers who seem to believe they know more about the subject then climate scientists... I started of in the religion section, but even though I am an atheist, but the atheist there were just too mean towards the people who ask genuine questions about religion.  If Sagebrush had spend any time in there even I would have felt sorry for him.  (Or maybe not) No one drove Lib(ido)Crusher crazy, he was crazy before he joined YA like all the other 4chan cult members with him.  The fact that you didn't get upset bugged him though.  He and his ilk in the politics section are forever asking questions how liberals feel, if they are upset, etc...  It is quite funny actually as they don't seem to realize that any liberal who comes to YA would by definition have to have a very thick skin indeed.", 4517, "ZcgSovspaa", -7],

But a 22 can be a surgeon's worst nightmare. There have been cases with people getting shot with a 22 in the leg and have it travel up your leg and spin all around inside your guts and then exit through the shoulder. Leaving a wound channel that takes hours and hours to put together. A 22 certainly does not have the takedown power of a big caliber bullet. You will bleed to death much slower.
