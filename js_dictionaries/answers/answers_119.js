	5959 : ["The idea of Marxian economics is heterodox in the Western academy, but the field is widespread in current socialist countries and has a surprisingly strong history in the West that does not precluding continued interest. Disclaimer: I'm no expert but this was an interesting deep dive so I typed this up. -------- Certainly, the economics ministers in communist-dominant states like North Korea, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam and China are Marxian, but I imagine that so too are those during the elected governments of SYRIZA in Greece, MAS in Bolivia, Patriotic Pole in Venezuela, or any left of social democratic government in the World. To offer more context: - In China, you can get a PhD in Marxism and any PhD in economics starts from a basis of Marxian notions of class struggle. Therefore, I think it'd be fair to say that someone like He Lifeng (Minister for Development and Reform, PRC, with degrees in economics) is a practitioner of Marxian economics (mixed market, so not fully socialist, but still). - In the West, there are Marxian/neo-Marxian economists like Richard Wolff, Samuel Bowles, John Bellamy Foster, John Roemer, David Harvey, the late Paul Sweezy and the late Paul Baran in the US and a few in England (per the Labour Party tradition, like Paul Cockshott, Ben Fine, and arguably the late Tony Benn). I'd also note Yanis Varoufakis in Greece (though not strictly a Marxian), the late Giovanni Arrighi, (political theorist) the late Ellen Meiksins Wood (for her work \"Democracy against Capital\"), and (still living, journalist) Seth Ackerman (considered here because of his few pieces on economics -  - (most direct answer to your question) Most of the following ^ are old, because under a near total capitalism, there's little to be gained from practicing Marxian economics. There may be some approximates to the Marxians in the school of post-Keynesians (like, arguably, Michał Kalecki), but this is by no means a complete description. Post collapse of the USSR, even talented, non-Marxian economists, like Thomas Piketty, are reticent to suggest socialist solutions, even when thoroughly disillusioned with the procedures of capitalism (note the conclusion of \"Capital and Ideology\" as noted on the wiki page, where he timidly advocates for a global \"participatory\" socialism to reign in the rapid increases in inequality). <- I'd also note the perspective offered by Zizek on this, as a utopian notion of economics.

Probably none if you include that criteria - however you didn't specify all of that information. The trouble with diamonds is their price is artificially set by the cartels. Yet manufactured diamonds look the same, are cheaper than natural and there are no complications with the blood diamond scenario. Hence it's a risky field to invest in. What you're really asking for, is investment advice with a product that's more likely to increase in value than others. Some of the rare earth metals might be viable, but you need to catch the price low and have some anticipated reason for it to rise. On top of that you have to be one of the very few who noticed this critical change coming. It was said some of the rare earth metals used in mobile phones and computers may be a good investment, however that's provided a replacement for them isn't found. Truthfully if I knew for sure which rare earth metal was the pick of the bunch, I would buy it first and then advise.  Which is what the best investment brokers do for a fee - then the price rises above what it's worth ....... Next thing you know the costing of that very same item becomes overvalued and the market listing suddenly plummets. Be very careful when investing. It's a minefield and even experts get burned. I know you want someone to provide the right information on what specific stock, mineral, bond or investment is best. However those people often have an agenda and it can be to dump the very item they recommend at a price they're happy with. It's hard to know which piece of advice to trust.

	5996 : ["You are right to identify the problem as being in Marx's labour theory of value.  We need to understand why this is wrong first and foremost, because Marx's entire theory rests on this foundation, and crumbles without it.  (Marx thought of himself first and foremost as an economist. Yet it was the economics faculties which were the first to reject his theory, in the 1870s. It lives on, not in economics departments, but in the economically illiterate faculties such as sociology and history.) If the labour theory of value were correct, it would mean that if you dig a gold mine at a cost of $1 billion dollars in labour, and dig up only one ounce of gold, then the value of that gold would be (at least) the value of the labour that went into producing it, namely $1 billion.  But that's wrong, isn't it?  And if you were out walking the dog in your leisure time, and kicked a stone that turned out to have an ounce of gold in it, then the value of the gold would be (at least) the value of the labour that went into it - nothing.  But that's wrong, isn't it? The theory is wrong.  And if the LTV were correct, the value of a Van Gogh painting would be frozen in time as at when he last took his brush off the canvas - ceased his labours on it.  But that's wrong. Something, not being labour input, is causing the prices to rise.  It is simple stupidity for the Marxists to keep insisting, as an article of faith immune to rational disproof, that the value of all production is imputable to the labour, and only the labour factors of production, despite the entire theory being so easily and trivially disproven.  (The theory of marginal utility provides the true explanation of value. In short, it is nonsense to talk about the value of whole entire abstract collective aggregate classes of things, such as \"labour\" (all the labour in the world), or \"capital\" (ditto), or \"the global order\", or \"the proletariat\", or even \"bread\". The reason it's nonsense, is because *no-one* is ever faced with the problem of valuing such great monolithic collectivist agglomerations. It never forms a subject of human action, which is what economics is tasked with explaining.) In reality, the price of bread, or gold, or labour, is determined not by coming up with some theory of the value of all the bread, or gold, or labour in the world, but by the valuations that individual buyers and sellers attach to individual units of bread, and for all other economic goods whatsoever.  This being so, it is no answer by the Marxists to the disproof of their garbled assertions, to shift to a new garbled assertion about \"capitalistic communism\", which a) doesn't make sense, and b) leaves you to try to construct their argument for them, themselves having vacated the field.  Capitalism *by Marxist definition* means the private, and communism or socialism the public, ownership of the means of production. Therefore the term 'communistic capitalism' is a contradiction in terms.  This means that it does NOT explain the alleged increase in profit based on investment in constant capital.  Moreover capitalism is not just a system of increasing profit. It's a system of profit AND LOSS. There is nothing about the nature of capitalism per se, that means that ANY investment is necessarily going to result in increasing profit.  It might. But it might not! That's the whole point! It's not something that academics can just pull out of their backside.  The economist, as economist, does not know. If he did, he'd go and invest his own money and take the profit himself. It is the function of the *entrepreneur*, not the economist, to judge whether the future combination of products, will produce a profit. And he does so at risk of loss! Most of the companies and businesses that existed when I was a child NO LONGER EXIST.  So much for Marx's theory. And the workers are RICHER, not poorer, DESPITE, not because of, the interference of the state in behalf of \"labour\", which in any event contradicts Marx's theory.  Marx's theory completely fails to explain, and to understand, the actual machinations of capital and capitalism, because the labour theory of value, and his exploitation theory of labour, are fundamentally mistaken, and this invalidates his economic theory. In reality, labour benefits from employment, and takes the first fruits of the production earlier in time, leaving the entrepreneur to take later in time a profit OR A LOSS IN WHICH THE LABOURER DOES NOT PARTICIPATE.  For an excellent clear article on this, google \"mises profit loss mont pelerin\" For a very readable, comprehensive total demolition and explosion of Marx's theory, read: 1.
