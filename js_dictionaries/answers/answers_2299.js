Put the cover down on th toilet , put all things that are dangerous away or out of reach. make sure there's lots of water in a bowl for her to drink and her bed or a soft clean bath mat  Do this just before you go to bed .  you could even put her toys in the room so she can play.. Get her in the morning . If  you try this for  a few days she might like it. Or you could keep your door closed just before you go to bed and let her find her own place to sleep.

Red card received by Zidane was something enough to explain the serious consequence of his act. He was already being punished and paid the price.  If his Golden Ball award is really going to be stripped, that would tell the children from countries all over the world that Materrazzi and his insulting words are the winners.

	120768 : ["Absolutely not. The golden ball (or boot) is not decided on behaviour but on performance on the field (goals scored, assists) and how vitall he is to the success of his team. I don't think any action should be taken until we find out what the Italian guy said to him. If they take any action towards Zidane, then the Italian player should be suspended for a year and the WC final be replayed.

The Golden Ball takes into account the entire tournament as a whole, a tournament  in which zidane proved to the world that he deserved to be called one of the greatest.   compare all those games to a single  incident.  red cards  happen all the time.  The  ones with provocation involved should also stick one  in the offenders face.  basically, the Golden Ball is his due praise,  the redcard was FIFA's disciplinary action against the behavior \"contrary to the ethic of the sport\" .  Isn't that what the redcard exactly does, anyway? By keeping the Golden Ball, it's telling  Zidane:  You are great.

So I'd pick it up and put it in the litter box.  It wouldn't know what it was, so it's jump and and I'd put it back in.  They may jump out a few times, but then they start sniffing the litter and realize it's a darn good place to go.  So they go and I never had a problem after that.  Piece of cake.  Also, don't spend a lot of money on cat toys.  Most cats prefer the homemade kind, such as boxes, paper bags, balls of paper, string tied to a doorknob, etc etc etc.  As for beds, leave a soft blanket someplace in a protected postion off the floor, but DON'T put the kitten on it.
