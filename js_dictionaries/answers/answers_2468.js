	129222 : ["To be proud of being a sociopath is like saying 'I am fine, and in fact revel, in being called a flawed human being.' People would rather think you are lying about your mental health status for shits and giggles than accept that someone would actually take pleasure in being what you are. The thing is... being a sociopath isn't a good thing. At least not to members of the general public. When you boast about this all you are telling people is that you're proud to be a 'bad' human being, with traits that most people avoid and habits that are selfish, manipulative and self-centered. People would rather believe that you are an attention whore than what you claim to be because people don't want to live in a world where people with a negative self image take pleasure in it. People want to believe that the world is only for the good. Of course you'd be self-aware as a sociopath... you'd have to be else why would you be able to manipulate in order to gain things for yourself? You have to have a sense of self before you can manipulate people because else you're not manipulating people... you're just a compulsive liar.  I think that you're probably proud of your diagnosis because it offers you something. Perhaps you want people to know that if they mess with you, or you mess with them, that it doesn't matter because rules mean little to you anyway... there's no way anyone can 'win' with you when they know that you don't have the same emotional response as everyone else. This gives you power because there's nothing anyone CAN do to you because anything they do means so little. That and we're not people you know in real life so you have no-need to lie and manipulate us, we offer you nothing, so you are open about it because hell... what's the worst that can happen, right?", 11020, "AA11362676", 0],

If any of us want to live through this, we'd better stop Iran while we have the chance.   If its us or them, I pick them.  It is an allied decision not just an Israeli decision.  There has not been a continent immune from suicide bombing and Iran has already been declared the #1 sponsor of terrorism and the terrorists have already requested a small nuclear suicide bomb. Really now guys.  To do nothing means one is just signing their own death certificate for themselves and millions of other people.  I really can't put it more blunt than that. If anyone wants to live, they will support the bombing of Iran to the stone age, and it needs to be an allied effort, and then leave the Iranian people to clean up their own mess. -----edit @mongoose, don't be so abrasive.

Ahmadinejad reverted to Iran's previous policy of anti-Saudi hegemony, by pushing the export of the revolution, and promoting a messianic Shi'ite vision that stresses the imminent appearance of the Mahdi and the reestablishment of the great Persian Empire. In his second television appearance following his election, he said: \"The message of the [Islamic] Revolution is global, and not restricted to a specific time or place. It is a human message, and it will move forward. Have no doubt... Allah willing, Islam will conquer. Islam will conquer what? It will conquer all the mountaintops of the world.\" -- MEMRI \"Saudi Arabia responded by increasing its support for the Sunni minority in Iraq, for various Muslim and Christian forces in Lebanon, and for others who were confronting Iranian threats in their territory (e.g. in Yemen, Sudan, and Palestine).\" -- MEMRI '\"Iran is the No. 1 world sponsor of terrorism,\" said Richard Clarke, ABC consultant and former national security official.' -- ABC News \"U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is criticizing Iran for promoting terrorism and trying to intimidate its neighbors and others in the Middle East.Clinton says Iran poses a serious potential missile threat not only to Israel but also to the United States' European allies and to Russia.\" -- AP #1770 - Jordanian University Lecturer Ibrahim 'Alloush Suggests Sending Suicide-Bombers Armed with \"Small Nuclear Bombs\" to Israel Al-Jazeera TV (Qatar)  ---------edit: @mongoose, yes i have data from a variety of sources, including gov't data if that's what you prefer: Remarks on IAEA Report on Iran's Nuclear Program and Iranian Reaction September 13, 2010 \"In sum, this report is the clearest evidence yet that Iran is refusing to address the proliferation concerns of the international community, number one, and number two, much more ominously, that it appears determined to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.\"   ------ edit to add: Indict Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the crime of incitement to genocide.", 11022, "i7oHTo9haa", 0],
