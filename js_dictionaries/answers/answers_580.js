	32814 : ["I wouldn't be surprised to see him stay in England if someone like City is willing to meet the Levy tax lol. Idk how much he'd cost but let's say it's like 130 million for foreign clubs an EPL team might have to pay 150 you know what I mean? I guess PSG with the Poch link, relatively easy league for a player of his quality, close enough to London if he wants to visit home, play with Neymar and Mbappe if he stays, get a massive pay rise, guaranteed to win trophies. Real Madrid have been linked and it would make sense. I can't see Benzema be dropped or sold under Zidane so he might have to find a way to fit them both up front.  I think he'd be great in Serie A btw but Inter with Lukaku, Martinez and Juve with Ronaldo and Morata there might be nowhere for him to go in Italy but I think he'd be really well suited to Italian football so that's a shame. I know Morata is on loan but idk if Juventus have to buy or want to buy at the end of it. If not then they should come in for Kane as well imo", 5012, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],
	32815 : ["I give it to Jose, he's got a far better pool of players to work with and is doing a lot worse, who inherits a team with Kane, Son, Alli, Moura and some good DM's for cover and thinks \"I know, lets park the bus every game and rely on our average defenders to win games instead\" and he's talking about signing freakin Fellaini whilst Alli & Kane want out, that guy is a complete detriment to any club he's at by now, always leaves them in a far far worse state than when he joined. Alli & Winks have devalued under him too so they're gonna have a much harder time rebuilding with less money to cash in on.", 5013, "cq22NZX5aa", 1],
	32816 : ["Both were great managers in their time however time does move on and their methods are advanced. If the manager doesn't advance with the times they drop back. One of Fergies biggest strengths was he evolved with the times hence the longevity. So id argue both are on the decline and both could do with an extended break from club management to allow them to modernise their styles. Both should move into international management for a stint", 5013, "TdmTjKt8aa", 1],

	32827 : ["Eventually yeah. They're too big a club making too much money to stay where they are forever. A bit like Liverpool but you guys needed new owners to sort you out, Arsenal is the same really. The owners are only interested in making money failing to realise that in sport the more you win the more money you make!  As we can see btw Wenger was never the problem, nor was Emery and now Arteta as well. Yes we can analyse every game and say oh well the manager picked the wrong players or set the team up wrong got the tactics wrong etc. But 3 managers and Arsenal are still at best trying to qualify for the Europa League? Meanwhile Emery has gone back to Spain and has Villareal in 5th place (worth mentioning they finished 5th last season without him) but they're also still competing in the Europa League so he's doing a good job there so far. It's a shame Wenger never returned to management but at his age he's better off enjoying life now anyway but if he did return I think he'd have done pretty well wherever he'd have been.  I've seen enough of Arteta to suggest he could be a decent manager but the circumstances are against him at Arsenal.  A mid table Spanish or Prem team without the delusion expectations at Arsenal would probably suit him better. ", 5023, "q1BX2eXuaa", 1],

	32829 : ["It will never be as popular as they want it to be. It's gotten a bit more popular due to more exposure but nobody watches women's football for the quality of play.  You watch women's football because it's hilarious, your local team or national team is playing or you just simply have nothing better to do.  Tickets to watch the women's teams are so cheap, I think some games they even let them in for free to increase numbers. Take that away and you'd have very little interest. Let's say tickets are £5, if they increase that to £15 less people will show up, increase that to £25 and you'd be lucky to get anyone into the stadium   ", 5004, "q1BX2eXuaa", -1],

Probably just someone's multi but that was an entertaining account.  There was taajspurs or something as well he had a picture of one of the Matt Lucas characters from come fly with me always had these strange comments I thought were funny.  Then people who role played like Michael Owen and stuff are always funny accounts as well.  The guy who used to run predictions Jeff I think he was. I won his competition one year I was having a bit of a dodgy finish and OBA was coming up behind me but I held out for the win.  For a more regular though I think Aces for the nonsense he puts on here, OBA because of all the battles he got in, KC for playing the role of the EFS villain, Dave was alight too had some knowledge but also prone to drama, that Danish guy was a bit like Dave decent user in terms of football but also prone to drama. Special mention to Julie of the SFS as well, not sure of 90% of what she types but she's always been sound to me. Her fights with other users were always entertaining. i think there was one guy made an account just to be a Julie translator it was great  Then there's obviously nice users like Martin, August and those lot, decent lads", 5005, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],

VS Guardiola though, his biggest fan, Bielsa has 1 win, 2 draws and 2 defeats.  Man City fans should be fuming about picking up only 1 point from their 2 games v Leeds ", 5019, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],
