	131773 : ["Let's look at this logically. I neither agree with the Christian view completely, nor what gays think about the topic entirely. What I do believe is that if you are certain that the Bible is inerrant, then you must accept the meaning of Leviticus as it so clearly states, i.e., that homosexuality is detestable.  I feel duty bound to point out the obvious, some things in life are hard to accept, and even more so for Americans since we have often been told that we can have whatever we want and at any time that we want it. Unfortunately, this is one of those times that we can't unless, of course, we wish to be hypocritical.  Start your own religion if you wish, but don't call it Christianity because it wouldn't be, any more than the so-called liberal Anglican Church is Christian. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a fundamentalist Christian. In fact, I haven't stepped foot inside a church of my own accord in over 30 years, but I despise hypocrisy and if one isn't capable of accepting the entirety of a faith then one should find another faith that he can accept completely.  Doing so isn't a problem for me, but obviously it is for you, so my advice is to look inside yourself and determine whether your feelings are hypocritical. It's not wrong to have hypocritical thoughts, only if you act on them.", 11116, "None", -2],

	131795 : ["\"What God has made clean let no one call unclean.\"  What a baptized Christian does is not for man to condemn, but for God. So many laws from the Old Testament are also currently ignored because they are \"outdated.\"  Shaving for men was prohibited just as homosexual interaction was.  Do we tell men to not shave?  No.  I bet plenty Christians out there have had a shrimp cocktail or a ham sandwich before, and most of us have worn blended fabrics too. I still don't know why people have held onto this law as long as they have.  There are logical reasons for all of the other relationship laws that have nothing to do with religion: sleep with your sister, and any kids you have will be likely to be deformed; sleep with someone who isn't your spouse, and your kids will not have the stability of two parents; sleep with someone who doesn't want to, and you've just committed an act of violence.  However, what harm comes from sleeping with someone who has the same genitalia as you do so long as you only do such things with a consenting individual? Final point: In Biblical times, pretty much everyone got married unless they were unable to reproduce (i.e. eunuchs).  Sleeping with someone of your own sex was almost certainly a case of adultery as you probably had a spouse.  If you didn't, you probably were going to get married in the near future, which is still hurting someone else. EDIT: Pedophiles have the disadvantage of being attracted to people who are incapable of knowingly consenting to sexual interaction.  Sexual interaction with someone who cannot consent in full consciousness of the consequences is just not right.", 11116, "wPSlWh5Taa", 0],

	131797 : ["I'm sorry to tell you this, but if you really do believe that everything you just said will benefit the public, you are wrong. Everything you said will only upset and insult gays. We ARE people. It is basic human rights, not just gay rights. And telling us that what we do is wrong will not make us stop doing it, but it will hurt some people who are sensitive. I myself and sensitive, and when I go to bed at night after hearing things like what you've put here, I can't even sleep because of my emotions and confusion in my head. It is not easy to be ridiculed all of the time, you know. And I know that some people actually mean well, or do not understand the effect it has on others, but you have to understand now that behind these usernames are real people with real feelings. We don't want to listen to this over and over again, because we do not choose this fate. No one would want this, but we live with it anyway.  Anyway, I just want you to know that even if a person is very religious, they are not disobeying thier beliefs by following their heart. No one wants to live a miserable life and wish they had lived it differently and pursued what they wanted sooner.  I am religious, and I go to church, and I'm telling you, as long as I don't abandon my God, my God will not abandon me.

If he is under pillows or stuffed animals, remove them gently. If he is in a crib, make sure he's not hitting himself against the bars. Just keep him safe and wait it out.  He will fall back asleep and probably not remember it in the morning.  YOU on the otherhand will be shaken and may have a hard time falling back to sleep.

He had been really hurt in a relationship before. Basically dated a girl for 4 years, she dumped him and he contemplated suicide.

	131816 : ["I am so very sorry to hear of your loss.... I can honestly say I know how you feel however it was not my canine companion I lost-it was my husband of 31 years named Arthur. My husband had been ill for a couple of years and they did not know what was wrong. Then they discovered 2 tumors on his liver. He was undergoing treatment and was on a transplant list which gave us all hope.He was scheduled for a treatment where they were going to freeze one of the tumors and I drove him to the hospital for his surgery. After several hours he came out ok and was scheduled to come home in 3 days. One the second day, his 60th birthday, I received a call that he was having trouble breathing and was moved to ICU. I went and saw him that day and he was on oxygen but was ok. He told me he would see me the next day and I went home. That was the last time he spoke to me. That night he was put on a ventilator and never regained conciouseness. He fought hard for the next ten days and on Oct 2, 2009 I was on my way to the hospital again and received news that the was in severe difficulty. I had a 3 hour drive to get there and was on the phone with my son and praying that I could get there in time to be with him as I did not want him to die alone. Unfortunately, I too did not make it in time. I was less thatn 3 miles from the hospital when my son called to tell me he had passed. It was the hardest thing I have had to ever do was to walk into that room and see my husband gone and know that I wasn't there for him. I cried and held him, told him how sorry I was that I wasn't there and that I missed him very much. And the reality is I still do. It has been 14 mos now and for the first 6-7 months I felt so much guilt that I wasn't there and then the healing began. I realize that maybe this was in Gods plan for me not to be there. To have witnessed the loss of the man I loved for over 30 years would have been traumatic to say the least and I believe my husband knew this and he and God chose to spare me this. And I believe God and your beloved Sam made the same choice. The ones we love want us to remember them as they were in life-vibrant and joyous. Though the pain never truly goes away, the guilt will eventually fade as you rejoice in the times you shared and remember the love you had. I will pray for you all and I know my Arthur and Sam are watching us now and are always in our hearts. May Gods Grace and Peace be with you now and always. Robin", 11109, "Oy9Te91yaa", 4],
