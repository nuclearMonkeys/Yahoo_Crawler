	86159 : ["Well, here you are asking inane questions again. Before that question should be answered, you should ask yourself what the purpose of the President's cabinet is. The Constitution is set up for separation of powers.  That is between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.  Now guess which branch the President's cabinet in in.  Yes, it is in the Executive branch and the President is the head of that branch.  The people in the Executive branch ALL work for the President.  Especially HIS cabinet.  It is their job to advise him and carry out his wishes.  Period. Any disagreements within the Cabinet should remain inside the Cabinet.  The country should only have one policy toward any single issue. From what I can see, Colin Powell has a lot of integrity.", 9212, "fab424dc17e0236294c9f82e5e7f1241aa", 1],
	86160 : ["A moment of insanity? This was and still is a true dark cloud for Powell. I think he succumbed to the pressures put upon him by President Bush, V.P. Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. I would like to think he was left out of the loop and he honestly thought what they were doing was for the benefit of the people of Iraq and America. I have such high regard for the man and was thoroughly disappointed in him while he was making his speech to the UN in support of the invasion of Iraq. I still give him credit for having enough integrity to step down after the President's first term. He wasn't going to be fooled twice. He also no longer supports the President's policy in Iraq.", 9212, "None", 0],

	86162 : ["It's utter hypocrisy. As a libertarian, I feel disgust at the hypocrisy of both Republicans and Democrats. One side shouts, \"Keep your laws off my body but in his pockets.\" While the other repeats, \"Limit government! (Except in their ability to legislate based on biblical beliefs.)\"  Why is it that the left has never accused someone of greed for wanting someone else's money, only for wanting to keep their own?  Why does the right express distrust of government in one breath, but proclaim it's ability to properly identify and torture terror suspects in the next?  My best explanation is that both sides base their political views on emotion rather than logic. Personally, I make an intellectual attempt to refrain from doing so. I may feel a certain way about a political issue in my heart, but will base my stance on which position will maximize human freedom. While my heart indicates that it is wrong to abort a fetus, my intellect replies that it is more important to keep beliefs and moral convictions out of our law books. I feel that the needy should be housed, fed, and cared for - but I cringe at the prospect of usurping wealth (which for most people represents a portion of their life; heartbeats that they'll never get back) at the point of a gun to accomplish that end.  So for all the ramblings, grandstanding, and condemnation that comes from both sides of the aisle - I pay no heed. Because neither side actually cares about the freedoms, rights, or needs of the people whom they claim to support -- they only wish to see their personal credos codified into our legal system.  Are you any different, Kevin? You condemn forcing religious beliefs on others, but support making slaves of productive men for the benefit of the indigent based on your belief that pro-life means caring for people in and out of the womb. You believe the ends justify the means -- and you're willing to force this belief into my paycheck? How is that not forcing a belief system upon others?  \"The only good bureaucrat is one with a pistol at his head. Put it in his hand and it's good-by to the Bill of Rights.\" [H.L. Mencken] \"The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities.\" [Ayn Rand]", 9216, "None", 0],
	86163 : ["Marriage:  It's not a State issue -- never should have been.  It's a religious ceremony and the churches should define the term.  There are pro-gay churches out there.   If, however, the state contends they have a stake in marriage, they must offer the same rights to civil unions -- which they do recognize as a legitimate coupling. Trickle-Down:  Works -- most people exclude jobs and the opportunity it provides to those who need them...lower/middle class workers.  All they worry about is the extra money in their wallet.  That's not how the real world works.  If you want more money, update your skill-set, ask for a raise or get a new job.  Don't expect to get paid more for doing the same work day in and day out.  It's that \"free\" mentality that's probably holding you back -- feeling entitled to more money for doing a job the market has valued at what you're getting paid...and what you AGREED to.  Life's a b*tch and then you die -- making false claims doesn't change that.  Again -- you want more money, work for it.  Both education and other jobs are accessible.", 9216, "None", 2],

	86177 : ["They don't want government interference in the ECONOMY The most powerful economic engine in the world is the American economy. The Republicans seem to comprehend that. But, the most powerful component of that engine is the American CONSUMER â€“ responsible for 70% of that economy. Yet, the Republicans seem not to get the connection between that fact, and the fact that CONSUMERS ARE THE VERY PEOPLE THEY CONSISTENTLY WORK AGAINST! When will they learn, you can't have a good economy if it's bad for the middle class? They say they are for smaller government. But, what they mean is that they are for smaller government interference in BUSINESS. They don't want consumer protection measures, or any kind of government oversight. So, a business can be negligent in manufacturing a product and a consumer can be injured.  That consumer won't have universal health coverage; the republicans don't want them to have that.  The injured consumer can't afford the lost income from time off work, much less the expensive medical procedures they need, but when they sue to be compensated for this disaster, the republicans call that a FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT, and have taken measures to minimize financial damages TO THE BUSINESS!", 9216, "54d8bqEDaa", -2],
