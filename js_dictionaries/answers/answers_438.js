	24101 : ["Christianity-Logan, WTF is wrong with your brain? You can't conceive that two people of the same sex can and do all the time successfully raise children? Also, by removing the stigma of being a single mother, it betters society by offering her something more than shame, having to live on the outskirts of society like a pariah and opportunities to succeed. All of that helps society flourish if we actually support our mothers. As that is actually pro-life when you give a **** for mom and kid beyond the cutting of the umbilical cord. Condemning her unless she's married is just nuts. As modern marriage is still heavily skewed toward favoring the male in all ways. Women have options these days.

	24110 : ["Because some people just go to work to work and get the hell out of there. They aren't there to socialize and are not interested in being your friend. Birthdays are not a big deal to many adults. It is just another day.... kind of like the stupidity surrounding the celebration of New Year's Day. Hmm, do we celebrate half-a-year with a holiday? Why not? And what is this about a New Year? The calendar we use is ARBITRARY.", 3801, "oze7u3eaaa", 2],
	24111 : ["This might be deeply shocking to you, but lots of grown ups don't care about birthdays.  The only time I pay attention to someone's birthday who is not very close to me is when I've had crew with someone about to turn 21.

Its entertainment.  At this rate they will be editing out tatanka, bobby the brain, the sheik, and I'm not going to say more because I hope they miss most of it.  There was a heel who refused to wrestle non whites and he was my favorite wrestler in another company.

	24124 : ["There was a lot of storylines that wouldn't fly to day. Pretending it never happened isn't the way to go. It's not hard to put a disclaimer before the event. There are more offensive things in Peacock's library than any of the segments WWE has ever done. Peacock has a movie called Imperium. Which is about an undercover FBI agent that infiltrates a neo-Nazi group. How is painting half of your body black more offensive than neo-Nazis?
