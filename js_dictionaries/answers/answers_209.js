Perhaps you misunderstood that part.  Maybe they told you that if you want to be paid, you have to use those PTO benefits. It will be your choice to use them or not be paid.

Anything that you do that makes it harder for some groups of citizens to vote while others are not bothered is potentially discriminatory. You give the example of voter ID. Voter ID is somewhat discriminatory as obviously some very poor people may not be able to vote because of it, as they may not be able to afford the $40 or whatever to pay for the ID. Voter ID however is not the biggest problem.  Lets look at something like cutting voting sites by half and creating very long lines.  Who does that discourage from voting?  We all know who;;;;;people who do not have a very leisurely care free life and can easily take time off work to go wait 4 hours in line that is who.  There are many others....but the main thing you have to ask yourself is why these restrictions keep happening when we have never seen any major outbreak of voter fraud that needs to be addessed. Look man, I have to be honest with you.  Bad people with bad agendas are not honest...they do not tell you hey we want to do something very bad and we are going to be honest and tell you what our intent is. What they do is lie and make up pretexts.  So the goal is to suppress voting, they will never come out and say that. Instead they say we want better election integrity. It has gotten so bad with the lying that they now even say that the actions they take to suppress voting are designed to increase voter turnout.  That is what bad people do. Bad people do bad things and they will swear to you up and down that they are not doing what you know they are doing. You live in the world like I do.....you know exactly what I am saying.
