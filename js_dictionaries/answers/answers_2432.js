	127425 : ["The Sabbath arrangement emphasized the importance of spiritual pursuits. The first occurrence of the word “sabbath” in the Bible is in connection with the provision of manna in the wilderness. The Israelites were told that they should collect this miraculous bread for six days. On the sixth day, they were to collect “the bread of two days,” for on the seventh, none would be provided. The seventh day would be “a holy sabbath to Jehovah,” during which each one should keep sitting in his own place. (Exodus 16:13-30) One of the Ten Commandments mandated that no work at all was to be done on the Sabbath. The day was sacred. The penalty for not observing it was death.—Exodus 20:8-11; Numbers 15:32-36. God's people are no longer required to observe a literal 24-hour sabbath rest, but the Sabbath arrangement remains much more than a historical curiosity. (Colossians 2:16) It is a reminder that we too must give spiritual activities priority. Sacred interests must not be overshadowed by material preoccupations or recreational pursuits.

	127426 : ["The basic premise is wrong - there are over 600 commandments, not just 10.  These first 10 were like a \"pre-amble\", so to speak.  The rest follows. Here's the problem - if you have EVER sinned, the Law is useless - it can not grant you a pardon; it can not forgive you; it can not even make you WANT to obey; it can not reconcile you back to God.  The ONLY thing Law can do is let you know when you're guilty, and proscribe the penalty! Keeping the Sabbath can NOT save you.  And \"Those who LIVE by Law, shall be JUDGED by Law\", so if you DO keep the Sabbath, you WILL be judged by the ENTIRE Law! Oh, and, by the way, Jesus said that if you have ever been angry with another person, you're already guilty of murder; and if you look at another person with sexual desire, you are already guilty of adultery. If you STILL insist on relying on Law, you SHALL be judged by that Law, with no mercy!  (The Law doesn't allow for mercy or grace!)

	127430 : ["If you believe in microevolution you believe in macroevolution.  Macroevolution is simply microevolution on a large scale.  Applying inductive reasoning to microevolution gives one macroevolution. How am I supposed to prove this without linking to a science journal?  Where else am I supposed to get the evidence that I can use to demonstrate my claim?   There's a huge difference between citing a scientific journal and citing the Bible.   Scientific journals contain information that has been peer-reviewed and tested under controlled methods.  The theories expounded in scientific journals make accurate predictions about observable phenomena.   The Bible is a story written by people that has been changed over time.  Some predictions it has made have come true, but the majority of them have been proven false.", 10928, "None", 4],
	127431 : ["You can define words anyway you want: Christian - a blithering idiot who has no grasp of science. So why are all Christians such blithering idiots, and why do they not have any grasp of science? Evolution is evolution is evolution. If you want to claim otherwise then you need to back it up with facts: Show me the process that limits the number of changes that a DNA strand can undergo. If there is no limit then \"macro\" is just a long series of \"micro\" changes.   And you are proof that my definition of a Christian is at least partially accurate.", 10928, "GHdscZ2Haa", 1],
	127432 : ["\"Macroevolution\" is nothing more than cumulative \"microevolution\".  Please reread that last sentence until it sinks in. Pointing to scientific journals for lists of scientific evidence (which you can in turn look up and see on your own if you contact the author) is not the same as using the Bible to prove the Bible. There's a big difference between published research, and dogma that makes unfalsifiable claims and is presented as religious text.  Scientific journals are not taken as dogma.  Any credible journal will review articles before publishing, and scientists realize that they have to be sure of what they're publishing for fear of ruining their own reputation.  Science changes in the face of new evidence; dogma does not.   Evolution works in gradual steps over many generations of a gene pool, not in huge leaps over single generations.  To make an analogy: try listening to the Billboard top 10 CDs that they put out for each year.  The one from 2006 doesn't sound too radically different from 2005.  The 2005 doesn't sound too radically different from the 2004, and so on.  But the one from 1968 sounds extremely different than the one from 2006.  You can however follow the chain of influence.  When enough bands of a certain style become distinct enough we label it as a genre (akin to \"species\").  A new genre doesn't spring out overnight, and not from a single band.

Matthew 5: 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. Romans 13: 8 [F]or he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. 9 The commandments, \"Do not commit adultery,\" \"Do not murder,\" \"Do not steal,\" \"Do not covet,\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \"Love your neighbor as yourself. 10 Love does no harm to the neighbor.

	127435 : ["The Christ never abolished any law, if anything, He gave more meaning and depth to the Law. Some folks need to read this carefully without their theological bias and tradtions. Matthew 5:17-19 ESV  \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  (18)  For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.  (19)  Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Last I looked, heaven and Earth were still here and everything written in Torah and Tanakh had not been fulfilled. Some of the other answerers should read 1 John to get a better grasp of the points Paul is trying to make. It shows just what the basis is for the 2 great commandments to love God and neighbor. 1 John 2:1-6 ESV My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. (2) He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. (3) And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. (4) Whoever says \"I know him\" but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, (5) but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him: (6) whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked....3:1 See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. (2) Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. (3) And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure. (4) Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. (5) You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. (6) No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. (7) Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. (8) Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil...1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. (2) By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. (3) For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. Revelation 12:17 ESV Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.  Revelation 14:12 ESV Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.", 10930, "RgceFQ9Caa", 2],

	127465 : ["Your probably alot better looking than you think you are. Look at these so- called 'perfect' celebrities and models and not one of them is flawless- jennifer aniston is considered beautiful she married brad pitt for god's sake but if you look at her individual features- she has small eyes, thin lips, a big jaw, big nose, yet nevertheless the overall pacakage is gorgeous. Adrianna lima is a victoria's secret model and is lusted after by sooo many guys but she has big, goofy teeth. Lauren Conrad is almost perfect you could say, but she has that wierd patch above her lip that looks like a moustache!!  As for being flat chested- your still in high school you've got plenty of time to grow but nevertheless there are plenty of celebs and models who are also flat chested and they make it work for them- look at kate moss! or kate hudson, speaking of kate hudson, she also has very sticky out ears yet i bet this has never turned a guy off before, i mean they are just ears!! And she is constantly voted as being one of the sexiest girls out there. Another 2 celebs who have funny ears includes jennifer garner and julia roberts. Cameron diaz has really bad skin, nicole kidman has tiny eyes, angelina jolie has a huge forehead, sarah jessica parker has a big nose, kim kardashian has a lonnng face, paris hilton has a lazy eye.  I am not trying to put others down Im just trying to show that everyone has flaws, nobody is perfect but they are still successful and happy and make it work for themselves. And even the most perfect feel insecure and a lot of them have had surgery to make themselves feel better (when most of the time they didnt even need it) Heidi Montag, Cameron Diaz, Jennifer ansiton and ashlee simpson have all admitted to having nose jobs and they are just the ones who admitted it, Im sure you can add megan fox, tyra banks, naiomi cambell, halle berry, jennifer lopez to that list.  Half the girls you look at in school and think are so gorgeous are probably plastered in make up and have their own insecurites. If you look at thier faces carefully you can probably find lots of flaws. Also your biggest advantage is that your in high school so you should just enjoy life knowing that your going to grow in to your looks. I mean look up pictures of celebs when they were kids- most of the time they just look normal. Infact, look up pictures of celebs every day without make up on, they look normal thier too!! Sometimes horrible. As for your body, you should be happy that your normal, some girls are really, really short- not past 4.11 at a grown age! Some girls have huge hips, some have massive, wide shoulders , some have really fat legs, some have really fat arms, some have saggy boobs even though they are young, some are way too tall- like taller than guys. And of course some people are too fat and some too skinny. As for thos guys and that list ewwwww! What a bunch of greasballs!! Look at them i bet half of them are dogs. But really even if they dont find you attractive who cares? Cos for every person that thinks a person is ugly there is another person who thinks they are beautiful. Look at Giselle Bundchen- i really dont see why people think she is so gorgeous and i think she looks like a man yet my brother is crazy in love with her. And people change tastes- I used to think britney spears was very pretty now i think not. It usually has to do with personality though, seriously, I NEVER liked shia la beouff and thought he just looked like 6 year old boy. I saw an interview of his in which he was so smart and funny that im now totally crazy about him. Its usually the same for guys with girls too (well guys that matter) You'll learn more about this when you leave the jungle hell that is high school.  But you need to just let go and dedicate your life to something else, somthing more important. You know there are little kids starving, girls as young as 11 are being forced to be prostitutes just so there family can eat. Little girls and boys who are being sexually and physically abused. Whole families with Aids and who are too poor for treatment, food even water- so they have to drink dirty water.  There kids who are burns victims and yet they are so brave. Babies born with a cleft lip. People, kids, babies with cancer, kidney disease, leukemia. A friend of my cousins got an illness where all her hair fell out and know shes bald, with no eyebrows or eyelashes at the tender age of 17... And what about me? I have vitiligo- white patches all over my dark skin. Yes this isn't just your average 'I hate my nose, my ears' kind of ugly- this is a 'people on the street dont even want to look at me' kind of ugly and the people who do just stare.
