	97994 : ["sounds like Asperger Syndrome (a mild form of Autism). It also manifests another disorder called Sensory Integration Disorder (sensitive to noises (someone talking loud, whistling, someone biting their finger nails, trains, fire trucks, ambulances, etc), big crowds or a large group of people, being touched (hugged, someone tapping you to get your attention), certain smells (stronger perfumes, etc). If these bother you; you might want to consult your doctor. You could try wearing ear plugs; ear phones; ear muffles, or other devices to help keep out noise. You could listen to music. Avoid the noise (walking away- if it's appropriate). Tell the person you need a break. Nothing wrong with a break. Everyone needs breaks.  If you have trouble or difficulty with social situations such as making or establishing friendships, but going about it the wrong way, then you probably do have Asperger Syndrome if you struggle socially. I have mild autism, a higher-functioning Autism. It's difficult. I struggle with my fiance using the laptop behind me right now, playing a game (monopoly) and things are dinging, so I have headphones to block out the noise. The dinging sound drives me nuts, popped gum, someone making a squeaky sound, or a pop can opening. It scares me, makes me nervous, have sweats, and feel uncomfortable. I break down and cry from my sensitivities. Try avoiding what you can.. If you see a crowd and it bothers you, try a smaller crowd or one-on-one talking and build your way up until you feel comfortable. If you have more questions or need help, please email me at Luvs2Write16@aol.com. Thanks.. good luck! Michelle", 9647, "None", 0],

	98000 : ["We don't NEED it, but money is a convenient way to exchange goods and services. Today, money is simply paper that represents a value in the minds of the people. Because you believe that the money is worth what it is, the system works. Money used to be actual gold. The gold was kept in a building and notes were given, similar to checks, saying that the bearer (person who has the note) is entitled to so much of the gold in that building.  Since we went off the gold standard, the government just prints the money it wants and puts it out. The money is only good if you will accept it as payment. If yesterday I gave you a loaf of bread for a dollar and today I want two dollars, you have lost some of the value of your dollar. It will no longer buy a loaf of bread. The economy is based on belief that you will be able to get value for what you have. The current crisis is a crisis of trust.  The banks don't trust each other enough to lend each other money. This also means that investors don't feel that they can safely invest in business so they sell stock. If no one wants to buy the stock, the price goes down until it goes low enough for someone to buy it. That is what happened to the money people lost these last few weeks. (Sorry John, but money can just disappear.) The answer lies in getting trust back into the economy. That will only happen when people believe that the bad guys are punished and there are strong rules to prevent the problems in the future.", 9648, "22ca5581dcd0b0b383647afbd8d78ea3aa", 0],
	98001 : ["The cells in the epidermis of your skin - the outer layer - are constantly renewing themselves (a lot more quickly than once every 10 years, BTW). But, there are several cells which do not (normally) divide in the adult body. Nerve cells, for example, have extremely limited regeneration potential. The best example, however, is the lens fibre cells which compose the bulk of your eye lens: the primary fibre cells in the core of the lens were laid down 7 months before you were born, and remain un-growing for your entire life. > \"how come our tattoos and scars remain?\" Tattoos are not *inside* any cell: the tattoo ink is deposited into the skin dermis, the layer underneath the epidermis. Cells in your skin ARE constantly dividing and being shed from the surface, but this happens in the epidermis, and does not effect the tattoo in the dermis below. Obviously, if you receive a penetrating injury to the tattoo, which damages the dermis, then some of the tattoo will be displaced by scar tissue. Tattoos also blur and fade with time, as the ink is photo-bleached by UV light from the sun, and as the dye \"leaks\" slowly into surrounding tissues. Scarring is not a change to the cells themselves, it is a larger-scale change to the structure of a tissue. When a tissue is damaged, the cells divide to repair the damage, but this repair might not be perfect - different cells and ECM proteins might be deposited, and the 3D arrangement of the newly-produced cells might not be the same as the original tissue: this is a \"scar\".", 9637, "iuGEySLDaa", 0],

Not that you really are one, but it's just how you will feel.  Sure, if you're already a wealthy musician or sports figure, it may not be so difficult, but the average person needs to make a living and it will be so much more difficult to do this when you're covered in ink.

Macs are in many circumstances very heavily matched in fee for what you should construct an equivalent computing device for. the concern is, Macs are over-specced. the backside fee Mac you will desire to purchase is a much greater effective computing device than the backside fee Dell or comparable variety call computing device you will desire to purchase in spite of the undeniable fact that it additionally costs greater. The Mac would have a greater effective pics card, a greater effective no longer hassle-free rigidity, a greater effective CD rigidity, it is going to probable have DVD burner and the competition won't, etc. however, you probable do no longer choose the greater effective pics card or the DVD burner... and that makes the Mac over-specced and as a result over-priced. that is incredibly a question of semantics.

	98021 : ["There is no connection between your enlisted MOS and the branch you would be as an officer. 1.  It is just as easy to pick an MOS for Guard or Active Duty.  It depends on your ASVAB score and what MOS's are needed.  If you mean picking your branch as an officer, then it is still the same.  You will be commissioned as a military officer into a specific branch.  You would then need to JOIN the National Guard and you could go into any position if they were willing to take you.  Getting the branch is the same likelihood.  The Guard is just willing to take individuals and train them for the specific position that is needed. 2.  It is possible to transition from Guard to Active Duty.  It is getting more difficult because the military is down-sizing.
