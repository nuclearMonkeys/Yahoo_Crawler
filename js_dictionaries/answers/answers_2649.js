I agree it was stupid to go into Iraq and that there were no terrorists there when we went in. That doesn't mean they aren't there now. Getting out won't magically restore the situation that existed before we went in, even if that were desirable. You've got to make decisions based on the facts on the ground today.

Barack's difficulty is a perceived loss of journey (which i think of is stupid). Hillary's difficulty is she has all of the superficial reward, yet maximum of the rustic has a equipped-in bias against her, and he or she in no way comes for the time of as genuine. whilst she talks compassionately, she sounds disingenuous.

	138301 : ["OK, lets get started: Bush tax cuts (which McCain voted against in the Senate): \"McCain has been shoring up his anti-tax credentials, pushing to extend President Bush's tax cuts, which are set to expire beginning in 2010. Some party conservatives remain suspicious of McCain because he originally opposed the Bush tax cuts, arguing the cuts favored the wealthy and that there should be no tax cuts until the Iraq war costs were known. Now he argues that allowing the tax cuts to expire would amount to raising taxes, which he opposes. McCain, who has admitted the economy is not his strong point, joked to the small business group: \"I have never run a small, struggling enterprise — unless you count my presidential campaign last year.\"   McCain's on/off/on campaigning relationship with Bush:   On the overall Bush economic \"plans\"\" \"During the GOP primary, McCain presented his economic program as a more ideologically pure version of Bushism. Now he puts the same thing forward as a new synthesis. \"It will not be enough,\" he says, \"to simply dust off the economic policies of four, eight or twenty-eight years ago.\" Right; those other presidents had huge tax cuts for the rich combined with unspecified spending cuts. McCain's plan has those things and a joke about bear DNA. How heterodox! ...  McCain is promising to cut taxes by $300 billion per year on top of the Bush tax cuts, which he would make permanent. In addition to this, he promises to balance the budget in his first term. When asked how he could possibly pull this off, McCain has asserted that he could eliminate all earmark spending, saving $100 billion per year. ... By conventional measures, earmarks only account for $18 billion per year. ... And McCain surely won't eliminate even that. ... \"   On warrantless wiretaps of AMERICANS: \"A top adviser to Senator John McCain says Mr. McCain believes that President Bush's program of wiretapping without warrants was lawful, a position that appears to bring him into closer alignment with the sweeping theories of executive authority pushed by the Bush administration legal team.\"       and:   On aggressive confrontational foreign policy: \" Addressing the calls for change in the presidential campaign, Bush said McCain would be steadfast to one of his administration's policies. \"He's not gonna change when it comes to taking on the enemy,\" Bush said of the senator from Arizona.\"   On the Iraq war: \"Stephen Hess, a political analyst at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said that Bush's effusive endorsement of McCain was in part a recognition by the president that his party had nominated the Republican candidate who may represent the best chance that Bush's policy in Iraq will continue past 2009. McCain \"supports the Iraq policy to the fullest and has the most authority in doing it, so strangely - given their history - [Tuesday] night symbolically was very good news for George W.

	138325 : ["I want to get this out of the way: I support Hillary, so this may sound biased. Their stance on the issues are actually pretty similar. All Democrats share similar views and beliefs in the first place of course, or they would not be Democrats. The two differ on how to achieve different objectives, but they ultimately want many of the same things for the country. One of the biggest differences is health care. Hillary wants universal health care. She will require everyone to buy health insurance, but plans to lower costs, and also help those who can't afford it. Her opponents say that it is not right to force health insurance on people. Of course, if those same people had a health emergency and couldn't afford care, they would expect and likely receive it anyway, except instead of their health insurance paying for it, it will be the American tax payers. This is why some consider universal health care the only way to go. Obama wants to require health insurance for children only, and also make it so a person can stay with their parent's health insurance until age 25. He plans to lower costs, and he thinks that will be enough incentive for adults to get it for themselves too. Personally, I feel this is naive thinking - there are millions of people in this country who could easily afford health insurance, but simply choose not to have it. Lowering costs will likely change little.  They both want to get out of Iraq. Both realize it can't be done hastily, but they both plan to start pulling out troops pretty quickly. Obama spoke out against the war from the beginning, something he has repeated umpteen times, and something his supporters love to remind everyone of. Hillary, along with most of the senate (because of the lies they were fed by the Bush administration), voted for the war. She realizes this was a big mistake and, like Obama, plans to get out of Iraq.  They both want to get rid of tax cuts for the wealthy. This was Bush's doing (of course). Both are pro-choice as well. Hillary has been a little more specific about her plans, in my opinion. Obama's favorite word is \"CHANGE,\" but I personally feel he kind of glosses over exactly what change he is talking about, and how he will achieve it. He rarely goes into specifics unless pressed for them. Still, a lot of people are willing to put their faith it him and just hope he knows what he is talking about. \"Experience\" has become a dirty word lately. Many people are claiming Obama's lack of experience is a good thing, and Hillary's extensive experience in comparison as a bad thing. It is very odd. Their apparent basis for this, is that if you want change (and every sane American does after nearly 8 years of Bush), you need to elect someone \"fresh\" instead of the same old thing. While this makes sense in theory, it is probably not a very good way to pick the leader of your country, at least in my opinion. Plus, a lot of people are of the same mind as Oprah. He's \"brilliant\" and charismatic. To some people, that's what makes a great leader.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something...I'm sure they must differ on more. Still, in the end, I'd say they agree on about 90% of the issues.", 11387, "06ec886c7d8a90ee05f754772645f600aa", 0],
