I also don't like the unique plugs they use and the unique software - for iPod for example. I think in 5 years they will push too much and start lose market share and users.

The next email will be from another of the scammer's fake names and free email addresses pretending to be the \"lottery official\" and will demand you pay for made-up fees and taxes, in cash, and only by Western Union or moneygram. Western Union and moneygram do not verify anything on the form the sender fills out, not the name, not the street address, not the country, not even the gender of the receiver, it all means absolutely nothing. The clerk will not bother to check ID and will simply hand off your cash to whomever walks in the door with the MTCN# and question/answer. Neither company will tell the sender who picked up the cash, at what store location or even in what country your money walked out the door. Neither company has any kind of refund policy, money sent is money gone forever.

Do you know how to check the header of a received email? If not, you could google for information. Being able to read the header to determine the geographic location an email originated from will help you weed out the most obvious scams and scammers. Then delete and block that scammer. Don't bother to tell him that you know he is a scammer, it isn't worth your effort. He has one job in life, convincing victims to send him their hard-earned cash.

The first 'novel' I wrote was horrible, cliched, and now that I go back and look at it, very very boring.  Now, when I write, there's an actual story involved, and one that I find quite interesting to boot! BQ2: I don't think so.  Then again, I live alone, so even if I did turn into a different person, no one would notice but my dogs, and they aren't telling anyone. BQ3: I'll use Kendall for once.  He's actually a supporting character, but I just love him to death. a) He'd look for a way off first, then when he found he couldn't get away, he'd find himself a coconut and a palm tree, sit down, and wait for his dad to come and get him. b) He'd be a little put-off, then assume the flowers were for Liana and give them to his dad to pass on later. c) He'd be a little concerned, considering there's no villain in this particular story.  It would be weird if 'the world' could use a phone. d) He doesn't have any pets.  Assuming an animal he was close to died in front of him, he still wouldn't care much.  Things live, then they die and feed the earth.  It's just the way things are. e) I'm not even sure he knows his birthday, but if he did and everyone forgot, being that he's a fifteen-year-old kid, he'd be hurt.

The government should not tell individuals what to do as long as they do not harm others.  4)Marijuana can be used as medicine because it helps to stimulate apetite and relieve nausea in cancer and AIDS patients. 5)Some religions instruct their followers to use marijuana.These people deserve the freedom to practice their religion as they see fit. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that the government cannot 'prohibit the free exercise' of religion, and so marijuana should be legal. 6) While thousands of people die each day from alcohol, no one has ever been killed by smoking weed. THC is one of the few chemicals for which there is no known toxic amount. The federal agency NIDA says that autopsies reveal that 75 people per year are high on marijuana when they die: this does not mean that marijuana caused or was even a factor in their deaths. 7) Smoking anything is not healthy, but marijuana is less dangerous than tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time.", 9062, "None", 0],
