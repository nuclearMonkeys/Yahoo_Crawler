Frontline employees at retail stores usually do not have this kind of interaction from customers = so you are \"safe\" from customers. Whether you are \"safe\" from co-workers it depends on the specific situation. Be mindful that the grocery union in Los Angeles is complaining about how unsafe their situation is YET they have about 75% less covid cases than the general population. In response to the comments: a) About 70% of covid transmission occurs in the household where you aren't wearing masks or social distancing. b) covid transmission from inanimate objects within the household where people are more apt to immediately touch their face / not wash hands, etc is about 1 in 10,000 c) covid transmission from inanimate objects outside the household is a very rare occurrence. d) covid transmission is caused by respiratory droplets but you have to get enough viral load to cause an infection. Almost all respiratory droplets fall to the floor within minutes. The smaller droplets that don't, would still have to cause enough viral load. Unless you are in a very small store, that is unlikely to happen.  Few stores are small enough for this to occur. however, covid has always been a \"if I take care of myself, I don't need to worry about others\" illness. FDA approved KN95 masks are cheap and long lasting.  You can get 20 at Amazon for $40 which will last you about 400 wears. If you don't think that is enough, then feel free to add a cotton mask or face shield over it.

Do not touch the flapper but with your pointer finger rub around the opening on the top.   It may feel slimy. (That is just your water, stuff grows in it. It is not poison.) Now you will rub around the circle of the opening and in some cases you will see it change to brass.  Sometimes not.  But you are wiping off the slime build up that is holding the flapper open. which allows water to leak past and go into the septic or sewer system.  After going around it a half dozen times to get the slime off, then let go of the flush handle and the flapper flops back over the opening.  While the tank is filling you can wash the black off with soap and water in the sink.  The black is dissolved rubber. so it washes off easily.  By this time the tank should have refilled. And shut up.   Job is done.  Put lid on and flush. It should be normal. Dead quiet.  You fixed in 5 minutes. Done forever or until it leaks again so several years down the road.       You don't care. you did your job. Never touch the rubber flapper because the rubber has gone out of it.  It is now fragile like glass. Dead flat and fragile.  You finger it and it breaks then you need to buy a flapper the same size(there is 3 sizes).  I don't want to do that when it is perfect NOW.
