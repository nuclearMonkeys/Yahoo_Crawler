	125865 : ["Since you did a bunch of copy/paste and made this waaaay too long - I will do the same. And this isn't everything, either. And this is just about Peter/Popes.  Matt 16:19 - \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.\" The New Testament contains five different metaphors for the foundation of the Church (Matt. 16:18, 1 Cor. 3:11, Eph. 2:20, 1 Pet. 2:5–6, Rev. 21:14). One metaphor that has been disputed is Jesus Christ's calling the apostle Peter \"rock\": \"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it\" (Matt. 16:18). Some have tried to argue that Jesus did not mean that his Church would be built on Peter but on something else. Some argue that in this passage there is a minor difference between the Greek term for Peter (Petros) and the term for rock (petra), yet they ignore the obvious explanation: petra, a feminine noun, has simply been modifed to have a masculine ending, since one would not refer to a man (Peter) as feminine. The change in the gender is purely for stylistic reasons. These critics also neglect the fact that Jesus spoke Aramaic, and, as John 1:42 tells us, in everyday life he actually referred to Peter as Kepha or Cephas (depending on how it is transliterated). It is that term which is then translated into Greek as petros. Thus, what Jesus actually said to Peter in Aramaic was: \"You are Kepha and on this very kepha I will build my Church.\"  Not only was there significance in Simon being given a new and unusual name, but the place where Jesus solemnly conferred it upon Peter was also important. It happened when \"Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi\" (Matt. 16:13), a city that Philip the Tetrarch built and named in honor of Caesar Augustus, who had died in A.D. 14. The city lay near cascades in the Jordan River and near a gigantic wall of rock, a wall about 200 feet high and 500 feet long, which is part of the southern foothills of Mount Hermon. The city no longer exists, but its ruins are near the small Arab town of Banias; and at the base of the rock wall may be found what is left of one of the springs that fed the Jordan. It was here that Jesus pointed to Simon and said, \"You are Peter\" (Matt. 16:18). The significance of the event must have been clear to the other apostles. As devout Jews they knew at once that the location was meant to emphasize the importance of what was being done. None complained of Simon being singled out for this honor; and in the rest of the New Testament he is called by his new name, while James and John remain just James and John, not Boanerges.  There is ample evidence in the New Testament that Peter was first in authority among the apostles. Whenever they were named, Peter headed the list (Matt. 10:1-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16, Acts 1:13); sometimes the apostles were referred to as \"Peter and those who were with him\" (Luke 9:32). Peter was the one who generally spoke for the apostles (Matt. 18:21, Mark 8:29, Luke 12:41, John 6:68-69), and he figured in many of the most dramatic scenes (Matt. 14:28-32, Matt. 17:24-27, Mark 10:23-28). On Pentecost it was Peter who first preached to the crowds (Acts 2:14-40), and he worked the first healing in the Church age (Acts 3:6-7). It is Peter's faith that will strengthen his brethren (Luke 22:32) and Peter is given Christ's flock to shepherd (John 21:17). An angel was sent to announce the resurrection to Peter (Mark 16:7), and the risen Christ first appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34). He headed the meeting that elected Matthias to replace Judas (Acts 1:13-26), and he received the first converts (Acts 2:41). He inflicted the first punishment (Acts 5:1-11), and excommunicated the first heretic (Acts 8:18-23). He led the first council in Jerusalem (Acts 15), and announced the first dogmatic decision (Acts 15:7-11). It was to Peter that the revelation came that Gentiles were to be baptized and accepted as Christians (Acts 10:46-48).  When he first saw Simon, \"Jesus looked at him, and said, ‘So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas (which means Peter)'\" (John 1:42). The word Cephas is merely the transliteration of the Aramaic Kepha into Greek. Later, after Peter and the other disciples had been with Christ for some time, they went to Caesarea Philippi, where Peter made his profession of faith: \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God\" (Matt. 16:16). Jesus told him that this truth was specially revealed to him, and then he solemnly reiterated: \"And I tell you, you are Peter\" (Matt. 16:18). To this was added the promise that the Church would be founded, in some way, on Peter (Matt. 16:18). Then two important things were told the apostle. \"Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\" (Matt. 16:19). Here Peter was singled out for the authority that provides for the forgiveness of sins and the making of disciplinary rules. Later the apostles as a whole would be given similar power [Matt.18:18], but here Peter received it in a special sense. Peter alone was promised something else also: \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven\" (Matt. 16:19). In ancient times, keys were the hallmark of authority. A walled city might have one great gate; and that gate had one great lock, worked by one great key. To be given the key to the city—an honor that exists even today, though its import is lost—meant to be given free access to and authority over the city. The city to which Peter was given the keys was the heavenly city itself. This symbolism for authority is used elsewhere in the Bible (Is. 22:22, Rev. 1:18). Finally, after the resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples and asked Peter three times, \"Do you love me?\" (John 21:15-17). In repentance for his threefold denial, Peter gave a threefold affirmation of love. Then Christ, the Good Shepherd (John 10:11, 14), gave Peter the authority he earlier had promised: \"Feed my sheep\" (John 21:17). This specifically included the other apostles, since Jesus asked Peter, \"Do you love me more than these?\" (John 21:15), the word \"these\" referring to the other apostles who were present (John 21:2). Thus was completed the prediction made just before Jesus and his followers went for the last time to the Mount of Olives. Immediately before his denials were predicted, Peter was told, \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again [after the denials], strengthen your brethren\" (Luke 22:31-32). It was Peter who Christ prayed would have faith that would not fail and that would be a guide for the others; and his prayer, being perfectly efficacious, was sure to be fulfilled.", 10861, "AA11067857", 0],

Are you attending church these days?  Or a college Bible Study?  Being around other people who want to follow Christ can be a big help.  Or are those the people you were talking about in your post? If you haven't tried a Bible study, it might be a help...see if your school has a Campus Crusade: Please know that Jesus loves you deeply.  You expressed it so well when you said that you wanted to surrender your life, but you can't.  I once shocked someone by saying that other people plan on following Jesus, but I plan on NOT following Jesus.  We are so weak, aren't we?  The Bible says that apart from Him, we are nothing.  And that is so true.  Sometimes we try so hard to please Him, to clean ourselves up for Him and to get by on our own strength.  We try to make ourselves good enough, so that we will be acceptable to Him.  But the only thing that makes us good is what He has already done, the free gift He offers us, the gift of Life through Jesus Christ.   Tell Him that these struggles are a problem for you, that you want to follow Him completely, fully, but you can't.  Ask Him to change your heart.  Ask Him to make Him your deepest desire.  Know that YOU cannot do it.  But He can do it for you.  Keep asking Him to help you surrender to Him.  Keep asking Him to help you to follow Him.     Is there anyone you can talk to about your struggles?  Do some journaling about what is going on...do you have a home church away from campus?  Could you set up an appointment to just chat with someone over Fall break?  Sometimes having someone who is willing to encourage you and hold you accountable can make all the difference in the universe...It's not a sign of weakness, but strength.

Most of the Christian walk is an uphill battle against persecution and against the secular world view...if you keep the faith, you will grow stronger with time - maybe God is testing you - maybe He wants you to see how much you need to depend on Him during a time like this.

Let our focus be  on Him and What He has done for you and wants to do in you not on what others do and don't do.  Leave them to Him. He can handle them.  That doesn't mean don't witness.   It just means that they are not your focus and when you talk about Jesus talk about Him not about their wrongs.  Tell Jesus what you have said here that you want to be His all out.  He knows it of course but for your sake you need to tell Him.   Then do things that help you focus on Him and keep that focus.   For example you can play praise music in the background almost no matter what you are doing.   If you don't have a CD player or praise CD's go to   or   and look around at some of what you can hear there.  You can probably also find some praise cd's and DVDs at the library.   Gradually what goes into your brain through your ears will seep into your mind and heart and help your focus.  You can also find audio Bible on line or get Bible tapes and CD's and listen when you can't face reading.

It's impossible! I think that if you feel in your heart that you are a Catholic, even while asking questions, then you can remain so.

	125885 : ["I should learn to write as succinctly as you.    We should be known as Christians by our love for each other,  by what we do.  Our faith should be visible,  which means it should be more than only faith and feelings.  I have said before,  God did not give us feet and hands just to stand in Church and clap.  We are supposed to serve,  which is a gentler way of saying \"suffer.\"  Good works matter.  I know that because Jesus Christ himself said so,  and He said it very clearly.  Matthew recorded the words of Jesus that refer to real actual plain old good works,  for us all to read.  These particular words are not mysterious or puzzling in my opinion,  at least not the basic message.  Jesus told us to serve others out of love for God.  That is part of how we receive eternal salvation.  To our protestant \"Bible believing\" brothers and sisters,  I just don't see how this could be any more clear. THE GOSPEL OF SAINT MATTHEW Chapter 25 verses 31 - 46 (NAB  - but trust me,  it's just as plain and clear in the KJV)  31     \"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, 32     and all the nations will be assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33     He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34     Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35     For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, 36     naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.' 37     Then the righteous will answer him and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38     When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 39     When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?' 40     And the king will say to them in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.' 41     Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42     For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 43     a stranger and you gave me no welcome, naked and you gave me no clothing, ill and in prison, and you did not care for me.' 44     Then they will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or ill or in prison, and not minister to your needs?' 45     He will answer them, 'Amen, I say to you, what you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me.' 46     And these will go off to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\" I am Roman Catholic.

	125896 : ["Hi sis!  You and I both know that there is a greater, mighter, more powerful realm than the physical realm.  It is the spiritual realm.  We also know that the origin of the sun,moon, and stars and our entire solar system is the spiritual realm.  God spoke them into existence in the first week of Genesis... Well the air is the part that is under the heavens!  This is where the clouds are.   1 Thessalonians 4:17 says this....  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. So where is that place....that we will go with Christ?  Because Paul writes, \"And thus we shall always be with the Lord,\" many assume that since Christ lives in heaven, the changed saints will too. But is this assumption valid? They Bible shows that the reward of the saved is eternal life as kings and priests ruling and teaching here on earth (Matthew 5:5; Revelation 5:10). But where will the saints go at the moment of Christ's return? The clearest verses that show Christians immediately returning with our King to the earth are Zechariah 14:3-5, 9: Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as He fights in the day of battle. And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. . . . Thus the Lord my God will come, and all the saints with You [Him, margin]. . . . And the Lord shall be King over all the earth. (See I Thessalonians 3:13.) If our Savior is going to rule \"over all the earth,\" the saints will have to settle for earth too! Now comes the central question of this matter. We have just met Christ in the air! Where do we go from here? Up to heaven or back down to earth? I Thessalonians 4:17 says that we are to be with the Lord forever, but where will the Lord be? Again, many scriptures give the clear answer, but Zechariah 14:4 gives a concise one: And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, from east to west, making a very large valley; half of the mountain shall move toward the north and half of it toward the south. Could this be some \"heavenly\" Mount of Olives? No, it is the one \"which faces Jerusalem on the east\"! Could it be some \"spiritual\" Jerusalem? No, Jesus is going to split it in half! He will have arrived on earth. Who will be with Him? The second half of verse 5 tells us: \"Thus the LORD my God will come, and all the saints with You.\" All the resurrected saints or holy ones will be with Him. Will He stay on earth? Notice verse 9: \"And the LORD shall be King over all the earth. In that day it shall be—'The LORD is one,' and His name one.\" Yes, He will stay. The Kingdom of God and the reward of the saved are on this earth! As Jesus Himself tells us in Matthew 5:5, \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\" Jesus will come again to earth, this time with His saints and with His army of angels too. He will take His rightful place on His glorious, earthly throne and share power with His saints over the physical nations of the earth (Revelation 2:26-27). God tells us in Revelation 5:10: \"And have made us [the saints; verse 9] kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign on the earth.\" Wherever is the third heaven?   2 Corinthians 12:2  I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago---whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows---such a man was caught up to the third heaven.  The third heaven is where God, Our Father and His angels are.  And of course where Jesus himself sits, at the right hand of the Father, which is a most blessed place!  the Son sits at the right hand of the FATHER on the throne. This is the traditional place of power and authority. Christ laid the foundations of the earth, he possesses endless life and existence. He exercises all the power and authority of Deity!  You know sis, it is good to ask us these types of questions so that we can all benefit and have a clearer idea of just how our Lord created and separated the heavens, form the earth.  Our Lord even named  the stars and constellations.  Jesus is the Word of God which did this...as we see evidence of in many scriptures.... Just thinking about how He created the universe and at the end of each day announced it as \"Good!\"  He is so worthy of all glory and praise.  And He is our Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and earth.  Hallelujah!   God bless sis! :))", 10861, "grwtwPbAaa", 5],

	125907 : ["The four centuries between the Reformation and the New Reformation have been characterized as the time of “the making of the modern mind” by John Herman Randall and others. During the period between Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses (1517) and Karl Barth's Commentary on Romans (1919), a growing divergence between the intellectual and theological worlds set a climate of opinion that would enable the emerging scientific method to be used to challenge the authority of the Word of God within the church itself. Critics and supporters alike have come to apply the so-called dialectical method to develop their own doctrines of inspiration and authority of Scripture. However, a correct understanding of the inspiration and authority of Scripture is not properly derived by a dialectical process. The deviations and departures from the historic teaching of the Christian church concerning the nature of Scripture were challenges that caused Christian apologists to respond in defense of the traditional doctrine of Scripture. The first major deviations from the orthodox doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture emerged after the Reformation of the sixteenth century. As one writer puts it, Christians early had inherited from the Jews the belief that the biblical writers were somehow possessed by God, who was thus reckoned as the Bible's proper author. Since God could not conceivably be the agent of falsehood, the Bible must be guaranteed free from error. For centuries the doctrine lay dormant, as doctrine: accepted by all, pondered by few. Not until the sixteenth century did inspiration and its corollary, inerrancy, come up for sustained review. Even then, however, the mainstream of Christian thought continued to adhere to the doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture. Roland H. Bainton suggests that the Reformers dethroned the pope and enthroned the Bible as their ultimate authority; the principle of sola scriptura was basic to all Protestants during the Reformation era. At Worms (1521) Martin Luther (1483-1546) affirmed that nothing as to the faith can be asserted that contradicts or goes beyond Scripture or evident reason. Ulrich Zwingli (1494-1551) took his stand on the same ground at the first Zurich disputation before the city council in 1523. John Calvin (1509-64) wrestled with the identical issue; the Anabaptists were the most scriptural of all parties of the Reformation; and the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England include one article “Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for salvation.” Such a widespread and uniform attitude reflects the general sentiment of the Reformation era that the Bible alone is the complete and sufficient guide in matters of religious faith and practice. Nevertheless, the Reformation period of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was an era of creeds and confessions in which each denominational group or sect sought to articulate and to perpetuate its own doctrinal tradition. Although some of those numerous creed-forms tended to become ends in and of themselves, they were generally based on and drawn from Scripture. These more or less formal statements of faith will be reviewed as they emerged in history. The earliest of these traditions is associated with the Anabaptist and Baptist groups. These noncreedal and nonsacramental bodies tended to use confessions and declarations of faith as descriptions of their doctrinal views rather than as prescriptive formulas to which one gave allegiance through creeds and catechisms. Martin Luther has often been attacked for not holding to the inspiration of Scripture because of his criticism of certain books of the Bible. James Orr clears the air of this accusation when he writes of Luther's view of the Scriptures, “Luther's views, as his ordinary teaching and use of Scripture show, were scarcely less high; but, applying a subjective standard, his judgments on certain books, as the Epistle of James, Revelation, Esther, even the Epistle to the Hebrews, were rash and arbitrary. These judgments affected canonicity rather than inspiration.” And the explination goes on. The conclusion is: During and after the Reformation era, Christianity entered into an age of creed-forms and confessions as individual groups, denominations, and sects sought to articulate, defend, and perpetuate their own doctrinal traditions. Those more or less official and formal expressions proliferated with the spread of Christianity throughout the world in the various movements. As they are surveyed, they reflect a basic commitment to the doctrines of historic Christianity in general and to the traditional doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture in particular. “The Reformers and Counter-Reformers were disputing whether all revealed truth was in the Scripture alone, and whether it could be interpreted by private or by official scrutiny. Despite a radical disagreement on these issues both groups persevered in receiving the Bible as a compendium of inerrant oracles dictated by the Holy spirit.” The Eastern Orthodox maintained the same traditional doctrine. When placed into a larger context this limited view may be challenged by some, but the various official statements, creed-forms, and confessions of the mainstream of Christianity during the period from the Reformation to the close of World War I indicate the continued traditional commitment to the orthodox doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture. That is reflected in the nonsectarianism of Anabaptists as well as the official statements of the more creedalistic communions. Throughout its broad and diverse ranks, Christians of all major persuasions prior to World War I officially adhered to the belief that the Scriptures are the divinely inspired, authoritative, infallible, and inerrant Word of God.", 10869, "DvQLt59Paa", 0],

And you will find that when you are happy with yourself and love yourself deeply and trust yourself completely, others will too. I went through this same thing. I truly believe there's a huge difference between Christianity (the so-called Christians) and Christ. I didn't want to give up what I had always felt in my heart about Christ, but I couldn't STAND Christians! To them it's all about winning...winning the argument, winning by forcing someone to change their mind and believe like they believe, winning by changing laws that validate their beliefs. Not very Christ-like if you ask me. So, I decided that I could love Christ, but I didn't have to love (or even like) Christians. I have found it's best not to discuss religion at all, unless it's with someone who shares your beliefs. That goes for politics, too. Be kind to yourself. Give yourself a break.
