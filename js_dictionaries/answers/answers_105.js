	5264 : ["My old 75 pick up doesn't, it doesn't even have a radio (never did). But my 93 pick up, who knows? The stock unit was gone and I put in a unit that does MP3 (as well as hands free). So an old pick up might have a cassette deck in it. It might also have an eight track or just a AM radio. It might not have a radio at all or it might have a very advanced sound system because they are easy to replace. I guess I forgot to mention AM-FM radio's and stereo or mono! It might be transistorized, be a tube radio or even integrated circuitry. If there is a cassette deck or eight track, it might not work right. At one time there was even a record player marketed that was supposed to work that was installed in a few cars. Never saw one installed, but have seen ads for them. Also there was a reel to reel type unit that was used as an aftermarket unit.", 880, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 1],

When the engine is on, the alternator becomes the power source running all the electronic equipment in your car. You need to run a DMM on the battery. It should read 12.4 to 12.9 volts with the engine off and 14.4 volts with the engine on. It could be anywhere around 14 to 14.5 volts, but commonly on 14.4 volts with the engine on. If not, then you need to replace the battery for a new one. If the new battery becomes dead within a few days, then there's a problem with the alternator.", 874, "euO1RSFVaa", 1],

	5271 : ["No, cassette tapes were analog technology typically with a range of 40 to 15,000 Hz. There was ALWAYS a background hiss too. Plus a nasty tendecy to tangle up in the player. They also typically had a limited play life of around 100 plays before the hiss got worse or they failed completely. CDs are digital with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, more than twice what  humans can hear & playback frequency range is quoted as flat from 20 - 20,000 Hz. In theory looked after a CD has an unlimited life.", 875, "UQRfkEmUaa", 1],

	5273 : ["SOME people find CD sound too crisp and clear.  They prefer the tape because it is \"softer sounding\" Hell, I play 8 track tape and have listened to some songs so many times ; that when I got it on vinyl - I was amazed at the sounds I could no longer hear on the tape. (They wore off) & I never noticed.   Pink Floyd -Dark Side of the Moon.

	5275 : ["Yes, you can wire 2 4 ohm DVC for a 1 ohm load. But the problem is that, the monoblock needs to be 1 ohm stable. If not, the monoblock will come to an end. That means you will be replacing the monoblock for a new one until it is 1 ohm stable. I'd recommend getting the DC Audio 2.0k monoblock. If your alternator is powerful enough to produce 3k watts, then get the DC Audio 3.5k monoblock. Then set the amplifier's gain to match both of the subwoofer's 1.5k RMS.", 882, "euO1RSFVaa", 0],

	5281 : ["Hydrogen peroxide H2O2   kills nanoworms inside facemasks. The elite is faking that they took the real vaccine; the real vaccine will cause spiritual and physical damage. When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 889, "None", 0],
