If You Want to Pay for your Anti-Virus, I Suggest Norton 2009, AVG, or Nod32.  Remember Only Use One Anti-Virus. For Firewall: I'd go for ZoneAlarm which I also use. At first its a little annoying because everything that trys to get onto the internet pops up a window. But after telling it to allow your internet browser and this and that a few times, its a walk in the park.   Remember Only Use One Firewall. For Anti-Spyware Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (Free) & Spybot Search and Destroy By the way, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware updates like a lot like more than twice a day. Use as Many as you like. Other: Download Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool From the Microsoft Website. It Updates on the Second Tuesday of every month. To use it other than the first time, go to the start menu, press run, type in mrt, and ok then run it. ALWAYS UPDATE ALWAYS SCAN NEVER USE McAfee because it a horrible POS Idiots think that AVG doesn't work, but it does.

	141533 : ["If you want a true role-playing experience, then I would highly recommend you *consider* the merits of text-based MUDs. An added bonus is that you will find a much larger percentage of the players are girls than with graphical MMOs. This makes for a much more balanced experience in my opinion. If the idea of a text-based game causes you to groan, I ask you to hear me out.. and I say this only because if you truly want a quality RP experience, you need to consider MUDs.  I'm a long-time MUD player (22 years now), having played the following over my lifetime: Texas Twilight, Gemstone, Achaea, Threshold RPG, Armageddon MUD, and various others not worth mentioning. If you are willing to pay a subscription, then Gemstone (   ) is by far the best MUD available. This is partly due to the paid programming and world building staff and also because the price point discourages griefers and casual gamers. This MUD has been around since 1988, that's 25 years! You may rest assured that your investment will not suddenly disappear because the game flopped. If you are looking only for a free game, then I recommend Achaea (   ). It is high fantasy with a touch of the older European cultures. It also is a mature MUD (15 years) with very robust player-run cities, epic battles, and collaborative questing. (The parent company, Iron Realms, produces many MUDs, each with a different theme and emphasis. They have won many industry awards for MUD *innovation*.) Both of these games are strongly established, richly developed, and have amazing communities. Enjoy!!", 11505, "0LlfvWGxaa", 0],
