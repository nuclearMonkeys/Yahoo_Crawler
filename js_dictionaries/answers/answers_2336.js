Here's my mental picture of it- dark charcoal grey background, with all the text on the page white, except for the top of the page where it says \"the fashion blog\" which would be really big, pink, and lowercase :) I hope that made sense lol... anyways that's just my idea! You could do an outfit of the day, trend of the season, maybe a weekly \"vs\"? For instance one week it would be \"Forever 21 vs WetSeal\", then next week \"American Eagle vs Abercrombie\". You could write about the pros and cons of each store, post pictures of your favorite items from those stores & why you like them, then set up a poll where your readers could actually say which brand they like better:) so it would be interactive. You could use random pictures of popular celebrities and rate their outfit from 1-10; like that section could be called Celebs: Hot or Not? haha Idk.... Just ideas! And then try to write every day or almost every day just talking. Like, you could say \"So I went shopping this afternoon, and saw the most gorgeous boots at Express! Well, they were beautiful until I bought them and my dog ate them\" so it would be about fashion, but still fun and everyday, you know? Anyway these are just ideas!!! Good luck with your blog!!!!! :D", 10714, "None", 1],

	122627 : ["Energy healing only works by placebo - at least on humans. The problem is there is no healing energy, it is completely undetectable or measurable by science, it is totally implausible, and energy is not something that can be manipulated to perform miracles by special people. The word energy is being misused anyway - energy is a measurement, of somethings work capability.  E = MC2.  It does not exist in some pure state.  It can be kinetic, potential etc, and it can be electromagnetic, gravitational etc.   When you see the word \"energies\" being used with some healing claim, be skeptical. And the lady trying to heal the tree?  Bless her deluded soul... EDIT: Carolyn - thanks for the typical alt med psuedoscientific rubbish you have offered about how MRI works.  Here is the reality: MRI \"uses a powerful magnetic field to align the nuclear magnetization of (usually) hydrogen atoms in water in the body. Radio frequency (RF) fields are used to systematically alter the alignment of this magnetization, causing the hydrogen nuclei to produce a rotating magnetic field detectable by the scanner. This signal can be manipulated by additional magnetic fields to build up enough information to construct an image of the body\" Sounds like your black belt mate is using Chris Angel type tricks, btw. EDIT: Tony - your attack on science does not mean healing \"energy\" exists.  The fact is, all healing energy modalities fail to better placebo under blinded controlled studies.  Your argument from ad hominem does not alter the null hypothesis.", 10717, "None", 2],

	122655 : ["Nothing like a question about healing energy to get the mainstreamers to pounce! Personally I doubt that the energy healing is going to help the trees, but then I don't understand healing energy as well as I would like.  I certainly do not totally discount healing energy and note that it has been used by man for thousands of years. Those who worship the false gods of science are quick to say that healing energy is not valid because it is not scientifically measurable.  But not scientifically measureable today does not mean it does not exist. A great fallacy of the science believers who like to quote mainstream controlled and apologist sites is that they make the false assumption man has always made - that today's science is the pinnacle of knowledge and understanding, when history has taught us time and again that the science of today is usually outmoded in years to come. At one point, it was believed that the atom was the smallest particle into which matter could be divided because nothing else could be seen or measured.  Then along came protons, neutrons and electrons and they were believe to be the only and smallest parts of matter.  And that too turned out to be false. Likewise, at one time the prevaling \"science\" or wisdom held that the earth was flat and that the earth was the center of the universe which all things revolved around - and those who dared say otherwise were persecuted as the \"woo\" sellers and heretics of their day. I am certain that someday man will look back on the barbaric and failed methods in the war against cancer - where the best \"science\" has to offer is trying to cut out, burn out and/or poison out the mere symptoms of cancer without treating the actual cause of the cancer and truly curing it - as the dark ages of medicine.  But those who suggest alternatives that are often more successful and much less dangerous are called the \"woo\" sellers of today. Science has not become God, nor has it replace or surpassed God and nature, neither or which are quacks or ever have been - while what is considered science in one age often is revealed as quackery in another. Just because we do not understand or cannot measure something according to today's limited scientific knowledge does not mean it is not valid.", 10717, "Pf5LCEKxaa", -1],

If you join Twitter do searches for fashion and health & beauty, then follow those experts. Regularly 'tweet' them, 'retweet' (same as a Facebook 'like'), and treat your followers with courtesy and gratitude. Like you do at 'YA', be very concise (less than 140 characters) and use lots of web links. Also use your own 'hashtags' (eg. #WhatToWear). These will get people interacting with each other.
