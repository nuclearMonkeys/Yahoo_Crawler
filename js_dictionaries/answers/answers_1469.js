	79106 : ["Because sometimes it's interesting. I used to be a reality TV fiend years ago and this was during the time when reality programming was all over network TV. If a scripted show got cancelled because of low ratings then they'd replace it with reality TV because it was cheaper to make. There were many bombs but also some very good shows. Many of the good shows have outlasted, like Survivor and The Amazing Race, which are the only two shows I religiously watch. I've only missed about 2-3 seasons out of the 14/15 seasons of Survivor, and I only missed those seasons because I had school during those nights. There was a time when I used to schedule my college classes around my favorite reality shows, namely Survivor, lol. I'm glad it's not like it used to be, thought, and I don't watch that much reality TV anymore. Right now, I prefer hour-long dramas, but mostly I watch supernatural shows like Vampire Diaries and Being Human (if it lasts). I never really liked the MTV shows, though when I was in my late teens/early 20s I used to watch The Real World, but not anymore. Another of my favorite shows that's no longer on air: The Mole that used to air on ABC years ago. I also like The Apprentice.  Yes, many of these shows aren't real, but they are interesting. They pick the craziest, attention-seeking people because without them they'd have a very boring show that no one wants to watch. Elizabeth Hassleback, from The View, was a contestant on Survivor and one of the guest on The View mentioned how reality shows are fake and Hasselback said that no one on Survivor told her to do anything or advised her to do anything. She said it was completely unscripted.  Also, keep in mind that even if it's completely unscripted,  there's also creative editing involved. THey can take the girl next door and edit the footage to make her look like a skank. I read an interview with an MTV producer who said they do this all the time. He gave as an example a show that used to air and how they'd edit it to make the contestants seem a certain way, even though it wasn't reality when the show was taping. He said there was a girl and her best friend who was a male and the girl's boyfriend who were on the show. They did a bit of creative editing to make it seem like a 3-way love affair between the girl, her boyfriend, and her best male friend. The producer said there was absolutely no indication that the girl and her best friend were in a relationship when it was taping, but when it aired they made it seem like she was having an affair with her boyfriend AND best friend.  All for entertainment value, mind you. :D  There's no way I'd ever watch something like The Hills or Jersey Shore, or any of the Housewives shows. They seem like utter crap for brain dead people. Do you remember the show Cheaters? Reruns still air. That show was so fake. I learned this when Inside Edition did an expose on it. Inside Edition found the actual actors who appear on the show! The actors said they were paid money to pretend to be in a relationship and catch their \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" in the sack. There's the famous episode when the host, Joey Greco, gets stabbed by on of the cheating boyfriends. Turns out that it was totally fabricated! Inside Edition couldn't find any hospital records or police files about the \"incident\" and they couldn't find any evidence that the police even made a run to that location when it happened. They cornered Greco on a street walking his dog and Greco had no comment about Inside Edition's findings. My mom and sister LOVE that show, lol. I stopped watching. I will say, however, that I don't think all the episodes of Cheaters were faked, but I know some of them where.", 8973, "f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa", 0],

	79109 : ["hii..ha ha..i know its hard training a dog..but this is one of the first lessons so ur doggy needs to learn it. Yea u can try to push is rear down gently saying sit down use its name frequently! maybe with u hand u can show him toolike how to go down. u say sit. it hink it will catch it fast..maybe 1st day it wont listen to u busy wondering wut the treat is. after two days u wil see a dif. when it sits u give the treat. and also somtime u can take the treat in ur hand and say \"down\" and with ur hand put it down so it wil understand wut down means and put his head down to take the treat. once he can sit..u can ask him to give its paw. take the right paw and say \" paw....give ur paw ( use name).\" ha ha. then repeat.ask for its paw...then give treat. my adopted stray pup's first lesson was to give its paw ha ha.then i asked for the other paw so she started giving me both and hold my arms with both her paws while sitting upright on uer behind its soo touching...cute. so now shis 7 months big..and stil duzn the same..she can sitand lie. but it takes time..they are hard to train. German shep's for example are veyr clever they catch things pretty fast. but some breeds learn slower he he...dont worry u do it daily and ur doggy will learn...each time u want to give it food..ask it to sit down..then give.al the best ;o)", 8971, "oLV6uie1aa", 0],
	79110 : ["in order to get a dog to sit u need to have patience and u have to praise them, (with treats).  1) have ur dog stand in front of u, show it the treat and say sit 20) as u say \"\"sit\"\" hold ur dogs collar with ur left hand and push its butt down with ur right hand, and say \"\"good boy\" or \"\"good girl\"\".  3) after u say good boy or good girl give it the treat, that way it knows that when u command it to sit it will be praised and rewarded for its good behavior.  4) be consistant this takes time, be calm and assertive, and always have posaitive attitude, don't yell at ur dog if it doesn't follow he command the first couple times, just keep practicing... good luck!!!!", 8971, "9CmzS0dsaa", 0],

Whenever the dog sits, for whatever reason, immediately say \"sit\", \"good sit\", \"good dog\", and give her a treat and lots of praise.  The other way is to say \"sit\" to the dog and then push her rear end gently down into a sitting position.  Then praise her and give treat.  Don't do it for too long or she'll get bored! Be patient!

	79126 : ["Some people don't condone pressing down on dogs for training with the reason being joints could be harmed. If your reward timing is not exact I would try a clicker for training. Take a treat and show it to your dog, then move it above its head towards the tail the dog will be forced to sit to watch the treat. As soon as the butt hits the ground click or give it a verbal queue (good dog!) then treat. Similar for down hold your hand over the treat and the dog will have to get in a down position to get it, click when he hits the ground and treat.", 8971, "rwziaAm4aa", 0],

But if ever if it is possible to teach it, do it, hardwork and effort should do it. Seek Advice, Praise him when he does it.Sometimes giving treats would not be the best thing. He would only probably sit when he knows you have treats. Do not scare him. Or you will find it harder to teach it to him.

	79136 : ["What I have always found is helpful is if you train with treats. What has worked on all of mine and my moms dogs is... Hold the treat in front of them so they know its there and want it. Don't let him/her jump up and try to get it though. It only works if they're standing still and looking up at it. Make sure he/she's looking at it and start to move it above his/her head until he/she needs to sit in order to continue to look at it. While you're doing this, say the command sit and after a while he/she should get the hang of it. Always give him/her the treat at first while you're training. Some dogs only takes a few minutes to learn. I hope this was helpful and you understood what I meant. It's kind of hard to explain without showing someone.", 8971, "HnTOEqfkaa", 0],
