It may still be safe to use after that but that's how long it was tested. So you're looking at shelf life. Once it is opened any number of things can intrude. My outlook is I replace at or near the expiration date unless it is an edible product. I start getting touchy as the expiration date begins to approach-especially things like milk.

At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. Mr. Lebowski, he called himself \"The Dude\". Now, \"Dude\" - that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. They call Los Angeles the \"City Of Angels.\" I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I've seen London, and I ain't never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw. I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced him enough.\"", 1051, "tmjHMMYCaa", 0],

	6633 : ["Subduction is the explanation.  Sea floor keeps being made, so the older stuff has to leave.  It can turn into continent (often does) or it can get shoved back down and replace the stuff that came up from below somewhere else.  Continental material is less dense so will not subduct (get shoved downward) until essentially all of the surface is continent, and even then it probably won't subject, but would instead keep stacking up on the surface, getting thicker and thicker.

They can do an x-ray and order an MRI if needed.  You can also rent crutches from a pharmacy like CVS if you need to.  Most sprains (stretched or torn ligaments) will heal on their own.  If you tore it all the way through, surgery will eventually be required but most orthopedic specialists will have you wait at least a couple of months to see how it heals.  ", 1083, "RVK1NrNJaa", 0],
