I have no magic wand that will open a place just for you and your boyfriend.  And if there are underground places opening in defiance of Heath rules then it's up to you to locate them if you are so desperate for a haircut. Reality check: EVERYONE is shaggy or cutting their hair at home or asking people they live with for home haircuts. The only real viable options are border hopping to a place that's not locked down or do it yourself.And reccomending  border hopping as an option is a bit of a grey area when it comes to virus protection but whatever.  So I repeat:  Hop on a GO and take it to Guelph or somewhere that's not locked down. One of the towns on the Barrie line maybe. Or watch a whole bunch of YouTube videos, grab a pair of scissors and give him a DIY haircut. I watched a bunch of videos  and so far I've done my husband, my son, his son, my other son, my dad, my mom and my brother. And myself.

My parents used to inform me that if I needed to escape a building for any reason during the night, it would look far better if I was suitably dressed. My reactions was that I would be able to run a dammed site faster naked than being concerned  about my pyjamas.

When a girl removes her pubic hair, or a man insists on it, it is because they want the female to look like a pre-pubescent girl. There is something kind'a sick about that idea! It is a matter of personal choice. But when  you see a line-up of vaginas, and they are all shaved, it is so wrong! That looks very unnatural! Something is wrong here. But YOU need to decide.
