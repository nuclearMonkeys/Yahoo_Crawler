Most vehicles have headlight and wipers switches somewhere on the turn signal bar, although in REALLY old vehicles, it's actually a button o the floor that you step on. High beams are usually turned on by pulling the turn signal bar toward you. Emergency flashers are usually located somewhere on the dashboard, usually as a push button. Heater/defroster switches are usually located on the console to the right of the driver, often below the radio/CD player.  They can be dial or slider switch.

This is a well-known issue, that we're all currently experiencing.  Sadly, these problems have been ongoing since March. It seems to be a mix of issues such as poorly created firmware on the SuperHub (a new firmware R29 is apparently being released soon to resolve some issues), P2P traffic management and possible over-subscribed UBRs causing massive latency and jitter.  All this is a result of Virgin Media using substandard hardware/firmware and trying to cram even more customers onto their network.  To make matters worse the problems seem to occur regardless of what product you are on and to add insult to injury, VM seem to be denying that any problem exists at all, despite there being literally hundreds and hundreds of reports.  A petition has also been set up here in this thread to raise the issue with CISAS: Also, could I point out that upload speed has very little effect on the performance of online gaming, as it doesn't require that much bandwidth at all. A 10mb line is all you should need. The most important factor is latency, and how much ping and jitter there is over your connection.  If you're not too tech-savy, a popular site to check this on is www.pingtest.net. I find the Milton Keynes server to be most accurate. Hope I've helped and pointed you in the right direction!", 10176, "hbfaqRkyaa", 0],

Next, divide the triangle into three triangles by drawing three lines, each from the corner of the triangle to the center.  Now, you have three congruent triangles, each measure 120º x 30º x 30º.  You'll notice that the lines you drew each equal the radius of the circle. Next, take one of the 3 smaller triangles, and draw a line that separates the triangle into two equal triangles.  Now, you'll notice that each of the two smaller triangles measures 30º x 60º x 90º, and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangles is the radius of the circle, and the longer of the legs is half the length of the side of the original equilateral triangle.
