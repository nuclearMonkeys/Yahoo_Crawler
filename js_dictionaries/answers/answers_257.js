So no, I would just shake my head. Masks are not as big as in the US. I wear them when its difficult to keep the social distancing (crowds, commuting, smaller shops). However, In Sweden, we have a different approach  and are more disciplined - If Sick or having slight symptoms, Stay HOME. Just having a slight fever, people won't let you in stores, venues etc. No \"I've a medical reason, I can't wear one\"  Karen excuses... Somebody I know use those plastic shields (vizors) instead because her skin get irritated of them. Rather than masks, people get confronted if standing too close.

	12869 : ["When playing against a computer, the computer will announce check first (as the King is threatened) before announcing checkmate (the player cannot neutralize threat to the King by any mean) immediately afterwards. Most players will usually say \"Check & Mate\" or will reserve declaring checkmate as they have to review the opposing player's options to ensure they cannot get out of check before declaring mate (or checkmate).  If the game is timed, players may mutually stop the clock to access the state of the board as there's only 3 ways to get out of check. 1) Moving the King to a safe space, not threatened by an opponent's piece. 2) Capturing the piece threatening the King 3) Blocking the threat by moving another piece between the King & the opponent's piece. In the cases of double-checks, Option 1 (Moving the King) is typically the only viable option since there's 2 pieces threatening the King at the same time.  Option 3 (blocking) isn't available since you're only able to block one threat.  Option 2 (capturing a threat) is rarely available since you would have to move the King to capture one threat & evade the other threat.  It's noted that it's impossible to get triple-checks or higher under standard rules as it would require a player to move into check (which is an illegal move). IF the player can get out of check, they resume the game & make a valid move they discovered.  Otherwise, they confirm the checkmate & end the game. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PUT THE KING IN CHECK FOR ONE MOVE BEFORE GOING FOR THE CHECKMATE!  You can put the king in check & then confirm they're mated before ending the game. The only time the game would end in a draw after a check is if the player moves their King out of check & the opposing player moves their pieces to prevent the King from moving, but not threatening their current position AND that player has no other pieces they can move (since players CANNOT pass their turn under standard rules).  Such actions occur when a player is inexperienced OR made an end-game blunder.", 2156, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", -1],
