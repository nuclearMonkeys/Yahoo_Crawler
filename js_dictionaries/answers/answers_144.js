	7202 : ["Not really. There is evidence for interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the Middle Paleolithic and early Upper Paleolithic. The interbreeding happened in several independent events that included Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as several unidentified hominids. Although the narratives of human evolution are often contentious, DNA evidence shows that human evolution should not be seen as a simple linear or branched progression, but a mix of related species. In fact, genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in human evolution. Furthermore, it is argued that hybridization was an essential driving force in the emergence of modern humans.", 1154, "HhZT5dqFaa", 1],

	7213 : ["That is because ever since our species first evolved, we have been hunter/gatherers. We humans have adapted to a hunting strategy known as persistence hunting. Persistence hunting means the hunter(s) induce prey to spint and run for safety. Then the hunter follows the prey and make it sprint and run again. After several episodes of such sprints, the potential prey will overheat or build up too much lactic acid and become disabled. Because of the need for easier child birth. women have wider pelvises, which make their legs spread out more and as a result, women are not as efficient as runners. Therefore men by necessity had to do most of the hunting.  When agriculture is invented, the work in the field is also done mostly by men. Therefore when there is overpopulation, it is men who are forced to migrate and look for new land to cultivate to make a living instead of staying at home, where there is enough people to cultivate the fields already. ", 1161, "None", 0],

People who are adapted to a warm climate tend to have long arms and legs, a slender torso to maximize body surface to lose excess body heat quickly to prevent heat stroke. Since future climate is unpredictable, we do not know how our body shape may change. If global warming continues unabated, we will likely see more people born with longer arms and legs and a slender torso, and little fat under the skin (which can lead to flatter buttocks), but it may take hundreds, even thousands of years before noticeable changes can happen. ", 1155, "None", 0],

That is the time when females start to menstruate, grow the mammary glands, grow pubic hair.  Males experience an increase in male hormones and their penis increase in size. Both genders start releasing pheromones to attract the opposite sex. The armpit and pubic hair traps the phermones to make them last longer. When the phermone is consumed by bacteria, body odor is produced. Children have no phermones and no body odor.
