	29592 : ["The key question is whether or not she's a strong woman. Ex's are often ex's for a good reason. May I suggest that the first question to ask yourself when considering whether or not to date someone is, “Is this person a strong person?” If they're not, no matter how much you like them, how much they like you, or how “cute” or “hot” they are, - please don't date them. A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money). My suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you're not already), forget about this girl unless she's a strong person, and eventually look for this type of girl (otherwise you're setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately this type of woman is difficult to find - but save yourself the heartache and don't settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps! PS Here are \"21 tips that could help you to attract a strong person\" from the book True Love Lasts: 1. Take the time and put in the effort to become a strong person yourself (this is the most important tip) 2. Put yourself in as many situations as possible that will allow you to potentially come in contact with other strong people - community service organizations, the library, high school or college clubs, the “Y” or other workout facilities, religious book studies, coffee shops, non-alcoholic parties, bookstores, concerts (wear a good pair of earplugs to protect your ears from permanent hearing loss), co-ed recreational athletic teams, community service projects, mission trips, volunteer service, etc. Try to get to know other people as much as possible without dating 3. Be cheerful, approachable, and friendly - smile regularly to put others at ease (let people see your positive attitude) 4. Take a real interest in getting to know others. Ask people an open-ended question about themselves in order to get them talking. Share things related to what's been said as needed to keep the conversation going. Then ask them another question 5. Be polite and kind to everyone - even to people who you don't like or enjoy being around 6. If you decide to not accept a request for a date, do it in a kind way (being rude isn't a good choice and it doesn't help you - word about it will get out and you'll become less approachable) 7. Be confident about yourself - if you're trying to become a stronger person each day, you already have a lot going for you 8. Be humble - don't act like you're Miss Charming or you're Mr. Wonderful 9. Don't be concerned about whether or not someone likes you 10. Have the attitude that if someone doesn't like you - they don't really know you 11. Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep (at least nine hours for teens, at least seven hours for adults according to the experts), exercising regularly (if approved by your doctor), and eating a healthy diet 12. Develop a good sense of humor - including the ability to laugh at your own mistakes 13. Be known as a hard worker 14. Dress well and dress modestly at the same time (wearing seductive clothing doesn't attract another strong person) 15. Pay attention to your appearance, but don't obsess over it (remember that strong people are attracted to other strong people, they're not too concerned about looks - because they realize that looks fade with age). If you use makeup, make sure it's not excessive. Use perfumes and colognes sparingly - if at all 16. Truly care about other people 17. Stay in close communication with real friends who can help you through the ups and downs of life and hold you accountable 18. Be patient - real friends can help you with this 19. Persevere - please remember that almost nothing worthwhile is quick and easy. Please don't settle for dating a weak person 20. Don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to date you 21. Don't act desperate for a date", 4593, "U4o8Bs4xaa", 0],

How can RussianOrthodox get some justice? RussianOrthodox Metropolitan Ioann Snychev was poisoned/murdered by Jew Putin (aka Shalomov) because he refused to work for Jews. KGB poisoned Putin; Putin died in 2007; now doubles (who wear latex masks) pretend to be Putin. Medvedev is David Aaronovich Mendel. Jews murdered Tsar Nicolas 2nd's family; Jews bled them for six hours according to ritual. Tsar Nicolas' family was sacrificed by Jews (they bled 6 hours); their remains were burnt; their blood drank; ashes from remains were sprinkled onto 50 hard-boiled eggs (dish called scido Amafreikis) [50 egg shells were found outside the place of ritual murder]. Also, decapitated Tsar's head (which was grey ... hair turned grey when he saw his kids being knifed).. Ritualistic murder... (blood libel is same thing as anti-Semitism ... a lie by Jews to flee justice). Jews came up that Tsar's family was shot. Tsar appeared to warn that whosoever worships false remains will become possessed by demons (this just happened like a decade ago ... maybe less)… Jews collect heads of leaders because they believe in reincarnation. How about Jews coming up with a mocking holiday April 1st because resurrection of Jesus happened on that day? Jews came up with mocking holidays 23 February (Day of Soviet Army) which was capitulation by cowards in Tsar's army… or March 8 (international Woman's day) which celebrates lesbian/prostitute Klara Tsetkin and Rosa Luxembourg. Three biggest saints in heaven (in this order): TheotokosVirginMary, John the Baptist, and Tsar Nicolas 2nd Four biggest sinners in hell (in this order from the bottom of hell moving up to our level): Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin You could joke that Marx is a bigger sinner than Engels because Marx fooked Engels but how is Lenin a bigger sinner than Stalin when Lenin was fooked by Zinoviev (even by Bronstein once)? Lenin's brain was the size of walnut. He had syphilis. Was alcoholic. Born from incest degenerate family. Was in insane asylum. Wife Kruspkaya was probably lesbian 'cause what normal woman would stay with him? According to Russian Orthodox researcher Grigoriy Klimov, three stages of degeneracy are 1)sodomy (69, anal, oral, masturbation, pedophilia, incest, necrophilia, beastiality, orgies, hand job, bj, even all non-missionary positions between husband and wife, etc.) 2)insane asylum 3)physical deformities in kids (eyes looking at different angles, wolf jaw, rabbit lip, horse foot, different length limbs, etc.) all these accompanied by drug/alcohol abuse Jews have like six times more degenerates than other nations because they don't have monkhood. Jewish degenerates become politicians (or similar high rank in society). In Germany during Hitler time, it was eight times. Hitler, Stalin (aka Jugashvilli which means son of Jew), Roosevelt, Churchill were all Jewish degenerates. Hitler had many Jewish coworkers as homosexual partners. Stalin was expelled from seminary for sodomy. A few centuries ago, angel appeared to Orthodox Christian community and said not to buy from Jews at bazaar because it's sprinkled with blood (something like that) Those were facts… and now for some Conspiracy Theory: Elimination of comments on Yahoo Answers means that Project Pogo is completed.
