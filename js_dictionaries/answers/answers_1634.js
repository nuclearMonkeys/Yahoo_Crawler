Science states theories based on fact, religion states fact based on hearsay.  And of course science can disprove religion.

When investigators flew into space, and found that the world was not set on a turtle's back, that disproved a native american religion.

	87374 : ["look up the dictionary to find that religion is a set of beliefs that deals with nature, cause, and purpose of the universe. science is pretty much the same at its core, though there are some important differences for example, religion typically use supernatural agencies to explain whereas science may use theories to explain. you are also right that science cannot disprove religion. science typically rely on the observable, however that does not disprove unobservable or supernatural. in fact, in many sciences, advanced theories and derivation, one assume supernatural or imaginary things to arrive at an answer that's found observable years later. there are many interesting paradoxes to solve. although not proven at high level, people have proved that formal systems of knowledge is incomplete and/or contradictory.", 9260, "lQZ73aTpaa", 0],
	87375 : ["You are right to point out that at the foundations of science there is a set of beliefs that hold the system together. You are further right in noting that there are many parallels between science and religion. They are both social institution that unify a group of people toward some common end, giving the people a sense of cohesiveness via a set of values and shared beliefs. Scientists and followers of science and people who are unwittingly indoctrinated into the ways of science have a strong tendency to distance themselves from religion and note the ways that each institution is different, and of course there are vast differences between the beliefs and methods of science and the beliefs and methods of religion. The repulsion that both groups feel toward one another is incredibly disturbing to me. Science-minded people often have a knee-jerk reaction to being identified with religion because relgion often, in virtue of its methodologies, goes against one of science's key values, which is objectivity. Of course, in any social arrangement, true objectivity is impossible to achieve, but that is why it is an ideal, a standard to live up to. Science adopts this value because of the methods it employs in order to establish truths. Since this is a question and answer session and not an essay writing contest I won't go into the details of their differences. But a few good places to look are Thomas Kuhn's, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Karl Popper's, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, and various philosophic texts that have been cornerstones for modern western thought such as Des Cartes' Meditations and Hume's Treatise on Human Understanding.  What is important to note is that science is a methodology aimed at discovering facts about the world by collecting evidence through experiment like a detective so that scientists can propose explanations for how the world might work, where as religion often seeks to develop a belief system that answers questions like, what is the meaning of life, or how should I live my life? Both religion and science rely on philosophic investigations and conclusions in order to establish their linguistic structures, note though that science tries not to rely on the contents of its theories as core beliefs but on the features of its methodology. In my personal life, having been raised Ukranian Catholic and having been trained in science my entire life and having earned a B. A. in philosophy, I find that both systems cover two entirely different realms of inquiry, and that disagreement between the two is merely a consequence of those who have not taken the time to thoroughly investigate the matter. Often problems arise when people in religion or in science make claims that are beyond the realm of their methodologies.", 9260, "oKzlHvXpaa", 0],

Science encourages doubt and questioning, religions typically do not.

Religions usually refuse to acknowledge the very possibility that one of their beliefs is false, and someone who produces a convincing argument demonstrating such a belief to be false is more likely to be labelled a heretic than rewarded for his or her contribution.

	87400 : ["_____________ Is the Bible true? ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Did you know that the Bible is self authenticating? You may think how could this be or what do I mean? Well let me explain….. The Bible is comprised of Hebrew in the Old Testament and Greek in the New Testament.  The Hebrews and the Greeks use their alphabets as their numbering system. This means that their words also represent numbers as a co-incidence of this previous fact. This system of interpreting words as numbers of significance is known as Gematria.  For example the number *eight* in the bible is a number that represents a new beginning.  The name Jesus in the Greek is Ἰησοῦς where the letter Ἰ=10   η=8  σ=200  ο=70   ῦ=400   ς=200 ….thus the total for His name is 888. This can be sourced at the following unbiased links…. Now this in itself may not be that surprising….. But this principle has been applied in a similar fashion to the first verse of the Old Testament and the first verse of the Gospel of John in the New Testament….both verses relate to Creation and Origins.  The results are surprising to say the least.  The author claims there is a 1 in ten billion chance of it occurring.  The formula that is applied is kind of suspicious but since it is the same formula applied to both verses the result achieved for both verses is so unique it is undoubtedly the hand of God. The results are 3.141554509 and 2.718312812 for Genesis 1v1 and John 1v1 respectively Which is the value of Pi and e within 0.0012% and 0.0011% respectively! If you are interested in understanding the details please visit this site…..  ____________________________________ Further….the Gospels can be validated thus.... ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Matthew describes Jesus as a King Mark describes Jesus as a Servant (humble) Luke describes Jesus as the Son of Man (Perfect) John describes Jesus as the Son of God Matthew = Purple = Lion = Royalty Mark = Red = Ox = Sin/Sacrifice Luke = White = Man = Righteous John = Blue = Eagle = Heavenly The colours(& tone) are those used in the Holy veil in the Temple. 2 Chronicles 3:14 .....  The animals are those represented by the Four Living creatures..... Revelation 15v7 .....  Ezekiel 1v5 ......  __________ Further…… ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ The bible continually weaves facts with indescribable codes and symbols that over a period of approximately 1600 years leaves no doubt as to it's author. The first Prophet of note in the Bible is Enoch.  He named his Son Methuselah.  Mut is the Hebrew word for death and Shalach is the Hebrew word for sent.  Prophetically his name means it is sent when he dies.  The year that M@thuwshelach died was the year the flood was sent. Similarly…… If you take all the names of Adam through to Christ it is a hidden gospel message.... ________ Further… ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Isaiah is a mini-bible comprising of 66 chapters each representing the 39 documents of the Old Testament and 27 documents of the New Testament.... …6 is the number of man. _______ Finally…. ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Without even touching on all the fulfilled and yet to be fulfilled Prophecies contained in the Bible it is without doubt the Word of God. One example is Israel becoming a Nation on Pentecost 1948... Isaiah 66v8 ….  >>>-----   -----<<< please watch God Bless. Anticipated Comeback…… The formula is consistent for both verses......if it was a different formula for each verse I think there would be a case to dismiss it. Firstly.... English is not *alpha=numeric* like Hebrew and Greek.   Secondly.... Let's say you achieved a particular result for this post with a particular formula.....let's say the result was Pythagoras Constant  [√ 2].   Let's then take another post and apply the same formula.....and the result was the Golden Ratio [(1+√ 5)/2]. What then would the relationship be between the two? The significance of Pi and e is the formula known as Euler's Identity..... e ^ (π i) + 1 = 0 Quote[Euler's identity is considered by many to be remarkable for its mathematical beauty.

You see no matter how much time goes by that people live here on this earth there is something that will never change about us that makes us all the same.

Oh, and since 'straw men are not good enough', do you think you could stop your friends using straw men arguments against theists?  The are so dreadfully tedious! Edit: since you ask, if you want to argue against a particular position, rather than just insult it, you need to criticise it from a position of knowledge, not ignorance.  To give an example, people think Dawkins is Oh So Clever at debunking Christianity (in particular).  But he isn't.  Sorry atheists.  Dawkins knows almost nothing about Christianity, and most of what he writes is simply wide of the mark.  He describes what he thinks Christians believe, then shoots them down.  Since the description is wide of the mark, the argument is ineffective: it's the straw man argument all over again.  His 'God Delusion' opens with the hope that any believer reading it will be an atheist by the time he gets to the end.  I can't answer for others, but my thinking on getting to the end was 'with enemies like that, we don't need friends'. Disagree with me if you like (most atheists do when I criticise them - they prefer to give criticism rather than take it) but many theists think Dawkins does theism a favour because his arguments are so weak. Having said that, I am NOT saying that theism is the only tenable position.  It isn't, and I respect atheists, particularly when they show respect in return, and if they don't try and tell me what I believe and why it is wrong. Now watch the thumbs down roll in! Edit again.
