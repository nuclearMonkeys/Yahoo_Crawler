If the nest have eggs or babies i would leave them till all has left the nest. When all nests have been cleared then get one of those fake owls and put that near your patio. The birds are afraid of the owls cuz they eat the birds. But if you do this without checking the trees for nests some birds might return to there nests or you will have dead babies and might encourge rodents to come into the yard.

I'm sure you drive a car, purchase products that were made and transported by things that produce toxins as byproducts, do not compost or recycle every little thing you can, buy products that promote deforestation, animal abuse, etc. God forbid someone smokes a cigarette. Get off your ****ing pedestal. If I want to light up outside or in a business that shares a similar mindset, I should have every right. If you don't like it, don't go to that establishment. I smoke casually (3-5 cigarettes in a week). To the asker, unfortunately the loudest people are normally the ones heard. The people that feel their rights supercede others rights.

The Supreme Court used the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to apply many, but by no means all, of the Constitutional protections to the states.  You'd have a hard time making the case that the constitution forbids smoking bans...though many such bans could be seen as violating the 9th amendment's implied rights.
