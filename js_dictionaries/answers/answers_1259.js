	68491 : ["I don't know what others think but I have lost almost all interest in this series.  I used to watch every race - now I watch less than half of them.  So the thing needs a brand new identity and I think they will get one.  I think the new car will certainly help (and hopefully they incorporate this good idea eventually into the big boy series).  I think they will continue to allow Cup drivers to compete but on a limited basis of some kind and they will not be eligible for the championship.  I used to argue that these guys were good for the series but I've changed my tune.  College football does just fine without Brady and Manning suiting up on Saturdays.  This should be a series where we are introduced to the new stars of Nascar. Now it's a place where stars we already know go and where stars of yesterday go to die.  I didn't watch.  I was at work. :(  Good to hear Kyle finally got him a win in that series though.", 8461, "W2R8TRDmaa", 5],
	68492 : ["Hopefully, they will tell the Sprint Cup drivers to either race strictly in the Sprint Cup series or change to the Nationwide series.  Part of the lack of interest in watching the Nationwide series is that a Sprint Cup driver always wins the race, therefore not giving a Nationwide regular driver a chance to win.  It's a waste of my time to watch a Nationwide race if Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski or other Sprint Cup regulars are in it because there's a 90% chance that one of them will win the race because of better experience.   If Sprint Cup drivers insist on competing in the Nationwide series, they should be allowed to claim winning the race, but not allowed to get any points toward a championship.  The points should be given to the highest finishing Nationwide regular driver. To answer the extra question:  No, I didn't watch the Nationwide race Saturday because I had better things to do than to watch a Sprint Cup driver spoil it.", 8461, "lduhtkwZaa", 3],

Did you know that the folks who are claiming 12/21/2012 are nutjobs, and the LHC critics are cranks who protested all the previous colliders, which of course never produced any stranglets? So no, the LHC is no threat. It will be invaluable to our understanding of how the universe formed, as well as to understanding what the universe is made of.

Nothing will happen at CERN, and as the scientist an the program said, that is the best possible outcome because it will mean they need to learn more.

I don't know if it will be dooms day, BUT something big is going to happen. The earth makes a full rotation on its axis (called something like parabala?), the sun, earth and the center of the Milky Way are all in perfect alignment, the winter solstace... all the same time, on the same day?
