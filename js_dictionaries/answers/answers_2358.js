	123723 : ["The incumbent's admin can tax & spend all the way to 99%, the spending & borrowing will not end cause when it does end no more free money & services. Entitlements are like the childless woman willing have a neighbor or sisters baby cut in half just so neither of them will have a baby to raise in the end. Basically if it's not your earned money & sacrifice who cares how much deeper in debt you get into. The business of self righteous, sanctimonious image is what sustains debt through over indulging entitlements, community reinvestment act, sub prime loans, over spending, debt ceiling increase, foreign aid, & nation building is to flood the world with currency created through debt. Debasing currency & inflating cost or value of goods, commodities & cost of living.  When andrew jackson paid off the deficit there were no social entitlement spending. Paper money particularly the U.S. dollar, is only a certificate of value (promissory under government) that deflates in value as more are printed by government out of nothing turning every ones earnings & savings into ashes. For it to have some worth or value the money created has to be borrowed. Sanctimonious, self righteous, & entitled attitude could care less about how much they spend & borrow as long as they get to live like kings until there are no more wealth to redistribute where rationed redistribution are all there is left, like USSR, Cuba, & N. Korea. Increasing spending & the deficit faster & higher above previous admins for which spending of 3 trillion in 8 years becomes 2 to 3 trillion annually & so on, more than previous admins combined, doesn't speak much into the commitment to pay off its creditors loan. The deficit is speeding towards quadrillion, but that would mean that may take $25 million U.S. for $1 Australian dollar, destroying every ones earned savings & wealth like in Zimbabwe were 25 million of their currency is only worth $1 U.S. Dollars, & even worst with the Weimar Republic that eventually lead to True Socialism. Massive debt means massive inflation. To Big to fail, cronyism, especial privileges/interest, bailouts, subsidies, & loopholes is the stuff of socialism/communism. Through this the rich stay or get richer being bailed out every time they miss manage their company to ruin.  No one can ever be fired & the Company can never be out of business. No restructuring, no layoffs, & no competitions just the way GE, GM, Solyndra, AIG, Power Solar, Warren Buffet, George Soros, Richard Trumka, Andy Stern, & Fanny mae/Freddie mac (exempted from regulations) likes it.  Buffet & Soros influencing political policies ensures them where to place their investments for investment in commodities, precious metals, etc. is how they make their money just as george kaiser  was ensured when solyndra received its huge loans. To let too big to fail entities go under means an more efficient equal or smaller competitors has a chance to climb up the ladder to take over the seat once held by too big to fail entities. Illinois increased tax to 66% income tax only to give subsidies, waivers & tax breaks to keep the big guys from leaving. Dems creates Over reaching regulations to create loopholes, waivers, & bailouts so they can stick their hand in the corporations pockets & keep corporates/special interest in line for their favor.

The former's economic policies had set a record of 52 straight months of job creation! January 3rd, 2007 was the day the Democrats took over the Senate & the Congress. 1. Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee, & 2. Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. Where the major economic meltdown started 15 months later.

The innocent taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for incarceration of the guilty 4.  Victim's families have to show up to parole hearings (as they did in the Manson slaying hearings). ////// Recent DNA evidence proved that many prisoners were completely innocent, and, in some cases, innocent people were put to death.  The system was (and likely still is) broken.  Yet it is the best system that we have. Courts often reject evidence.   THE OKLAHOMA FEDERAL BUILDING BOMBING CASE: In the Murrah bombing case (Oklahoma City, 1995), McVeigh was not the bomber.  Jose \"Joey\" Leon was the bomber.  Leon and his uncle, Mr. Kintop (both of Anaheim, CA and Kingman, Arizona) then plotted the Hyder derailing to divert and dissipate 100 FBI agents looking for Leon in Kingman in connection with the Murrah bombing.  The FBI issued a $2,000,000 reward for Joey Leon, but Leon was never caught.  I was at the Hyder planning meeting. When the Murrah bombing case went to trial, lawyers knew that they could not get a death penalty conviction of Timothy McVeigh (Leon's best friend prior to the bombing) unless they made McVeigh the lone bomber.  To do this, the prosecuting attorney had to lie through his teeth, ignore all witnesses (about a dozen recognized Jose Leon's white hat with a purple flame pattern), and then dream up fairy tale evidence. McVeigh did decide to blow up the Murrah building, and did test bombs, with Leon, in the Kingman area (designed to focus the blast), but McVeigh quite definitely was not in the bomb truck when Joey Leon drove it to the Murrah building.   A few days after the Murrah bombing, Joey Leon told me that the fuse doused when he lit it inside the cab of the Ryder rental truck, so he had to go to the back of the truck to relight the fuse, then he ran.  I have a lot more info about all of this, but I'm trying to make a different point. My point is that the court rejected the testimony of all witnesses.  Just what kind of investigation ignores everyone who knows anything?  Why ignore a dozen people all telling the same story about a man in a white hat with purple flame patterns, and olive complexion (which Joey got from his father's roots in Guam)? The postal worker who recognized Joey's hat and green dragon tattoo was forbidden to testify because she was a Federal employee.  That is the worst excuse I've ever heard of.  So much time elapsed that Joey was able to remove that tattoo. Daina Bradley was a victim of the explosion.  Her two kids and mother were killed, her sister injured, and the doctor standing on her leg pinned under concrete said that anesthesia might slow her heart rate and kill her as he cut her leg off while she screamed for him not to.  The doctor was afraid that the quaking building might collapse and kill them.  In court, Bradley's testimony was ignored because the court said that she was traumatized by the tragedy.  Bradley tried to testify that she saw a dark skinned man with a white hat and purple flame pattern get out of a yellow Ryder truck, go to the back, then run, just before the explosion (this is exactly what Leon said happened).  The people who rented the truck to McVeigh also said that there was a dark skinned man with a white hat and purple flame pattern who rented the truck with McVeigh.  How many witnesses have to say the same thing for the court to believe them? ////////// We can't trust courts.  We must convict those who are definitely guilty.", 10757, "None", 0],

Every copy I've ever had has been a certified copy.  If he provides a copy certified by the State of Hawaii, is this not sufficient? Many states due to the cost of storage, and volatile nature of paper over a long period are digitizing their records. If you want a copy of your birth certificate, they don't send you the original. My parents never had originals. We only get copies. The originals (at least in my case) probably no longer exist, except on microfilm or as a digital image.  This does not mean I was born in Kenya.  I hope you have some other reason to believe this claim because to assume \"lack of original birth certificate\" = \"foreign national\" is without reason, or logic.

Hawaii will send a certified copy if you pay them $10 and provide the correct info.  It's a State record.

Don't forget that the Lorentz transformations, and their physical meaning, are implied by the postulates of theory of relativity (one of the postulates is that speed of light in vacuum is constant for all observers), and therefore we cannot choose the transformations as we wish! They are given, and known, and do not contain rotations around time axis... You might benefit from reading the Wikipedia articles on \"Lorentz transformation\" and \"Lorentz group\", they are correctly written (I summarize below). These will show you explicitly the form of all possible Lorentz transformations. There are many transformations, but they can be grouped into classes, where each class represents a physically different type of transformation. For instance, rotation around x-axis by any angle, and rotation around y-axis by any angle, are all obviously physically the same type of transformation, so we can group them together under the name \"spatial rotations\". All Lorentz transformations are some combination of six elementary ones: 3 spatial rotations, and 3 boosts. Why 3? Because rotations are in 3 spatial dimensions (there are 3 independent axes, say x, y and z). Also there are 3 spatial dimensions along which you can boost (again x,y,z). Boosts represent changing to a reference frame that moves with a constant velocity. These boosts mix space and time coordinates, so you can view them as mapping distance in space into distance in time and vice versa. But this is not a rotation around time axis (which wouldn't change the time coordinate). Notice that combining rotations and boosts can give you transformations in which the new reference frame is both moving with a relative velocity, and rotating, with respect to the original reference frame.", 10760, "rzAP5yjDaa", 0],
