	116035 : ["There are a couple of basic issues you will need to deal with.  First, the deck will probably require a building permit.  Building without a permit may affect your home owner's insurance and cause legal problems with your town.  They can force you to take it down, after it is built.  You have to build to meet code.  Even if you decide to not pull a permit, building according to code will ensure that the deck is safe and that it will stand up to your local climate.  Essential parts of the code vary by region, to accommodate climactic variances.   Style is another issue.  You have given us no insight into what you want.  Your choices are almost limitless.  Start with basics like deck height, approximate size, height from the ground, and interior/exterior access.  Move on to decisions like finish.  Do you want a natural color, a paint, or a stain?  What kind of railings do you want?  Do you want the deck/tub to be screened from view? Style is also a big deal on the inside work.  Look at your house.  What kind of look would fit the area?  Do you want to use a framed or a frameless cabinet?  You can even mix styles.  I've done some nice jobs with frameless open shelving over framed bases.  You need to do some home work, to be sure you understand your options.  Good luck.", 10452, "24a0e92730d86ca53f9e5467414cb0aaaa", 0],

	116078 : ["The best wood to use is maple.  This is because of the tight grain.  It is very tough to stand up to the punishment of cutting, without getting cut.  If you use a different wood, you can have cuts or a open grain structure that will allow bits of food and stuff to collect and rot.     Once you have the wood, you will want to construct it so that you are cutting on the \"edge\" grain.  Will \"end\" grain will hold up to lots of different types of applications and cutting,,, it is porus and will allow food material to soak in.  That's why you need the \"edge\" grain for butcher blocks. You will season the top, and use a cooking safe oil.  Lots of kitchen shops and big box stores to help out with this. Since you are soliciting lots of different ideas,,, I would recommend against a butcher block top built into the counter top.  It's going to be harder to clean, and harder to maintain when it is built in.  Also, you will always have to contend with the edge where the block top meets the counter,,, and the collection of food and moisture.   Get a top that \"sits\" on the counter.  Install or repurpose a base cabinet into a tall thin cabinet.  Some people call these baking sheet cabinets.  But I store my butcher block top, my tempered glass top - (use it to put hot stuff on), and my baking stone, used for dough.   If you are dedicated to put in the top,, look at purchasing an existing top, and then installing that.  Here is a link to a simple one, that should serve that purpose. Good luck,,, good cooking,,,", 10453, "pTXDREEPaa", 1],
