The only good think happening  now if that people are recognizing this double standard and starting to address it.  This double standard has changed greatly from 30 years ago.  In another 30 years I'm willing to bet that it will be nearly non-existent (or highly ignored). EDIT-- Actually, COLDGREY, that is not true (from an anthropology view).  There are some societies that believe in shared paternity (meaning the society believes that a child can be born of more than one father).  In these societies, it makes MORE sense for the women to have more sexual partners because, once she has the child, it has been proven that those children with  multiple \"fathers\" fared far better than those with singular fathers (they had more food and provisions).  While it is scientifically proven that more than one man can not father a child, this is their belief and shows that the idea of roles of father/mother/child relationship is a social construct more than a scientific one.

In this context, with literally ALL the resources available to the state and at their disposal to prove that the crime happened, it is very reasonable to assume that they would be able to prove it (beyond reasonable doubt) at a much greater rate if it truly did happen in many/most of those cases. Since they aren't doing that, it's very reasonable to assume that in a significant number of those cases (the rest 92% who get charged but don't end up convicted), the crime of rape has not happened. That said, again - I won't speculate on the exact numbers. Edit: \"Falsely accused men is a drop in the bucket\" No evidence for this. Read my answer for an explanation. \"when you consider how many rapists get away with it\" It's impossible to measure how many \"get away with it\". A certain number most certainly does. Those stats you show are a mockery since they are based on self-reporting data and subjective definitions/interpretations of the word \"rape\". Basically they anonymously ask women were they raped and conclude that each and every one who answered \"yes\", truly was raped. Or they ask women to describe certain \"edgy\" situations from their sexual past and conclude for many of those situations - RAPE!, pretty much without ANY credible evidence. Again, given that the number of those charged for rape (where there is at least a certain degree of suspicion by the DA that rape truly has happened, if there wasn't any suspicion they probably wouldn't charge the alleged rapists), only 8% end up being convicted, it's reasonable to assume, even less of those not reported, if they were to be reported, would eventually end up being convicted/proven to be guilty (beyond a reasonable doubt), and in that way it would be proven that rape truly has happened. For the rest, and that number would probably be above 95%, it would be very reasonable to assume that in a a significant number of those cases, there was no crime at all, otherwise with literally ALL the resources available to them and at their disposal, the state would be able to prove the case at a much greater rate. The numbers you cite are inflammatory, dishonest, biased and simply - wrong. \"Why do you show no concern for the victims?\" I do. For both those who are raped and those falsely accused/convicted; but we, as a society, can't go on and knowingly produce new false rape accusation victims just because rape victims exist. We simply don't have that right! We should focus on persuading all the alleged rape victims to report their cases, keep their info private (if they want it), never shame them and give them all the support of the system WITHOUT EVER trampling on the rights of the alleged rapist. Consequently, we should also focus on investigating whenever there is a suspicion of false rape accusation and charging those where the state believes they have a solid case, again WITHOUT EVER trampling on the rights of the alleged false accuser.", 10420, "WrrA88l1aa", -1],
