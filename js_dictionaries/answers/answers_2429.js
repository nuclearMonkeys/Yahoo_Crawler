If one actually thinks about what the Christian church is selling, the absolution of all sins at death, simply by acceptance and repentance at death.

One the other hand if one accepts that they are damned then were is the motivation to repent? The concept of going out \"with a bang\" is attractive to those who consider themselves lost to mainstream Theism. Atheists understand that there is no \"get out of jail\" card waiting for us as there is no hell as it is mankind who requires a sense of \"justice\" so that they can feel more comfortable in their existence and in their and he death of others. At death we are all responsible for our actions in one way or another, for that which we do in this life and in the next. No gods are required for it is the natural laws which govern the universe and all that it holds not any of the thousands upon thousands of gods mankind has created and worshipped in our attempt to feel more comfortable in our ignorance of that which we find significance but can not understand.", 10938, "xgkTMnXHaa", 0],

It is the best one we got going with what we know with the given information. It says nothing or even implies that if or if not there is a G-d. So the answer can be all behind the motives of either side. If someone dares to ask questions about evolution that should be allow and that is good science.  If there is good proof out there that shows problem with the theory it should be tested and see where it leads us. Not just dismiss as junk  because we don't want to hear about it.

When people are confronted with Scriptural facts they do not believe, they resort to proof texts, assumptions, inferences, poorly drawn conclusions, and other things in order to circumvent the facts of Scripture. What you have cited here are proof texts. Mt. 5:17.  You assume that Jesus is talking about the legalities of the law, but the context does not support this view. There are no laws codified in the prophets.  You cannot destroy or fulfill in the prophets what is not in the prophets. Rom. 7:12.  The law did exactly what it was intended to do; it brought all under sin.  It rightfully and justly condemns transgressors.  Is that what you want, condemnation?  II Cor. 3 states the old covenant law had a glory, fading as it was, yet what glory it had was nothing compared to the glory of the new covenant. Mt. 5:19 says \"these\" commandments, and not \"the\" commandments.  It relates to the commandments Jesus proceeds to give His followers where He alters old covenant points of law beyond \"jots and tittles\" (in relation to your first proof text) and even negates a point of that OC law. Mt. 19:17 is taken out of context, and ignores the conclusion of the matter later in the same chapter.  No one will save themselves as a result of keeping the commandments seeing as no one can keep them perfectly, as required.  It is \"impossible\" for men to save themselves.  It is only possible through God and what He does.  Recall that the man asked Jesus what he, personally, could do that would result in his salvation.   The old covenant ended. With it went the conditions of that covenant. This includes the ten commandments. .", 10930, "AA10471892", 0],

A week in this case is not 7 days, but 7 years and 70 X 7 = 490 years, so 490 years after a particular event, which will be discussed in verse 25, there will be an end to sin, iniquity of Israel will be forgiven, everlasting righteousness will come to exist..Daniel's vision will be sealed and a holy place will be anointed... 25 Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto one anointed, a prince, shall be seven weeks; and for threescore and two weeks, it shall be built again, with broad place and moat, but in troublous times. The event is the restoration of Jerusalem...the building of the new Temple--the anointed holy place...490 years after this order is approximately 30 years AD/CE--and we know a particular event happened around that time--Jesus began His ministry. 26 And after the threescore and two weeks shall an anointed one be cut off, and be no more; and the people of a prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; but his end shall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. This verse says clearly, the city and the sanctuary-the Second Temple-will fall at the hands of the people of a prince--and 70 AD, after Jesus' crucifixion, the Romans came and conquered and destroyed the Second Temple...at this point, Daniel's vision seals the date for the First Coming--the end of sin, the end of iniquity...and while man will continue to sin, in this world, those who are of another world, of the spiritual world, will be saved...  27 And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week; and for half of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease; and upon the wing of detestable things shall be that which causeth appalment; and that until the extermination wholly determined be poured out upon that which causeth appalment.'

I have the honor of being raised by parents and relatives who made their offspring realize that regardless of who we are and what we look like ... all people are important.  We all count as a viable part of this beautiful earth.  God created it for all people and most of us understand that even though we often forget it. In answer to your question ... I was pleased to watch a Super Bowl where two outstanding head coaches (who just happened to be black) competed for the title of best in the world.  I'm speaking of Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith who were the coaches for the Indianapolis Colts and Chicago Bears.  I put it down as a simple coincidence and prefer to think of it as a regular game ... not one between two black head coaches but a game between two teams with outstanding players, staffs and team histories.   Just like Coke and Pepsi ...   Two big boys battling for the top spot.   To those who think that it's a way of trying to be more important than others ... it really isn't.   The vast majority of holidays in this country are centered around those who aren't black who just happen to be in the majority.  That's ok ... I'm not offended ... neither should anyone else be.  As a people blacks were/are a major part of this country's history though not always in a positive way.   If a day is created to help bring about a positive way of thinking for people who's past was a part of suffering/degradation (I'm talking about those who's history included slavery and everything that went with it ...) then I'm all for it.  It doesn't make us better nor worse than others ... It simply gives us something to look forward to to help improve our outlook on life.  Nothing more.        As far as two black head coaches playing for a title or a black head coach trying to win another title ... look at it this way.   Fritz Pollard   was named the head coach of the Akron Pros in 1922.  As far as I know he was the first and only black to coach a pro team.  From 1920 until 1932, some 13 Blacks suited up in the NFL. ... But after the 1932 season, NFL owners voted to ban Blacks from the NFL. At the time, Joe Lillard   ) and Ray Kemp   were the only remaining Blacks in the league. In 1946 the league was re-integrated. Woody Strode   (#27) and Kenny Washington   signed with the L.A. Rams, while Bill Willis   and Marion Motley   signed with the Cleveland Browns. The four players were the first Blacks to play in the league since 1932 ...  Yes it is interesting.  Yes it is important.  But not so important to the exclusion of others.  We need to get to a point where we root for the teams we love regardless of who coaches and plays for them.
