Dad gave me his watch to get rid of me.  Little Johnny was extremely impressed with this idea, and extremely jealous of Jimmy's new watch. He vowed to get one for himself. That night, he waited outside his parents' bedroom until he heard the unmistakable noises of  lovemaking. Just then, he swung the door wide open and boldly strode into the bedroom.

	80723 : ["They are a form of population control. Wars have been started to unify populations in a cause distracting them from the terrible way they are being governed, they stimulate economic growth and end downturn. Unemployment falls, production soars, no-one complains. The many fight the battles for the few.  People were enslaved by wars. Nazism and fascism are ideas. They are still around. The Second World War was NOT fought on an idealogical basis. Thats propaganda. Communism is an idea and a system still current in the world, certain countries are still governed by this system. The only \"war\" fought against it was the American invasion of Vietnam. Don't get me wrong people have been killing each other for various reasons since the dawn of time I'm not going to get all moral about it. Its just the people who say that wars are good are those who were on the winning side. And rarely the same people who fought in one. ", 9039, "dFY8BOFlaa", 0],

While that's hard to comprehend, we're only human, and humans fight; sometimes we only debate (an intelligent argument), and sometimes we pitch grenades at each other (war). In most cases we feel the need to protect ourselves and the only way we know how is to fight back. While fighting WWII may have seemed morally wrong, the execution of millions of people simply because of their religion dwarfed regular fighting.
