When in reality, we don't know near as much as we think we do.  But, finally it's our choice to blindly follow this sites or not. Pro-wrestling was seen as a very exciting TV product in previous eras' only because the fans watched it \"clean\", unlike the \"internet-spoilt\" product nowdays. But the good side is that the internet has also increased our passion for pro-wrestling. Not only are there huge archives to see matches from all over the world and from decades ago up to the present, the internet also makes it possible to meet and talk with other wrestling fans. Most of us don't have a large community of wrestling fans to interact with, but we all have the internet and it's easy to find others to speak with, about pro-wrestling.

They mixed in the usual \"Israel is awful\" commentary, but if you listen, they also didn't support Hamas, complained about Hamas & more importantly, on an international politics front, they supported Israel's actions. They did against Hizbollah too. There's another conflict in the ME that's very old, but heated up recently that's changed the dynamics completely.  Namely the Shiite-Sunni conflict is part of the ancient \"who will dominate the region\" conflict between Arabs & Iranians.  Iranians are NOT Arabs.  While the alliances have gotten more creative, with Shiite Iran in bed with some Sunni groups... there's a split in the region. Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon (non-Hiz factions), Saudi Arabia & a few others are afraid of Iran going nuclear & Iran's intent to take over.  On the other side, Iran has allied with Syria, Quatar, Hamas, Hizobollah (which is run as an extension of Syria's goals to own Lebanon as well.)  There is some alliance with Al-Quada in that 2nd group. So, obviously the chess game is much more complicated than the media presents it.

	138269 : ["Ruined depends on your point of view.    There is no doubt that the internet has changed wrestling.  The kayfab story lines are now almost impossible to pull off with any surprises.   Undertaker was ticked when news of his wedding to Michelle McCool was leaked, when he was supposed to be in a comatose state, according to the storyline on smackdown.   However, since most of the wrestling fans are aware of the scripted storyline nature of the business, few people care if they hear spoilers.  This also gives more priority to the action, and the match should be the most important thing.   I love good, surprising stories as well as the next world-famous detective, but the action is what gives wrestling a feel of spontaneity.   There is also a lot of difference in how a wrestler's popularity is judged.   Once upon a time, crowd reaction and ticket and merch sales were the only way to judge popularity.  Now there is facebook and twitter, and the countless spoiler sites you have mentioned.   The backstage realities of superstars are more visible than ever.   All of this means that the management can see trends in fan reaction, and make judgments based on more information.   Not that all of these comments are viewed as serious advice, but trends can be seen that may indicate the views of a larger portion of the audience.    This can be good or bad.  It means that we, as fans, have some measure of input, but it also has led to a lot more control on the part of the creative teams, as opposed to the wrestlers themselves.  I believe that the wrestlers should have a bit more input and control, as they did back in the war eras, but that is just an opinion. There is also the WWE sites.  They can use the sites to push the propaganda they wish us to see, and also to determine popularity based on hits.   What matches and shows get the most clicks?  What superstars?

	138273 : ["Shalom! Many of the Arab nations bordering Israel are home to large numbers of refugees who have travelled to them from Israel, and whom live in vast refugee camps. These people form a vast drain on those nations' resources and one of the reasons that they are opposed to Israel is simply that, if Israel was destroyed, these refugees would return home; thus saving their host nations a very great deal of money. Whether or not they genuinely care about the Palestinians is open to argument - my personal belief is that Israel shows more care towards them than any of the Arab nations (and would argue that Israel is the only Middle Eastern nation with any true human rights policy to counter any accusation of Jewish bias) and that the Arab nations oppose Israel only due to their wish to avoid having to foot the bill for the refugees rather than due to any real concern for their welfare - that's why any support that the Palestinians do get tends to take the form of weapons to Hamas and other groups rather than food and medicine (though I should also point out that many non-governmental humanitarian organisations such as the Red Crescent do provide real aid). The Gulf states, though wealthy and undoubtedly more democratic than certain other Middle East nations, are by no means democratic in the way that those of us in the West and Israel understand the word (if anyone doesn't agree that Israel is a democratic nation, I recommend you go to Tel Aviv and stand in the street shouting about how the Israeli government denies you your rights. Now go to any of the Arab nations and try shouting the same thing abou that nation's government. Note that this experiment can only be carried out this way round, because the very long prison sentence in an Arab prison will severely hamper your attempts to carry out the Israeli part).
