Personally, I wouldn't abort as I don't see Down's syndrome as a severe enough disability to justify it. In another two weeks, your baby is viable and stands a good chance of survival outside of the womb. Several babies have survived in neonatal intensive care units from 22 weeks gestation onwards. Whilst there are some health complications sometimes associated with the syndrome, a lot of Downs children live extremely happy lives. I've known several in my life and I can honestly say that they were a lot happier than most of the unaffected children I know. They are also very loving. My mum knows a Downs lady in her late twenties who is actually an actress and has her own home. I would suggest you talk to a counsellor before doing anything drastic as they are impartial and can offer some really good advice. In addition to this, you could go and see your doctor and find out what caring for a child with Downs actually involves. At the end of the day, this is still your baby. Abortion is not something to be taken lightly and can cause you permanent psychological damage. If you decide to continue with your pregnancy, whether it is difficult or not, you will adjust to having a child who needs a little extra care. I hope you manage to reach a decision that you are happy with and wish you all the best for the future.", 9678, "None", 0],
	98950 : ["I'm not sure about thread worms...but this is what I found about round worms. A large percentage of puppies and kittens are born with microscopically small roundworm larvae in their tissues.  The larvae got  there via migration through the mother's tissues right into the developing pup or kitten in the mother's uterus!  The worm larvae can also be transferred to the nursing pup or kitten from the mother's milk. The larvae make their way to the intestinal tract where they can grow up to five inches in length.  They start shedding eggs and try desperately to keep house in the small intestine of the pup or kitten.  The eggs that the adult worms pass in the stool can now reinfest the same pup or kitten or other dogs and cats if somehow the egg-bearing stool is eaten.  When the worm eggs hatch, larvae  are released internally to migrate to the animal's lungs where the larvae (remember, the larvae are microscopic in size) are finally coughed up, swallowed, and finally grow up to adults in the small intestine.   If that can happen with puppies then babies shouldn't be too far off.", 9678, "AA11022786", 0],

	98954 : ["It's all moot, because Jesus never even existed.  Furthermore, no gods even exist. All reliable evidence points to Jesus Christ being just a myth.  There is no reliable evidence that Jesus even existed, and significant evidence that he didn't.  The evidence is in the Bible, the other religions of the time, and the lack of writings about Jesus by historians of the time. The story of Jesus can be shown to be just a myth created to fulfill prophesy, cobbled together out of  stories from the Old Testament and previous gods and myths -- created in the 40's and 50's by Paul of Tarsus (who exhibited symptoms of epilepsy and had delusions of Christ talking to him), the other apostles, the unknown authors of the gospels in the 70's or later, and many other people.  The reliable evidence for this is overwhelming. For the evidence, see the links. -", 9681, "qVG5GJdPaa", -4],
	98955 : ["First of all, not all Jewish people rejected Jesus as Messiah. The early believers (in the thousands) accepted Him as Messiah. The entire New Covenant scriptures were written by Jews. I am Jewish as well. Second, many were looking for a Messiah who would get ride of the Roman soldiers. Jesus came to get rid of a more important enemy - the sin inside each of us. Third, The Jewish Bible clearly tells us that the Messiah would have TWO roles to fulfill (most completely miss this). In Judaism - there is Messiah ben Joseph and Messiah ben David. A suffering Messiah and a Reigning Messiah.   There is no arguing this fact.  Ancient Rabbinical writings reference this concept many times (although they reconcile it as two different people). However, you cannot reign over people who have sin - so the first thing was to be the suffering Messiah and take away our sin.   Again - most completely miss this or else they would realize that Yeshua (Jesus) is the Messiah.    They only put HALF the prophecies down (Reigning Messiah) and then claim Yeshua did not fulfill them.   (Ever fly on a plane with only one wing!?) Here is the OTHER HALF of the story that you do not get from them.  According to the Jewish Tenach (Bible) Messiah would be… • Born in Bethlehem..... The Jewish prophet said so in Micah 5:2 • Born a descendant of David..... The Jewish prophet said so in 2 Samuel 7:12-13 • Live a sinless life..... The Jewish prophet said so in Isaiah 53:9 • Do miracles like Moses..... The Jewish prophet said so in Deuteronomy 18:18 • Enter Jerusalem on a donkey..... The Jewish prophet said so in Zechariah 9:9 • Arrive after King David died..... The Jewish prophet said so in 2 Samuel 7:12-13 • A rejected man..... The Jewish prophet said so in Isaiah 53:3 • Die as a substitute for others..... The Jewish prophet said so in Isaiah 53:5 • Rise from the dead...... The Jewish prophet said so in Isaiah 53:10 And even MORE important.............. • Messiah was to arrive BEFORE The Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E..... See -> Daniel 9:26 • Messiah was to have an impact on all nations..... The Jewish prophet said so in Isaiah 49:6  If this is not Yeshua -- who else could it be? And this is just the start…..!!   The list goes on and on, There is not a shadow of doubt - Yeshua (Jesus in Hebrew) was/is the Messiah of Israel. Leviticus 17:11 tells us that it is blood that makes atonement. If this were not so - why would God even have had almost a whole book of the Torah (Leviticus) which deals with blood sacrifices and how they make atonement. This is what I have done. Over 26 years ago I accepted the Messiah as my atonement and it was the BEST decision of my life. Not that every day is all roses (it's not). But I have a peace that surpasses all the problems of this world. And when I die (as we all will), I know that I am ready for the next world (Olam Ha-Ba) because of what the Messiah has done for me. He has taken away all my guilt and given me forgiveness. Atonement. That's what the Messiah came to do. (read Isaiah chapter 53). **************************************… Dr. Michael Brown has given definitive answers to virtually all of the arguments using Rabbinic (Talmudic) sources and a correct interpretation of scripture that even the ancient Rabbis agreed with!

Cotton gloves may help prevent night-time scratching. Wash them daily. Bath or shower immediately on rising each morning, washing around the anus. General personal hygiene measures — encourage all the time for all household members: Wash hands and scrub under the nails first thing in the morning, after using the toilet or changing nappies, and before eating or preparing food.
