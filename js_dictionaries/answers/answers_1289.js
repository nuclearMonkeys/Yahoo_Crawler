	69997 : ["It's times like these that try a woman's soul. Like many problems, there are multiple pieces to this one that need to be looked at. The first part is the inherent contradictions between our natural tendencies and our learned behaviors. Your natural tendency is to be taken care of and you make this abundantly clear in your explanation of the situation. Your learned behavior is that, due to the fact that men and women are “equal”, we should both pay our equal share when we go out to dinner. The resolution to this contradiction is to correct what we mean by “equal”.  Equal is not equivalent to “the same”. Men and women are not the same. Duh. Equal means that we all get treated with the same level of dignity and respect in the workplace, in public and at home. If you and a guy do the same job, you get the same amount of money. When you go to cast your vote, it counts the same a man's vote. When you sit down with your spouse to discuss the budget, he can't say “because I'm the man” when he allocates $1000 for new golf clubs. The second part of the problem arises from your boyfriend's tendency to want to eat out a lot. That's not your choice, it's his. It would be cheaper to buy the ingredients at the grocery store and go home and cook it. My suspicion is that even if you were splitting that cost, it's cheap enough that you wouldn't mind, and you might have leftovers and leftover ingredients that mitigate the cost even more. So here's what you do. Tell him if he wants to go out (and you don't), he pays. Tell him you can make a date out of going to the grocery store; splitting the cost of dinner (or lunch or breakfast…); and staying home and cooking. Make sure he does his share, too, like either cooking or cleaning up. How very equal! In addition to being a date, this will actually serve several purposes since you get to interact with him in domestic settings that can tell you a lot about his personality. Going out to dinner and a movie is easy; it's staying home that's hard. Think of it as an interview, and if he fails, you can find another one of him in a minute, because after all, you're “gorgeous”.", 8535, "pKGZGe1Gaa", 2],

People in highschool sometimes have that silent pact that they both pay. But some couples (as they get older) tend to fall into the habit of letting the guy pay. this is usually cuz theyve been togther for so long, or theyre just more romantically inclined to do it. Just one thing that dont look right to me. HE always asks you to go out? Do you ever say no to him... that youre tired, or you just dont want to. Or are you always forced (in case it affects the relationship) to accept and go? (and pay) Another thing is that some men (actually most men) tend to pay because:  1. the macho effect...they have to pay to avoid looking like jerks. 2. cuz they love you (and theyve probably goe a lot further than you have with this guy). BTW you havent been together that long (no really... 4 months usually isnt). wait a little. And do you really beleive that his talk about money being tight is all BS? it might not be. but just in case, dont go out next time... or ask HIM out... have you ever done that? Im telling you to ask him out cuz when you go on a date you arranged, even if you have to pay you tend to feel its your responsibility (opposite of what you were feeling). I think whatever the payment methods are, it should be a mutual understanding... and both should follow it. I guess youll have to wait till his wallet gets loose again before finding out whats going on. even when youre 30, you sometimes go through a career change, or have a demotion, and that sh1t counts against your income. see what problems he's going through at work.

	70019 : ["There is no best option.  It is about learning any of the quality applications and knowing how to make it do what you want.  As long as you're acheiving your artistic vision than the software is good enough for you. Professionals on the PC will use Avid Media Composer.  That is the big boy on the block in Hollywood and in NY film scene.  It was there long before FCP even existed.  The learning curve for it is hard though.  And it is not perfect, its just been around a long time and lots of facilities and editors are familiar with it.  Until recently it was quite costly. Commercials, Wedding Videos, Corporate Videos, and similar level sized projects might use Adobe Premiere Pro.  Not many professional houses use it, but there are some.  But that is because of some bad business decisions by Adobe, not because the software is lacking.  The current version is fully capable.  With a professional video card you can even output to professional broadcast decks.  Also, with the Adobe Production bundles, you could get it bundled with the motion graphics/compositing tool After Effects.  Those two programs a lone would make the Adobe line a strong choice on the PC Prosumer/Consumer level option would be Sony Vegas.  I hear its quite easy to pickup and use.  It is also apparently okay in terms of the feature set.  I don't think its quite as robust as Adobe, Avid, or FCP, but none-the-less a capable option. After that there are the cheap/free options like Windows Movie Maker and AVS.  But I wouldn't expect a lot of robust features with these.
