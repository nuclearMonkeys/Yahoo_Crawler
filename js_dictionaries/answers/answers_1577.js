	84517 : ["Obama`s politic is to push through million page bills and rush both Houses to approve it when nobody has been able to read through the whole thing. As usual he is rushing Congress to approve his Health plan, but it`s being thoroughly looked over with a magnifying glass. The Congress and Senate are finally getting it that WE THE PEOPLE do not want unread bills to be passed. Just yesterday, the responsible media informed that Obama`s health plan will only cover 1/3 of uninsured \"Americans\", those are probably the illegals that Liberal Democrats like Obama love so much.  It has also come to light that he wants to destroy the Social Security Act and Medicare to pay for part of his multimillion a year Health plan and that the elderly will be put in a waiting list for medical service. I guess he has not had the \"Experience\" of dealing with millions of very angry elderly Americans, most of which voted for him. It`s going to get real ugly for the Impostor in the up-coming days. Obama is the biggest liar in the world, he lies more than the boy who cried wolf and Americans are slowly coming to understand that he is the worst President to ever sit in thwe White House. In less than 2 months he quadrupled the national debt. In less than 5 months he has caused over 6 million job loses. I guess that when he talked about change, the only change that was going to take place was the color of a US President. He has spent more money than the combination of all US Presidents, starting with George Washington`s administration. Where all those trillions have gone, only Obama knows, to to[p it off he continues to borrow from China. I hope he is dumb enough to not know what comes after trillions because if he does, his socialist regime will hand us over to China as American debt slaves.", 9166, "None", 1],
	84518 : ["Both It is not solely the gun nor solely the human. Killing someone with a gun is simply done by pulling a trigger. You can't take it back. Stabbing someone would be different, because it involves truly having total control over the situation. A gun is just a trigger. Once it's done, it's done. But then again, it is not entirely the gun's fault. The person was the one who decided to pull the trigger. The person has the brain, not the gun.", 9165, "Hkmpa8xYaa", 0],
	84519 : ["It's the bullet. But the bullet was an instrument used by the gun, which was used by the human to kill someone. The bullet can't kill anyone without a human making the first move.", 9165, "k5aFYr2oaa", 0],

	84522 : ["If one seeks to understand Obama's true meaning you have to listen to what he says, then take the true meaning to be the opposite.  Example, \"I do not want to run a car company.\"  Then the government went into the auto business as a proud majority owner of GM. Therefore, saying his medical plan will be \"fully paid for\" means that it will be just like Medicare and Medicaid - seriously in the red.", 9166, "None", 1],
	84523 : ["It's impossible for him to create a medical plan that will be fully paid for. Where is he going to get the money to make this happen? China basically owns us because were up to our a** in debt.", 9166, "fH5aQ5Ulaa", 1],

	84526 : ["The human, because they choose to pull the trigger, the gun was just a tool for it. Like when you hang a picture frame. YOU use the hammer to beat the nails in... The hammer and nails are just your tools, ultimately YOU do all the labor. My thoughts though", 9165, "TznK0HTsaa", 0],

	84542 : ["Since Hillary has not yet hung up her gloves, and the bell hasn't rung, the champion, being a true champion of experience and skill, is not letting his guard down. The chance that Hillary can take the nomination depends on something outrageous happening out of the norm. Wishful thinking and bogus numerology won't get you to the white house, unless you are Jeanne Dixon and Nancy Reagan is your client. THEN, you get an audience with the president. Oh, how ODD that the republicans worry about who influences a president when their last best leader was actually influenced to take action by an astrologer. Lord, have mercy!", 9170, "None", -2],

Hillary is not a a racist and does not go to a White Sepremacy Church, and has not written racist books, but Obama has and does... Go figure who would have believed a racist could get the Democratic nomination, and yes, that does not go over well with whites and other races.
