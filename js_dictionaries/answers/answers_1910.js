The California border has been a hot bed of violence for years and it is getting worse.   Not even safe to go to Baja anymore due to so much anger and senseless blood shed over the marijuana trade.  There are far more important issues for law enforcement to be concerned with than marijuana possession and distribution which should for all sakes and purposes be legalized and sales and marketing regulated by states.  Obama should leave the legalization of it up to the states. Marijuana  and health care  reform are two issues which seem to scare certain factors of our society mainly the pharmaceutical industry and insurance companies.  Why?  Well, for one thing, marijuana is a threat to the drug industry as it stands today and health reform is a threat to insurance companies.   Why can't we give marijuana a chance and why can't we give the public option a chance?   If left up to the American people, they would be voted in a heart beat, no hands down.   Do we really have a democracy or are the insurance companies and big pharm going to rule out world forever?   Do the American people really have a say in the matter?  It does not seem so.  More legislative power should be given to the states if Washington cannot get their act together to make appropriates decisions that will help the American people.", 9770, "CfGsdH9qaa", 0],

The majority of California's population classifies themselves as \"habitual or social users of marijuana\" anyway.  Might as well allow the citizens to profit from their plants in a legal way & allow the state to collect the taxes it needs to balance out their deficit.  They've clashed with the fed before, they're used to it.  The DEA shut down many licensed legal medical marijuana distributors but they just set up shop elsewhere.  The federal government needs to relax on this topic... especially once a state has seen fit to legalize a substance.  They should, at that point, stay hands off.", 9770, "None", 0],

I think there is full agreement among Christians that Jesus will one day return and gather his faithful from the people on Earth. However, it seems to me (based on Scripture) that this will happen on **the very same \"day\"** as the final judgment.  The dead rise first (v 16), then the living faithful.  When does such an event occur (a wholesale raising of the faithful dead) other than at the time of the final judgment? Is there any other place in the Bible that mentions the \"wholesale\" raising of the dead - even of the faithful dead?  And we can see from this same passage that there are living faithful still on the Earth at that time - they have not all been gathered up into the sky *before* that time. Jim, ", 9771, "None", 0],
