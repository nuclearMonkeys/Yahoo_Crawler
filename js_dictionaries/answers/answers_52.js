Britain has the Falkland Islands, 8,000 miles from the UK and not very far from Argentina.  Even the USA has Hawaii a long way from its west coast. Etc, etc. Note that Jas B is wrong, since Yakutsk is towards the far end (eastern end)  of the Asian part of Russia and is nowhere near Europe, about 2,000 miles away in fact. The most isolated place in mainland Europe would be in the European part of Russia, west of the Ural Mountains.

But, if the toxin is produced faster than it can be cleared, then it builds up and has time to cause damage. Overdosing is one way to get there.

Everyone's body is diff, but for this particular med, there is a known very fine line between a little more than normal acetominiphine, yet fine and E.R. for kidney and liver failure needing life saving treatment. It is such a risk that doctors have been advised not to prescribe it(yes, it's also prescribed by doctors, not just over the counter)at dosages of 325mg any more because people already take more than prescribed and that was leading a significant amount of people to the ER.  I wouldnt take the 4,000 all at once.

And I take three Benadryls in between as needed.  I don't even have allergies. I got this thing called dermatographia about two months ago, which means \"skin writing.\" Basically, if I take my finger and write my name on my arm, in about a minute, you'll be able to see my name written in red on my arm. Apparently, it's a condition brought on by stress where the receptors in your skin that turn into hives from an allergic reaction get triggered by touch, meaning if I touch my face, a red blotch is there for about 20 minutes, or if I wipe my forehead, where I wiped turns red like hives for about 20 minutes. The cure for it is to settle those receptors down, which is done by taking allergy medicine for about six months, even though I don't have an allergy. Every time it happens, it makes it take longer to go away. So I have to keep allergy medicine in me all the time, the Zyrtec and the Singular. If in between taking them I notice I get blotchy from touch, I take three Benadryl.  People say Benadryl makes you sleepy. I've never once gotten sleepy from Benadryl. I don't notice anything from it at all-- well except that after about 15 minutes or so I don't get blotchy anymore from touch. ", 418, "None", -3],

	2624 : ["Short Answer:Maybe   Long Answer: Technically we first have to go by what is a continent , Firstly let's go by the most popular seven continent model , where the seven continents are Europe , Asia , North America , South America , Australia and Antarctica , this model divides Eurasia (Europe And Asia) or Afro-Eurasia (Africa , Europe , Asia) into three separate continents Asia , Africa and Europe , and divides Europe and Africa by the Mediterranean Sea separating them and Europe and Asia by the Ural mountains and Rivers And North America And South America are separated by the Panama Canal , The 6 Continent Model is when either Eurasia or America are combined and the 5 continent model is when Eurasia is combined into one continent and when the americas are combined into one continent and then the 4 Continent model when Afro-Eurasia (Europe , Asia , Africa) are combined and America (North America and South America) are combined , essentially leaving Australia and Antarctica as the only two continents left (Since they aren't connected to any other continent by land) . The inconsistency with the 7 continent model is it divides Eurasia based on mainly cultural reasons , which doesn't make sense , for example you can say that the Middle East is different enough in terms of culture to East Asia to be considered its own continent , then again if Eurasia is a single continent because it's one connected landmass then Africa shouldn't really be a continent either and if plates are what make a continent a continent then the Indian Subcontinent should be a continent like Africa or Africa should be a sub-continent of Asia/Eurasia like India . The 6 continent model either includes Europe and Asia into Eurasia or North America and South America into America , the problem with this model is Eurasia is way more connected then America , America is connected by a pretty small piece of land compared to Eurasia , and by this model Afro-Eurasia should be one continent , because Afro-Eurasia is connected the same way North America and South America are connected . The next continent model is the 5 continent model which combines Europe and Asia into Eurasia and North America and South America into America , which basically has the same inconsistencies as the 6 continent model and the 4 continent model which combines Africa , Asia and Europe into Afro-Eurasia and North America and South American into America . So this leaves us with our question what is a continent , well continents as a whole have no definition and are defined by convention rather than any real reason , if you go by plate tectonics there are 11 continents (Eurasia , India , Middle East , Africa , North America , South America , Australia and Antarctica) , But by this definition you would have to say that a good part of Morocco  is part of Eurasia and that a good portion of The Middle East is part of Africa . If you go by culture then there are 12 continents (Europe , East Asia , Middle East , India , North Africa , -Sub-Saharan Africa , North America , South America , Australia , Caribbean , Antarctica ) . If we say that Mountains and Rivers separate continents then Europe and Asia would be continents , making there be 7 continents (Africa , Asia , Europe , North America , South America , Australia and Antarctica) , The Ural Mountains separate Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the Caspian Sea separates Southern Europe and The Middle East/Western Asia , India would not really qualify as unlike Europe , India is not really separated by any water and besides the Himalayas and India having its own Tectonic plate unlike Europe , there's not much of a geographical separation between the Indian Subcontinent and the rest of Asia and The Middle East is interconnected with the rest of Asia with little separation and Africa , North America and South America also qualify as being continents due to being separated by canals or narrow pieces of land and Australia and Antarctica qualify because they are not connected to any other continent by land . If we go by continents are defined by separations of ocean , the. Africa , Europe , Asia , North America and South America do not qualify as they are all connected to other continents by land , instead there would Be 4 continents (Afro-Eurasia , America , Australia and Antarctica) , So overall Europe can be a continent or not be a continent depending on your definition of a continent , overall I'd say that the 7 continent model is probably the best continent model to use as it's the continent model that's been traditionally used and probably has one of the least inconsistencies, but the 6 continent model is not inaccurate.", 429, "None", 0],
