Trump was the final facilitator, mainly because White House is a neutral location. Now that the first major steps have been taken, they Americans can now be relegated to the background. Biden will be the thorn in the side of these types of deals; they go against the philosophy of the Democratic party, that said that peace with Israel cannot happen unless the Palestinians agree.", 6234, "fc933328ee9740346801c991325ba391aa", 1],

	43056 : ["They do. Full disclaimer: I'm a Jew who went to public school, and not a religious Jewish school for my primary education. However, with that said, I should point out that I went to Sunday School and religious nightly classes at a Jewish school to provide me with the Jewish education for students like me. This Jewish school was linked to my synagogue, which is one of the LARGEST synagogues in the United States. A synagogue that actually takes time to pray specifically for the United States, mind you. Furthermore, I was quite involved as a student with this synagogue, so naturally I knew what my peers went through even if I didn't go through the exact same programs. So it's with some great authority that I can say \"they said it\". I do remember actually saying the Pledge of Allegiance in my religious school, though I can't remember if it was a regular thing during the night or on Sunday (I went in the 90s and 00s). I at least remember helping raise an American flag during a field day that we were holding, so that's something. However, ALL the classrooms had American flags in them, and there was a huge American flag in the auditorium. And, as I pointed out, we had a flag pole so we displayed our Americanness on the outside as well, outside of a very prominent and large Jewish synagogue. In addition, I explicitly remember saying the Pledge everyday in a Jewish camp I attended one summer. It was for a leadership program that BBYO (a HUGE Jewish youth group) put on. I'm not sure if we sang Hatikva, Israel's national anthem, even once; but, we did have some Israeli/Hebrew-language themed events so it's possible. Chances are, your wife may be misremembering things. For one thing, Hatikva is the national anthem while the Pledge of Allegiance isn't our national anthem, the Star Spangled Banner. Hatikva is not said everyday, even in Israel. A lot of Jews do take pride in Israel, so it is sung... but, more so for special occasions. And, this pride isn't supposed to take the place of our pride of Americans, even if she sung it everyday. It's just that Israel represents ~50% of Jews, and given our turbulent history we're just happy they're alive. But we're American too, and most American Jews are proud of that. Edit: After reading BMCR's answer, I am reminded that saying the Pledge isn't something uniform worldwide and a lot of schools in America are abandoning the practice of having their kids say it. Actually, when I was in high school, we were given the option for \"a moment of silence\" instead of the Pledge of Allegiance and I bet, over a decade later, they no longer even have it anymore. And this was a public school were the Jewish population was, at best, double the expected amount in a random American sample (so, 5%).", 6235, "hKgjv1Deaa", -3],

	43060 : ["No necessarily. While Jews do identify themselves as part of the Chosen people (which, btw, isn't meant to disparage others who aren't a part) and Israel calls itself \"the Jewish State\", not all Israelis are Jewish. ~20% of Israeli citizens are not Jewish, being Muslim, Christian, Druze, or even something else. If you are Muslim Israeli, you obviously wouldn't be considered part of the Jewish people. Thus you wouldn't be a part of the Chosen people, per Jewish belief. However, you would still be an Israeli national, holding Israeli citizenship. Thus, you have an Israeli who is not Chosen. So, yeah: Being born in Israel doesn't entitle you to that term, per Jewish belief at least. Other groups have similar beliefs as Jews in regards to being chosen (switching out Jews for their own, of course) so it's not even a unique thing found in Israel.", 6236, "hKgjv1Deaa", -2],

The Left hates Israel and Jews, like the Nazis did, and they do everything they can to ruin the traditional concept of American identity.
