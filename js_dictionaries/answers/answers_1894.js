Cowboy Bebop\" Neon Genesis Evangelion is also critically acclaimed, although not as popular because its so f*****d up (especially last 2 episodes).  But, i think Detective Conan needs to be in there, along with Lupin III. Detective Conan is the longest running anime series ever (i believe) and Lupin III is one of the oldest and most popular anime.  I also personally think Ouran High School Host Club should be included in a best of romance/shoujo. Just overall great with an ongoing manga.  I love that FLCL is 4th.  Otaku No Video needs to be included too, even though it isnt as popular. It was a top notch mockumentary about Otakus (and the Otaking) and has gotten great reviews for its storyline, inserted interviews, and pretty realistic portrayal of the life of an otaku (especially in the interviews). Death Note is also pretty acclaimed in the seinen genre, which doesnt usually become as popular worldwide as shonen and shoujo.

	100455 : ["You speak of brainwash but fail to see and understand you are talking of the Roman Catholic Church which is opposed to the true knowledge of God and of Christ and His Gospel  but seeks to replace with itself. They derived their power from the secular Roman Empire and continued the vicious persecution of the Empire against those who follow Jesus. You really do not know that they persecuted to death Christians? They kept the Bible from the people and tortured and put to death those seeking the bible, usually by burning. Were you to read and examine the Bible you would be able to see what is the distinction between those who follow Christ and those who us His name for their own purposes. You would also be able to see how the RCC is filled with the spirit of antichrst and error.

	100456 : ["You're the one that's ignorant of the history because it was the pagan Catholic Church that took control and under the guise of Christianity that killed millions who would not bend down and worship the Pope who was then the high priest of voodooism and controlled Rome. Once Constantine could not defeat the Christians in the 2nd century he had his men jump in a lake and called them baptized then they called their churches Christian and taught that they didn't want to be like the Jews who Crucified Christ so the Catholic church said it was better we keep Sunday worship because that's the day Christ arose. It's still pagan Catholic  they still pray in repetition, they worship idols, they bow down to a man instead of God, they pray to the dead such as Mary instead of God the Father through the name of Jesus the only name under Heaven in which we must be saved. There is nowhere in the bible that it says we should pray unto anyone but the Father in Heaven, but if you look into voodooism they pray to the same virgin birth of a self-made woman god. Start at the beginning with your studies not in the middle. True people of God do not kill or plan to kill it's one of the Ten Commandments just like having only one God, worshiping only Him. Those who would fight to live here lose their lives but those who lose their lives for his names sake shall live forever. Guess who ordered the murder of 6 million Jews?

Very seldom do I have a problem with the two groups, and when I do, it's usually a ferret picking on a cat. My four month old ferret loves to play with my 24lb. Tom cat. They play very well together. However, not all cats like ferrets. Try to give the cat a place to get away from the ferret. I keep the top of my entertainment stand clear. If any of the ferrets are bothering the cats, the cats just get up there. Now there are a few concerns. If the cat has nails, they can easily hurt a ferret, even if they are playing. If the cat makes the ferret feel threatened, the ferret can do some massive damage to the cat. In general the two do get along, but I would recomend that they are only together under supervision, especially in the begining.", 9735, "3388b2b1591a91e7855a317777ee76f6aa", 1],

My kitty was definitely disturbed for a few days, but they are getting along well now. Be careful with the introductions. When you bring the ferret home, you should let him get settled down for a day or two in a room away from the cats. Maybe bring out a blanket with the ferrets smell on it for the cats to sniff at. First intros should be done through the cage and when that seems to be going well, see how the ferret does out of the cage. Take it slowly though, you don't want anyone to get aggressive or overwhelmed. Now they wrestle like crazy and chase each other all over the house and get into trouble together! Just a warning... ferrets are crazy! They will get into anything and everything and need to be constantly supervised when they're out and about. And they really should be let out to explore a few times a day to run around. But if you're willing to give them plenty of attention, they are super awesome.
