I have no doubt that there are many similar boondoggles out there.  But the public has no way to know about them without the media.

	76189 : ["well personally I think it ties back to the earliest civilizations.  Throughout history, men were the strong, allpowerful dominators, while women were there for their entertainment purposes and to make more men to dominate, and more women to make more men to dominate.  So that whole mindset has lessened a LOT in modern society, and women play a much larger role.  However, homosexuality isn't socially accepted by most of society.  Men now feel they have to work harder to prove their masculinity now that women are doing so much, setting high sports levels, etc., so homosexuality has really become socially unaccepted because many men see it not as liking men, but as not BEING a man when they are called homosexual.     Most homosexual men are defensive BECAUSE their lifestyle isn't accepted.  They ARE gay and they want to be recognized for it.  They get enough crap from being ridiculed for liking guys, plus they have to deal with people that dont know automatically assuming that they're straight. but girls dont have to defend themselves so much because stereotypically, females care about their appearance and what other girls think of their appearance, and even about guys that they arent attracted to's appearances, a lot more than men care about what they look like or what other men think or what girls they're not interested in think of their appearance.   so there, just stereotyped all of humanity for you ;)", 8832, "j5WQpnNyaa", 0],

You have to look up the definitions of Man of War and Upset to figure out how witty this choice of phrasing was. A Man of War is a fighting ship. Upset is a synonym for to capsize or turn a ship upside down. Seabiscuit is another name for hardtack, a hard piece of bread a sailor might consume on board a ship.  To say Man o' War was later Upset by Seabiscuit\" was brilliant. It is like saying the horse choked. Prior to that date the word upset was mainly used to show the change from a stable position to a prostrate one. That race forever changed the word upset's common usage.

	76201 : ["Wordorigins.org - upset Author: Dave Wilton, Sunday, February 04, 2007 The use of upset as a noun in sports writing to indicate an unexpected result in a contest dates to the late 19th century. It was a fairly common term dating back to 1877. From the New York Times of 17 July of that year:  The programme for to-day at Monmouth Park indicates a victory for the favorite in each of the four events, but racing is so uncertain that there may be a startling upset. It is commonly claimed, however, that this use of upset as a noun stems from a classic 1919 horse race that pitted Man o' War, probably the greatest race horse of all time, against an unlikely opponent named Upset.  During his career, Man o' War lost only one race, the 13 August 1919 Stanford Memorial at Saratoga. Man o' War was heavily favored to win, but lost to a horse named Upset. This, the legend goes, is where the sports term upset comes from. Man o' War would face Upset in five other races, winning every one, but this, according the tale, one loss early in his career would be the one to make lexicographic history.  Most lexicographers and etymologists thought the story too good to be true, but no one could disprove it. Sporting usages of upset prior to 1919 just could not be found. Then in late 2002, researcher George Thompson, using the newly available tools of full-text online searching of the New York Times databases, turned up a string of sporting usages of upset dating back to the 1877 citation given above. There are numerous uses of the term in 19th century sportswriting, proving beyond a doubt that the term was well-established by the time Man o' War lost his only race. Upset did not father a term, he was just well named.", 8833, "03166f17d77809895acba55aa1b35151aa", -1],

However, a more thorough understanding of the works in question reveals that the verse as written by Joseph Smith actually causes quite a problem when compared with early versions of the bible.   A great analysis of the issue is at the church's own Maxwell Institute located at:  In a very short nutshell what we find is that \"ships of the sea\" and \"ships of Tarshish\" were most likely the same phrase translated in two ways and \"all pleasant pictures\" was translated wrong into the KJV.  The earliest records from the dead sea scrolls align quite well with the Septuagint translation and do not support Joseph Smith's Translation.  Also, contrary to other posts, the difference in the KJV translation as compared to the Septuagint were well known among ministers and well-documented in Joseph Smith's time. It is quite probable Joseph Smith chose to include both the KJV and the Septuagint translation for the same phrase, resulting in three phrases instead of two.", 8828, "MGpXUO5xaa", 0],
