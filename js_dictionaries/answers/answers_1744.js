	92897 : ["Absolutely.  I would actually also argue that it was a Civil War not just here on the continent but also in Britain.  Many Americans have not been taught that there were many voices supporting American independence in Britain, including a number of important MPs.  Since History is \"written by the victors\" we rarely hear about the Loyalists in our history texts.  Conventional wisdom on the subject is that 1/3 of the Colonists were in favor of independence, 1/3 were Loyalists, and 1/3 did not really care.  We also hear little of the Loyalists fleeing to Canada after the war either because they still wishes to be British subjects or feared reprisals from the victorious Americans.", 9459, "fcf1212e61101bf3ce91e97128ba80dfaa", -1],

	92921 : ["When a marriage is arranged by a parent or guardian, it will be difficult for the spouses to make up their mind on who to marry. Sometimes you would feel oversensitive and not reject a proposal on purpose. This could be due to how much you care about hurting the other person. A minority of arranged marriages are done in haste and without the spouses not fully knowing each other. This has its advantages and disadvantages. You can treat the marriage as a challenge and you will find yourself being “curious” about your spouse every day. Curiosity is somehow exigent and exhilarating. A marriage requires a more durable foundation and it cannot survive on love alone. Loyalty, friendship, companionship, commitment, affection should be included in a marriage. It is very true that love is weak, but one can get through the weakness by building a good relationship with their spouse. Spouses should treat other as friends and should be open with each other. So it is very essential to open your eyes when you meet new proposals. Don't worry about their feelings (may sound harsh) but worry about your own. Remember there are demands to meet after marriage too. Who will provide for the children? Who will look after the house and kids? Both spouses have responsibilities, both in a love/arranged marriage. As for this man on facebook – ask yourself this question. Do you feel attracted to him? If so, what are you willing to do to get your feelings across? Would you rather be open or conceal your feelings? Don't be confused by his behavior, men act all the same from time to time. Remember that no one really takes the internet seriously. He's playing safe and maybe thinks that there is no point in getting to know other people (since it's the internet).", 9460, "pJ9QWsQGaa", 0],

I did work with a man from Uganda who was of Indian descent. He and his family were kicked out by Idi Amin (sp?) and they eventually ended up in Canada. He had a VERY difficult time with his daughter who was raised in Canada and he wanted to arrange a marriage for her and she said no way.  He and I had a lot of talks about it and he went from angry to sad because his culture was taken. He did feel better when I explained that her culture is here now and she doesn't feel slighted in the least. I don't know that an arranged marriage is horrible- your parents and his parents do know you best. I just don't like that choice is taken. Or, am I wrong?

	92929 : ["Taxes primarily. Many Americans (perhaps the majority) did not want full independence from the United Kingdom, right up until the war broke out. Even after the first shots were fired, many Americans (loyalists) fought alongside the British. Although it is debatable whether a war was really necessary, because proposals had already been put forward in 1754 through The Albany Plan (proposed by Benjamin Franklin), to give the Colonies more rights and greater democracy. In effect they would have been free, but would have retained the King/Queen as the Head of State, with democratically elected State Presidents. This would have created a British America similar to modern day Australia or Canada. The Albany Plan was rejected not because the Colonies did not want to be associated/tied to Britain, but because the States themselves could not reach agreement with each other. Indeed, after the French and Indian War, Americans generally rejoiced at the defeat of the French - which highlighted the affection that many generally still felt towards their 'Mother Country'. After all, many Americans were then fighting in the British Army. Ultimately the War for Independence was due to the inability of either side in the end to reach a compromise palatable to all parties involved. But the issue of taxation was probably the straw that broke the camel's back, Still, the Albany Plan being rejected was clearly a missed opportunity to avoid both bloodshed and the tragic reality of brother facing brother on the battlefield. .", 9459, "zLDT0Tlbaa", 1],
