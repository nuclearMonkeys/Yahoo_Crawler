	107157 : ["I used to think that a growing lack of talent among singers was the problem.  I have found that the real problem is the most popular music that is exploited today is not music, it's \"music\".  Corporations create an image that they think will sell units and don't even consider the music that's recorded.  They also don't consider the fact that their audience wants to hear good music as well.  I can give you an artist...( www.cdbaby.com/lylemiller ) .  You have to form your own opinion about him, but I can say personally that this artist did not conform to today's rules of singing over 4-bar loops.  There are many artists out there, but the best are underground artists, simply because there is no place in the \"music\" industry for them.  Think about this, Paris Hilton has a CD selling worldwide and Johnny Gill is on the chittlin' circuit.  Does this seem even a little wrong?", 9988, "e65b9db568c5c214460d76626c81f334aa", 0],
	107158 : ["I have to make pretty much all of my own food, but I am unique in that I want to have everything organic also. Thus it is hard for me to even go to a restaurant, even a vegan one. I usually get canned organic beans of every kind I see there for my legumes (to make hummus, chili, soup, bean burritos). I find about four different, and more, of rice - like brown, jasmine, wild, and basmati (to make stirfry rice, pilafs, burritos, own rice milk, spanish rice). I buy pasta and sauce for a meal of spaghetti or a casserole. Most whole grain cereals that are NOT enriched with vitamins/minerals are vegan (vitamins can be from animal sources) - granolas are a good bet. Just like the oats in granola, oatmeal is also vegan. Milks can be anything from almond to hazelnut to oat to rice to soy (take your pick!). I will also get Tofurky's deli slices, Vegenaise, and whole grain breads to make sandwiches for lunch. Amy's has soups that are vegan (vegetable soup, and no-chicken noodle) that are good for lunch too. Tempeh, tofu (plain and baked), and in some stores seiten (wheatmeat) can be purchased to make a meatless entree for dinner.  From there I buy my vegetables (potatoes, peppers, peapods, onions, tomatoes, etc.) and fruit (bananas, apples, oranges, grapes, peaches, grapefruit) and other stuff (parsley, cilantro, ginger, spices). There are many other foods to enjoy like falafels with pita bread, hummus and tabouli rollups with tortillas, and vegan burgers (Amy's and Boca) with whole wheat buns, that you can buy at most grocery stores (and of course health food stores). And most of all, read labels! Simple to read ones with just simple whole foods are the safest.", 9989, "f0b220ec644bff7c6640e684c3408f12aa", 1],

	107176 : ["As always, context is important to understanding the meaning of scripture.  For example, there is a section of the Boy Scout Handbook (at least older editions) about pressing on people's chests.  So, why are Boy Scouts violating their own handbook and not going around pressing on people's chests?  It helps to know that the excerpt comes from a section about how to administer CPR. Corinthians is a letter from Paul to the church in Corinth.  Corinth, itself, was a cosmopolitan city at the time, and there were many religious traditions at the time, mostly pagan.  People in Corinth had answered the call to salvation, but they didn't know how to hold a Christian service.  Christianity was brand new, and there weren't any longstanding churches to model from.  Paul uses the model of Christian services in Jerusalem.  The first Christians were Jews who were familiar with synagogue worship.  Anyway, some of the pagan cults in Corinth at the time included some forms of goddess worship.  Some of these services included people being loud and even making lewd comments.  People new to the Christian faith were bringing this to church because for many of them, that's all that they knew.  These are the types of things that Paul is addressing.  If you notice, he uses a lot of I-statements, meaning that he is giving his own personal opinion, based on his Jewish background and the practices of the early Christians in Jerusalem, rather than stating that these were commandments from God that applied to all churches for all time. Read further throughout the Bible, and you will discover that Paul praises women... including women who are fellow apostles!  Women apostles who were preaching the word of Jesus Christ! When the Bible speaks of \"ruling over\", it does not pertain to the human idea of selfishly exploiting and taking advantage of people.  Rather, it refers to the Godly idea of taking care of people, guiding, and protecting.  Although Eve was the first to sin because she was deceived, Adam's sin is deliberate and willful.  Read earlier verses of Genesis 3, and you will discover that Adam wasn't in some far off part of the Garden of Eden when Eve was deceived.  The Bible says that he was WITH HER.  He then blamed Eve for his sin.   In short, you need to consider scripture in its entirety.  To isolate scripture and assign a different meaning out of context and not consistent with God's word in its entirety is neither a fruit of the Spirit nor is anything remotely scholarly and in keeping with academic excellence.  Recall that when Jesus was in the dessert, Satan showed that even he could quote scripture.  That didn't mean, however, that he had righteous motives. Peace be with you.", 9985, "wiD2RHuuaa", -3],

	107181 : ["Speaking as a guy who has done a few dumb relationship things in my life, I can speak with a little experience for all mankind. haha Honestly, if a guy has some pics on his current cell of naked ex-girlfriends than I am thinking he is not focused where he should be. Now you have to realize that men are visually stimulated and some men will have old photos laying around in a box or something that he forgot even exists but ... on his phone? That would be a BIG problem of apocalyptic size.   An ex is an ex and their naked photos should NEVER be on a phone or something that he uses all the time. If it is, it shows that you need to clarify where you stand in the relationship.  If you find them ... have a serious conversation. Try not to yell too much. Guys tune out yelling if it is frequent. Ask some detailed questions. Hold him accountable for pictures on his phone if you find them. You have the right to ask that they be deleted forever or you delete him forever.  Finally, set some standards with him and enforce them. Sometimes guys are just dense (I was) when it comes to thinking if this is a big deal or not. Most of the time, men do not see the point. Tell him you can play that game too and have naked dudes on your phone if you want .. how would he feel then?

I personally think that religious experiences cannot be imitated by methods like these, because after all, how would someone just sitting down on a chair inside a lab feel like they have a religious experience.

	107192 : ["The ancients believed women were kind of like children.  They believed a woman never actually grew up.  They didn't get bulgey muscles or hair on their bodies, their voices never deepened like a man's did.   So they believed women never matured to adulthood.  A woman had to be taken care of, like a child,  first by her father and then by a husband. But there were some strong women characters in the Bible.  Ruth and Esther spring to mind.  In the New Testament Mary Magdaline and Mary of Bethany.  Jesus believed that women should have the same rights as men, making him a radical feminist for his time.  He spoke to women the same as he spoke to men.

Now read the Gospels, see how much Jesus gave much more respect to woman than his culture did as a rule.
