	16701 : ["Someone did the math and not flushing your toilet with piss to save money only saves $7/year. You buy $40 in cleaner and have to smell stale piss for 365 days to save $7. You pissed out your $12 Starbucks.  When Walmart makes 100,000 units per second, 1/2 inch of cardboard saves $2 million/year. Putting a light on in your house for a few hours isn't going to add up that much. Personally, I think LED lights make the place look like a computer screen. Incandescent is warm and welcoming. I'll pay the extra $5/year to feel nice. ", 2868, "u1thfT1aaa", -1],
	16702 : ["I see the nailhead sofas and imagine pulling that metal tone out to the side tables.  Whatever they are, a light bronze or copper...I would consider that direction.  Lighter than the seating, but not so drastic like white would be. You desperately need a complementary color with so much brown.  Adding some yellow or teal (or both) with pillows, accessories, or wall art would go a long way.", 2875, "RKD60nJnaa", 2],

	16704 : ["My bathroom ceiling fixture supplies the room with a light, a fan and supplemental heat. There is a toggel switch on the wall with 3 switches; one for each function to use independently or together.  It sounds like you need to install a fixture with independant functions...a fan and light fixture that have separate switches. If the fan is sucking the heat up and out, close the bathroom door and put a towel or sleeve full o f sand at the base of the bathroom door until the fan finishes the cycle. That fan is probably timed to insure moisture is removed to prevent mold. I'm guessing that you have no window and you live in an apartment.", 2876, "9MJS6I6Laa", 0],
	16705 : ["if the bathroom has an outside  window, not all building codes require an electric fan at all.  You can often disconnect the fan from the light where it is connected by way of a cord inside the combination light/fan fixture, but you didn't say that's what you have.  In any case, there are many different ways to wire the fan to its own switch, if you still want the ability to run it when deemed prudent.  Some may involve the simple installation of a pull-string or a more serious rewiring through the walls or ceiling to a switch near the light-switch.  Many people install a \"timer switch\" that adjusts to the user's requirement and only stays on for the selected interval. I rewired several of my bathroom fans to activate a remote blower in the attic (and out through the common vent already on the roof) when anyone operates one of the timer switches on the wall in any of the bathrooms, thus increasing the airflow but reducing the interior noise and individual fan maintenance.", 2876, "VjgqZetcaa", 0],

	16710 : ["If it is a wood deck, you are not going to pressure wash.   Usually  WP stain is not going to come off. You can only paint it with the same stuff or resheet the deck. . The waterproofing is PROBABLY SILICONE so the only thing to take that off is silicone remover.  For the cost of that stuff @$40.00 I would be more apt to get a couple sheets of plywood G1S and put a layer on the deck so now you got new wood to paint.", 2872, "None", -1],
	16711 : ["TC us right, stain works into the wood. Some detergents with a pressure washer can get some out, but not all.  Sanding can also get down enough to remove the stained fibers, but it is a lot of work.

	16718 : ["How can you hear pipes groaning from a house next to you?   Are you up against their windows listening in?  Pipes and heating ducts do make noises. Especially if you are up north and have had both warm and cold weather in the same week.  Empty? Are the owners on vacation? In between renters? Foreclosure? Up for sale?  If you know for a fact no one is suppose to be in the home-  perhaps a friend coming in once a day to check,  bring in mail. Or a maintenance/repair/ is in the house with permission.  If you think there is a break in you can call the non emergency number for the police.  If the house is up for sale/rent call the real estate agent.  Houses in foreclosure  can have a sticker on the door with info.

Luego lijas todas las mesas, luego barnizas todas las mesas, etc. El trabajo en serie aumenta la productividad. Y como bien lo dijiste: lo principal es contar con buenas herramientas.
