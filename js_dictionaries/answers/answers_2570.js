You would have to brace yourself for hours of waiting, watching her endure the most painful experience of her life. Filled with lots of bodily fluids and seeing your friend in ways you've never seen her before (emotionally and physically) If you were polite about it, like you said you were, then everything should be fine. But if you notice your friend acting differently towards you, she might have taken it wrong. So you should just approach her again and explain to her that you don't feel like you should be there because it's a special event that you feel should only be for her family.", 11218, "La44jZYiaa", 2],
	134324 : ["There is always a right way and a wrong way to make a correction. Mostly it has to do with the persons mental attitude. \"Teach, don't punish\"! Making a correction in order to punish a dog is a complete waste of time, and is actually taking a step backward in a training program. It should be noted that making a correction has absolutely nothing to do with the dog performing an action right or wrong. For instance when we begin teaching a dog to \"heel\", when we give the command we naturally give the lead a little snap. That is a correction. With that correction we did two things; #1 we told the dog to pay attention, #2 by the direction of the snap we told the dog what direction we want it to go. Now I won't pop a dog on the nose, ever. This comes from a field trial background where it is imperative that I be able to line my hand above the dogs head when sending it on a retrieve. Which is impossible to do if I have made the dog become hand shy. A simple alternative is to wrap the thumb and index finger around the pups snout holding it's mouth closed for a moment before handing it an object that it is allowed to chew on. I don't quite know why I would want to throw a chicken at a dog, but OK. I have been known to throw a choke chain at a wall to startle a dog, which is just a step up from rattling some pennies in a coke can. As a dogs proficiency level rises the way corrections are made needs to change drastically. With an advanced dog applying direct pressure will work against the training almost every time. So we convert to \"attrition\" and \"indirect pressure\" as the primary ways of making a correction. The bottom lines are think before making a correction, and NEVER make a correction when angry.", 11213, "b89ac737b04f2e9d2ad9a7ad01707cc2aa", 9],
	134325 : ["I agree that every dog is different and training methods should be specific for the individual. Some dogs are touch sensitive, some are not. Some may be distracted or \"corrected\" by noies, others not, others may be very noise sensitive and overreact massively. Some do not need correcting at all - yes really, it is possible to train a dog without corrections! The same goes for rewards - many dogs are not motivated enough by praise alone, although some are. Whether they like treats or toys etc, or need more of a NILF approach, depends on the dog. I think one problem is that people simply stick with what they know and don't bother to learn about alternative methods, or which mught be best for their dog. Like the \"tap on the nose\" thing. I guess it has potential in theory - but it is also risky. A lot of dogs can become handshy, even aggressive from physical punishment. And if you lose your temper one day and whack the dogs rather than tap you could cause injury. Not to mention that this method frequently makes nipping worse.... I do not believe there is a single universal correction (or reward, or training method) that works perfectly on every dog. With one exception = clicker training. Clicker training is universal simply because it is basic learning theory. It is not the method iteslf, but the use of a marker to enable the dog (or any species) to learn quicker.", 11213, "None", 0],

Not everyone agrees with the official stance of the APA, and no modern research was atually used to create their stances. I realise peopel want ot hink of science as dispassionate and truthful, but the Scientists are human nd have their own ideologies, and this is particulalry true in the social sceinces. Modern research can't even prove that such a think as Sexual Oreintation exists, and contemporary studies actulaly do cast serious doubt on the official claims made byt he APA regardign Homosexuality. Notably, that Homosexuality is a fixed condition and immutable. There is a signifigant body fo researhc that contests this, though mroe researhc is needed, and we can find easily many cases of those who do abandon Homosexuality. Also, all studies show Children do better in families with their biological parents, thus precluding by default Homosexuals raisign the chidlren. Further studies shwo that Chidlren raise dby Homosxuals do show gender confusion, ar emor eliekly to be Homosexual themselves ( Even if adopted) and tend to have other personality disorders on a higher rate than is usual in the generla populace. The APA's official line is not in keepign with contemproary research, which can be easily optained at any University library.  DOn' ttake my word for it. Read up on it, the reports are as dry as dust but they do bare out my claims. I know I'll get thumbs down for htis, but its the truth.
