This is nothing but a hatchet job. Look not only is it illegal but think about all the money they have acquired illegally off the good law abiding, tax paying  citizens over the years since you have been duped into paying an unapportioned tax on your income? Ooooh I tell you, if it ever came to light fully, if everyone woke up tomorrow and understood what has been happening, the Fed would be finished. The IRS gone.

	100572 : ["We Muslims have two religious feasts: The Feast of Breaking the Fast, at the end of Ramadan, and The Feast of the Sacrifice, which is during the Hajj. For both feasts, we attend a special congregational prayer early in the morning, and then visit each other, and have a big meal with our friends and relatives.  Ways of spending the feast days vary from culture to culture. In the US, we often take a large group (think busloads) to an amusement park. The kids and teens spend the day on the rides and (even I go on a few) and the adults walk and talk.  Meals are often potluck. Everywhere in the world, we visit friends and relatives, especially those who can't get out easily because of age or health-related limitations. There's a tradition of giving children spending money or toys.  In Muslim countries, the toy shops are usually open on feast days, so the kids can pick out their toys themselves, and families often spend the later part of the day at amusement and other public parks. Each culture has its own Eid traditions and foods, but all include prayer, a big meal, and socializing. We love the Eids!  (Eid means \"Feast\".) (The self-flagellation you mention is limited to a particular cult--mainstream Islam forbids any activity in which a person deliberately injures himself or herself.

I'm sure there are others -- oh, putting a fatwah on the authors of books that they disagree with,  a la that author Salman Rushdie, that's a holy event for them (and a Holy Sh#t event for him).

Including some more estimates, the world population has been doubled or will double in the following years (with two different starting points). Note how, during the 2nd millennium, each doubling has taken roughly half as long as the previous doubling. The doubling takes less time as each generation puts out 3.4 children. Other projections of population growth predict that the world's population will eventually crest, though it is uncertain exactly when or how. In some scenarios, the population will crest as early as the mid-21st century at under 9 billion, due to gradually decreasing birth rates, (the \"low variant\" of [1]), The \"high variant\" from the same source gives a population between 10 and 11 billion in 2050. In other scenarios, disasters triggered by the growing population's demand for scarce resources will eventually lead to a sudden population crash, or even a Malthusian catastrophe (also see overpopulation). Then there is the Malthusian thing: Malthusian catastrophe From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Malthusian catastrophe, sometimes known as a Malthusian check, Malthusian crisis, Malthusian dilemma, Malthusian disaster, Malthusian trap, or Malthusian limit is a return to subsistence-level conditions as a result of agricultural (or, in later formulations, economic) production being eventually outstripped by growth in population. Theories of Malthusian catastrophe are very similar to the subsistence theory of wages. The main difference is that the Malthusian theories predict over several generations or centuries whereas the subsistence theory of wages predicts over years and decades.
