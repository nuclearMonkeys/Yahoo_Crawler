	96140 : ["I think the Seahawks are going to play more quarters coverage which could mean Thomas matched up one on one with a guy like Welker. Thomas is a great middle of the field defender with a lot of range but not as great in man defense. Though I agree with you, the Seahawks match up well all around with the Broncos. People are talking up the secondary but the real mismatch is the nickel front of the Seahawks, Avril, Clemons, Bennett and Irvin as the spinner vs the Broncos offensive line.

	96147 : ["Squats properly done actually strengthen the knees. Heavy squats are, however, bad for the knees. Still the benefits outweighs the harm done. Squats strengthen the muscles of the posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, lowe back) and this corrects a lot of posture issues that might need to back issues. For most people the quad to hamstring strength ratio is too high and squats will bring this into a good range. Squats recruit a lot of muscle fibres more than most exercises, which leads to increased muscle growth. The typical errors that people commit are  1) Rounding of the back 2) Stopping way before parallel. This is infact most causes for knee injuries 3) Squatting from the ball of the feet than the heels. This again puts too much pressure on the knee joint. 4) Smith machine squats - people usually place their feet way infront of the bar. This again causesa shearing force on the knee For best results, squat with a decent weight and go below parallel. Do not bounce at the bottom while you rise. Push with your shoulders first.", 9576, "AA10697808", 1],

	96174 : ["I would bet on a Seahawks Packers game. The Packers may have lost to the Niners (during the replacement ref era), but that was with Smith at quarterback. Kapernick is young and makes more mistakes than Smith. The Packers just shut down Peterson, so I don't see Gore giving them too much trouble. I just can't see the Niners scoring as much as the Packers. The Seahawks game is more interesting. Atlanta can score, but Seattle's defense can be good enough to keep them in check, and the Seahawks have shown they are capable of putting up big offensive numbers. EDIT: Ax: That horrible run defense held Peterson to 99 yards. Ponder wasn't going to light up the scoreboard in a cold Lambeau. The Vikings gameplan was to give Peterson the ball no matter who started....although Webb looked like he barely qualified for the job.", 9578, "g11hvOI6aa", 2],

	96177 : ["Of course.  Obviously you dont need to be the most limber double jointed person in the world.  But you need some flexibility and looseness of the muscles in your quads, hamstrings, calves, and achilles tendons in order to prevent pulling or tearing a muscle.", 9579, "NxKypQ68aa", 0],

	96180 : ["Some of us are naturally inflexible. I even tried Karate for three years and while that helped, I really don't like stretching; I like running. As I got older, my ligaments were less tolerant of getting stretched and when those buggers get injured it takes months to heal. So I don't stretch much. My advice is to jog for a minute before setting out to run. That gets the blood flowing and helps me get loose. I will stretch my quads and my calves, and occasionally rotate my hip joint, but I don't push it. Running, or any excercise, will shorten and tighten your muscles. If you rest for long enough, they return to normal but most people prefer to stretch them out. It's more important if you're competing, but if you're just running for fun don't worry about stretching. To alleviate cramps, you can try drinking more water long before you run. It can take a while for water to become available to your muscles. I never got many cramps, though, despite years of running hard.", 9579, "177d18bcc551489f20ac5980bc53b55baa", 0],
