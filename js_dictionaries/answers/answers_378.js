Sure, I could have flown and the flight itself would have been less than an hour BUT we would have had to go to the airport and more intense/time consuming security.  At our destination, we would have been much farther outside of town compared to a centralized rail station. So for actual travel time ( including the mandatory check-in time for domestic flights ), there wasn't really that much of an overall time difference  Then there were the accommodations on the rail car itself.  The seats were wider and offered far more leg room.  There was the option to walk around.  The rail car had wi-fi available as well.", 3359, "bqLvWpcZaa", 6],

	20529 : ["Until room temperature superconductors are cheap and widely available then it's not going to happen in many countries at all.  Even with such superconductors, MagLev infrastructure costs immensely more per mile than conventional rail technologies. Even simple things like having level crossings become effectively impossible with MagLev as they always need a bridge or a tunnel to cross roads. In many locations there's simply not the space to build either of those. But suppose the necessary superconductors and infrastructure are installed: where are you going to get the electricity to power them from?  The huge changeover to electric vehicles already means hundreds of thousands of new power stations worldwide, whether solar, wind-turbine, nuclear, hydroelectric or any other form already need to be constructed. But with conventional rail technologies it's already easy to have hybrid diesel locomotives which use exceptionally clean versions of diesel engines solely to generate electricity to power their electric traction motors. Hybrid locos have been in commercial usage for decades: the very latest designs have very low CO2 emissions (some prototypes can capture their CO2) and their only other exhaust product is water. With hybrid locos no overhead power cables and no other electricity supply needs installation; only track needs to be laid. Even signalling can now be done wirelessly direct to the driver's cab. MagLev is only suited to very limited uses, and most of those are just prestige technology demonstrators which cost vastly more money to install and maintain than can ever be commercially justified. The only way the USA will ever get any kind of high speed rail network will be if flying becomes too expensive or too uneconomical compared to investing in a conventional high speed rail system, possibly based upon or licensed from the French TGV system or perhaps the Japanese Bullet Train designs. The newest high speed train system is the Chinese one and it has potential to go significantly faster than the French and Japanese systems, but for political and security reasons it would be highly unlikely that the US would buy licenses to copy the Chinese system.", 3360, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],
