I have noticed that the honeymoon registry idea- people either love it or hate it.  I personally think it's wonderful to contribute to the couple's honeymoon especially if they are like me and don't really need towel sets and dishware.  HOWEVER, those who dislike it seem to severely dislike it, it's odd actually how passionate they are about it (considering it in \"poor taste\" and all) Perhaps that is regional too?  If giving cash to someone you know well is considered rude in other parts of the country- perhaps that is where you find the honeymoon registry haters?  Just a thought. = )", 9357, "hoGumKrHaa", -1],

Your relative has the most appalling value system: \"if people are too cheap to buy a gift than that is their problem not mine.\" She's judging them by what they bring. I say take a f.f. She's not worth the trouble. How is your not attending the bridal shower any ruder than not being invited as a relative to the wedding?

Tail docking is usually done when pups are very young (before they get their eyes open).  Your pups may be too old.  Older pups will lick, chew and bite at the bandages, tearing out the stitches and causing infections.  Think BIG PAINFUL BLOODY MESS (very costly, too). Many breeds that traditionally have their tails docked have very beautiful tails if the tails are left natural.  Your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel x Cocker Spaniel pups should have lovely tails.

His family is local (we live outside DC), but mine is from NJ, so there's a fairly large distance there (although not huge), but both our families are large, immigrant families (mine is Polish, his is Lebanese), and we're both first generation Americans. I think that may be the crux of it, at least for us - giving specific gifts is generally a modern American thing, but with parents who moved over here as children, they grew up attending weddings where the gifts given were generally cash and/or heirlooms.

I just got married this past weekend and we got a couple things off registry (a cookbook from a restaurant my uncle and I had been to in the UK, a beautiful custom made quilt from a family friend, a book of recipes straight from the kitchen of my best friend) but they were definitely among the best and most special things we got.", 9357, "5412173baed2a21884761c1f6bde287baa", 0],
	90349 : ["What difference does it make to your pups' nervous system whether they have the genes of one, two, or 57 breeds? If done in the first few days of life they won't be able to tell which part of them has been hurt, so they will feel as though their whole body is in pain. (But maybe you are one of those who still believes in fashionably circumcising girls?) I didn't regard my undocked boyhood \"Fockers\" (first cross between a Fox Terrier & a hunting Cocker Spaniel) as \"looking stupid\". But I DO regard your comment \"look stupid \"as BEING stupid! In MOST of the world, both cropping and docking are illegal. In the remainder, it is almost universal that ONLY breeds which have been traditionally docked may be docked - and then only by people licensed to do the docking. See, neither cropping nor docking has any FUNCTION - they are purely \"fashion accessories\". In Europe no docked dogs may be shown. Breeders there who craved that \"bobtail\" look have BRED the necessary gene into their Boxers. Unfortunately for them the gene they chose to use (from Corgis) is a semi-lethal dominant, so every embryo that inherits it homozygously dies in utero - therefore about a third of their pups (from a pair of natural bobtails) will have tails (unless the breeders find another gene somewhere for natural bobtails). Doesn't bother the pups! Breeders of hunting breeds protest that their dogs bash their skinny barely-furred tails against plants and so injure themselves. Duh... So BREED-IN the genes for fat bushy tails! (Do you see African Hunting Dogs, coyotes, dingos, foxes, jackals, wolves needing their tails amputated??? Are you going to claim that they DON'T actually hunt???) The only breeds whose FUNCTION might require a bob-tail are the terrier-types (which includes Standard Dachshunds and Pinschers) - they were bred to go underground after vermin, and the bob-tail was used as a \"handle\" to haul then out when the owner decided that the dog had become stuck in the burrow. But, having often used the tails of my GSDs as handles, I see no reason why owners of terrier-types can't just grab the base of a natural tail. And anyway, in many parts of the world it is now illegal to set dogs to hunting vermin. Not one word of \"cavalere cocker spaniel\" is correct. Do you mean a cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a hunting Cocker Spaniel? Or a cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an animated floor-rug American Cocker Spaniel? Or a cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and King Charles Spaniel? Or what? So okay - WHY do your Cavalier King Charles-cross pooches NEED a shortened tail? If it is because of diarrhoea, try feeding your dogs better. And doesn't the diarrhoea mess up their \"feathers\" more than it messes their tails, thus suggesting that you should be breeding for a SHORTER COAT instead of worrying about their tails? But as you don't even know how to spell & punctuate the ancestral breeds of your cross-breeds, in my rarely-humble opinion you ought NOT be breeding at all.

	90357 : ["arc welding is primarily used in more heavy fab. situations. Such as structural steel or metal thicknesses ranging from 3/16\" on up. Arc would burn through the 16 ga. sheetmetal on your car. Then you would have to fill in a 1/4\" hole with more weld. Not to mention lower you go on your amperage settings, the harder it is to weld with. The rod wants to stick and not start a good arc. When doing body work you will see most of the shops using MIG with a shielding gas or in some cases TIG. Fluxcore is great for fixing your lawnmower of something of that nature. Me being a welder, I wouldnt even bother with wirefeed fluxcore. The welds come out ugly! On what picasso said pushing and dragging. I would like to add that pushing and dragging actually depends on the position that you are welding in (i.e. uphill vertical, flat, overhead etc) and on the type of profile weld bead profile that you desire.
