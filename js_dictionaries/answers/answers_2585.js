Their economic platform is much like what Lenin proposed in 1922, the New Economic Policy, in which the goal was to use capitalist principles that are heavily regulated by the state. The Nazi government used this same tactic as well, known as state-capitalism. There are also many aspects of free enterprise as well, however most of the economy is centrally planned.  The problem with this platform, as Hitler realized in the late 1930's, is that eventually, the country will run out of resources, and there will be nothing to stop rising inflation. China has for a long time purposely devalued their currency to prevent inflation from occuring, but eventually, they will have to let their currency loose, which will cause inflation, and a drop in economic activity.", 11267, "nrs988KVaa", 0],
	135077 : ["The purpose of the square root of a number or expression N is to find a value such that when that value is multiplied by itself, the product is N. As with any mathematical function, you make use of the square root when it is useful in solving a problem.", 11268, "G16B4W08aa", 0],
	135078 : ["Science at it's root is simply a system of careful and methodical observations designed to arrive at a conclusion about physical phenomena which are perceivable via the five human senses. God is a divine creator being (in the western understanding of the term, at least) generally regarded as supernatural in nature..  Though some may argue that God is not a scientifically provable concept (and therefore does not exist) The simple inability to prove a concept or idea, does not automatically mean that said object, idea, substance etc. does not exist. Rather, we simply do not have the means to prove it at a given time with the given technology. Every day new scientific techniques discover concepts and structures that to previous generations were merely theoretical constructs. Take the evolution of our understanding of the composition of the atom over the past hundred years, for example. Structures like quarks were nothing but mathematical constructs and theories until the past few decades. As technology develops and advances, our capacity to observe ever more esoteric phenomena will increase and more and more ideas which may seem impossible now will become common place. Having said all of that, however, science will always be limited to testing only phenomena that are observable using the five human senses. Although technology gives us the capacity to refine and focus those senses to observe things we otherwise could not, should anything ever occur or exist in the nearly limitless universe that is completely outside the detectability of the five human senses, science would be utterly useless. To accept that nothing that which is undetectable by the five human senses (like God) can exist, you must also accept that the five human senses are basically the pinnacle of sensory perception in the Universe and nothing superior to it could possibly exist either. Given the vastness of the Universe, I am not comfortable myself making that assumption. Just look to the other beings on our own planet. Dogs do not have the intellectual capacity to understand the workings of quantum mechanics, but that in no way proves that quantum mechanics cannot exist. With our superior, human intellectual capacity, we realize that such a thing not only can exist, but is integral to the existence of all life and matter as we know it. By the same token - just as we are superior in our perceptions to dogs, I have to accept the possibility that other things superior to human sensibilities and perceptions might also exist. God is a metaphysical being. It is very likely that we will never be able to put a little \"God\" into a test tube swish him around with some litmus paper and say \"Oh! There he is!\" but that still does not mean that such a being does not and/or cannot exist. Science is a highly useful tool whereby we can better understand the physical world around us, but it still has its limits. Science can tell us why we live or die, but not \"HOW\" we should do so. It can offer hypothesis about how we came into existence, but nothing at all about how we ought to live. It can tell us how our ancestors came to live here or there, but not what our own personal place in the world ought to be. These questions are (like the concept of God) metaphysical rather than physical and thereby must be addressed by some other system of inquiry or basis for knowing such as philosophy and religion. In the end, if someone tells you with 100% certainty that there is no God, period. They are lying, because that is just simply something that cannot be conclusively proven one way or the other. The best they could offer and still be factually accurate is that the existence of God can neither be conclusively proven or disproven, but if you are like me, you don't find that answer very satisfying. Science is a valuable tool, but it has a very specific purpose and very specific limitations. There are certain questions that it just flat out CANNOT answer. For those types of inquiries I turn to other sources - Philosophy and religion. There is not automatic conflict between science and religion and/or the existence of a supreme being. Both are perfectly valid methods of understanding very different things.", 11268, "ybpJUWRnaa", 0],
	135079 : ["Because you're making the wrong claim. Simply say \"God is imaginary\"- and the simple truth is that nobody can come up with evidence to prove that he isn't.  Apart from the fact that the definition of God is that he exists everywhere at all times, which in itself is purely an imagined statement, saying that he might be found in outer space is purely a statement of imagination as is everything else claimed about God. Furthermore, you cannot claim that   does not exist based on the fact that he can't be found at the North Pole.  All that may be invisible, etc.", 11268, "hWi899Itaa", -1],

	135084 : ["You mean Politifact's Liar of the Year 0bama?  And you believe him why?   Wouldn't it be nice if the chief executive responsible for upholding the laws knew what they were?  That is part of the reason 0bama has been the worst president in history bar none.

Next round of contracts will probably contain the language, \"contractor must never have offended anyone in a minority community.\"  That won't work but the city will certainly try.

One of many stories that morphed into the globally commercial franchise of   Claus. But I do get your point.
