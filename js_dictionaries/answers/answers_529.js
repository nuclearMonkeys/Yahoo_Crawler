	29446 : ["Sorry about your pain - it is an agonizing situation. I don't mean to be rude, but this sounds like it could be on the verge of an obsession. It seems like you need some professional counseling to help you through talk through this and help you get over her. It's often available for little or no fee through health insurance. Almost everyone needs counseling at some point in their lives. Unfortunately it takes mutual true love for a relationship to last a lifetime.  Could you possibly be confusing having the feeling of being \"in love\" and true love? Here's some information about love from the books True Love Lasts, Straight Talk About Teen Dating, and Straight Talk About Dating: “Unfortunately, lots of people don't know what true love is and that's a big reason why a large number of marriage relationships are unhappy. Many people think that true love is just a feeling. You know, the wonderful head spinning feeling of being “in love.” If true love is just a feeling, feelings come and go. But true love doesn't come and go. True love is patient and kind. It isn't jealous, rude, selfish, controlling, or easily angered. It forgives. It's supportive, loyal, hopeful, and trusting.  Unlike the feeling of being “in love” which is relatively easy to get especially during dating, true love usually develops slowly over a significant period of time (often years). In order to develop true love for someone you really have to know them well – which means that you have had a chance to observe their behavior in all types of situations (pay special attention to how they react when things go wrong or they don't get their way). True love is so much more than just the feeling of being “in love” - it's supposed to be a mutual lifelong commitment. When you say that you love your significant other, you're saying that you're committed to loving them for the rest of your life - for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, from this day forward, until death do you part. True love lasts - it almost never fails. Think of it this way, if a person has true love for another person, it's like the sun - it's always there no matter what (remember that even at night, the sun is still there, it's just shining on the other side of the earth - and when it's cloudy outside the sun is also still there, it's just behind the clouds).  On the other hand, the feeling of being “in love” is like sunshine - even though we'd like it to be sunny every day, the truth is that the amount of sunshine changes regularly. Some days it's nice and sunny and the feeling of being “in love” is strong, on others it's partly cloudy and the feeling of being “in love” is there but it's not very strong, and on other days it's cloudy and the feeling of being “in love” is barely there at all. I'm hoping that this explanation is helping you to see that it's possible for a person to have true love for another person and not have a strong intense feeling of being “in love” with that person at a particular moment. (If you talk with married couples, I think they'll tell you that the strength of their feelings of being “in love” changes regularly.)  So when you hear someone say, “I don't love him or her anymore” - take it for what it usually is. It's usually someone saying that they've lost the feeling of being “in love”, that they don't know how or they're not willing to make the effort required to get the feeling back, and that they probably never had true love for their significant other to begin with because true love almost never fails.  Many times I've heard young women say, “my boyfriend loves me.” Unfortunately, most of these women have been fooled. How could their boyfriend possibly have true love for them if their boyfriend doesn't even know what true love is? Sadly many people marry when one or both people don't have true love for the other - and the result is usually divorce because it's hard to keep a marriage together when it's based only on the feeling of being \"in love.\"  My first suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you're not already). A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), puts forth their best effort, and displays self-control (of their body, anger, tongue and money).  It's going to be tough, but my second suggestion is that you eventually look for this type of girl (otherwise you are setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately this type of woman is difficult to find – but save yourself the heartache and don't settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps!         ", 4556, "U4o8Bs4xaa", 1],

Do not be afraid of insulting her on her flaws, or insulting her taste in men, especially since she is not attracted to you.  The quicker you assure her you are not her friend because she is not attracted to you  the more animosity you will get from her which will probably help you get past her, in the years to come.   But it may take years to get over her.   Been there.   Once you do, you will be free of that problem, and able to live your life the way you want.     In the meantime, well, some people join the Army to help with this problem.  Being placed in a life and death situation makes a person think about other things.  ", 4556, "6mVpfmR6aa", 1],
