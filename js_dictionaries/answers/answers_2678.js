In other words, the church fabricated salvation by crucifixion against the clear teachings of Jesus (peace be  upon him).", 11436, "7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa", -1],

You see, if you are a true believer and you repent of your sins only then will he forgive you for them. Not only that, but he will make it harder for you to sin. The Bible says in John 3 (KJV): 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. AND     Mark 1:14-15     14Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,     15And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. [Repent, and then believe. Not vice versa. You see 'When Jesus began to preach, he didn't ask people to confess and believe in the gospel and then repent, but he first asked people to repent. Repentance is the first thing that Jesus asks of us.

Rev 5:10 says that these ones will be priests and kings and rule over the earth.   As for the rest of the dead, they will be resurected to earth.

Where will they all live?  The land surface of the earth at present is about 57,000,000 square miles.  If half of that were set aside for other purposes there would still be just a little less that an acre per person, which can provide more than enough food.  The reason there isn't enough food today is because of the political rivalry and commercial greed.  Under God's rule the whole earth would be blessed.  As for Hell, there is no such place.
