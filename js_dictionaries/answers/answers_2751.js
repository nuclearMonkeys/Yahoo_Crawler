	143397 : ["lol, though I should probably be insulted, I'm gonna take the bait.  I'm a fat girl with a hot guy.  No, really.  Here's my theory about why that's a lot less common than a fat guy with a hot girl. It has been my personal observation that, for whatever reason, really big guys are even more harsh towards really big girls than average and below average guys.  (which makes no sense to me, but to each his own I guess.)  I have a very large friend (who's a guy) who would rather be single than with a big girl...  Why don't you see more hot guys with fat girls? It's the guy mentality.  I think a guy is more likely to get negative pressure from his friends if he dates someone who's considered generally non-attractive than a girl who does the same. I lucked out.  My boyfriend was one of my best friends for years, and as such, all of our best friends are mutual... so we both had everyone's blessings when we hooked up.", 11587, "None", 2],

	143399 : ["To have access to TV show and movie auditions, you'll need an agent.  And to get an agent (a legitimate one), you'll need professional acting experience.  The online and \"talent search\" type agents who claim they'll represent inexperienced actors are frauds who make their money by charging for classes, head shots and other promotional materials that are completely useless.  They're not the agencies casting directors call when they're looking for actors and they have neither the ability nor the intention of finding anyone work.  But legitimate agents never offer classes or ask for money up front, since they're providing a service.  They only get paid when their clients do, since they earn a percentage of what an actor is paid for a job.  Because their own livelihoods and reputations are tied to the actors they represent, they can't afford to represent actors who haven't already proven their talent in a professional environment. Just about everyone you see on TV and in movies started out in community theater, since that's about the only place an aspiring actor can learn while gaining the experience required to access other opportunities.  If you enroll in classes at a local theater and show that you're talented and committed to learning and mastering the craft of acting, you'll be considered for roles in upcoming productions.  Once you've appeared in a few of those, you'll have the professional credentials required to shop for an agent who may be able to find you other work.  Most stage actors also work in commercials, TV and movies, so your theater peers will be able to recommend legitimate agents when you're ready to take that step. Building a career is a process and the dues-paying process is designed to weed out wannabes from those who are serious about acting.  Just about everyone thinks it would be fun to be an actor, but very few people are willing to invest years learning and mastering the craft of acting.  The fake agents take advantage of people who are looking for shortcuts -- people who want fame, but who aren't serious about acting.  Legitimate agents need to know the actors they represent are committed to their craft.  If you show that you can recreate the same character night after night on stage without your performances becoming predictable and stale, agents will know you're the real deal and consider representing you.", 11590, "KBBonf97aa", 1],

Then write about it again, describing it differently, using different descriptive phrases and different metaphors.  Then write about it again, looking at it from a different angle.  And again.  You will find you are getting more creative with your use of language. Also, try playing with language.  Find a word you like (eg by flipping open a dictionary) and work it into a short piece of writing.  Then use it in another, and another.  Explore the possibilities of that word.
