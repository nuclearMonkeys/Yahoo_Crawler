First get your friends to help you, having a group supporting you will help a lot. next find a no stress hobby, something you really love to do.

	138970 : ["The World Wildlife Fund was established well before the World Wrestling Federation and are thus entitled to the \"WWF\" trademark and logo.  As the Court ruled.  The Court wasn't \"stupid\", they just followed the letter of the law and gave the \"WWF\" trademark to the group that established it first. But it didn't make much sense for that group to sue over the use of the \"WWF\" logo because by the time they did the World Wrestling Federation had already made \"WWF\" synonymous with the World Wrestling Federation.  The World Wildlife Fund didn't gain anything out of it and the money they spent taking the case to court could have been better spent on something else. It actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Vince McMahon, though.  He got to make some fun out of the suit in public and he got to do a big humorous advertising campaign for changing the name of the company (the WWE got the \"F\" out). The name change would have happened sooner or later, anyway.  The World Wide Wrestling Federation was the name of the company when they were a large northeast territory.  Vince Junior just took the word \"Wide\" out of the WWWF.  And once it became a national promotion in the mid 80's, then a global company in the late 80's, \"World Wrestling Federation\" didn't really fit it anymore because that was the company \"up north\" as most fans and wrestlers referred to it, and was the company Vince was changing to become the global phenomenon it became. Vince would have changed the name eventually; the court case just sped it up. But yeah, all the World Wildlife Fund gained from that suit was a little publicity for a short while.  The WWE gained far more.", 11411, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 1],

	138972 : ["Why is Cena vs Taker important to The Dragon?  Simply because Cena is THE face of pro wrestling, it's most recognizable star, the most in-demand performer from pro wrestling and \"sports entertainment\" wanted for guest appearances by other forms of entertainment (I'm not counting The Rock because he's not a full-time wrestler or full-time member of the WWE; he's an actor who does an occasional match for the WWE, that's all).  Cena is this generation's \"Hulk Hogan\" or \"Ric Flair\" or \"Stone Cold\".  It absolutely does not matter at all if the IWC \"hates\" him.  The quotation marks are intentional.  If those who claim to hate Cena really hated him as much as they claim then they wouldn't watch the WWE nor would they spend so much time and energy blaming Cena for everything wrong in the world.  Cena is, without question, the biggest wrestling star in the world of the past ten years.  He does it because he loves it and loves the fans.  Cena lives to be a WWE \"superstar\".  Lesnar, on the other hand, did it, and does it today, strictly for the money, nothing else. The Undertaker, much like Andre The Giant, has transcended the company he works for.  Taker, like Andre, occupies a whole other plane of stardom nobody else does, not even Cena.  That's a very apt correlation.  If Cena is this generation's Hulk Hogan, then Taker is this generation's Andre The Giant.  Hogan and Andre were the two biggest forces of the 80's.  Cena and Taker are the biggest forces today.  And they certainly define the old saying of \"the irresistible force (Cena) meeting the immovable object (Taker)\". Their first go-round happened when Cena was basically a rookie trying to make a name for himself.  Taker was already established.  Cena did well but he was basically just getting started.  Taker is past his prime, yes, but still a very dangerous opponent capable of defeating anybody.  Cena can be said to be a little past his prime, as well, as injuries have slowed him down a bit.  But that doesn't matter.  They are still the two biggest forces in the WWE.  Still the two guys everybody wants to beat to make names for themselves. Cena is no longer that rookie trying to build a reputation.  He's done that already.  He IS the biggest star in the business and he's beaten everybody there is to beat in the WWE.  Except for The Undertaker. Taker, as well, has beaten everybody.  Except for John Cena.  A whole lot of fans consider Taker the greatest of all-time.  But unless he faces Cena at Wrestlemania that claim isn't valid.  They are the two biggest stars in the business.  They HAVE to face each other at Wrestlemania. If Cena is the one to end The Streak the WWE will not lose any viewers.  Those who obsess over Cena will be back the very next night \"hating\" him while they watch RAW.  The snivelers will be back on the internet blaming Cena for everything wrong in the world, whining about Taker getting \"screwed\", believing Cena somehow someway manipulated Vince into making Taker lose or some BS.  Win lose or draw, doesn't matter, the WWE won't lose any viewers. BQ:  Absolutely!  The original Four Horsemen are the blueprint, the prototype, the standard, and any other word you may want to use, for the pro wrestling stable.  They exemplified what it means to be a TEAM where nobody was more important than anybody else, where the group as a whole had common goals and they all did their parts to achieve those goals, where the group itself was more important than any of it's members.  The original Horsemen were a nearly perfect collection of five individuals who became greater as a stable than they were as singles (or tag team) champions.  Unless you got to see them in the mid 80's it's hard to describe to somebody who didn't get to see them just how great the group was.  There have been some excellent stables since then (the original nWo and DX especially) who got it mostly right but they didn't quite measure up to the standard of excellence that was The Four Horsemen.  Ric Flair, Tully Blanchard, Ole and Arn Anderson, JJ Dillon.  We'll never see the likes of that again.  As the old saying goes, \"often imitated but never duplicated\".", 11409, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 10],
