Embrace the surprise that you fell in love with a dress, irrelevant of it's color! I was positive Iwanted to paint my house a true gray color (white base with a touch of black). While looking at the gray paint colors, I kept being attracted to this pretty blue/gray paint chip, time and time again. But I never wanted a blue/gray house or anything remotely blue.

And until the feelings HAVE died out for both, we never know if a lasting relationship of actual love and mutual nurturing can be built. She is your ex for a reason. Even if you could get her back, you would only get the same result because you are still you and she is still herself. All you are doing is prolonging your own recovery and creating more suffering for yourself. Let go and move on. She doesn't really want to be friends .. she just doesn't want to feel responsible for your feelings being hurt or you feeling inadequate about yourself. You need to start total non-contact right now, and maintain it for at least 6 months past the time when you are completely over her.

There's no law and you can do what you want.  It's an \"old fashioned\" etiquette rule that spouses must be invited, and guess what?  If your husband ever gets an invite that doesn't include you, you have a leg to stand on!  But you'd be a hypocrite if you point this out.  ", 4596, "Ohcyim3Kaa", 4],
