All you get for £25 a day is an unqualified illegal immigrant with no checkable references. Or for that money you get an unqualified au pair who is expected to help with child care and household duties (operative word being to \"help\", not to do it all for you), and £25 a day pocket money while they stay in the UK to learn English is still on the miserly side. If done correctly then you can also expect your male or female au pair to have almost no English when you first meet. So they're not even a real nanny substitute.", 5563, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],

That is the \"by the book\" safe way to deal with the pool so a law wouldn't surprise me.   You should be grateful that they are taking care of this for you.  I've had rentals where they just leave a note with a closet of pool chemicals for you to figure out.  Otherwise I'm sure they would rather not have to come every day either, but it's the right way to deal with a pool.

We drive to the store and eat them packaged  in tiny little plastic wrappers...so our natural instincts DO NOT actually influence our eating behavior... We have the choice to buy anything we want, and the chance to evolve beyond, much beyond the primitive cave dweller we once were and have far far succeeded that hunted their food with sharpened rocks on sticks...
