That kind of thing just shows the ignorance of some of the Obama-haters. They really don't care about historical facts. The Republicans have used the Nazi tag for years, they love buzzwords, because most of the hoi-polloi who follow the party line are too stupid and/or uneducated to look beyond images and epithets. Calling someone a Nazi is a woeful display of ignorance and scare-mongering - something that the GOP has become expert at. But again, the GOP shows it's manipulativeness, and the party faithful their sheeplehood, when they use images of swastikas and mustaches when they insult Obama.

That's why reconciliation has been referred to as the \"nuclear option\" since abusing that procedure would open the door for both parties to use it all the time to pass/repeal legislation instead of using the procedure sparingly.  Reportedly, Republicans are not against using reconciliation, in general, if there are bipartisan support for a piece of legislation but the only thing that has been bipartisan about the Democrats health care reform has been opposition to it. Both Democrats and Republicans voted against the bill but only Democrats voted in favor of it.  In any event, according to recent polls 55% of Americans are now in favor of repealing the act, and you can expect Republicans to try to use \"repeal and replace\" as a campaign slogan in mid-term elections of 2010 and presidential elections in 2012.

He was energetic and gung ho and his dream that he professed was to kill a Jap.  His sargeant saw him glump one day and asked him why, and soldier worried that as the days past he wouldn't get to kill a jap.  So the sargeant told him to go to the north side of the island along a hill line and to look for one of a dozen caves.  Once he was within shouting distance all he would have to do is crouch behind some rocks and yell out \"To Hell with Emperor Hirohito\".  Days past and the sargeant happened upon the soldier at mess.  He approached the soldier and asked him if he killed his Jap.  The soldier then told him NO.  The sargeant said what happened, didn't you find the cave?  Yes was the reply, the caves were easy to find.  Well wasn't there a jap inside?  Yes, there was one that came out right away?  And, said the sargeant. Well when the Jap came out he yell at me in perfect english \"To Hell with President Roosevelt\" and stood right in my line of sight.  Well, what happened, asked the sargeant?  \"Well sarg, I couldn't shoot a republican\".   Then 2nd joke went like this: Eveyday a business man walked to a newstand, paid a nickle and looked at the front page, then place the paper back down without reading a word scarce the title.  One day after years of this daily habit seeming quite pecular, the news stand owner asked the gentlemen, \"What are you looking for\".  \"An obituary\" replied the business man.
