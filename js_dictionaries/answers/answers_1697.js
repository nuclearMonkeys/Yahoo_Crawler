For the wedding, some people just considered the gift they gave us for the shower a present for both the shower and the wedding.  Some people gave us an additional present off the registry, like household items or gift cards (which we loved!! they are the best present besides cash!).  If it were me giving someone a gift, I would give the bride something kind of girly for her shower...after all it's a BRIDAL shower.  The nightgown then would be great.  Then I would give them the gift card for the wedding.  That seemed to be the most common thing we got, but you could do it either way and any gift you give would be appreciated.

If you've spent as much as you want to already, then give just the nightgown at the shower and the gift card at the wedding.   Contrary to an earlier poster's advice, you do not need to give money for a wedding gift.  Any gift (cash, a gift card, an item off a registry or an item of your own choosing) are appropriate.  Technically, no gift is required, but custom is to give one if you attend the wedding or are close to either the bride or groom. By the way, the wedding invitation was correct not to include a registry list.  It is considered rude and crass to suggest a wedding present.

The last words you said (( i wish he could take me back )) were like a strike on the head after reading what you wrote, and i'm gonna tell you why,, but first look we could be so complicated to the point of having an opposite effect by appearing simple.. meaning no one will ever understand how our minds work ,, depending on your description of this guy he could be the ultimate JERK if we look at it in a certain way , but at the same time he may be considered to have done nothing wrong and making a total sense  since he was straight up with you... But anyway it's not about him right, you are the one important in this equation... Now allow me to say that you've never LOVED him cuz love is about letting go and swallowing your hurt if you know that your loved one is happy and not clinging up on him so obviously,,, maybe you loved the idea of him and maybe some where inside you.. You just couldn't except him rejecting you so emotionally it was interpreted by wanting him , will i'll never know.. But i know that your aching because of him and your not living it because of him. So just realize that you deserve better than this... So look the day you stop asking questions and seeking help for a relationship you're in cuz you know it concerns only the two of you , and when you stop thinking cuz you know what you have is a feeling that can never be described , and when you NEVER REACH THE POINT where you could even think about saying ( i wish he takes me back ) .

For example, the federal income tax.  All others fail to one extent or another, some of them devastatingly so.   Consumption taxes -- VAT and sales and use taxes -- are the worst of all as they transfer most of the burden to the poor and middle class who must spend nearly every dollar that they earn on taxable goods and services.
