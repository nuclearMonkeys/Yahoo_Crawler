No one got rich  over estimating the intelligence of the general public. Then you need to commit 18+ hrs a day to the business and then some good luck on top of that.  Then you need to say the right things so the stock market thinks you've got a great company even if it's losing trillions and finally sell a big chunk of the company when the share price is absurdly high. Most people don't have the original ideas and even more want some life outside of their work, rather than work ridiculous hours in the slim hope their company will one day be the next Microsoft or Amazon.", 623, "HdLKZwkyaa", 0],

	3820 : ["The danger is the combination of Volts times Amps which is power and causes cooking burns of the body. A current of 1 to 3.5A can stop the heart if it passes through the chest area. The body resistance is about 10K ohms so it would take 10,000 to 3,5000V to do that. Generally DC Voltage causes burns and AC Voltages cause nerve damage and heart arrest and brain damage.", 621, "a8pRDaIyaa", 1],
	3821 : ["Look at it this way. The amps are what kill you but it is the volts that push the amps through your body. So it takes a combination of the two to be deadly. You have to have a high enough voltage to do the pushing and enough amperage to do the damage. ", 621, "AA10332086", 2],
	3822 : ["24 volts is below the hazardous voltage limit. Current is that determined by the body resistance and the voltage. Currents above about 10 mA are painful, currents above about 100 mA can kill. A 24 volt 10 amp supply is not more hazardous than a 24 volt 100 mA one, in fact neither are hazardous except under unusual circumstances. 24 volt 30 mA is even less hazardous than those. A 200 volt 10 amp supply is not more hazardous than a 200 volt 100 mA one and both can be lethal. Bottom line, current is what kills, but current is determined by voltage and body resistance, I = E/R. Current thru your body is NOT the max rating of the supply, but by the calculation above.", 621, "8Y7LQ6TGaa", 3],
