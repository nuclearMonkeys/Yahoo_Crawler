But they are both not good for us because it's deep fried in oil and we don't know how long the oil has been sitting there. I have a theory...do you know why it's called Popeyes?

Costa Rica may not have an army officially, but it does have a national police force called the Civil Guard, which is unusually heavily-armed for a so-called police force.  The Civil Guard fought a number of bloody border skirmishes with the Sandinistas back in the 80s and stood up to them fairly well, so you tell me:  Does that sound like a police force to you? Ditto for the Iceland situation.  True Iceland doesn't have an army, but it does have an unusually large and heavily-armed coast guard, which it used in the \"Cod War\" with the Brits a decade ago. In both areas, the international situation has been stable for a long period of time.  The states of Central America were US satellites from about 1850 until the overthrow of Somoza in the early 80s.  Under these circumstances, the Costa Ricans could afford to disband their army because the Pax Americana guaranteed their borders.  A similar situation prevailed in the North Atlantic where Iceland is located.  The British Empire, and later NATO, and now finally the EU have guaranteed Iceland's territorial sovereignty.  Thus, no local army was required.  In all of these cases however, the dominant state and/or alliance most certainly did require an army, as well as a navy and an air force, to ensure compliance with it's hegemony.", 9852, "2apYbVzlaa", 6],
	103611 : ["It would be good in an ideal world, but the world works under the \"Realist\" theory of international politics. Basically, according to the realist view, the world is anarchical (no central government, all countries are really alone), every country wants power, must survive, and thus needs an army for self-defense and take more land if necessary. It is impossible to trust your neighboring countries, because you never know if they will be your enemy tomorrow. Nor can you trust others enough to disband your army, because a more ruthless and power hungry State will take advantage of it and attack. this is specially true with world powers, who rely on their armies and military operations to hold on to their positions of power and provide a stable life for the citizens of a country. Imagine if the U.S. gets rid of the military, trying to start a weaponless peaceful world. Countries such a north Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba, which are weak States, will be among the first to attack a defenseless U.S. Another world power would then take the opportunity to achieve regional hegemony in the American continent, and we would probably be screwed. A defenseless world is just a dream, and an impossible one at that.", 9852, "rlNdaP31aa", 6],
