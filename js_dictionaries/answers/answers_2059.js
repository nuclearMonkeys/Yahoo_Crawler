Also, when my son was about 18 months, he started to throw really horrible temper tantrums, that would last for hours and none of my friends had experienced this type of extremely out-of-control violent behaviour from a baby.  I was shopping and he started one of the first really horrible long ones, so I took him out of the store onto the concrete entrance to the store which terrified me because I knew he'd start banging his head on the concrete if I put him down but I was almost dropping him because he was writhing around so much.  I didn't know what to do and I was almost crying too.  And then this lady came over and she showed me how to hold him so he could move.  I don't know how I didn't come up with that myself but nobody had suggested it before either and it worked.  I used that technique for years afterwards (until he was too big for it to work).  Great advice that saved me from a random person at the grocery store.", 10067, "KmQw6vd2aa", 2],

	108707 : ["hello. I have been thru a lot of similar experiences in my 22 years of life as a female so perhaps I can help you. There are a few things that could be going on here.  One, this guy friend could be trying to guilt trip you a little.  I mean, put yourself in his shoes: if someone had broken your heart (and you were an immature young teen) you might handle it by throwing their feelings back in their face when you get the chance.  It can feel quite good to do so after letting yourself be vulnerable with bad consequences.  If he is doing this, it will pass, but there is no way around it really.  Falling in love would be easy if two people always fell for one another at the same pace...which never happens.  Ah, life...simple yet so complicated!!  Try to just enjoy it.  You only live once and nothing can last and nothing can be perfect.  Chalk it up to life, experience, and someday you will remember all this fondly. Now, for the part about you.  Sweetheart what you have been through is awful. I haven't talked to my own mother in a couple years and our relationsip and her whole self were destroyed by her divorce and she attempted many drug suicides and spent time in a mental hospital...tons of shady stuff went down....mistresses, secret bank accounts, restraining orders, love affairs, bastard children etc etc etc between my parents. It's AWFUL for a child to go through.....no need to sugar coat that.  It's awful.  When I finally got the courage to seek professional therapy, the guy told me:  You are a trauma patient and must be treated as a trauma patient would receive therapy.  While it was hard to acknowledge the seriousness of my situation, it felt so good for someone to finally recognize how strong I had been.  I know you've been very strong too and it's hard when nobody seems to care.  **People (especially MALES) do not want to listen about problems they cannot fix.**  Do not take this personally; it is human nature.  The ego kicks in when a woman says \"Change my tire\" or \"Open this jar\"...men love that.  But get emotional and talk about your baggage and they will run in the other direction.  It's a fact of life.  The only way around this is to find somebody who truly cares about you unconditionally.  It does not only exist in movies, trust me.  Be yourself and that person will come along.  You cannot choose them, but they will come along.  It happened to me and I have my 3 close people and they are my saviors.  Everyone else abandoned me and I'm glad they didn't stick around to use me more. All in all, from reading your specific story, it sounds like neither one of these guys really care about you.  They might have thought they did, but it can be hard to distinguish infatuation from true devotion, and true devotion doesn't happen very often in the immature impulses of middle school boys.  Unromantic, but true.  Not what we wanna hear  as females, but true.  The real-life nittygritty way to get thru this?  Keep your head up and rely only on yourself.  Get real help and heal actively.  What's been done to you is unfair.  The only thing that would be more of a shame is if you let your beautiful self go to waste over some silly boys who are less than half as strong as you.  It is true that what doesn't break you makes you stronger, and you will be ahead because of it in the long run.  You are beautiful and any guy who misses that the first time around doesn't deserve a second glance cuz they clearly just aren't getting it.  You're the bomb, and they just don't get it.  Their loss.

	108713 : ["Well, my birthday is November 9th, and my older brother's is September 30th.  The kindergarten cutoff date was September 1st in the place that we lived at the time my brother was starting school, but he went to a private school which allowed him to start kindergarten when he was 4 going on 5.  By the time I started, we were both going to public school and my parents went ahead and just let me start when I was 5 going on 6...I don't know that they even would have let me start early if my parents had wanted me to. I did just fine in school and I feel that I definitely started at the right time.  My brother was smart and advanced for his age (whereas I was definitely more \"average\"), so I can see how he might have been a bit bored or not as challenged if he had started school a year later.  But, he also definitely had some disadvantages.  It isn't just about how smart you are, but also emotional maturity. These days, I think the majority of places have full-day kindergarten, and 6-7 hours is an awfully long schoolday for a 4 year old, regardless of their academic level.  And it can be hard when you're younger than most people in your grade, particularly in the later grades.  My brother was already small for his age, but then being with the older kids, he got picked on and bullied a lot in middle school.  When he started 6th grade he was still such a scrawny little thing and wasn't even 11 yet.  That's something else to consider...if you send your 4 year old to kindergarten (or have your 5 year old skip K and start 1st grade), that means your kid will only be 10 when they start middle school (unless your school district is one of the few anymore that keep 6th grade in elementary school), and barely teenagers themselves (13) when they start high school where there will be 17 and 18 year olds.  And then you'll be sending them off to college when they are still 17 year old minors (my mom had quite a hard time dropping my brother off two states away!)  I also agree with what desmeran said...if your son has a June birthday, that would already make him one of the younger ones in his grade if he started at the normal time.  He could potentially be close to two years younger than some of his classmates if he started this year.  I honestly don't think I've ever heard of any place that lets kids start school that young...it's usually the fall babies like my brother and me (who would be the oldest in their class if they started at the \"normal\" time) that they might give some leeway. And personally, I don't think totally skipping kindergarten is a good idea.  Going from preschool, or no school at all, and straight into 1st grade would be hard.  Kindergarten is definitely a good bridging gap between the two.  They still don't expect quite as much as they do in 1st grade, and there's not as much \"work\", but they learn to get used to being in school all day, and definitely brush up on their skills and be more prepared for 1st grade.", 10068, "dcNdPnwmaa", 0],

Sure, at first you're giong to be constantly thinking about him and wondering what he is doing and how he is etc, etc. BUT you need to be strong. You  need to convince yourself that you don't need anyone that doesn't need you. And if he no longer needs you, then why should you need him? It isn't fair to yourself to waste your time on someone that will no reciprocate the feelings. Who knows? Maybe he told you that you guys are cool but secretly he still holds it against you that your relationship didn't work out in the past. Maybe he has been hurting a lot too because you broke his heart and now he just isn't able to trust anyone either, especially you. So like I said, all I can really offer you is to distance yourself for a bit. I know it sounds crappy but in my experience, it's the only way to heal a heartbreak. That saying about how time heals, it's true. It's cliche, but true. Everything gets easier to deal with in time.

They are in class with both younger and older kids so its natural that they excel rather quickly, but again, for us its important that that foundation is strong. IMO, testing to skip kindergarten can do a small child more harm than good.  Kids can be heartless and they form circles/bonds.  Some 1st graders that have gone to kindergarten together have formed friendships and should they not \"let him in\" it can cause him emotional problems.  Plus, he will miss out on things they learn that have nothing to do with workbooks, such as the songs and other teachings.  No way would I allow our kids to miss out on these things.

Pork can just be seasoned the way you like, or you can do a Dijon, fresh lemon juice and garlic marinade.  It's pretty good and only has to marinade an hour or so. Grill as well.  Chicken can have jerk or cajun seasoning on it, marinaded in a lemon herb mixture. Make some Italian sausage with peppers and onions.  Serve a side of Spaghettini and Pesto of your choice.  Toss a beef or pork roast in the crock pot with root veg's.  Cook up some Italian sausage and onion with fresh minced garlic to add to your favorite Marinara sauce, mix with your fav pasta and top with mozarrella or provolone and bake in oven at 400 for about 15 minutes until the top browns.

Season them with fresh minceed garlic and bacon grease before you leave for work or whatever.  When you get home you'll probably need to add a few things like salt and perhaps a bit more of the garlic and bacon grease.  The bacon grease is a must for REAL mexican pinto beans.

Homemade doesn't take that long nor is it difficult) Bratwurst, German potato salad, cooked purple cabbage Grilled cheese sandwich with green chili in it.  So-o good.
