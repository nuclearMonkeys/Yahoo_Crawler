	13366 : ["Well, it was because Nintendo had a partnership with Japanese giant mobile company, DeNA, where both companies tries to develop cross-platfofm service, across PC, Smartphone, and Nintendo's consoles. Due to this, Nintendo decides to remove the native voice chat feature from the Switch, and implements a very convoluted system with the Smartphone app for doing it, which was developed with DeNA's \"help\". So, if you're wondering why the Switch was so bad in terms of Voice Chat and other basic stuffs like party chat/invites/friendlist etc, it was all because of DeNA...", 2236, "EBeItD4Jaa", 0],
	13367 : ["Because Nintendo seems to have built the Switch almost exclusively as a machine made for gaming and has left all of the other stuff out or relegated it to the mobile app. I don't think they've said exactly why but I'm guessing it was because they wanted to keep the price of the console down and excluding those extra bits that people may not necessarily need is an easy way to do that.  For one reason or another, online multiplayer has always been an afterthought for Nintendo. Putting a microphone on the console wouldn't make sense anyway because it would only be usable in handheld mode.", 2236, "ASCIOsbwaa", 0],
	13368 : ["Viruses?  Let's see.  Influenza is different every year is a virus, a Cold is a virus(no, we have no cure for it yet) . They think that Cancer may be a virus too. . There may be some others but they do not come to mind at this present moment. Viruses are not bacteria(they live inside of bacteria as they are that much smaller)   They are able to hide inside human cells and thus protected from the white blood cells that roam the streets and make sure all the diseases are under control.  However the white blood cells do not attack the bodies red blood cells that have these viruses hiding inside of them and multiplying until they do come out and YOU get sick. .   This one has proven to be that smart even though it is not alive but that is what it does.  Which is new. .  All other diseases were a walk in the park compared to this one as most of those were an actual \"bug\" or live organism.    .  So white blood cells have to be informed on how to find them. No different than finding a virus from you computer.  It has to leave a trace of itself and the programmer has to see that coding and write a \"counter code\" to defeat it.   Something like that.", 2237, "None", 0],
	13369 : ["I will add, why. Viruses are not alive as we know it, so antibiotics which interfere with the life cycle of bacteria have nothing to work on.

	13398 : ["Generally, your whole immune system improves and you feel significantly better. One common problem of most people who struggle with weight loss is due to emotional eating, especially eating sugary foods whenever we feel down. We always hear about these so-called miracle weight loss cures. Add cinnamon to food for weight loss, or eating peppers helps with weight loss or lemon and honey and black pepper.I don't really care about what a study says about any of these to be honest. If you consume 5 gallons of ice cream and 6 liters of soda every day and you also consume cinnamon or honey or lemon or peppers then I guarantee you that you will not lose weight.If water, honey, lemon juice and pepper are the best things you eat in a day, and everything else you eat is loaded with sugar and void of nutrition then you will not be very likely to lose weight.I think where remedies like this gain steam with the media is because of that bigger picture I was talking about. Let's say we are looking at the eating of peppers for weight loss (this one is common and is easy to make an example of).The type of person who is likely to eat a lot of peppers may also eat a lot of other vegetables. A person who eats a lot of vegetables may not have much room for sugary foods or foods that are not doing anything positive for their body. Because of these things, this person may lose weight.So, did the peppers cause the weight loss or is it the lifestyle?The media doesn't ever report the rest of the picture. They see \"honey and lemon causes weight loss\" and they write their little story. Then people read it and figure they can eat anything they want as long as they add lemon and honey to the mix that they will be thin and healthy.I don't care about gimmicks and fads and quick results that won't last. If we are talking about long-term, sustainable weight loss, then that is going to come from a holistic approach. Eating a diet very high in colorful vegetables and fruits and good fats and avoiding processed foods that are filled with sugar is absolutely a great way to lose weight, keep it off, and improve your health.If you do those things AND add lemon/honey/pepper water then sure, you will lose weight. To me, the bigger picture is that these things may be a contributor, but by themselves would not cause weight loss...at least not in the long term.", 2238, "AQLIy01Laa", 1],
