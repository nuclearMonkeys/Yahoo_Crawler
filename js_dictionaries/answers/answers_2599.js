One thing is to supply the troops (like Sun Tzu said \"the invading army feeds of the land that conquers\") another thing is the troop movements, those are called maneuvers.The movement of troops is another part of military strategy as well. I quote Sun Tzu because his book \"Art of War\" was Napoleon's favorite (along with Machiavelli's The Prince). Nobody seemed to read Sun Tzu again in Europe until after WW1. If you read it you'll see why Napoleon used the troops the way he did.", 11301, "None", 1],
	135786 : ["Yes, logistics is supply of good that require to complete the mission, without parts and equipment the military can't complete their mission, also reason why U.S. military so powerful is because of massive logistics support worldwide, one reason why had base all around the world help a lot when a war broke in the region, is that you got logistics support form the base nearby then depend on some other nation or thousands of miles away from home.  Example U.S. has a base in Bahrain the Persia Gulf and has Logistics support from dubai, otherwhise will make almost impossible to Naval Ship to spend great deal of that in the region without resupply of logistics.

	135809 : ["Napoleon is perfect person to discuss when it comes to logistics or failure of it in the military and losing a war because of it, at least partially.   Logistics is getting things and people from one place to anotther.  Napoleon moved faster than his supply lines and was stuck out there and got supplies cut off.  His troops were starving and didn't have warm enough clothing and so even though the army was large and powerful, they were defeated by the weather and their lack of planning - logistics.  Supplies didn't keep up.  They expected to get war over fast but people fled cities and left nothing there for them and so they couldn't replenish supplies.  They were defeated.  They ended up walking ack to France, many dying, and many sick, and in disgrace.  Think about what you have read as to what happened to the French army and why.  Perfect example about logistics.  Think not just about troop movements but also supply movement. that played part int he defeat of the south in America too.  The north had more trains and manufacturing to make supplies and materials for war while south was agriculture.  So north took trains to take troops and supplies south.  South had agriculture but could not get food supplies to the troops and people like Gen. Sherman burned the fields and deprived the south of any help and they could not replenish their supplies.   Have to think about supplies and replacements as aprt of military strategy.  There was a big fear in WWII as Patton kept moving out in front of supplies and was sometimes cut off.  He didn't get caught in a bad spot but that was partly because people welcomed him.  But he was a pain to his leadership as they had to worry about supplying him and he was out like a hotdog ripping ahead but could have been cut off and destroyed at any time.  Was hard for his men and hard to support.", 11301, "AA11043457", 2],
