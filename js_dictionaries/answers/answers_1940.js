This baby is completely incapable of life without you right now, and it's the greatest gift you can give. You just found out, give it some time to sink in. I wanted to get pregnant but when I did, I went through a flood of very negative emotions about money, not being ready to take care of it, how my life was gonna change etc. It's normal, especially if this is your first and it's taken you by surprise. I was super stressed about it in a bad way, but a couple of weeks later, my maternal instincts already started to kick in and I became so overjoyed about the baby that the problems I thought I would have took a back seat in my mind. Now I don't care about my financial situation or anything else, I just care about my child. You didn't mention how far along you are, but if you're 6 weeks or over. Try and get an early ultrasound so you can see your little peanut and the heartbeat. Once you see that, and once he sees that, you will be so in love, I promise you!  It's an amazing moment. Nothing else is going to matter to you. But during your pregnancy if you do have financial issues, there are plenty of resources you can use to make things smoother. If you are uninsured then you qualify for state Medicaid, which mean no cost healthcare for you and the baby. There are also agencies out there to help, even if you just need someone to talk to. Find your local Birthright international location. All their services are free of charge and they even offer free maternity and baby clothes.   You are not going to struggle the rest of your lives. It's only the beginning. The baby may delay some plans, but they will eventually happen. If he says he will support you no matter what you do, then he needs to stop being negative, it's not good for you or the baby, and he's being selfish to be honest. There's another life involved here now, not just his! Take some time away from him and focus on yourself for a bit if you need to. I promise it will all fall into place if he really does love you.

As for you, motherly instincts come naturally for women. And the family may not be so happy for your pregnancy, but they will support you. Read 'What to expect when you're expecting' its a wonderful book that will answer a lot of your questions. As far as saving up for when the baby come.. Have a baby shower.. A lot of what you'll need you will get. My sister had a family baby shower & a friend baby shower.. It helped tremendously!! Also, when she had a little extra money, she would by a box of diapers every 2 weeks.. So she was stocked up for when the baby came.

Here's why: nVidia has the advantages of lots of superior nVidia proprietary features like: * CUDA cores (Compute Unified Device Architecture) * nVidia GPUDirect and nVidia PureVideo HD 1080p, an nVidia hardware feature designed to offload video decoding processes and video post-processing from a computer's CPU (processor) hardware to the nVidia's GPU hardware, used in all series GeForce 6 and later and GeForce M for laptops * PhysX (a proprietary realtime physics engine middleware SDK) All those features lack on the ATI/AMD cards... What all that translates into, is more stress put on your CPU to compensate when using an ATI/AMD card, and degraded overall performance in games and other graphics intense applications. That's why AMD uses cheap tricks such as putting the GPU on one board (what they call dual graphics) or creating the AMD APU series processors (an all-in-one CPU+GPU) in a desperate (and failed) attempt to compete against an nVidia GPU from the same price range.", 9824, "P8E92nebaa", 1],

The twin fans keep it cool and it is pretty quiet. Unfortunately its back to $389, but its still the way I would go, if I was in your position again.
