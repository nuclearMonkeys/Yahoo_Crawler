Then comes the beauty of God's judgment, let's read it: Matthew 25:31-46 .  31 ‚ÄúWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. 34 ‚ÄúThen the King will say to those on his right, ‚ÄòCome, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' 37 ‚ÄúThen the righteous will answer him, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' 40 ‚ÄúThe King will reply, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' 41 ‚ÄúThen he will say to those on his left, ‚ÄòDepart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' 44 ‚ÄúThey also will answer, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' 45 ‚ÄúHe will reply, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' 46 ‚ÄúThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.‚Äù Revelation 11: 1-8. 1 \"Behold the dwelling place of God with men! He will dwell among them and they will be his people. and he will be the \"God-with-them.\" 4 And he shall wipe every tear from their eyes; there will be no more death, neither mourning, nor lamentation, nor breathlessness, because the things of the past have passed.\" 5 He who sat on the throne said, \"Behold, I make all things new,\" and added, \"Write, for these words are certain and true. 6 Behold, they are fulfilled! I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who is thirsty I will give for free water from the source of life. 7 He who is victorious will inherit these goods; I will be his God and he will be my son. 8 But for the vile and unbelieving, the wicked and the murderous, the immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and for all liars is reserved the burning pond of fire and sulfur.
