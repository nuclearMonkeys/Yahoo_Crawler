	126218 : ["Yes, or I wouldn't devote my life to it. One thing I wonder about is that we believe a portion of people chose to follow Satan before this life and will never gain a physical body or continue their progression.  Now, it is believed that they had full knowledge and made a choice and wouldn't change regardless because they are that stubborn and prideful and evil.  It just seems really hard for me to believe that so many people could really be that evil that they will never ever see the light and want to change.  I sometimes wonder if they did have regrets to the point where they wanted to honestly change, could they have a chance at doing it.  The answer would be that they aren't going to change, because they don't want to, but it is just really hard to believe that people can be in the presence of God and just outright deny him for eternity.  I often wonder how final everything really is in our final judgment. So I guess I sometimes wonder how things work, esp things that aren't clear and I sometimes wonder if we are really understanding it all based on our limited ability to understand things right now.  I try to comprehend infinity and it hurts my brain.  So clearly, we are giving information in a limited form to help us grasp some complex concepts.", 10895, "AA12383652", -1],

	126220 : ["I can't think of a thing I would disagree  with doctrinally with my church. However, some of their practices are a tad annoying.

	126222 : ["I didn't look it up or read the context surrounding it, but it sounds like it's saying that the only way for anyone to truly understand the Scriptures is for the Lord to work in our hearts.  Just proves that man cannot do it by himself, and that explains why a lot of people don't get it - they don't want to get it, so they shut God out.

Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. BUT the NATURAL man receiveth NOT the things of the Spirit of God; for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can he know them BECAUSE they are spiritually DISCERNED!

	126231 : ["I doubt domestic violence against men is not taken as seriously. Society might not take it seriously, but the police would. The reason the average person wouldn't think it's as bad is because MOST domestic violence is by men against women, and since *usually* men are bigger and stronger, they can do more harm. Where are you getting your statistics, by the way? You generalize to all women, which is irresponsible. Personally, I would prefer to go dutch on a first date.  I don't think implementing selective service for both sexes will happen any time soon, because it is simply not in the country's best interest. Forcing both men and women to go to war will endanger the next generation, and women ARE the ones who bear and raise the children. If you don't like it, tough.

I have more love and joy in my life than I thought possible. The very reason I accepted Christ is that I saw traits in Christians that I desperately wanted.  My cut and paste cheat answer from the \"Life Application Study Bible\". I included it, because it is really good. \"Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms\" means that in Christ we have all the benefits of knowing God—being chosen for salvation, being adopted as his children, forgiveness, insight, the gifts of the Spirit, power to do God's will, the hope of living forever with Christ. Because we have an intimate relationship with Christ, we can enjoy these blessings now. The \"heavenly realms\" means that these blessings are eternal, not temporal. The blessings come from Christ's spiritual realm, not the earthly realm of the goddess Artemis. Other references to the heavenly realms in this letter include Eph_1:20; Eph_2:6; Eph_3:10. Such passages reveal Christ in his victorious, exalted role as ruler of all.", 10884, "mrzeXJ6Eaa", 1],
	126264 : ["I don't *think* that when people ask someone to define god, that they are implying that they have the authority to define god.  They are saying they have the authority (and probably the responsibility) to define the concepts which they want to discuss. They are really saying what do you believe god to be like...something they must ask because we cannot walk up to god and poke him with a stick to determine His nature. I've spoken with both Christians and Muslims for example, and there are some important differences in how each conceive of God. If I want to understand what the other person means, I need to know what their concept of god is. Most Christians would agree that god is \"unchanging\" and that He is limited in a certain way (most agree god cannot violate basic laws of logic...He can't make \"dehydrated water\" for example). Muslims, however, do not believe God can be limited in anyway. God in Islamic theology can literally do anything: He can make \"square circles\", or \"married bachelors, or \"dehydrated water.\" God in Islam likewise is not unchanging...He can (and has) changed his mind. (Changing the proper direction of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca is just one example.) And then there are more New Age type people who will say things like \"God is love.\" That's important to any discussion. Even atheists would agree that, by that definition, god does exist.", 10897, "None", 1],
