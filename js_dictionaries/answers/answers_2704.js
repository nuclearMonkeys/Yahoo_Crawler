With the engine not running, the hood open, and the key on, have your friend push the washer control. listen for the sound of the washer pump motor. If you do not hear the pump (it should be very near the reservoir where you fill with washer fluid) the pump need to be replaced.  If the pump is running, look at the line (hose) that comes out of the pump. Follow that line to see if fluid is coming out anywhere. If there is no leak, pull the hose off of the nozzle and see if the fluid comes out of it. If it does, the nozzle is clogged.

	141043 : ["Right first of all how do these girls know you think they are hot? i never understand when guys say that it's like they think all girls know they are hot when tbh you don't even tell them that in the first place so how would they know? Now onto this whole topic. Most girls who KNOW they are \"hot\" are shallow hence why they flaunt themselves off hoping that some guy will love them and pay them attention because they think that's how to get a guy's attention. Yes it is one way to get his attention but not to earn his respect where he'll even care about you etc. These type of girls are shallow and think looks are everything because what they see in movies etc shows them this perfect image of men with six packs (same way men are shown images of perfect airbrushed celebs with false boobs and plastic surgery) and any other guy who doesn't have that isn't good enough for her. These girls need to understand that once the looks fade then what do you have left? just this horrible shallow personality which puts anyone off wanting to marry you later in life. Also money can't buy happiness. Yes money is essential and when you date someone or marry someone you need them to have a job and be financially stable so they don't sponge off you but I have never been interested in a guy's money because at the end of the day money can always run out and be meaningless if the banks folded yet love etc remains regardless what happens. Yes we all value looks as we need both physical and emotional attraction to someone otherwise you'll never become intimate with them etc. However looks shouldn't be the be all and end all of someone. Just think about this if you or this girl are shallow and date this person end up marrying them for looks only and when the looks start to fade you're only convos are \"hi how are you?\" and that's it. What kind of relationship/marriage is that really? Also plastic surgery in my opinion should only be used either in cases of disfigurements or to help someone feel more confident it should NOT be used for VANITY reasons like most people are using it for nowadays. The main reason for this is because yes you may look \"perfect\" after the surgery but when you get to 40+ the rest of your body ages and then your youthful face doesn't go with this saggy wrinkly body and in the end you destroy yourself so much to the point where no one recognises you and you end up back in square one with a face you hate etc. I'm 18 years old and i have been called gorgeous and beautiful alot by guys and some women but i don't let that go to my head, in fact i don't see what they see i just see an average looking girl yes i wear meake-up but i don't hide behind it. I use make-up because i generally look more me and presentable with it on and i also love make-up. However I'm not afraid to sit in my house etc without makeup on like now for instance. I don't use make-up as a mask to hide behind like some girls do like the ones you are talking about who then act like bitches with their make-up on. I am the same person i am with or without my make-up on and THAT is what makes me stand out from girls like that. Not ALL attractive women are shallow please in future will you stop generalising? i'm sick of everyone doing that it makes you look ignorant. Perfection is something that none of us can ever obtain people need to understand that and realise that quicker to be honest.", 11487, "iXhjGH4waa", 0],

Newcastle United Football Club (also known as The Magpies, or The Toon) are an English football club based in Newcastle upon Tyne, who were founded in 1892 after the merger of two local clubs, Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End. Newcastle are currently playing in the Football League Championship. The club's traditional kit colours are black and white striped shirts, with black shorts and socks. Supporters of Newcastle United refer to themselves as the Toon Army.[1] Early in the life of the club, Newcastle United played in red and white. This was later changed to black and white stripes, with the inspiration coming from a magpie the directors saw on the pitch.[citation needed] Newcastle have a long-standing rivalry with neighbouring Sunderland with whom they have contested the Tyne-Wear derby since 1898. They also hold a smaller local rivalry with Middlesbrough, which is referred to as the Tyne-Tees derby. Following their relegation, the club was put on sale for a price of £100 million. The owner Mike Ashley noted that \"“It has been catastrophic for everybody. I've lost my money and I've made terrible decisions. Now I want to sell it as soon as I can.\"[45] Newcastle United released an official statement on the clubs sale and included a press phone number and email address which was quickly made further public by the national press, although the address provided was merely for general enquiries. This resulted in a large number of hoax bids being sent, most of which were made by rival Sunderland supporters.[46] Further controversy was once again caused by Dennis Wise who claimed the club were still paying him £80,000 a month despite his departure in April 2009, and claimed it was a factor in why Ashley was struggling to sell the club.[47] In October 2009, Keegan's dispute with the club was resolved, 10 months on from his departure, receiving £2million compensation as agreed in his contract which the club failed to pay him following his resignation. A premier league arbitration panel, ruled in Keegan's favour citing that player Ignacio González was signed by Director of Football Dennis Wise against Keegan's wishes, but also against the principles of the generally understood role of a premier league manager, which usually states the manager's decision is final on player signings. The panel revealed that Wise asked Keegan to review González from youtube.com, no more than 24 hours before the closing of the summer transfer window, from which Keegan refuted the player. The club revealed to the panel that their response to the media and public critique was just ‘PR,' that Keegan had never been informed his word was not final, and that they were not in a position to sack him should he not have agreed to their demands.[48] Following Keegan rejecting talk of a 3rd return to Newcastle, feeling the fans had 'had enough' of him,[49] Chris Hughton was confirmed as the club's full time manager in late October 2009, until the end of the 2010/11 season. He stated \"It's a very proud day for me to be named as the manager of this magnificent football club,\" and that he \"will be doing everything in my power to get the club back into the Premier League at the first time of asking.\"[50] On 27 October 2009, Ashley announce that the club was no longer for sale, reporting that he had been unsuccessful in finding a buyer who could produce proof of funds, despite reducing his asking price to £80 million. The club claimed that Ashley would continue to invest money into reducing the club's financial debt and had the best intentions for the club.[51] The start of the season of 2009-10 in the Championship saw the club placed top of the table at   with an 8 point lead [52] and a defensive record of only 12 goals conceded in 22 games. Manager Chris Hughton was named Manager of the Month for August, September and November.[53] The opening of the January transfer window proved quiet; the club's 8 point lead was reduced as the month unfolded and the club failed to sign transfer targets Jermaine Beckford [54] and Sol Campbell.[55] The window picked up pace in the last 8 days with the permanent signings of on-loan defender Danny Simpson,[56] defender Mike Williamson from Portsmouth,[57] Queen's Park Rangers winger Wayne Routledge and Leon Best from Coventry.[58] These were added to by the loanings of Fitz Hall from QPR and defender Patrick Van Aanholt on a month's loan from Chelsea,[59] returning after the away game at Watford F.C. in late february.[60] Interest in Crystal Palace striker Victor Moses was also declared by Hughton,[61] after Marlon Harewood's injury meant the club did not sign the player on a permanent basis,[62] but he moved to Wigan.[63] As a result, the club signed striker Leon Best from Coventry City on the final day of the January transfer window to bolster the", 11488, "FBAzWV8Faa", 1],
