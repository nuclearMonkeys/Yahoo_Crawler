	133776 : ["In a nutshell because the stock has suddenly become cheaper, some investors who were not previously interested in buying it suddenly decide that it may be a good investment. For example AAPL has fallen significantly over the last few weeks from a high of nearly $150 to below $120. A lot of people who owned the stock have clearly decided that it is time to get out and/or shorts have borrowed the stock and sold it. However I (an investor without a prior stake in Apple) think that the company remains a very good company with great long term prospects, and thus I am much more enthusiastic about buying in at $120 than I am at $150. So, as a general rule, when share prices decrease new investors come in who think the stock is a good value at its new level. In general though your gut reaction is not misplaced-- people tend to assume that trends will continue, and very often once bad news comes a company will continue to decline. I tend to think that the old axiom 'don't try to catch a falling knife' is good advice. Still after a stock has been pummeled it can be a good idea to look for buying opportunities.

Contrary to another post, I do believe that that part of the building was indeed on fire. Conspiracy theory or not, let's not insult the memory of those who died in these attacks, as well as those who died in Shanksville, Pa. on a plane which I believe was intended for either the Capitol Building or the White House.

If you were lucky enough to see the News brief before it was pulled, it would have been obvious that nothing carrying a megaton of fuel rolled across that immaculate lawn and into the Pentagon.  There was absolutely nothing disturbed on the lawn and there was a large perfectly round hole in the side of the building but no plane and no fire.  As I've said before, if the morons running this madhouse aren't involved in a conspiracy, then they must stop acting like they are.

You know a bit of sense would tell you that thousands of people were in the building, and that people died its more than a little morbid to keep wanting to replay that. With so many people involved in the clean up and there on site that day, the idea that all of them are keeping quiet about whatever it is you think \"really\" happened is so crazy I just don't get it.

	133804 : ["As I hope you know from reading my Q&A, I favor voluntary association.  As long as executive compensation is based upon open, honest and voluntary agreement, then no one other than the parties to the agreement has any business interfering. The problem with executive compensation is that a great deal of it is the result of fraud.  The government frowns on private fraud and addresses it when known.  But it is horribly hypocritical in its own fraud. Many aspects of corporate regulation, governance and capital markets favor certain large corporations over others.  While the abilities of most executives should not be questioned, I think that it is fair to question whether their compensation isn't artificially inflated. In addition to corporate governance issues, the monetary system puts us into a bind.  A great amount of new credit finds its way into corporate coffers.  So if you want to insulate yourself against inflation, you have to own stocks which then further pushes their values up which then leads to highest executive compensation.  It is inflation that makes saving foolish and requires us to speculate in stocks to protect ourselves. The advantages to corporations are manifold.  While corporations exist that produce great wealth, there are many others that are zombies feasting on the dying wealth of our societies.  I wouldn't go too far to defend them. Unfortunately, there is no one single bullet to counter corporate abuses.  The injustices are composed at least in regulation and monetary policy.  I am sure that there are other factors that I have overlooked.  In any case, to directly answer your question, the government should not have power to limit executive compensation.  Neither should it have power to unfairly inflate the value of corporations and, by extension, the compensation that executives receive.", 11191, "5syj6Uzaaa", 1],

	133818 : ["Humans have a distinct advantage over dogs in the respect that they can reason, understand and learn with a much higher rate of intelligence than any dog. I think anyone can provided they have the right temperament, personality and dedication to do so. If they were to be taught by someone more experienced in PP training, learned under their guidance and most importantly were WILLING to learn and be taught, then i think anyone could. The problem is finding all those characteristics in most people who do want to train their dogs for PP. How many can you say have them? Hardly any.. and that is what i believe makes the difference. Lets face it, the average person who decides to train their dog to be a guard or 'attack' dog will confine the dog to their property, encourage the dog to bark and display aggressive behaviours towards any approaching person or animal and will generally agitate the dog into such a state that it will be seen as ''very protective'' instead of a nervous wreck. Getting the right dog to be trained for PP is paramount and not something that can be found in the local shelter. I doubt the people who do their own 'protection training' have put much consideration into the background of the dog they purchase. They will go to a shelter or byb'r and pick out/buy the biggest, meanest and toughest dog. I do not believe the average canine will be successful in PP even if training was attempted, i am not talking about sports, but, actual protection when push came to shove. There is a reason why those dogs are so expensive, why breeding selection is done carefully and why people invest so much time and money into them. They are not breeding for pets but for dogs that may potentially save lives one day. Here, where owning a firearm is illegal then i definitely see a use for PP dogs.

	133819 : ["Well, you know me beth, and you know that \"I\" certainly don't believe that anyone should train a dog. however I do believe anyone 'can' train a dog. its a complex issue, but basically, if you wish to train your dog, you 'can' but that doesn't mean you 'should'. as far as training personal protection dogs, I disagree with your stipulation, period, no question about it. However, details for my stance are necessary to insure that you understand why I say this. #1. I am a believer that freedom is a must, and all people have the right to train their dogs as they see fit, so long as it does not bring harm to an innocent person/people, or ANY dog/animal (with the exception of hunting game) #2. most people would state that a family dog is the only dog for PP (personal protection) otherwise you have an attack dog, and there is a big difference between a PP dog, and and attack dog. A personal protection dog is one that has a family which it loves, and has been trained all basic commands. it can be trained to do just about anything, but the main lessons it has received are based around how to treat strangers ( they should be trained not to be aggressive, or overly friendly) in other words, they should be quiet, and reserved with strangers. a PP dog is not taught to 'attack' he is taught to defend. some people teach their dogs to attack on command, this is both impractical, and detrimental to a dogs psyche (which is something reserved for a different time.) #3. a person willing to put the time and effort into learning how to appropriately train their dog should have the right to do so, they should not have to spend all the time and money on books (which they should read plenty of) and lessons (how they receive these lessons is irrelevant) and then have to go through some government agency to get 'permission' to train their dogs. also, not all breeds are good for PP, anyone smart enough to train their dog right, knows this to be fact. I'm not saying that you are doing anything wrong, as you didn't specify exactly how it works. I am just saying that you need to be careful, creating laws is a messy business, just be sure your not taking away a persons right to their property. some people will spend years learning about how to train their dogs, and I can tell you, many of them will not/would not, ever think to ask uncle same if its \"okay\" to train their dog this way.", 11189, "6OnEHC93aa", 2],
