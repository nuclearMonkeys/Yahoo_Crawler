You can however say that the feminist movement does not believe in gender equality and has in fact been fighting to advantage women over men.  And no one is redefining terms. What feminists claim their movement is about and what the feminist movement is actually about are very different things. ", 2196, "15coUBsxaa", 0],

I think if parents could go back in time, they would go to the country and adopt my sisters. It gave me friends, and something to strive towards. That is why I am so angry with the banks, educational institutions, and the religious institutions, when they pass laws, requiring you must be a 1st through 4th heir to be \"creative\" or have \"creative\" tools. Then they wonder why within 3 years, these people have breakdowns, meltdowns, have demons and people trying to kill them, and go insane or try to harm themsleves and others, and join cults and so forth. All so their parents can go overseas and the Hamptons. That is why I won't do the UK's, Disney's, or The Backstreet Boys and their record companies deals. It is worse for society to get rid of most of these people, then to force a reconcile, rather than wasting everyone's time with rigged illegal contests. It is as bad as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. With their children as adults and minors like I was and still am, to cover up the sins of the parents and occult groups.

Both men and women have those qualities.    As cogito says improv is not just about laughs it, like all kinds of acting, is about finding the reality in any situation.  Improv is also about team work and being fearless about making mistakes.   Mistakes teach what doesn't work in acting and in life. I was terrified my first fully improv show.  I was so afraid that I would not be funny and would come across as ridiculous.    What that experience taught me is that just like in any theater that playing only for comedy was a no win situation.   That isn't to say that comedy gold didn't happen from time to time but rather that really funny stuff can happen when you just play being in the moment and making up stuff as you go along just like in real life. As for our anonymous friend below you are speaking from a position of inexperience.  Improv actors are just as serious about their work as scripted theater folks are.   The kind of experience he talks about is much more aligned with \"sketch comedy\" companies.   They are the groups that force \"slapstick comedy\" and rarely produce anything really intelligent or character focused, but rather just each creator making themselves the center of every story.", 2215, "f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa", 2],
