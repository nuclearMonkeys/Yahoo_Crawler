	57184 : ["Injuries to your feet happen only  when there is bad training. When dancers are rushed into pointe shoes before they are ready and/or the pointe shoes are ill fitted. As pointe work is not  for beginners and years down the road if you decide to pursue it ( you don't have to) I see no reason why you can't start in an  age appropriate beginner ballet class.  Below is a photo of the great Sylvie Guillem's feet.  Not damaged but articulated and strong!  Edit: Your height has little to do with having the right body for ballet. Professional female ballet dancers are all heights but the majority fall between 5' 2” and 5' 8” tall. As almost all of ballet comes from your turnout, it helps if you were born with shallow hip sockets which will give you fuller natural turnout. Long stretchy Achilles' tendons is a plus too.", 7944, "BQtmmnFRaa", 2],

It was like one of those old fashioned ones you can get at fairgrounds etc..... Then she realized it wasn't her son.... But the man in the photo was his double.

Now it's faked by heretics. Irenaios is the last Orthodox Patriarch. Irenaios blessed Catacomb movement. What you need is antimins (remains of saints sewed into a towel, one cup, one spoon, wax candles, nonkosher non-yeast nonbarcoded nonqrcoded bread/wine, etc.) Electricity is from Satan; yeast is grown on pig bacteria, etc. Barcode = Druid black magic curse; QRcode = ancient Mayan curse... Kosher (K) or Union of Orthodox Synagogues (U) = sprinkled with blood like Mosis did. Underneath the entrance of synagogue lies New Testament... Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good.

I lost some of my family for a while, but rediscovered them due to mis translations.  On sites like Ancestry, you can read some of the originals, so if the translator has made a mistake, you can check the original to see whether it is your relative or not. With the person you may be looking for, if you think you know who their parents are, then check their records.  If you can't make a link, then it could be someone with the same surname.  If it is a living, recent person, then it will be more difficult to ascertain if they are family or not without asking them or supposed close family.  Recent records are less likely to be available to everyone.", 7946, "3arJsZ91aa", 2],

	57215 : ["Here is something: History:In 1865, a Democrat shot and killed Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.In 1881, a left wing radical Democrat shot James Garfield, President of the United States who later died from the wound.In 1975, a left wing radical Democrat fired shots at Gerald Ford, President of the United States.In 1983, a registered Democrat shot and wounded Ronald Reagan, President of the United States.In 1984, James Hubert, a disgruntled Democrat, shot and killed 22 people in a McDonalds restaurant.In 1986, Patrick Sherrill, a disgruntled Democrat, shot and killed 15 people in an Oklahoma post office.In Sept 2013, an angry Democrat shot 12 at a Navy ship yard. Lots MORE too. Clearly, there is a problem with Democrats and guns.Not one NRA member, Tea Party member, or Republican conservative was involved in any of these shootings and murders (except as a target!).SOLUTION: Let's make it illegal for Democrats to own guns. \"The great object is that every man be armed.\" and \"Everyone who is able may have a gun.\"Patrick Henry, American Patriot\"An armed man is a citizen. A disarmed man is a subject.\" \"To prohibit a citizen from wearing or carrying a war arm . . . is an unwarranted restriction upon the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. If cowardly and dishonorable men sometimes shoot unarmed men with army pistols or guns, the evil must be prevented by the penitentiary and gallows, and not by a general deprivation of constitutional privilege.\"Wilson v. State, 33 Ark. 557, at 560, 34 Am. Rep. 52, at 54 (1878) “The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right.\"Nunn vs. State, 1846\"The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943) Why do you think that it is Republicans who MUST 'do something' about mass shootings when the Democrats won't obey their sworn oath to uphold and defend the constitution? It is not the government's JOB to protect us from one another. That is every individual's full and total responsibility ONLY. Government isn't supposed to do 'ANYTHING' except ensure that our rights AS WRITTEN are fully upheld at all times, everywhere. If you are that fearful, then why don't you immigrate to Venezuela where no civilian is allowed to have guns? Or CHINA? You, like most antigunners, are hoplophobes. That is a real mental illness. Please seek REAL mental treatment for your disorder (real meaning not a liberal antigunner professional). “Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.”― Thomas Jefferson, Complete Jefferson \"I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery.\"- Thomas Jefferson Nearly every mass shooting was in a democrat place with no guns allowed.
