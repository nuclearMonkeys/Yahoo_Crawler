	78450 : ["Hmm.. it depends. If they're just dating for sexual crap or because everyone else is dating, it's stupid. But if they're actually mature and truly WANT to get to know the person and be with them, that's fine. But I honestly don't think 14-15 year old guys are mature enough or ready for a good relationship. Some of them are. I was 14, almost 15 when I went out with my first boyfriend and he was 16. This doesn't make me a ho, I was just more mature than guys my age and I actually LIKED the guy I dated and wanted to get to know him.", 8945, "None", 3],
	78451 : ["So I'm not really sure what the question is...and I think it's fine to be 14 and dating..I mean like 10 year olds dating is dumb but I think 14 is fine", 8945, "None", 1],
	78452 : ["There are no laws that protect you in this case.  It sounds like the person who told you it was ok was not the boss that fired you.  I would call back and talk to who ever told you it was ok, and ask them what the deal is.  It's probably to late to do any good.  Hope you can find a new job,  Good Luck!", 8941, "flkVehA9aa", -1],
	78453 : ["The Family Medical Leave Act would protect you if you had been employed there for 12 months, but apparently you haven't worked there long enough. It was a rotten thing for them to do to you, but unless you have a contract, I don't think you have any recourse.", 8941, "sbqNavbqaa", 0],
	78454 : ["I think that this week Frank and Dan will get Brittney out.  I don't want any former players to win.  I want a new person to win. I don't think Frank will win because he can't compete in the next 2 HOH competitions.  They will turn on him then, backdoor him because it is the only way to get him out and none of them feel they can beet him. I like Ashley.  I adore Ian.  Can't stand Joe and Frankly I am just confused by Jenn.  I have no idea what she is.  I really miss Wil and was happy to see Janelle and Boogie go. I would like to see Ian win!", 8944, "6LoVKfOxaa", -1],
	78455 : ["I hope Ian wins. During last weeks double eviction I was jumping up and down when Ian won HOH. But think about last week: Ian ratted out Frank and Boogie and the two ended up nominated Dan, Shane and Britney got even bigger targets on their back to protect him from two people who think Ian is working with them and on their side Ian's physical game is horrible But he's playing a pretty damn good social game So far Ian's safe this week, and most likely will be next week. I hope Frank goes home next week.", 8944, "None", -1],
	78456 : ["I don't think there's anything wrong with what you're doing. What's popular is not always what's right. 14 year olds dating isn't BAD but I don't think it's great either. There's nothing wrong with a little peck but these days, 14 year olds are going pretty far and that's not okay! Good for you and your friends, stand up for what you believe in :)", 8945, "3IU6sDljaa", 1],

	78459 : ["this is normal, most dogs stick their ears up for the following reasons: when playing, when mad, when scared,  however boston terriers ears stick up because, no lie, so they can hear better, they are not the best dogs in the dog family when it comes to hearing. and they do stick there ears up when they are in a new enviornment, its kind of like a getting used to the new enviorment, they are almost always suspicious.", 8947, "BQx34HATaa", 1],
	78460 : ["For the best answers, search on this site  k well a guy who used to smokes pot and is almost legally an adult kinda scares me...but I mean hey, ur life, do what you want. i mean you live in two totally different states and only see each other so often, so it sounds kind of like a hard relationship from my end of the table. but if he makes you happy then go for it. just be careful though, don't do anything you'll regret later!", 8945, "None", 0],
	78461 : ["File for unemployment and take them to court if you have too. This is the only thing left for you to do. What they did was stupid and they should give you unemployment for it.", 8941, "None", 1],

	78463 : ["My family is very loyal to each other and if somebody had thrown one of us to the ground, they would have immediately been beaten to a pulp by the rest of us, but fortunately everyone was also not as \"sue-happy\" as they seem to be now, so nobody ever called the cops or anything. I think what that guy did was wrong and you are very good at controlling yourself because had it been my child, I probably would have jumped on him and started swinging. You should be commended for being the better person in this case.", 8949, "None", 1],

My parents took care of most of my needs but my Grandmother took care of all of my needs. So it depends on your definition of \"raise\".", 8950, "None", 2],
	78468 : ["My dad. He raised 5 kids, had a full time job at a factory and ran a 100 acre farm at the same time. Sometimes I think he's superman's brother because even at the age of 62 he still won't slow down.", 8950, "AA10283080", 4],
	78469 : ["ok your link didn't show me a pic of a dog so i'm gonna go on what i know, some dogs do this on their own and its perfectly normal, some animals have what i consider to be cruel and unnecessary \"cropping\" done to make them stand up, and being he is a year old this might have been done to him, either way as long as he is healthy and happy, it shouldn't matter. I find it quite cute when a dog stands their ears up as if they are doing it to better hear and pay attention to what you are saying.", 8947, "87yovKYlaa", 1],
	78470 : ["sounds like he has mites, if he doesnt see a vet quickly, the ear ought to get contaminated, communicate to the vet approximately paying at a later diploma if achievable, the poor animal desires drops in his ears to help him, he would be in an incredible style of discomfort in any different case,", 8947, "4Wg4jOj6aa", 0],

	78478 : ["Consider yourself a lucky lady! Yes my parents divorced late in their lives in their late 60's. I was still devastated as an adult daughter. They had an unusual situation because they still lived together and got along better than they ever did. I know they still loved each other, but my brother pushed it and talked my Mom into divorce. It was sad because my Dad had the house almost paid off and when the divorce took place, my Dad had to refinance the home. My parents always fought for years but they really still loved each other. They got along better than ever and my Dad took care of my Mom until the day that she dies, including her bills which he really didn't have to pay. This was his way and I am like them. I have been divorced since 1990 and never remarried because I was engaged to a man that after he put the ring on my finger, he changed drastically and showed his true colors. I was happy to find out (not that I wanted it that way) but because I didn't marry him and that was good to know before instead of after the fact. Neither of my parents remarried and never would. They are both gone now, my Mom died in 1995 and my Dad in 2001. They are buried next to each other. All my other siblings married and divorced but one and she isn't happy at all. Her husband is extremely demanding and a control freak. Several years ago, this last sister filed for divorce, but backed out. Not very good statistic eh? I still miss them both till this day .", 8951, "None", 0],
