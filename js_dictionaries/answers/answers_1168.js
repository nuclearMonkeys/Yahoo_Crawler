	63897 : ["Abortion is a political issue disguised as a moral or religious issue.  The Republicans have been manipulating the issue since 1980 for POLITICAL gain.  I don't even think they want to, or intend to, ban abortion because they'd lose it as an issue!  They're controlling the discussion for maximum political mileage. Ronald Reagan started out by promising to push for a constitutional amendment, no less, to declare the unborn as 'human beings', which would have made abortion equal to murder.  But once in office he didn't even try!  This is now called a 'personhood' law.  Alabama had a personhood law on the ballot back in 2012, and even the voters turned it down! Then they went through a period where the attitude was 'Well, personally I'm totally Pro Life.  But I don't think it's something for the government to be involved in.' NOW the idea is to reverse Roe v. Wade which (they say) will pas it down to the states.  Frankly I don't see that happening.  Every single Supreme Court nomination made by a Republican since 1980 has been promised to the Christian Right to be the single swing-vote needed to overturn Roe v. Wade. But it hasn't happened in 40 years, has it?", 8219, "55XWsWHsaa", 5],
	63898 : ["I could be wrong but I have the date of Roe v Wade written down as being 1-22-1973. That would have hit during either Nixon or Ford's administration and at that time the Supreme Court was pretty much as Republican as it is now, if not more so. I can remember when the closest place to go was around the corner and down 2 blocks to the building on the corner, last office back in the hall. I also remember a neighbor going to a Dr. who gave her a shot that did the job. There were also over the counter meds you could buy that would make it happen and other methods that were touted. I don't think it would make one iota of difference, just not as safe or as out in the open, just as it was back then.", 8219, "Juw2uckPaa", 2],

	63905 : ["Because Christians rely on a dogmatic religious book for answers to everything, when we're living in quite a different world than 2000 years ago. We know for a fact that the world is more than 6000 years old, and we know it was formed under conditions different than Creation. We know that evolution exists, and just because you say it doesn't, doesn't matter. You're not a scientist. The only people trying to debate evolution are religious. There is no debate within the scientific community, as different fields of science all have a vast amount of evidence proving evolution. I have done the research. The Bible is full of murder, rape, and condemnation. It claims to know the perfect truth of the world, when it's full of so many lies and contradictions it's not even funny. On the other hand, science only looks for natural explanations that can be formed from empirical evidence. You should go find out what 'empirical evidence' means, because I don't think you understand.", 8202, "068f05ab7155bd595d571a3a68d15e70aa", 5],

	63918 : ["Like people have said, it would go to the states. The more important question would then be \"will conservatives be satisfied at that point?\" I can't imagine why they would be. If their policy were \"you do you\", they wouldn't have opposed Roe v Wade in the first place. And if they did want to ban it nationally, overturning  Roe v Wade would be the first step. It would never happen, but they could try.    Otherwise, if they think God is fine with abortion at the state level, then I guess that would be it.", 8219, "LU6mysqgaa", 2],

	63925 : ["You could start from the other end. Assume the US population is 320 million and use the output from a solar plant like Ivanpah then calculate the number of those power stations you would need. Ivanpah's produces about 652,300 MWh/yr. Divide that by hours per year to get average power output and you get 74MW. 50kWh and 320 million people gives about 666,666MW as an average power requirement. So, 8,953 Ivanpahs required. The project cost $2.18 billion. Therefore about $19.5 trillion required. 56,000 square miles of land would be needed. 29,545 years of total building time. Some assumptions of mine now: Assume you had already built enough and that each one had a life of 30 years then you would just need to maintain them at the rate of 300 a year, or nearly 1 each day, in perpetuity.

They do not see it that way- they see it as us being closeminded because we stick to ONE Truth- when in reality we know this ONE truth will set us free- and that when it comes to truth we are not going to accept false doctrine or false gods....that is like saying to someone you care about who believes in something other than the Lord Jesus Christ- \"its ok if you are going to hell, I love you anyway-\" they dont see it that way- they see us as being judgmental so we need to be aware NOT to come across that way- to speak the truth in LOVE and show them we CARE about them- that is why we share the truth with them--- like if your neighbors house was on fire, you would warn them!
