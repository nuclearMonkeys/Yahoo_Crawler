So even if you took off Saturday at 2:30, it will be 4:30 by the time you get down there, and you'll have about 1.5 hours before it gets dark.  So if you find the perfect suggestion on what to do and are willing to give the 4 hours of driving to do it, then OK.  Otherwise I'd just stay in the Bellingham area. Chukanut Drive in Bellingham is a nice one.    If you do the drive, the Rhododendron Cafe at the corner of Chukanut Drive and Bow Hill Road (on the far end) is a great stop for dinner. Fairhaven is the older district in town, and has some nice shops to wander through.  You could catch a whale watching tour and get a chance to see our resident Orcas and get out in a boat around the San Juan Islands. If you have one, take your passport for the border crossing to Vancouver.  While not absoultely necessary, it's nice to have and makes the return crossing Sunday easier.  Be prepared for waits at the border, especially Sunday evening if you are returning on that day. Temperatures are highs in the upper 50's and lows in the 30's.

My list will probably be quite long! :P  I have a four and a half month old and I confess: - I sometimes sit him in front of the TV while I need five minutes to myself (though in fairness the 5 minutes are usually to do his washing up or something!) - Sometimes if he falls asleep during a feed I'll leave him and wind him when he wakes up - I used to only bath him every three or four days (every day now though... stinky baby!) - He was in his Moses Basket until only a week ago - I let him sleep with a blanket - We used to co-sleep, and I have fallen asleep with him on the sofa before Told you my list was long!!! *gives self a good telling off* If anybody reads this thread and judges anyone then they can't be parents or at least not involved parents as I don't believe there's a single mum or dad out there that doesn't cut corners occasionally!
