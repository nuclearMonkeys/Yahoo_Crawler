However, our systems checks and balances should temper any such actions-it's up to the Congress, the Courts and the Media to exercise those checks and balances. Only working in concert could they harm America irreparably.", 9143, "bsKTIOsqaa", 0],

	83660 : ["Yes, it does show that a lot of voters were very gullible and if that trend continues it'd be no surprise if Palin won the Republican nomination. Maybe Peck or Limbaugh would be her chosen running mate.", 9137, "AA11661950", 0],
	83661 : ["Sarah Palin would not be a great candidate for president. The general public is generally stupid...and there are too many people that believe she's a dumb woman because Saturday Night Live and Keith Overbite have told them so. Never underestimate the drones out there. They are everywhere. Liberals have proven that any conservative woman running for office is open to the most vile criticism out there. Call her stupid, make fun of her handicapped child, make jokes about her husband having sex with her daughter, on and on. This is acceptable to liberals. The same liberals that claim racism if you question the experience of the great Obama and point out that he has never, ever, managed a budget for a town, city, county or state. All the while, Barabara Boxer, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi are just outstanding intelligent politicians to liberals. I think Newt will run for president and he will win in a true landslide over Obama. Landslide as in what happened in 1980 and 1984 with Reagan. Obama's victory was not a landslide by any means. That map will be red in 2012.", 9137, "fkJZ2lqwaa", 0],

And that coin is presently residing interior the pocket of the massive firms and particular activity communities! No GOP candidate will do something to strengthen the economic gadget, and Obama will no longer end something the two. Partisan rhetoric is purely dropping time. Why won't be able to human beings see that the events are purely fascinated in triumphing, they do no longer care with regard to the middle classification!

	83675 : ["of course.  Love, respect, humanitarianism, peace, helping each other.  They are all great messages.  Unfortunately the followers of the christian faith who preach these things, dont follow a single one of them, so they taint the positive messages with the hatred of the organization of the christian faith.  Oh, and the bible does a good job of that too.  But, some parts are really good ideals, but not just christianity teaches those ideals, lots of religions, and other groups <including non religious ones> teach the same thing, without the biggotry, murder, violence, rape, incest and stuff.", 9144, "None", 1],
	83676 : ["I don't really believe in free will but I believe in a non-causal, non-material mind besides the signals in the brain. And I think determinism proves that this thing exists, because the act of non-causal observing is redundant with determinism. Not sure how or if this applies to free will.

Time lines are being studied now and the universe does not have to work on our one, we can only move forward, God said The names are written in the Book of Life, so it is over before it began! Free will has only one choice to serve God or Satan, that's it, two choices to pick from. You can't claim to be in middle ground as that makes you a liar! So God gave us the freedom to choose once not to choose everything we do, If you are for Christ then he will live in you as he said he would and it will be his will we do, No choice we just follow his teaching and we are not given a choice as to what parts to Choice!", 9141, "93galWG1aa", -1],

There are also some people on here who report questions just because they don't like the question being asked. I think that's sometimes a dumb thing. Perez Hilton would be a good example of a LGBT person  who is narrow minded. P.S. Let's hope your question doesn't get deleted.", 9136, "None", 2],

I myself show though that not all gay people are like that. The first thing  I look for when I see and theory is evidence.

So are atheists.... so are Christians, so are republicans, so are black people, white people, anyone not from America, every American I've ever met, lions, tigers, AND bears. The truth is that it's human nature to only accept your own beliefs. You're narrow-minded in that you believe the majority of gays are one way. I'm narrow-minded because I think EVERYONE is narrow-minded. :) I think it's better to address individuals rather than social groups. That's how prejudices are born. No one wants that.

But people tend not to investigate or read. We still have 23% of the country who drink the \"kool-aid\" everyday. And then you have the religious right who love the fetus but hate the child, they hate gays, and want a country under religion.

Our current President and his cabinet are doing a giant disservice to our country but we'll survive, as will Iraq. We're going to see a change of party this election. Most of America doesn't feel to good about the republicans, even some republicans and I think they will pay the price for continuing the war after the 06' elections when American voters made it clear we want this fiasco to end.

She should have flown back to Alaska on September 5th, hired three tutors and started Palin University in the Governor's mansion. Her subjects should have been Economics, Foreign Studies, and Current Events. In two months she could have been knowledgeable, articulate, informed and credible.  But instead she decided that she didn't need to know any more. I'm sure she's felt that way since before her Gubernatorial campaign. And that alone should have disqualified her from nomination as Vice President. Governor Palin defends her own ignorance. She refuses to learn.

	83703 : ["As others have pointed out, there is just as much ugliness in the New testament as there is beauty. All of the positive philosophical points (including the Golden Rule) had been stated by far more erudite minds for over a thousand years before the time of the NT. The negative points are typical of any Iron Age culture (such as Jesus dvising his slavery-boudn followers that they must obey their master as if the master was Jesus Himself). There is no positive aspect of the Bible that cannot be found in simple human reason and compassion. No deities needed.", 9144, "kaa7SV7Jaa", 0],
	83704 : ["I do not respect those who refuse to reciprocate and respect me -- that would be most of Bible thumping fundamentalist Christianity.   I do find great value in Christ's message of forgiveness, but only on a voluntary personal level. For the record, Secular Humanism is a religion Bertrand Russell and others created specifically to appeal to atheists.  Very few atheists want anything to do with Humanism because, ultimately, it is just another man-made religion.   Personally, I'm repelled by the very notion that any particular set of arbitrary rules should be considered appropriate for all possible circumstances.  The fundamental problem with all religions is that they are inherently inflexible.  I also reject all forms of mandatory altruism.  The bottom line is I feel no compulsion to systematize \"acceptable\" human behavior, beyond obeying necessary secular laws.", 9144, "86PUxs1jaa", 0],
