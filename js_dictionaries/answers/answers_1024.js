Sixty years ago, the youngsters at the time thought 30s and above old; the same people today, old and retired, think that 40s is still young. Also, there is a societal tendency to \"infantilize\" people: treating teens as children, young adults as teens, and so on. So, people in the 40s tend to be seen as in their 30s, despite the early signs of aging.", 7885, "XKxPtadBaa", 0],
	56679 : ["yes, not allowing anyone to vote for any reason if they are of legal age and with legal citizenship status is not very fitting of a democracy. Of course, uninformed voters are also not very fitting of a democracy, so really, the question is, who gives a damn?", 7928, "None", 1],

Ask them what happens if you stop contributing.", 7924, "None", 0],
	56681 : ["No, that's not government required, that is based on the institution. They are probably doing it to protect you for tax purposes though, I would imagine. Eventually when you have to pay taxes, or take your RMDA then you'll need so much, etc. So they have obviously based things on that. I'd ask them the reasoning behind the policy, and if it doesn't seem necessary just do a roll over to another institution. Not everywhere will do that.", 7924, "AA11591656", 0],

	56712 : ["In politics, party loyalty is everything.  In Congress, successful politicians who get done what their constituents want done always follow the party line.  The party lends strong support to its loyal supporters.  When you vote for a candidate you always vote for the party he belongs to.  No candidate can every separate himself from his party's platform and remain with the party---his power will be deleted by the party leadership.  No one candidate is perfect; therefore, you have to consider the party as a whole, which is why I always vote straight party ticket.  Jumping from one side of the bench to the other only produces confusion on a personal level.  As an analogy (and I think that it is a good one) If I were to constantly jump from Christianity to Buddhism, then I would end up with a confused theology that would cause me not to fit in anywhere.

It is (1) a myth that humans only use 10% (or some other %age) of their brain and (2) a myth that this myth is attributable to Einstein. Even when people are asleep research has shown their brains are still very active. Anyone with a significant brain injury has some disability as a result, even if the disability could be classed as minor. However, if we only used 10% of our brains we would not see this phenomenon. Statisitcally, the majority of people who suffered brain injuries would have the disused 90% of their brain affected and thus have no disability. We all use all of our brains.

If such tests were mandated then the parties in control would slant the tests to assure the disqualification of those voters not agreeing with their policies.  For better or worse, the founders felt that the populace would be sufficiently interested in government and take advantage of the news media and maybe -just maybe- the majority would reach an intelligent and informed decision about those they are voting into office.
