	79486 : ["It's his loss.  You are allowing those who are undeserving of your attention, to control your emotions.  They don't even deserve your attention, much less control over your emotions.  Either you learn to control your emotions, or your emotions will control you. It's his loss, because he doesn't get to spend time with you.  You may assume that it's your loss, because others will avoid you, but you don't want those type of people to be around you.  If you value yourself, then you should realise that not everyone deserves your attention.  He's proven by his words and actions that he's undeserving.  Most women in school probably think he's a real creep.  Oh sure, there may be some who haven't figured it out yet.  Although, that doesn't speak well for them.  But, the vast majority of women probably can see that he's a real creep.  If you change and give-in, then he wins.  If he sees that he's won, then it only reinforces his negative behavior, and he wont learn.  The only way for him to learn, is to see that this negative behavior is negative, and that people don't accept it.  If you give-in, then you've choosen to accept it.  By saying you don't care, and that he's a real creep for having said it, you are indicating that you don't accept it.  In time, he may learn that this is not alright. Your friend Sam, obvsiously doesn't agree with him.  Words hurt.  They can hurt a lot, but we can choose just how much we allow them to hurt.  We also tend to hear what we want to hear and ignore what we reject.  There may be many people telling you that you're attractive, but you don't want to hear or believe it.  You'd rather focus on the negative.  As long as you do, it will hurt you.  Your friend Sam defending you is a positive. You need to focus on that.  Don't let others determine your value.   You determine your value and tell others what you're worth.  If they say you're only worth 50 and you accept that, then you are only worth 50.  If you demand that you are worth 100, and they reject that, say no damnit, I'm worth 100, and when they fianlly accept that, you will have proven that you really are worth 100.  Things are worth what we say they are.  We can't allow others to determine our value.  We shouldn't settle for half, when we can have all. You do need to work on your self-respect.  You need to respect your abilities.  You must have certain abilities that you're proud of.  Respect yourself for those absilities.  Confidence is knowing who you are, and what you want.  Who you are is unique.  You can't compare yourself to others, because everyone is unique.  What is ugly anyway?  What does that even mean?  What is beauty?  What does that even mean?  Everyone has different ideas of beauty, so no one person can even define it.  You're beautiful in your own way.  Not someone elses way, but your way.  There will be those who see your beauty as well.  They will like you, for you, and only you.", 8985, "3CLLxK80aa", 8],
	79487 : ["I don't think you need to worry about it, even if you are in fact unattractive. Firstly, there are LOADS of ugly blokes out there for us ugly people to choose from, and very few good-looking ones, so the chances are you'll have more to choose from! Secondly - good looks won't keep guys if you're horrible.. After a while, personality kicks in, and changes your face, so work on your confidence and make sure your face says you are a nice, kind, friendly, happy person and eventually you'll be seen to be pretty. Seriously! Of course, dressing as a punk is meant to look aggressive and nasty, giving people the message that you are hard to get to know, but obviously other punk guys would not feel put off by that. I saw a punk girl who looked really pretty, with long pink and white spiky hair and cute mini skirts etc. I'd go very easy on the tattoos and avoid face piercings, and try for a more feminine look. And a definite NO to breast implants.", 8985, "spvhj5Jsaa", 0],

	79492 : ["The downstairs area def needs groomed.  Everyone has a different style and taste of how they shape theirs and what they do...trial and error over the years will determine what your preferences of what you like to do.  Bikini wax is my fav, people actually sometimes put shapes in(unless your a porn star, I think this is kind of gross), some shave it all off.  The most important thing to be blunt is just not to have a massive bush.  If your try on your bathing suit, I tend to focus on the areas that would stick out and make sure to shave that area.  I also keep the rest trimmed w/scissors and relatively short, some people use shavers like a guy would use to get their hair buzzed.  Just do whatever is comfortable for you.  The reason people get waxed is bc when you shave that area big or small, most tend to get razor burn and unsightly bumps.  Waxing makes it better, but sometimes I still get bumps, it also supposedly keeps the hair from growing back longer.  Unless I'm going on vacation, I usually just shave and save money on waxing.  Some people use Nair, I think it is too chemically and unsafe, not my thing but to each their own.", 8983, "None", -1],
