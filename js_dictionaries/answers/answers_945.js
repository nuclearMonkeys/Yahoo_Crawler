	52717 : ["A deduction reduces the amount of income you pay taxes on.  You always get the full amount of standard deduction you qualify for no matter what you earned or what you paid. A tax refund is the amount that you overpaid on your tax liability. Example:  A person who is single earned $20,000 for the year. A single person who is not a dependent gets a standard deduction of $12,400.  So, instead of owing income tax on the full amount of their earnings - they get to deduct that standard deduction and now they only owe taxes on $7,600 of their income. (20,000 - 12,400 = 7,600)  (income minus standard deduction equals taxable income) Their employer withholds federal income tax from their paychecks based on how they filled out the W-4 form when they was hired.  In this example, we will assume that their employer withheld $900 in federal income tax.   The tax liability for a taxable income of $7,600 is $758.  But, they paid $900.  This creates a refund of $142. (900 - 758 = 142) (Taxes paid minus tax liability equals refund)  (BUT if the taxes paid are less than the tax liability - the person would owe more instead of getting a refund) Again, that was a very simple example.  Actual taxes can be a little more complicated.  The standard deduction is different for single vs married vs head of household.  For some people, it is better to itemize their deductions instead of using the standard deduction.  There is a list of things that can count toward itemizing deductions BUT you can't use both the itemized list AND the standard deduction, so it only makes sense to itemize when you have enough qualifying things to be higher than the standard deduction.  (the average person doesn't) There are also things called TAX CREDITS that can increase your refund.  For example, you might qualify for an earned income credit if your income and age qualifies you for it.  The amount of an earned income credit would be based on your total income and not your income after the standard deduction.  There are some other tax credits for things like having children and education tax credits.  You would only know what you qualify for by either talking to a tax professional or using a decent online tax program that will ask you questions to guide you to what you qualify for.   BTW - if a person's total income was below their standard deduction that just means that they have NO taxable income and would qualify for a FULL refund of any federal income taxes that they had paid during the year.   Hope these examples helped clear it up a little.  If you just have W-2 forms and nothing too complicated, I would suggest finding a decent online tax program like Turbo Tax or H&R block online and entering your information and answering the questions that they ask on those programs.  ", 7369, "NgsseKaUaa", 0],
