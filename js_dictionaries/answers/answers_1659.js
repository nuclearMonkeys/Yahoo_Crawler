Why in an American school should you have to write about British celebrity trash. If you are going to say why she dose not inspire anyone you will need to say why, here a list. Shes size zero which is very unhealthy, Bad role model for women. She has never worked. She has not earned her position The royal wedding cost the British economy £5 billion in lost revenue. No one voted for her.  Their honeymoon was payed for by the taxpayer meaning they are nothing more than a welfare family. She nothing more than a talentless celebrity. She's not a scientist, inventor, business woman or one of the other many worthy profession. There are a lot of people in the world who do good things like scientist for example who barely get a mention, these are the sort of people you should get inspiration from. You may also what you say why might inspire people, the people that are inspired by her are do not have interesting lives and are of low intelligent  and need inspiration from talentless celebrities instead of working hard to archive some thing themselves.

	88622 : ["In 1965, when I was 30 years old, I had gallbladder attacks. I was pregnant and they couldn't operate until I had my baby. The operation is very serious.  They have to go up under the diaphragm, but if the stones have not started to pass into the liver, I hear of them being able to use a process, where they can explode the stones and operating isn't necessary. Have you had a second opinion from another doctor? I finally got to the point that all I could eat was baby food, yellow squash and green beans. She has to be in a great deal of pain when she has an attack. A gallbladder attack is the second most excruciating pain. The first most excruciating pain is passing a kidney stone. I feel for her.

	88623 : ["You have got a lot of answers with plenty of good advice about spicy and fried foods but also there are a lot of foods that have hidden fats too eg egg yolk and liver.  When my father had gallstones he couldn't drink tea or coffee either as they upset his tummy, caused the pain up under his ribs and in his shoulder blade. Most dairy products caused the pain and sickness for him too.  He was on a very restricted diet until he had his gall bladder plus all the stones removed.....he and I sat and counted all of them coz he'd asked the surgeon to keep them for him lol....much to the disgust of my mother....he had 112 altogether! They ranged in size from that of a garden pea to tiny pieces of sharp gravel like stones with sharp edges.  White, low fat meat like chicken and turkey will be good for your aunt as you already know as will pasta if it's not been made with egg and rice of course.  Tomatoes might set her symptoms off.  If you have a dietician available to speak to he/she could give you  a lot of advice about what your aunt can and cannot eat.   There are other options available for the problem of gallstones....laser surgery under an epidural anaesthetic is possible these days for those not able to have the full anaesthetic but we do not know fully what is available where you live.  Bless you for being such a good nephew and we wish your aunt well too. x", 9300, "rMP9BCyGaa", 1],

Potatoes are OK if there is no butter or sour cream.  Watch the usually fatty foods that have a \"low fat\" cousin.  I don't trust them.  If she normally likes ice cream, frozen fruit can be purred in a blender with fruit juice and a banana for sweetener to make a low fat dessert.  There are many seasonings that are not spicy.

If you want to have a great life,  you have to work on yourself.....and not just think that someone is going to come along and make a life for you. The girls now who do not study hard in school,  are trashing themselves by sleeping around and having the morals of alley cats,  do not try to learn any nice manners or upper class behavior traits......are not going to be the women that nice men are going to want for wives.
