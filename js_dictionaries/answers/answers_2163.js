I think there a re a small number of guys who like really small breasts and a small number who like them enormous, but most like them big. My pet peeve is when guys like big breasts, but they want the girl to have a slim fit bod as well. I mean, they don't seem to understand that big boobs go with big everything else...***, tummy, hips, thighs, arm fat and general flab. When I was fat I had nice big boobs but the rest of my body wasn't so great. Now I am slim and fit and my boobs are small (35 B) but I do wish my boobs would have stayed big...sigh...haha!", 10371, "LDlrJNX5aa", 1],
