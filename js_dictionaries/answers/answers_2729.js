	142307 : ["If there was a worldwide flood, then you would expect to find marine fossils on mountains. Therefore, the existence of these fossils supports their hypothesis. Therefore, they present it as evidence. That much is pretty straightforward and shouldn't be controversial. However, those fossils don't support just one supposition of the earth's past: it could support any number of suppositions...including the notion that the region was once under water, and the land was pushed up due to continental plates crashing together. Both sides can use the marine fossils to advance their claim. The better question is: is the proof of previous submersion of any part of the land actually evidence that all of the land was under water at the same exact time in the past?  We know that uplifting causes mountain ranges: we measure it via computers and laser imaging, and the folding of geological strata seals the issue. Not even Creationists will argue that this mechanism exists. And if a known, incontroverisial process is sufficient to explain the data, then why go looking for extra variables, such as worldwide floods? The answer has nothing to do with science or explanations. It has to with what their holy book told them to look for. If the book claimed that the world was 4.5 billion years old and that most of the life forms of the world had vanished in mass extinctions over time, then they would be the greatest supporters of radioactive dating, evolution, the fossil record, and every other piece of data that we have regarding the age and development of our world.", 11537, "urIm4YaBaa", 1],

	142324 : ["My opinion of the phrase \"Love conquers all\"? I would have to say that I can think of it in a couple different ways right off the bat. In the first, love is within us, we all have the capacity for love, if we are human, and so, love conquers all humanity from within. From a secular viewpoint, that word \"conquer\" kind of stands out in my mind when placed next to love and makes me wonder, \"Is that what they really meant to say?\" Love conquering all makes a really good point, especially where hindsight has 20/20 vision, someone obviously could see that, yes, Love indeed conquered all and was moved enough to utter this phrase. However, Love, perhaps, did not use war to conquer everything, love used - love. Perhaps you could also say,\"Love is better than everything.\", and still mean the same thing. Saying,\"Love Conquers All\", is said just to make the point in a more dramatic way. Perhaps, just a thought... Secondly, I think of Love personified, although I do not consider myself limited to purely religious thinking, a similar phrase, \"God is Love\", comes to mind. And, when Love is unconditional, we, and Love, can cross many boundaries effortlessly, whereas without Love, or atleast some kind of attraction and familiarity, things can be much more awkward, difficult, and sometimes apparently impossible. In this sense, I think maybe Love did not actually do all the conquering. Instead, Love conquered several friends, and they (using love), conquered several friends, and so on and so forth... Unconditional Love allows people to see things as the really are, also makes a lot of things people do appear silly, and can be a natural feeling that allows people to look at the world in a completely different way, a much more positive way. I think you may want to add Unconditional Intelligence to mix though as well... and thirdly, yes, a third idea, is one I hesitate to offer. It's kind of humorous, a play on words. You see, Saul, a character in the Bible, was a really nasty figure historically, so a variation of the phrase came to mind: \"Love Conquer Saul\".  It's a command.  Surprisingly, I am indeed finding that Love is Eternal, and hope I live to tell my tale... Good Luck with Love Mulder, I think you are on the right track...", 11536, "621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa", 4],

Whoever said that did not even attempt to find any other explanation. Plus the water receded quickly stating that not a lot of marine life should have died in such a short time period.

	142332 : ["It is part of their goal to be completely inconsistent. Scientists say it was the upthrust of an ancient seabed which was deposited slowly and compressed under the weight of its own sediments.  Creationists say it is proof of the flood, and that upthrust is a fiction of scientists. The Creationists claim that the weight of the water caused the compression of the rocks.  The problem is that the mountaintops would have been the shallows. The mass of water needed to cover Everest is about 1/10th the mass of the Moon.  When asked where the missing water from the flood went, Creationists say the mountains weren't that high back then.
