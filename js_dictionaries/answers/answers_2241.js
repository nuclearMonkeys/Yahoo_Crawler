	117839 : ["First and foremost changing the oil and filter regularly based on the type of driving you do is the single most important thing regardless of the brand and variety of oil [fossil or syn]. If you drive normally and don't tow and don't race just about any will do.  I personally have switched to Mobil 1 synthetic over fossil oil because the oil change intervals using full syn are extended. I would not use what I consider to be gimmicks like Redline etc. or any additives. The real answer lies in your owner's manual.  The mfg tests their engines with various oils and then issues specs. For example my BMW spec requires LL, long life oil. I use Mobil 1 5w-40 because the 5w-30 doesn't meet LL specs. I think Castrol sells a LL 5w-30 but I don't care enough to chase it down. I also use a quality Mann filter element. There is a list of oil designations half a mile long.some apply to Diesel engines only.  On my other vehicles I use the Fram standard filter. There will be just as much passion about that as there will be regarding type of oil.", 10517, "YnJKKrN0aa", 0],

Get to a dr as soon as you can.  An untreated infection can cause problems that can be much harder to treat.  You can also call your doctor's office and explain that you don't have transportation.  They may possibly call you in a prescription but don't count on it.  Tylenol or Ibuprofen can help to relieve the pain.", 10518, "0UPhrBX4aa", 1],
