I read recently that she is happy in foster care and a source who was privy to the first supervised access visit between Karen and Shannon heard her (Shannon) say she didn't want to return home. That pretty much says it all, regardless of her young age. It's important to remember why her image was used by the media to begin with. There was a strong suspicion that she had been abducted and any chance of her being found relied strongly upon her image being in the public consciousness and perhaps weighing on her abductors' conscience. In time her image will fade from the public conscious  and she of course will still be growing up and subject to an organic change in appearance.  My fear is for her psychological and emotional welfare in the coming months that will set the tone for the remainder of her childhood. Nurturing aside she will require professional guidance in reconciling these traumatic events that we know of. That said she will need an inordinate, unforeseeable amount of time and access to a responsible, state approved guardian every hour of the day. Sadly, the likelihood is that she will spend a significant amount of her childhood, for the next few years at any rate, in a residential school who specialize in educating young people who have been abused. There may be some respite in that she may spend  holidays with experienced foster parents who know her. She is very much in my thoughts at the moment and I wish her only happiness in the future.", 11312, "None", 1],

I'll make him go to all of the appointments with the girl and help him get a job.
