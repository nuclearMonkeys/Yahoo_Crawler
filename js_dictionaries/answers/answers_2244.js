In my opinion aside from constantly using the restroom mice are wonderful pets, my dad and I have raised many animals from mice, dogs to snakes, and the mice we own are so people friendly when my dad calls them they come running to him into a basket he uses to carry them to their cages to a play table we have set up for them where they can play. Though if you plan on getting more than one mice make sure its 2 girls due to boys generally wont get along together even if they are brothers, we had the issue and ended up buying two separate cages for them because they would fight and draw blood most of the time.  But overall they are amazing little creatures, my dad spoils the 4 girls we have, sadly they are plump (fat) but they enjoy eating so why put them on a diet. The two boys are white albinos, the 4 girls are brown with the exception of 1 girl who came out white, and the little boy we keep in the girls cages till hes older is brown.
