For all the people allegedly concerned about this kid, why weren't they concerned that a 13 year old was running around committing crimes at 2:30 am on a school night?  Where were the parents then? Where was his \"concerned\" family then?", 1823, "9t7gBQsgaa", 0],

The gun was found there on the ground, and the kid had gunshot residue on his hands. He used that gun for something, and the cops claim he shot at them.  That boy was probably a thug in training. I suppose you'd be ok with him using his gun to kill some innocent for his initiation into his gang to go on with his criminal life. Remember. it was a 14 year old the murdered a young female college student in a robbery last year and it was another 14 year old that murdered the pizza delivery and then stole his money and his car.

Damn him. Damn Andrew. Damn that man! The bastard has foiled my plans yet again. Now I'll have to (gulp) do my own homework. What a self-righteous prick. Why couldn't he just do what I asked and furnish me with a story like I asked? Is it really too much to ask to just write an original story and post it here so that I can appropriate it and pass it off as my own?
