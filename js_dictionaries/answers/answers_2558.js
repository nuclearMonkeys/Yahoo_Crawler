	133725 : ["AS A non-Christian minority in a society governed by Christian beliefs and Christian institutions, the Jews were obvious and easy targets for popular hatred in times of crises such as the Black Death in the mid fourteenth century, when rampaging mobs all over Europe blamed the Jews for the morality that afflicted so many of the population, and took their revenge in countless acts of violence and destruction. Traditional antisemitism focused on the non-Christian religion of the Jews, and derived  its political power from biblical sanction. The New Testament blamed the Jews for Christ's death, condemning them to perpetual obloquy by declaring that they had willingly agreed to let Christ's blood be upon them and their descendant's.", 11189, "7G9W5bTRaa", 2],

However, people blamed them to be the cause of the bubonic plague.  In addition, they are hated in Middle East becuase due to the persecution in Europe during the 1800s they fled to Palestine even though it was Ottoman territory.  In the middle east, there is a constant battle for Jersualem, the holy city, between Muslims and Jews.  But it all comes back to the bible because they are considered people of God.", 11189, "5e2jTPMAaa", 2],

If this was a truly equal society, the left would not mention Obama's race. You are belittling him by doing so - reducing him to a colour in the EXACT same way that small minded racist rednecks do. Your attitude is pathetic. I don't care what anyone says - slavery is irrelevent in a modern society. Your attitude spreads division, and is all to common in modern society. And how dare you mention Martin Luther King? He was a great man - a man that in spite of all the hatred he faced, never retaliated in the same way. Not many people could do that. He wanted equality. He wouldn't want millions of blacks voting for a candidate for his skin colour. Can't you see the flaws in your logic? I have always thought that King was too optimistic, and that the full extent of his dream would never come to be. Nevertheless, he did great things, although I fear that this just shows that it will never be a truly equal society.", 11190, "None", -2],

The only special allowances tribes get is that they can allow gambling on their lands even if it's illegal in the state, hence the \"Indian Casinos.\" Also not all African-Americans today are of slave ancestry and not all whites in America today had ancestors who owned slaves. I have a black ancestor who owned slaves and none of my white ancestors did - how is that for irony? It would be impossible to decide who paid if reparations were made.", 11191, "1kJk1DSGaa", 6],

	133752 : ["Like most other ethnicities, Jewish people ARE good, kind, well-meaning people. Like most others, there has been good and poor examples of  Jews as a people. I personally think it's because they stood out in their beliefs and customs. Jews weren't (and some still aren't) willing to accommodate to others, for fear that the \"one bad apple may spoil the barrel\". So, not only are they fairly singular in their beliefs, they weren't always openly accepting of new people to their religion and lifestyle regardless of the reason. Historically,they were openly opposed to people of other religions marrying Jews, they wanted the bloodlines to stay Jewish, by race and faith. They have, however, have been persecuted for one reason or another since, well, forever.  Maybe it's because we, as humans, have this nasty habit of pointing the finger and placing blame.

However, personally, I've had very, very little bad experience with Jews and have mostly admired many of their accomplishments throughout history, but at a distance.  So, I don't fully understand the hatred either.  To me, it seems - from a distance - to be mostly envy as well as objection to some things one might consider offensive.
