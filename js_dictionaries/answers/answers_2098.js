	110676 : ["First, let's construct a diagram. Suppose we have circles B and E with radius of E 1 and radius of B unknown. Let's call the points of intersection of the two circles A and C. And let D be a point on circle B such that it lies on ray BE. It's important to note that D will lie \"after\" E, and that line AC will be \"before\" it, in order for the area to possibly equal to half the area. Let the intersection of AC and BE be F. Let X = AB (the unkown radius we are solving for). AE = BE = 1 (as this is the radius of cicle E) Using Law of Cosines: AB^2 + BE^2 - 2(AB)(BE)cos(angle ABF) = AE^2 X^2 + 1^2 - 2X(cos(angle ABF)) = 1 X^2-2X(cos(angle ABF)) = 0 cos(angle ABF) = X/2 angle ABF = cos^-1(X/2) Because triangle AEF is isosceles, we find that angle AEF = pi - 2cos^-1(X/2). Thus,  angle ABC = 2*angle ABF = 2cos^-1(X/2)  angle AEC = 2*angle AEF = 2pi - 4cos^-1(x/2) The area of a sector can be calculated by taking the measure of the angle and multiplying by the the radius squared. The area of a triangle can be calculated by ab*sin(C)/2. With that said, we can find the area of the intersection: [ABCD] = [sector ADC] - [triangle ABC] + [sector ABC] - [triangle ADC] = X^2cos^-1(X/2) - X^2(sin(2cos^-1(X/2)))/2 + cos^-1(pi - 2cos^-1(X/2)) - sin(2pi - 4cos^-1(X/2))/2 Setting this area formula as Y1, Y2 = pi/2, and the viewing window at [0,2] x [0,pi], we see the point of intersection is at X = 1.158728, approx. 1.16.
