You think that being trans happens overnight, no.. most know theyre in the wrong body from very young, and keep it a secret for years because of confusion or shame. 4. When people were decent? What does that even mean? People have been trans for THOUSANDS of years. They may not have been able to get sex changed but their attire and mannerisms matched the gender they identified with. 5.
