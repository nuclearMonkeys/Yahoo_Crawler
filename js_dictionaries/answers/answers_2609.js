I do understand your initial reaction, it must have been a huge shock, and your husband's \"instinctive\" violence too.  You did the natural thing to protect your son, and seem to have accepted that he is gay (I guess with not inconsiderable difficulty and heartache) and like most moms \"love your kids unconditionally\" ..... Sure your husband is what we here would call a \"bigot\", but I honestly believe bigotry and hate are rooted in ignorance, community and socialisation.   People screaming \"divorce\" don't have a clue .... sure if the guy is a violent brute you might have reasons .... but if you love him whatever his faults you must try to reconcile him to what's happened and bring family back together.  He might never fully accept (gay people just don't understand the aversion many straights have to same sex physicallity,  it can border on a genuine phobia) but he could learn to live with it and keep a son. Also what your son did was way way \"provocative\" .... almost like he wanted this to happen, to cause a huge scene.  What resentments were \"bubbling underneath\" to make him want to break the news, \"out\" himself in this way ? You don't screw a boyfriend in your bedroom while living with mom & dad and expect not to be discovered ? .... Especially knowing the \"dangers\", and what father's reaction would be ?

It became something we just didn't talk about for almost 10 years. Even now I am not convinced he is accepting, I just think he realizes that this is not going to change and there is nothing he can do.
