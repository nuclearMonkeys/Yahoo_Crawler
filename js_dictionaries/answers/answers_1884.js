I cant really say what it will do to your fish or the snails. I guess what you could do is put all of your fish and snails you wish to keep in a seperate tank and dose the tank with any medication that is high in copper to get rid of the snails in your main tank. That will work, i dont reccomend it but it will work. once the snails are gone then do a large water change on your main tank befor adding the fish back in. good luck and hope this helps.

If you don't have enough algae for them in your tank, you should supplement their diet with some greens (romaine, squash, cucumber) weighted down with some gravel.  You fish might nibble on these too. Apples are one of the better liked aquarium snails - you need to have both a male and female to produce young, although a female can store sperm and produce fertile eggs for a few months after mating.  The eggs are laid above the water line in the tank, so they're easy to remove if you don't want babies.  After about 6 months, it won't matter.   If your water isn't very hard (most public water sources soften the water), you should add a calcium supplement, otherwise the snail's shell can start to get holes in it.  A good calcium supply allows it to keep making new shell material. See this website for some good info about them:  ", 9718, "8e17cb78ea95956bb7fa096dce60a800aa", -2],
