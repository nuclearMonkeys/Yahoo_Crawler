Under current NHL rules, a team can have up to 5 goalies on an NHL roster, but can only dress 2 a game). This goaltender is not paid (under the 1974 CBA, any player who is not a member of the NHLPA is not permitted to be paid for any NHL action they may see. A player becomes a member of the NHLPA by signing a valid NHL contract). In some cases where that goaltender is not available (Vancouver a few years back comes to mind) a goaltender can be brought in.
