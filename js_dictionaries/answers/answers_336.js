	17000 : ["Have a consultation with your bank. Your financial borrowing power will be determined by your income to debt ratio.  Howsoever, it is never wise to borrow up to the maximum allowed because as time goes on you can guarantee that your monthly mortgage payment will increase as property taxes and your homeowner insurance will ALWAYS go up in price. Also, you have to afford maintence of the house as well. I just learned that I need a new furnace and compatible air conditioning unit....for about $11,000.00, gulp! I recently replaced my hot water heater for about $850.00. So, please understand that homeownership has many more financial obligations other than the initial monthly mortgage payment. One secret to a good marriage is to compromise. Why not meet in the middle ... find a house that costs more than he wants to spend and less than you do. This isa simple and fair way to handle conflict. Also, please do not purchase a house together until you are actually married. That would be stupid.  You see, there are legal benefits of being married that don't exist for \"almost married\" couples. Don't be foolish. Money disagreements are a major cause of marital problems. So, I suggest you both learn to compromise or your marriage is doomed before it ever begins.Also, remember, most people don't buy a house that they remain in for the rest of their lives. So, remember, as your lives change, as you have a family and what not, you'll likely move.", 2907, "9MJS6I6Laa", 0],
