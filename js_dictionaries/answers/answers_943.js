	52635 : ["Some clarification as to terms and definitions: \"Moral\" is Cicero's coined word-idea translating Greek ethikos, from G ethos, moral character, for his Latin speakers.  Thus ethikos and morals pertain to inter-monadic manners, built upon individual ethos.  At this juncture, one typically claims Godly moral character, or retreats to subjective materialism (Kantian 5-sense phenomena), which in its most reductive mode becomes objectivism, aka an ignorant claiming of only atomism.  \"Empathy\" is Lotze's coined word-idea translating G empatheia, emotion (especially suffering), for his German speakers. Edith Stein's brilliant, compassionate \"On the Problem of Empathy,\" which was her doctoral thesis written as Edmund Husserl's student, paves the way for an answer to your question.  Em-pathy is empathy-neuronal, presaged as the middle-period Kantian Categorical Imperative sensibility, and is healthy; sym-pathy is a Nietzschean \"last man\" herdly socialism, the polar pathology to sociopathy as \"plutocracy\" or \"robber barons;\" thus the middle way of compassion, between the cliched stereotypes of cold selfishness and emo infantilism. Middle Kant's correct intuition re neuroarchetectonics' transitivities promoting increasing awareness remains the basis for all phenomenally-sensed ethics/morals.  Insofar as the Noumenal is sensed, even as Schopenhauer's simple, inchoate will-to-live, there is a movement toward later Kant (\"Opus Postumum\"), in which he interprets God, and God's starry, wonderful Nature, to Man--a type of Natural Law theoretic. The neuroarchetectonics of empathy neuronal processing may be regarded as Stein's problematic of empathy, in which God/Energy and Man/man manifestly interact, (according to the varied epistemologies of sensibilities); in turn, these mores are functions of ontological evaluation (Noumenon, as unsensed, by middle Kant, and as Realized by e.g. Plato, Plotinus, Husserl, and Whitehead)--epistemic sensibility arising of ontological awareness. \"Logics\" are functions of Logos/ratio, and tend simply to quality-assure axiomized systems, which axioms are correlate with \"self-evident\" sensibilities and awarenesses.   Related: \"There's Something about Godel;\" \"Return to the One:  Plotinus's Guide to God-Realization;\" \"The Path of the Higher Self.\"", 7357, "380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa", 1],

I entered all the names of the people in my family as far a I could remember & asked various older members in my family also. I personally checked the archives & also obtained birth & marriage certificates. After entering all my info, my tree on moms side was up to 438 members (large family) including 2nd marriages & grandchildren having children. Ancestry always gave up notices that I had possible relatives & gave the names of possible ones who usually was not correct but still had  the same last names.  The problem in the US is when folks migrated from Europe or wherever they changed their last names to sort of Americanize them. For instance De Mello was changed to just Mello, also Spanish or Portuguese names were changed to English from the translation. (Blanco which is white, & Moreno which is brown)  When a person whos name is white try's to trace their heritage all the people named white would probably be wrong unless the info indicates it was changed from Moreno.                        Some Latin families carry the fathers & also the mothers name when they name their children. This is still evident today when ever you hear someone's name like  \"Jose Rodrigues Garcia\", Garcia being the mothers maiden name & Rodrigues being the fathers. Rodrigues would be from the father & Garcia the mom. When these folks have a daughter & she marries, HER children would carry Garcia in moms honor, and the daughter would carry Garcia for the middle name & dads for the last name. This was so confusing for me & most of the information I got from ancestry was incorrect except the ones I actually got on my own. They keep sending me names similar to mine but not related to me at all due to the name changes in the past. So no ancestry is not completely correct. simply my opinion.

Plus, I've taken DNA tests with two different commercial testing companies, but neither have been able to get it right yet. E.g., I know I am 38% Scandinavian, and approximately 20% English and 20% Central/Western Europe, along with some other things, but Ancestry.com's first test said I was less than 2% English in their first test. Meanwhile, on FTDNA, they claimed I was 48% English. I remember thinking, gee, if they just split the difference, they both would have gotten it right. I will say, however, that both sites originally had my Scandinavian pretty accurate. However, then they updated them, and now Ancestry.com claims I am 32% English, and FTDNA claims I am 18% English, so FTDNA deleted 20% of my English and Ancestry.com gave me 30% more English. But now both gave me way more Scandinavian also. FTDNA is now claiming I am 65% Scandinavian and Ancestry.com is claiming I am 52% Scandinavian. They should never have messed with those ones, as they both had my Scandinavian right the first time, and was literally the only thing they got right, but now it's wrong, along with everything else. And this is just on two of my ethnicity groups. For my other regions, they are also wildly all over the place. And don't even get me started about the trace regions...
