If he only worked three days and you worked five, who would you expect to do most of the chores?  If the answers are as we'd guess, where does this leave your marriage? Where do you see this going? Are you going to wait until he grows up? Do you want children?

We never did go to war with the USSR, and that is a good thing.  The Communist regime fell of its own accord.   China doesn't quite look like falling, but who knows?  In any case, they are not going to attack Western countries directly.  They took Hong Kong, next they will be going after Taiwan, and meanwhile  they use less conventional methods.  ", 2623, "54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa", 1],

Study privately, audition for gigs, and work your *** off to pay for it. If you can get into a program that will pay for your education to study performance then take that route. My colleagues who were working professionally (thanks Covid) either studied privately or received phenomenal scholarships to incredible programs. Why did I major in performance? My high school counselors and parents pushed college on me big time. The only thing I knew to do really well was perform. I got a decent scholarship at a small program at a state school. The state school taught me the things I needed to know but didn't provide many opportunities for me (this isn't the case at programs like CCM or Michigan where they provide countless life changing opportunities) It wasn't until I started auditioning for summer stock or intensive programs that doors began to open for me. And guess what!?! You don't have to be enrolled in a program or have a degree to be accepted into these intensive programs or summer stock... Audition EVERYWHERE, local, regional, and national!

	15454 : ["The person who mentioned that the user who's obsessed with Andrew is allowing him to live rent free in his head was right. Yes, Andrew did say that it's obvious the asker is troubled. And yes, he did use the words \"retarded\" and \"muppet\", but he didn't call the asker \"retarded\" - he called the story retarded, something regular users here would agree with. And \"muppet\" is rather tame as insults go. It's practically a term of endearment compared to some of the most disparaging words one might use.  It's only in your own feeble mind that the man is attempting to drive anyone to commit suicide. And it's only because your fixation on Andrew compels you to try and paint him out to be a devil when it's obvious that he isn't that you believe there's anything more to his posts than snarkiness and dismissiveness.  I remember something Andrew said one time \"this is a question and answer site, not a psychologist's office.\" It's not a crime to be indifferent to people with mental problems who refuse to help themselves who mistakenly believe that their mental disorders are an excuse to annoy others. There's nothing disgusting about telling someone to shut up and go away, and there's certainly nothing vile about calling someone a muppet. And if you think it's evil to tell someone you think their story is retarded, then you must have some very interesting opinions about the world we live in.  People are not more important than books here. This forum is dedicated to the asking and answering of questions about books. It's not a free clinic and it's not a cafe where you can pop in for a chat either.  As for \"nobody doing anything about it\", the asker failed to post a valid question. Andrew's reply was relevant to what was asked about. How is your \"Everything about Andrew makes me see red\" rant relevant at all?  Obviously the man has made quite the impression on you. But rather than convincing people to see it your way and thinking that Andrew is very, very mean and a big bully, all you're doing is demonstrating that you're a spineless minge who's allowing his all encompassing obsession with this particular user to drive him mad. Do you think Andrew cares who you are or what you think? Yet you scroll through this section looking to comment on anything he says and are always ready with your double thumbs down the second he posts anything.  It's pretty obvious that you have some mental issues yourself. I couldn't care less whether you address them or not, but you're not going to succeed in your silly quest to make yourself look like a knight and Andrew a knave. We can all see that you're just some jealous loser with way too much time on his hands.  It's a shame this isn't a cafe.
