	142602 : ["Okay, before I start I'd just like to point out that I'm fairly young, not yet wise in the ways of the world, and I sometimes have a tendency to be a bit naive.  So bear with me here. Personally, if I were the death row inmate, I'd rather die than live out the rest of my life in prison.  Federal prison sounds like a pretty rough place (and my dad works at one, so I'm not just speculating).  Life imprisonment is a pretty tough sentence.  Death would be kind. Also, I'm not naive enough to believe that our justice system gets it right every time.  When we're little, people tell us that the good guy always wins.  The bad guy never gets away.  They get thrown into prison.  But the stark reality is that sometimes our legal system makes mistakes.  Sometimes the bad guy gets loose again.  And sometimes we catch the wrong guy. If, hypothetically, we DID catch the wrong guy, well, what does it accomplish to kill him?  And then, even if we got the right guy, what does killing him do?  Besides the fleeting feeling of vindication, all that you've done is sink down to his level.  Two wrongs don't make a right. And on the practical side of things, executions can be expensive.  Basically, I guess I'm voting against capital punishment.  If you fight fire with fire, the whole world will go up in flames.", 11549, "mqdkcHDFaa", 4],

	142622 : ["Yes, I believe in capital punishment. One the guy takes a ride on Old Sparky (or whatever the liberal weenies will let us get away with), he will NEVER harm another person again. So in that sense, capital punishment is 100% effective. I also think there should be a limit to the number of appeals they can file to waste the time of the courts. I'm NOT saying that they should be denied due process, but there comes a point where they have to accept that they are guilty and deserve punishment. Of course I also believe that there shouldn't be cable/satellite in prisons either. They are there to be punished. I love the way the sheriff in Mericopa county, Arizona does it. They live in tents, sleep on cots, eat bologna sandwiches, and WORK all day. Tell the ACLU to piss off! These scumbags gave up their rights when they infringed on someone elses rights. The same goes for Amnesty International.", 11549, "TyyRPh6Waa", 2],
	142623 : ["I supported the death penalty for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it. In the end, several factors changed my mind: - Like you said, mistakes happen. Since 1973 in the U.S., over 140 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA and other evidence (DNA is not available in most homicide cases). Note that these are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.” A life sentence is reversible. A death sentence is not. - Cost - because of the legal apparatus designed to minimize wrongful executions, it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute someone than to imprison them for life. - It is not a deterrent - violent crime rates are consistently HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. - It is inconsistently and arbitrarily applied. - It fosters a culture of violence by presuming that killing someone is a valid solution to a problem. - Jesus was against it (see Matthew 5:7 & 5:38-39, James 4:12, Romans 12:17-21, John 8:7, and James 1:20). - Because the U.S. is one of the last industrialized nations to use the death penalty, many other countries refuse to extradite known criminals who should be standing trial here. - Life without parole (LWOP) is on the books in most states now (all except Alaska), and it means what it says. People who get this sentence are taken off the streets. For good. - Whether you are a hardened criminal or a government representing the people, killing an unarmed human being is wrong. Period. \"He did it first\" is not a valid excuse.", 11549, "Y6H8rH9saa", 0],

	142638 : ["Woolas, chico. Fíjese que debido a que no hay escuela en Guadalajara, ando aqui en Vta pasando unos dias con mi familia y cuates, y cuando llegan grupos tambien trabajo como guia de turista. mMMm  hay un chin.go de lugares que visitar, pero te advierto, justo en estos dias hace un calor INFERNAL. Vallarta es super open minded, hay muchos antros gay, el de ley es el paco paco. De cualquier modo en toda la ciudad son gay friendly, tanto restaurants como bares, cafecitos, etc. El Oldtown o zona romántica es de lo que mas me gusta, es tambien conocida como la zona Gay, pero es mas un area super tranquila donde hay muchos cafés y restaurantes, pero si bajas una cuadra hasta la playa encuentras toda el area de hoteles gay friendly.  Es que... depende de cuantos días vayas a estar, por ejemplo, si tomas un crucero puedes llegar hasta yelapa, las animas, majahuitas... son playas a las que solo llegas en barco y estan preciosas.  O puedes ir rumbo a Sayulita si te late el ambiente relax, hippioso. O si eres de los que disfrutan los pueblitos pintorescos entre las montañas puedes manejar hasta el Tuito. Eso si, las playas del centro se infestan de turistas, justo en esta epoca no... pero no son las mejores para nada. Si te laten las playas chidas ve a Las Gemelas Conchas Chinas, o hacia el lado de Nayarit. Destiladeras, Punta de Mita, Guayabitos...  no se, toda esa costa. Todo depende de que te guste hacer, jeje. A mi lo que me gusta hacer es visitar playas virgenes -que por cierto, hay muchisimas -y quedarme acampando por dias, precisamente ayer regrese de un camping.   Lo bueno: La gente es super buena onda donde quiera que vayas, muy amigables. Excepto los taxistas, jeje. Esos son unos maldit.os. Toda la ciudad es gay friendly, no es tan grande asi que el acceso incluso a lugares lejanos no es para nada dificill. La restaurants son muy variados, etc. No hay Influeza xD Lo malo: El calor. No es la mejor epoca para venir, te la tienes que pasar en la playa, en los rios o adentro de un mall que tenga aire acondicionado. Es algo caro, en general. Los cines y los bares despues de las 12 de la noche, estan cerrados debido a la Influenza. Creo que el gobierno piensa que antes de esa hora no hay riesgo de contagio.   Lo que no te puedes perder: La carretera a Mismaloya. Es una completa delicia pasar por ahi, por que vas viendo de un lado las montañas, y al otro la costa. Los alrededores. Es lo mejor que tiene Vallarta, aparte de su gente. El Tuito, San Sebastian del Oeste, Yelapa Caletas y Majahuitas, la costa de Nayarit. El Le Biztro. Tocan Jazz por las noches y la cena es deliciosa. La zona Romantica Y La Isla Cuale.  Y por supuesto, una caminata de noche por el malecon, pero seguir hasta donde termina y mientras te disfrutas de un rico elote con crema y queso! Saludines", 11545, "None", 2],

That's great and I love the nerdy type 5. Yes, treat woman nice but don't be a player 6. Ok, if that's what you want just as long as you are in shape thats good for me 7. GREAT!!!!!!!! 8. Nope, nope, and nope 9. I only like your following hobbies: hiking, wine tasting, TV, exercising, photography, backpacking 10. Girls don't like another woman in the room.  She wants you to herself. Thats wrong and SICK! 11. I hate guys with lots of friends so 3 is ok to me. No, I wouldn't date you (excluding my boyfriend).  You seem shallow, cocky, you have some bad habits, you smoke and drink alot, you don't sound very interesting but I could be wrong, and the threesome thing is so bad. You need to pay attention to your woman \"only\". To date you, I would have to get to know you better and understand you more.  My advice is to become friends with woman, not date them right away...maybe that's your problem.  Let someone know you a little before you two get serious or start dating.", 11555, "None", 0],
