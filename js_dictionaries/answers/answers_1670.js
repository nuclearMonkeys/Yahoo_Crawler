He of course does not understand what he needs, or he could have chosen the lady who of course cares approximately him and could no longer **** him over, like he has her. the alternative is yours, yet my suggestion is to discover somebody who will follow you and not circulate off to screw another chick only reason she's who he in the previous wanted. stable luck to ya. ~Aaron", 9318, "I5g3NgqCaa", 0],

	89179 : ["A note about buzzards-- I've never heard of a buzzard being mistaken for a duck!!! They don't sound, look or walk like ducks, nor are they even waterfowl! The thing is that many of the analogies that people use to explain the trinity fall apart under scrutiny.... Classic examples- Roles- Yes, I'm a wife, daughter and sister... but I'm not my own daughter (or sister or even spouse)-- I never will be, because I can't be. Egg- There is no way someone could possibly mistake the shell for the yolk, or the white for the shell... Yes, they're united perfectly for the single purpose of bringing forth life...... (Hm, that acutally sounds more like what I believe! 3 separate beings, united in vision, purpose, and mission...) First you have to realize that although belief in the trinity has become some people's litmus test for Christian-ness, it's not entirely Biblical. Sure, John 1:1 says that the Word was God... but about 16 chapters later, if you read the entire 17th chapter of John, you have to admit that either Jesus was schizophrenic, talking to His Father/Himself... or He and His Father are 2 separate beings. End of story. Sadly, this is only one of the many apparent contradictions in the Bible... the contradictions that so many supposed Christians refuse to see, and refuse to pray to learn the truth about. (Why are so many \"Christians\" afraid to ask God a question??) Last I heard (from a valid, non-biased source), the only requirement for being Christian was to believe in and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ.", 9322, "AA10031161", 0],
	89180 : ["One explanation likened the Trinity to water, steam, and ice, which are different formations of the same element.  How are we to become like water, steam and ice? Why is that any more believable than becoming a person of flesh and bone? Touchable.  The trinity is founded on the ideas of man and the Nicene Creed includes the words \"incomprehensible\"  \"without body or form\" It just boggles my mind why it is so hard to believe in a Loving Father, a Son in the flesh and the Holy Spirit making up the Godhead.

Just because they (as to say) walk like a duck, they quack like a duck. Does not mean its a duck- Its a buzzer in discuise.  Lets look at the importance of the tri-unity.     Hey wisdom. They Catholic church uses a different Bible.  Besides when Constantine came into power the believers took to the hills away from him and started living in caves and the such. Now Jesus knew that \"actions\" speaks louder then words!  In John 10:24-25 we read; Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

I would hope no one is really \"pro-war.\"  Pro-war means you are for the killing and the destruction that goes with war.  Anyone wanting to kill and destroy has a serious problem. Most people are \"pro-life.\"  We don't wish suffering or death on anyone.  Pro-choice is another term.  In this day and time, when we are suppose to be tearing down all the human barriers that go with racism and labeling, and then we have to develop such extreme terms as these.   But, to answer your question, it's just another way of protesting.  Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.  Remember the old sixties saying \"make love, not war?\"  There is another stupid saying.

An unborn baby with no voice being killed before it ever gets a chance to be born is different than a legal adult, choosing to enter a job that may or may not put him/her in harms way.  Police officers, fire fighters, Alaskan king-crabbers, all have dangerous jobs...by choice. So do military personnel. They are trained for war and know that they can be called up at anytime to go to war and possibly lose their lives.  I am not for the war, I am not for anyone being killed born or unborn...but I do think there is a difference.
