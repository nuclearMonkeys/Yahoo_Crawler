	60834 : ["Car: Speakers are my only choice. In New York, it is illegal to wear headphones or earphones that cover both ears because it makes it hard to hear emergency vehicles. But speakers are the best anyway because there is nothing like lowering the windows and cranking up the volume for an amazing song. I find myself doing that quite regularly (I actually got detention once for blasting my music in the school parking lot) Home: Always listen with my headphones if I'm not alone because I don't like to disturb everyone else. Besides, my family doesn't like most of my music so they'd tell me to put on headphones anyway. However, if everyone is out, I blast my music, move the coffee table and do my strange version of hardcore dancing in the living room (shhh, don't tell Chiodos). Working out: I'm at the gym or sports practice for a good portion of my day, so since I don't have speakers available, I use headphones. It sucks when running though because I've dropped my itouch a few times, and earphones have a tendency to fall out. I'd prefer speakers.", 8092, "None", 2],
	60835 : ["80% of the time it's headphones. I can just connect with music better with them. Only I am listening and not anybody else. Also my mind is extremely busy and I get distracted a lot. With speakers that is extremely easy to do. My perference however is a to a certain extent by activities. Car: I believe that the car was made for people to sit and listen to music together. I despise speaking in the car (I usually don't speak outside of it anyways). Also I grew up with my father blasting his music in the car all the time. I guess it just stuck.  Getting ready: It's more convient for me to have speakers in this occassion. I dance a lot and run around my house. Usually by this time my family is busy outside of the house so the volume is turned to its max. Computer: Headphones! There is nothing better then pulling in headphones to my computer's speaker. The first time I did it was when listening to a Sigur Ros perfeormance and realized that it is such a better listening expeirence for me.  Bike riding: Headphones. For two reasons. I don't have a bike stereo. AND! I have a feeling people would start to give my a lot of dirty looks if I ride past them blasting Suicide Silence :D I also find that I enjoy speakers more during the day and headphones at night.", 8092, "Hck22n9Faa", 4],

	60838 : ["Definitely moderates of other beliefs, not extremists of my own. But here is where we get into some sketchy semantical territory: by labelling someone as an \"extremist,\" you have most likely already made a delineation in your mind between the beliefs they hold and your own.  So this becomes a little more tricky than it would seem at first glance. While you and an extremist may share some of the same beliefs (eg, \"Members of my faith group are saved\" or \"There is no god\"), there are many others you may have nothing in common with (eg, \"No one outside my faith group is saved\" vs \"We don't have a monopoly on salvation,\" or \"Others who believe in god are idiots\" vs \"People's beliefs should be tolerated insofar as they do not affect other people\"). Absolutes, generally speaking, should be avoided.  For as advanced as we are, we often lack the proper descriptive terms necessary to relate a full understanding of a topic to others.  There are also many cases where our knowledge is incomplete (both in faith and in science).  People of good will and sound mind can accept these propositions.  Therefore, I would have to argue that moderates tend to be people of good will and sound mind more often than extremists are.  That is why I believe that moderates have more in common with each other (even \"across party lines,\" so to speak) than do moderates with extremists of any cloth.", 8088, "Yb9E25Uraa", 0],

	60852 : ["Hmm, this is a toughie. I'm completely for homosexual marriage (and even incestuous and polygamist marriage) for consensual adults.  Basically, I keep out of other people's business and worry about my own. One of the main secular arguments Christians tend to bring us is it redefines marriage.  Not a problem in my book, but there you have it.  Another popular argument is that it destroys the sanctity of marriage; though when people are getting shotgun weddings in Vegas, what is sacred? One argument that I slightly agree with is \"it isn't natural\".  That one is true.  In order for evolution to continue, humans need to spread their genes.  If two male homosexuals are together (or two females who don't opt for in vitro fertilization), then they aren't spreading their genes and they aren't contributing to the gene pool.  Though, like I said:  I only slightly agreed with that one.  While it's not necessarily natural for humans to engage in homosexual relationships, I don't feel there's really anything wrong with that.  We're overpopulated enough as it is; if there's no limiting factors, human population would spin out of control. Christians also like to argue that being gay is a choice.  I don't agree with that either, but as there's a lack of scientific data (that I'm aware of), it could easily be argued without using religion to back the claim up.", 8089, "AA12360579", 6],
	60853 : ["It can really be a challenge to make healthy food choices on a budget! Students have a double challenge, because if they're living in a residence there may not be much storage for foods or time to prepare healthy meals. (Oh, I remember all too well!!) Some good tips are: Shop for meat and produce at smaller ethnic grocers (if your city has a \"Chinatown\" that's a fantastic place to start!) Actually, in general get as much of your grocery list from these stores as you can. Your dollar goes a lot further, the veggies are fantastic quality and often half the price. Plus there's excellent variety! Variety is entirely under-rated, nutritionally speaking. So get adventurous! If you see something you've never tried before, buy a small amount and look it up online to see how to prepare it. (This is an excellent way to expand your culinary horizons.) Mornings for students, more than anyone, tend to consist of a quick coffee on the way to class. I'm aware that it's not very realistic to tell students to cut out coffee, so instead of cutting the coffee, try to balance it with something healthy for that all important first meal of the day. Time saving and still nutritional? Make a fruit shake - protein powder and some frozen fruit with some almond milk, whip it up in a blender and voila! Tasty, easy, fast AND good for you. On that note - frozen fruit and veggies are okay. They may not be ideal, but if you're having troubles with food going bad in your fridge before you can eat it, opt for frozen. Invest in some nut butters (almond, cashew, hazelnut) and some tahini... A dollop on rice crackers with a touch of honey is a yummy, healthy snack while you're studying in the afternoon. And it's easy enough to take with and eat in class. Learn to cook lentils and beans!! These uber-cheap darlings are oh-so-healthy and just pennies a meal. Make soups and stews in a crock pot, so dinner is ready when you get home (and you have left-overs for a few days.) Crock pots/slow cookers in general are a lifesaver. Especially at exam time! Pick up a slow cooker cookbook (even better if it's a vegetarian one, because vegetarians have scads of great bean and lentil options.)

You can call a gay relationship something else, e.g. civil parrtnership as in Britain, where it's legal and no-one makes a fuss about it; but you can't call it a marriage.  That's not what the word means. 2.  The argument from nature.  Human beings are equipped to procreate, homosexuals use their equipment in ways that prevent this happening.  It's unnatural.  (and disgusting and unhealthy and disordered - which are more emotional reflexes than arguments as such, but they infuse a lot of the debate) 3.  Society has a vested interest in the continuation of our species, so it needs to create institutions that provide stability for couples and protection for children.  It may wish to provide sanctions against families breaking up too easily.  It has no such interest in providing security for gay couples.  There is no reason why they shouldn't live together, but it is of no concern of society whether their union is permanent, exclusive and publicly declared.
