	56478 : ["You asked a good question, one that I have seen a lot, and that I have a couple of stock answers for. I am going to put two of my old answers here, they are both long, so this will be VERY long. Wanting to know about Day One, here it is: You load up on a bus, are told to keep your head down and mouth shut. Then you get driven onto MCRD Parris Island at about 0200. A DI rolls onto the bus and screams you off. You then form up on a bunch of yellow foot prints into your first real formation. Then you are hustled into the receiving building, where you sit down at desks and they make you fill out a bunch of forms, give you your platoon number, do a quick contraband check, ect... Then you get led off to the barber shop, where you get a 15 second hair cut (and about 10 bleeding cuts). Next, they take you to bucket and uniform issue, and you get your gear. They run you up into the receiving barracks, where you lock up your new issue, and put on a set of cammies. Then, you get marched to the chow hall (When I was there, we went to 2nd Battalions), and you get shown the ropes of how to get through the chow hall. When you get done with chow, you get marched back to receiving, where you go through some more paperwork. You fill out things like your SGLI paperwork, GI Bill paperwork, and you get the \"last chance\" speech. That is where you sit there and they tell you that this is your last chance to come clean about things like drugs, convictions, medical conditions, ect... that you might have \"forgotten\" to mention to your recruiter/MEPS. If they find out about anything later, you're screwed. After that, there is a piss test, you fill out a little post card with your address on it to mail home to your folks. Then the receiving DIs (You won't meet your real DIs for a couple of days) will run you through some basic drill movements, show you how to do things like make your rack, get on line, everything like that. Then you get marched to chow again, march back, they tell you some more stuff, and then they finally let you get some sleep. You will have been going for about 20-24 hours by this point. One HELL of a day. And in two or three hours, the next one starts. And Day One was the easiest day. Remember, the Army has Drill Sergeants, Marines have Drill INSTRUCTORS. And you call all real Marines Sir or Ma'am. You are just a worthless Recruit.  As for the rest of it: Where they really blow you away is your first few days with your platoon. They will bring in extra DIs and ride you harder than the rest of the time. Don't misunderstand me, they will be on your @$$ until the day you get your EGA, but the first week is the worst. if you aren't supposed to be talking, keep your mouth shut, if you are supposed to be talking, sound off as loudly and enthusiastically as possible. Don't get an attitude, and do whatever you are told as quickly and efficiently as possible. Your DIs are going to be jerks, @$$holes of the first order, that is their job, and it isn't a personal attack. Remember that. If someone is falling behind, help them, because there is no individual effort in Marine Boot Camp. If one person fails, the whole platoon will pay. Oh, and trust me, 10 years from from now, you will look back on Parris Island and realize that as absolutely miserable as it was, it is also the most important and life changing thing you will do until you have kids. Oh yeah, don't let your friends send you any letters or packages with anything on the outside besides name and address. And don't let them send you anything that will earn you large ammounts of quarterdeck time. So, in conclusion, Boot Camp will suck. It is designed to. But it will make you a stronger person, and you will look back on it with pride. Enjoy lovely Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, home of the hottest, most humid weather, the most vicious sand fleas, and loudest sadists on planet Earth. You to will learn that drinking water can be a punishment. EDIT:  Upthcrek is wrong.  Marine Corps PFT is a 3 mile run.  I don't remember female requirements, but to get the best score as a male, you had to run it in 18 minutes.  Females also have to do the \"flexed arm hang\" instead of pull ups. Some of what I said (haircut for example) apply to males, not females, but it is pretty much the same.  You females are kept VERY segregated at Parris Island.  I went to boot camp there, and I saw females only a few times.  Once was from a distance, while a female platoon was out for a hump, another was because they used part of the same rifle rage as we did, and finally, at gradutation practice and graduation.  We only saw that many because our Company was on the same schedule with a female company.  You guys have your own battalion, chowhall, and everything.", 7920, "4XQcKZOBaa", 3],

	56513 : ["How is feline upper respiratory disease complex treated? The treatment of cats with feline upper respiratory disease complex is basically the same, regardless of cause and includes: Keeping the eyes and nasal passages clear through regular removal of discharge, increasing the humidity (e.g., placing a vaporizer in the room with the cat), and the possible use of a nasal decongestant prescribed by the veterinarian Ensuring food and water intake - this may be difficult since the nasal symptoms may not allow the cat to smell the food, in which case it usually does not eat. These cats may need to be force fed. Keeping the cat quiet and warm Controlling secondary bacterial infections through the use of antibiotics Treating any oral ulcers or eye lesions with appropriate medication Cats with upper respiratory disease are generally not hospitalized unless their symptoms are severe due to the contagious nature of the disease. In severe cases, fluid therapy, supplemental oxygen, or a tube placed in the stomach for feeding cats who will not eat may be necessary. SYMPTOMS: SNEEZING  NASAL DISCHARGE  RUNNY EYES  COUGH  ORAL OR NASAL ULCERS  SNIFFLES  FEVER  HOARSE VOICE  OR ANY COMBINATION THEROF  WHAT CATS ARE AT RISK? Despite the highly contagious nature of all the feline upper respiratory agents, it is important to realize that most cats are at very small risk for exposure. In other words, in order to get this kind of infection, a cat must be in the same home as an infected cat or share the same human caretaker, toys or food bowls. Typically infected cats come from the shelter, are outdoor cats, or are housed in close contact with lots of other cats (experiencing crowding stress). Persian cats are predisposed to upper respiratory infection due to their inherent facial flattening. The average housecat who is not exposed to any rescued kittens, lives with only one or two other cats at most, and never goes outside is unlikely break with infection. Kittens are predisposed due to their immature immune systems. Viruses are spread by the wet sneezes on infected or carrier individuals. The Herpesvirus is very fragile, surviving only 18 hours outside its host; calici is tougher, lasting up to 10 days. Bleach will readily inactivate either virus but calici is able to withstand unbleached laundry detergents. COURSE OF INFECTION To some extent, the combinations of symptoms and course of infection is determined by which of numerous infectious agents is responsible. Ninety percent of feline upper respiratory infections are caused by either feline Herpes or feline Calicivirus. Neither of these infections is transmissible to humans or to other animals. Most feline colds run a course of 7 to10 days regardless of treatment but it is important to realize that these infections are permanent and that Herpesvirus infections are recurring (a property of all types of Herpes infections). In kittens Herpes infections are notorious for dragging out. Stresses such as surgery (usually neutering/spaying or declawing), boarding, or introduction of a new feline companion commonly induce a fresh Herpes upper respiratory episode. These episodes may recur for the life of the cat though as the cat matures, symptoms become less and less severe and ultimately may not be noticeable to the owner. A cat with Herpes is contagious to other cats for a couple of weeks after a stressful event. Cats infected with Calici are contagious for several months after infection but do not appear to have recurrences the same way cats with Herpes do. WHEN TO BE CONCERNED A cold for a cat is usually just a nuisance as a cold usually is for one of us. Sometimes though an upper respiratory infection can be serious. If a cat is sick enough to stop eating or drinking, hospitalization may be needed to support him or her through the brunt of the infection. A cat (usually a kitten) can actually get dehydrated from the fluid lost in nasal discharge. Painful ulcers can form on the eyes, nose or in the mouth. Sometimes fever is high enough to warrant monitoring. In young kittens, pneumonia may result from what started as an upper respiratory infection. If you think your cat or kitten is significantly uncomfortable with a cold you should seek veterinary assistance with an office visit. HOW IS THIS USUALLY TREATED? Since 90% of cases are viral in origin and we have no antibiotics against viruses, it seems odd that most feline upper respiratory infections are treated with anti-bacterial medications. The reason for this is that it is common for these viral infections to become complicated by secondary bacterial invaders. The antibiotics act on these. Further, the next most common infectious agent (after Herpes and Calici) is Chlamydia psittaci (recently renamed Chlamydophila felis), an organism sensitive to the tetracycline family (such as doxycycline). For this reason, when antibiotics are selected, tetracyclines and their relatives are frequently chosen. (Since tetracycline use can permanently stain the teeth of immature animals, these medications are generally not chosen for younger pets.). Oral medications, and/or eye ointments are commonly prescribed. For congestion, some human nose drop products can be used for relief. Consult your veterinarian before attempting any sort of home treatment. Other therapies frequently employed include low doses of interferon-alpha (to generally stimulate the immune system) and oral lysine supplementation (which interferes with Herpesvirus reproduction). For younger kittens that are infected, often the most significant factor in their throwing off infection, is maturation and gaining a more effective immune system with growth. Occasionally infections can lead to more chronic symptoms, such as gingivitis (gum inflammation), conjunctivitis, or nasal congestion. WHAT ARE THE VACCINATION OPTIONS? In selecting a vaccine against upper respiratory infections, there are some choices one can make. First, one must choose between a nasal vaccine and an injectable vaccine. The injectable vaccines which typically include feline distemper, were developed first and when vaccines for upper respiratory infections were created, they were simply added to the basic distemper injectable vaccine. Since that time science has developed a more localized form of vaccination to better address more localized types of infections.  If one selects the injectable route of vaccination, one must then decide if one wants a “four in one” or a “three in one” vaccine. You may vaccinate your cat for distemper, Herpesvirus, and Calicivirus or you may vaccinate for distemper, Herpesvirus, Calicivirus, and Chlamydia psittici. Remember that Herpes and Calicivirus together account for 90% of upper respiratory infections and Chlamydia accounts for less than 10% of upper respiratory infections. There is some feeling that these vaccines may provide a more complete stimulation to the area of the immune system responsible for defense against the infection in question. Herpes and calicivirus vaccines can be given either nasally or injectably.", 7926, "None", 0],
