	128488 : ["Other than the miracle of giving birth, the only other time, I was involved in witnessing a miracle was when I was a teenager, and learned my grandmother had incurable cancer, and hadn't been given long to live. I had been a young girl, very religious and trusting of God. And I couldn't bear the  thought of being without my favorite grandma in my life. And I arranged for a prayer circle among my closest friends. Telling them to all be set to pray for my grandmother, at a specific time on a specific day. I felt very close to God as I prayed and I felt a sense of energy, I had never before experienced. I call it 'prayer energy' today, for I feel it is a special energy that comes from our very soul, when we are desperate for intervention far beyond our reach. My friends told me the next day, that they all had complied with the prayer circle and concentrated as hard as they could.  Several days passed. Maybe a week or more. And I came home from school to find my grandma having a cup of coffee in the dining room. Both mom and she were all smiles and feeling really good about something. And my mom told me, that my grandma had gotten miraculous news from her doctor on the cancer. She went in to have them do other tests, and found there was not even a trace of the cancer. They couldn't explain it. And so naturally my grandma and mom were just elated. Especially when thinking back to when my grandma had been such a ill young wife when she began to have a family. I felt so relieved, but I somehow felt, that had there not been a small group of my friends praying for her, and offering up more prayer energy, she would not have had the divine blessings she received. And I knew and believed, she would no longer have the threat of cancer hanging over her. After that, life went on for her and she lived a long life, exceeding her husband of many years, until the age of 91. She was in her 60's at the time of the cancer scare. You can say that God cured her, or you could say the energy of thought processes cleared it all away. But it doesn't change the fact, my grandma was cured for all time. And how it came about could only be due to a miracle. And so I believe, it was not her time to go, and with a little help from unseeable power, made her whole once again, to live out her life. She was the most special person in my life. Which has not been whole since she passed away.", 10987, "XEbrGfZuaa", 4],

As far as mechanics and understanding of the game, Peyton is probably one of the best ever. My measurement of greatness goes beyond mechanics and regular season stats though. In my opinion, a player should be measured by their performance in big games... Playoff games to be exact. All Peyton has ever done in the playoffs is choke! Eli seemed to be on the same path as Peyton the first couple years he made it to the playoff but last year... Something in him... Not sure what it was, but the spark went off in Eli. Eli Manning actually won those playoff games for his team! He droved down the field against both the Cowboys and the Patriots to put his team on top in crunch time and never looked back. It wasn't like Peyton who let his defense carry the Colts to the Super Bowl in '06. I admit, Eli's D was not too shabby, but when the Giants needed him the most last post-season, he was there.
