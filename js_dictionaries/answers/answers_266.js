	13334 : ["You can pursue acting at any age, but you need to keep in mind that it's going to take a huge investment of money time and effort, and there's no guarantee it'll ever pay off. It takes making big sacrifices, which you may not be willing or capable of making at this point of your life. First, understand that you can't just go to auditions for professional work, they are not open to the general public. You need an agent. But you can't just hire one, especially not yet. No legit agent takes on beginners or amateurs. Only talented, highly-trained and highly experienced people with a strong resume to back it all up. So where do you start? At square one. Square one is adopting a realistic approach. No one's just discovered and handed an acting career. It's not like in the movies. The reality is very different from what people imagine and you might be more interested in the fantasy of what you THINK it's like. This is show BUSINESS. Understand that no one's in this to make your dreams come true, they're in this to make money. Productions invest tons of money and they need to know it's in the hands of people who know what they're doing. Before you go and invest so much time, money, and work, research all about the business side. Being an actor is like running a business where you are the product you need to market and sell out. You need to know all about the industry, how you fit into it, and how to navigate it. Backstage. com is a good place to start. Then, you might wanna get into some local, low-key acting classes. High-school classes many years ago don't mean much, I'm afraid.  Listen to the feedback. See if you can handle it. See if you're good at the craft and if you still enjoy it. In short, see if you're capable of pursuing it on a professional level, mentally ad physically. Make sure you have a true passion for the CRAFT itself - as opposed to the fantasy. If after all of that you're still interested in pursuing a professional career, and if you're capable of pursuing it, start building a resume strong enough to impress potential agents: Apply to a top-quality acting school (where well-known and respected teachers teach and successful professionals graduated from, not just any acting classes). Get yet more training in the form of workshops and masterclass and the likes (also run by well-known and respected people). They're all in the big city. In addition, start auditioning for any local non-professional work you can, such as student and indie films. Also audition for or join a community theater. Anything that doesn't require an agent. Constantly land leading roles. Win awards for your acting. Take vocal and dance lessons. Also study and master other skills to give your resume a boost (for example: horseback riding, ice-skating, martial arts, acrobatics, dialects, mime, etc.). That's the kind of resume agents look for. It takes about a decade, give or take, to build it. Which means that by the time you're ready for an agent and for professional acting jobs, by that *become* a professional actor, you will be 47-49, give or take. Understand that. Once you've got an impressive resume under your belt, unless what you want is to act locally rather than nationally you'll need to move to LA (or NYC with just less opportunities but more for theater). Continue getting training and experience till someone you've worked with and impressed (like a director, a producer, an acting teacher, or even a fellow actor) will be willing to refer you to an agent. That's how you usually get an agent. Other ways (like cold-querying with your headshots, resume and demo reel, or getting spotted at a showcase) rarely work. Speaking of, you'll also need to network and get connections in the industry. Stay in touch with people you work with. Networking is a big part of this biz. If and when you get an agent, you will be able to start working as a professional actor and go to auditions for professional jobs. In short, the way it usually works is, when a new project starts casting a casting director is hired. The casting director creates a \"Character Breakdown\" specifying exactly the roles they're looking to fill based on their age-range, looks, ethnicity, special skills, etc. Then they approach the agents they know and trust. The agents go over the breakdown, go over their client database, and submit to the casting director only the clients they believe may fit those said roles (meaning, they send them those clients' resumes, demo reels and headshots). Out of those, the casting director will invite to audition only the handful *they* believe may fit those said roles. Those actors will come in and audition as many rounds as needed till one gets each role. So theoretically, you may be invited to 100 auditions a year or you may never be invited to any auditions. There's no way to know, luck plays a huge part in this. Understand that. Also understand that chances are you will need to get plenty of *professional* experience before you can audition and get any serious roles in serious productions such as national movies and TV shows. So, statistically, it's very possible that IF you ever get a serious role on a serious production you'll be in your 50s or even older. The reality is, 99% of professional actors will never get more than a few minor speaking or non-speaking roles, on minor production (including things no one's ever heard of) their entire career, let alone become famous. The reality is almost all actors are constantly exhausted, far away from home and lonely. They barely have time to socialize or be with their family. They hold another job or two alongside acting. They're hungry for food and live in a small apartment. Their looks, talent, and skills are constantly judged and they're more often than not rejected. They can easily fall into depression. And with all that, they STILL have to make sure they remain healthy and strong - physically AND mentally. That means exercising, eating healthy, getting your beauty treatment as needed, getting therapy if needed... So what I'm saying is, even if you love the craft and are good at it, also make sure that this lifestyle is for you at all. That you can handle it. Will you be willing to make those big sacrifices at 40 and 50-something for the small chance you will succeed? Can you? Pack up your entire life and move? Will that work? If you have a family, will they be able to move with you? Then, will you be willing to sacrifice time with your family and friends? And free time...? And what about a job? You'll need one once you land in LA and so will your spouse... Keep in mind that LA is an expensive city... Ideally, you'll need a job that's stable yet flexible so you can take off in the middle of the day to go to auditions, rehearsals, shootings, fittings, classes, etc. You can't be a doctor and pursue acting at the same time, for example. There's a reason why actors-waiters is a cliche. Are you willing to sacrifice your job or other career choices you may have? Or will it be too late because you're all settled down? That's for you to consider and answer. If you decide to go for it, you'll have to wait a little longer, what with COVID-19. If you're asking about a theater actor, you don't need an agent or move anywhere for that. Just go to a good acting school (once we all can) and start auditioning for local theaters. Bear in mind that they too look at your resume, so the more impressive it is the better your chances are of getting good roles. Also, the vast majority of theater actors hold a \"regular\" day job because acting doesn't pay their bills. Understand that. Acting is not for most people. So please give it some serious thought and be honest with yourself. If nothing else, if a professional acting career is not for you after all, there's also the option of acting as a hobby. Nothing wrong with that. Good luck!", 2213, "None", 3],
