However I am no longer a Catholic in a proper feel as I used to be raised within the Anglo Catholic Church and so are not able to obtain the bread or the wine at mass - I simply sit down on the again or to the part close the wall.

	125722 : ["You look at the evil that Jesus said would be there and would be rooted out and damned at the last Judgment but you refuse the good that is there and that is truly from God. For Jesus said the gates of Hell would not prevail but He didn't say there would be no evil within the Church. The Catholic Church exists to protect the Teaching of Jesus on Faith and Morals, and that it does do.St Augustine long ago showed that the good of the Sacraments and the blessings that come from the Church are in no way dependent on the holiness or lack thereof of its ministers else we could never know that we were recieving the grace of God through those divinely-appointed ministers. They will be judged on their conduct, don't worry about that.", 10854, "None", 3],
	125723 : ["Explain to me how you can believe that the Catholic Church is the only one in which man has succumbed to the temptations of evil?

	125724 : ["You don't.  Never is that commanded.  You hear the word, believe it as truth, confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and are baptized for the removal of your sins, then you are added to the church of Christ by God to live a faithful life unto death.", 10858, "cLFIL9Edaa", 1],

For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. Â And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. So to be joined to Christ, have the flesh, the self life cut off and live by His life. Then you must inherit the authority of Jesus Christ, as you put it, and reign with Him, here in this life or world.", 10861, "4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa", 3],

	125734 : ["First, I honestly think that people are somehow blinded to the \"search for questions\" button on the screen. Like when you look for something and find it right in front of you after having it missed it a few times. Second, I think so many answers pop up that it overwhelms people. Maybe if Yahoo limited it to the 10 most recent answers (and more if you chose to go on) people would not be overwhelmed and actually read some of them. Third, questions that appear the same in the title often have different sub questions that may not have been asked before. Fourth, since I regard it as related issue did you ever notice that people do not read the answers already posted before they answer a question? At least it appears that way to me. Of course maybe they just want the points and don't care about being helpful (shrug)", 10855, "LtL0PXG0aa", 0],

	125745 : ["I have some problems with this type of thinking. IF it is used solely to prevent genetic diseases, then no problem, but we already do that to a great extent by aborting genetically defective children. Doing genetic selection for all things frivolous is a ridiculous concept. Personally, I do not see this happening in my lifetime or yours. The human genomes are just to big to control that much.

	125746 : ["I would say it isn't morally right or wrong, it simply is what it is. I think all humans are equal, regardless of what their personality is or how they look. It wouldn't make the child less of a human to me. People already somewhat genetically select for their children, like I know people who want to get married to another race, because they like the look of mixed children. I would think it might be a good thing in some cases, it would prevent some struggles between parents and children, which is mentally healthier for both. If two parents want a smart child, but the child is not intelligent at all, then there can be lots of conflict. If the parents genetically chose for higher intelligence, this would not be a problem. Parents already shape the way you are from the second you are born. The way you are raised plays a huge role in how your personality develops. The whole argument of \"Nature vs. Nurture\" is about how big of a role parents play in your personality.", 10864, "U4cNbbS1aa", 0],

Is it morally OK in a situation like that, where you could have genetically chosen a child that would not be born into a world of discrimination, suffering, medical problems, and a hampered start on life?

	125750 : ["actually, if you believe, and know what to believe, it helps the intellectual side to desire to come to Christ,  someone said PRAY until you can pray.   read Luke 11 and Matt 6 about the lords prayer.  you have to acknowledge that you are guilty of sin, and need to repent, and then you say you want to be saved and will confess your sins and forsake them.  i prayed to be baptized in the holy spirit before i was baptized, but baptism of thet holy spirit and immersed in water is a priority.  in the LDS church, the missionaries go door to door and they do the actual teaching on the principles of the gospel to be saved.  i would advise asking them the questions and  listening Not arguing to them.  sure you can go to any church, there should be a freedom of religion and free will choice, but theologically there is only  ne faith and one baptism and besides !   the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is the ONLY \"restored\" church", 10857, "wuPTBIIuaa", 0],

	125753 : ["God does not lead any church or group, In old testament he did lead the Jews. God is personal now to our death. Men lead the Catholic church not God so what it is today is understandable.

I hope you learn more about god and ask questions to help you get closer to God.", 10854, "8VzhWOh2aa", 2],

You can not be sinless, you can not be good enough, you can not pay enough tithing, and you can not go to the temple to get a \"special\" blessing or ordination to go to heaven.

All the Pastor could do is tell me that he Loved me, and Jesus did too..that made me all the madder and wanting me to go back, just to do the same.. The following Sunday, I did go back, but before I could say or do anything, the Pastor asked who wanted to be baptized that day..my hand went up in the air..I was baptized in the Lake (Kingston) behind the church that as a little child, I would make fun and taunt the other children who went to that church.. The Pastor asked if I believed that Jesus died for my sins, I said No, but I want to..I said I knew that I was a sinner and I wanted to be a good Mom for my oldest daughter, whom I could not Love.. :( That was on August 28, 1978..I smoked a joint on the way home.. \"When I woke the next morning, I was quoting the Bible (I never read it before) I was so full of peace, Love, joy, kindness and gentleness, I could hardly contain the the Love that dwelt deep within my heart..the empty pit in my stomach was gone..a veil was lifted from my eyes..I was looking through different eyes..my vision was finally clear for the first time in my life..I felt clean, as white as snow..I was set free from drugs, greed, hatred, anger and swearing\".. \"My daughter came to see what was happening..I said to Sherry, I Love you..and for the first time in her sweet ten years of her little life, I meant it and I could feel within my soul..we both hugged each other and cried\".. :) I will never go back to hurting others, nor hatred, greed, lust, envy, strife and why should I for who the Son hath set Free, Is Free Indeed..Praise the Lord..Glory be to God in the Highest..
