	22219 : ["For a straight up mystery show, try Midsomer Murders.  It's the most straight-laced mystery thing you could ask for.  Poirot is in the same vein. Monk would a little lighter and more fun, balancing comedy with the Sherlock Holmes super-detective aesthetic.  Psych is along the same vein as Monk.   Veronica Mars has alot of detective aspects, but bends genres and gets into teen drama and comedy as well. Also, which Sherlock did you watch?  The modern Benedict Cumberbatch one or the classic Jeremy Britt one?  If you've seen one, try the other.  The modern one is much less faithful, transplanting the spirit of Sherlock into the modern world, but the Jeremy Britt one is incredibly faithful to the books. For the shows in the 2nd paragraph, you're looking for lighter sci-fi shows set in the modern world investigating the paranormal or super-science?   Supernatural does the paranormal.  Stargate SG-1 is older, but has some elements in common.  Magicians is something a friend of mine raves about, but I never got into.  Pushing Daisies and iZombie both have supernatural components yet bring your love for episodic murder mystery into play.  And I can't talk about a show centered around the supernatural without suggesting Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls are modern set and have supernatural aspects, but they aren't about good vs evil, so much as character dramedies.  I think Resident Alien might be interesting to you, it's airing on syfy now.", 3594, "3Cd8Iq5gaa", 1],
