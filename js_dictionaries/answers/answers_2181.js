	114830 : ["Hmm, you need the punishment to fit the crime but also need it to hit her where it hurts. Meaning take away something she loves.  I'd say she needs to WORK off the money she stole. This can be by helping mom with EXTRA chores. Her current chores still need to be done but extra work is added.  If it was one of my kids I'd get them to help me with chores. When they normally get to sit down and watch tv or play a video game they will join me and help me fold laundry, separate dirty clothes, pick up trash around the house, empty trash cans & so on. Just extra chores she normally doesn't help with.  Make sure the chore isn't fun. Some kids enjoy something like hand washing dishes. They get to \"play\" in soapy water. Or some kids enjoy washing the tub for the same reason.  Also she needs to lose her FUN time. Meaning for a day or 2 or even 3 or more what ever you think is needed she needs to be grounded from the computer, tv, video games or what ever she enjoys most.  Does she have an MP3 player, DVD player, radio or something fun in her room like that? Take that away too. I often walk to up to my kids room and I will just pick up without a word. When they complain I'll look at them and remind them of what they did wrong. This can cause tears in the younger two.  She needs to get the idea too that she has lost your trust. Trust is an important thing in our family.  What you need to do is make it a BIG DEAL that she stole. One time one of my kids took something from my room without askng. To make a point I followed them around the rest of the day (a few hours) and when I was looked at I just said \"Well, you took something from my room without asking. I just want to make sure it won't happen again.\"  lol the look I got back was funny but they go the point. So do something like that with your daughter. Follow her around the house for a bit. If she says she is going to the bathroom follow her to make sure. If she whines just tell her \"I'm sorry. I don't like this either. I'd rather sit and rest but honey you lost my trust when you stole from me. I'm worried it could happen again.\" Be honest with her. Let her know it HURT you deeply. My middle daughter who is now 9 use to have a huge problem with lying. It took a few long months but when she saw how much this hurt me and how it hurt her trust it stopped. Now if we even THINK she is lying she will cry and let us know it will never happen again.  Sorry so long. I hope this helps. The key is to let your child know this hurt the relationship between the two of you and it will take time to get this back.", 10398, "35b41910bfb06e071630bf7b9672e64daa", 4],

	114840 : ["Yes. Many gyms have this policy to avoid the possibility of novice climbers making mistakes while tying in (a leading causes of climbing injuries). This can also make things more efficient for the climbers since clipping in generally takes less time than tying in. I frequented a gym several years ago where this very subject was debated. The gym management said that you should clip the belay loop plus the upper part of the harness where the belay loop passes through. Their argument was that this provided redundancy. I argued that this cross-loaded the carabiner (applied forces to it from multiple directions - a bad thing) and that the belay loop is designed to take loads like this when being used to for its normal purpose. Well, a few months passed and the owners changed their policy. They had found, and actually posted at the gym, an article from a climbing magazine stating that attaching a top rope to just your belay loop with a locking carabiner was safe and that clipping other parts of the harness as well should be avoided. That all said, you and your partner should still have a safety check routine before each climb. Make sure that the climber's rope is attached properly through the belay loop and that the carabiner is properly loaded and is locked. Also be sure that the belayer's belay device is properly loaded and that its carabiner is locked and that both the climber's and belayer's harnesses are properly buckled. Enjoy and be safe.", 10402, "FdjFSyU6aa", 0],
	114841 : ["Yes, it is safe, though not ideal. See the following questions: Where do you attach the belay device, from which you will be catching a falling climber?  Where would you attach carabiners when clipping into an auto-belay? Where do you attach a rappel device? Where would you clip the biner on an alpine butterfly knot while climbing with 3 people?  All of the answers are to the belay loop. The belay loop is designed for clipping into carabiners. The dual tie in points (of most modern harnesses) are designed to attach directly to a rope. As I said before, having a biner between the rope and harness is not ideal for the following reasons: 1) Adds unnecessary complexity to the system. More complexity increases the possibility of something failing. 2) I assume they are using a fig-8 on a bight and clipping the biner into that. If they are alwys leave it tied in, the self sinching knot can break down the rope faster. Also the force of any falls will always be on the same point on the loop where the biner is clipped to. This is additional wear on a single point in the system.  3) If they use one biner, they should use 2. Gates opposite and opposed so as to avoid the posibility of the biner opening while climbing. This also distributes the force of the fall over a larger length of the loop mentioned in 2). I dont really see the pros for have a perminent knot tied into the rope and attaching with a biner. Climbers should know how to tie a knot. There is NO reason to not know the knot. I'm in the process of teaching my 3yr old right now. Note: he cant even tie his shoes yet but can tie a fig-8 follow through...  -Good luck", 10402, "2X65YXgLaa", 0],

That happened to my niece.  After her 1 yr old shot she got a terrible diaper rash. Your Doctor might tell you that \"that is not it\" but trust me it is very common.  There is so much junk in those things that some children have a reaction.  Very normal.  Make sure you pat dry his little rash area and make sure there is little moisture there. One way for everyone to avoid dry skin is to make sure the wet area gets dry right away.  If you can avoid using wipes right now that would help.  If you have to though get the sensitive wipes. But for now, I would avoid those. And when you bath him just use warm water, no soaps. Diaper rash is the number one sign to a food allergy.  My advice would be to take him to either his MD or a Natuopathic Doctor and get him an allergy test right away.  Take notice of what he has eaten when it flares up.  Could be dairy, gluten, sugar, certain fruits?  For example Strawberries have a high allergy rate.  His body is definitely trying to tell him something is not right.
