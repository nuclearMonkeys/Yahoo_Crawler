He is using that to try and convince us he is honest and would make a good president. I don't believe it for a minute. If he had had the guts to stand up to George Bush, I would respect him more.

	83317 : ["I think a lot of sane Americans don't think this is OK but totally disrespectful. Beck has never called the 43 other white presidents racist. That's why Beck took an unexpected week vacation and lost a lot of sponsors.  Beck is playing to base by saying our president hate white people. The base like this kind of stuff i.e. calling the president a muslim, Nazi, Hitler, an African Witch Doctor etc. etc.  They have no respect for Obama let alone the Oval Office. All they see is black. President Obama is biracial. He's half white and have white relatives who he loves.

	83318 : ["Yes, it's a real problem. I've seen good cases of good kids that would have made it in life, hadn't it been for peer pressure molding them into someone despicable. One girl confessed to me that, if it weren't for the pressure to conform (she had been going to the most snobbish schools in our country), she would have turned out someone completely different, and better, but being a certain way (nice, friendly, not caring about money) meant complete social suicide in those schools.

	83326 : ["INTJ Republican Rational Portrait of the Mastermind (INTJ) All Rationals are good at planning operations, but Masterminds are head and shoulders above all the rest in contingency planning. Complex operations involve many steps or stages, one following another in a necessary progression, and Masterminds are naturally able to grasp how each one leads to the next, and to prepare alternatives for difficulties that are likely to arise any step of the way. Trying to anticipate every contingency, Masterminds never set off on their current project without a Plan A firmly in mind, but they are always prepared to switch to Plan B or C or D if need be. Masterminds are rare, comprising no more than, say, one percent of the population, and they are rarely encountered outside their office, factory, school, or laboratory. Although they are highly capable leaders, Masterminds are not at all eager to take command, preferring to stay in the background until others demonstrate their inability to lead. Once they take charge, however, they are thoroughgoing pragmatists. Masterminds are certain that efficiency is indispensable in a well-run organization, and if they encounter inefficiency-any waste of human and material resources-they are quick to realign operations and reassign personnel. Masterminds do not feel bound by established rules and procedures, and traditional authority does not impress them, nor do slogans or catchwords. Only ideas that make sense to them are adopted; those that don't, aren't, no matter who thought of them. Remember, their aim is always maximum efficiency. In their careers, Masterminds usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees. Problem-solving is highly stimulating to Masterminds, who love responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out. Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past. Masterminds tend to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals, having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research. Masterminds are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked against reality. Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Ulysses S. Grant, Frideriche Nietsche, Niels Bohr, Peter the Great, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, Lise Meitner, Ayn Rand and Sir Isaac Newton are examples of Rational Masterminds.", 9133, "d7570355e6c141f9b4bc359d2fb03aa1aa", -2],

	83341 : ["I don't see how you can be a Bible-believing Christian and reject Christ's teaching, reiterated over and over in John 6: Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.  I am the bread of life. Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.  I am the living bread that came down from heaven.  If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.  For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.  Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.  This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" Bible-rejecting Protestants don't believe Jesus today, just as  \"from this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.\" A caution:  Those who don't believe Jesus should NOT eat the body of Christ.  Paul explains in 1 Cor 11: Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.\" Cheers, Bruce", 9127, "Sn0CViR7aa", 10],

	83345 : ["I don't think this is true.  I think if it was, Obama woun't have become the frontrunner a month ago.  America is a lot more progressive than you give us credit for. Obama has already mathematically secured the nomination.  Power brokers like Pelosi won't let the SD's overrule the pledged delegate and popular count and Clinton won't catch him in either as reps in Florida keep rejecting every preposal for a redo.  Florida is Hillary's best state and it won't be counted if the local yokels keep angling to have the non-contested results count.  Hillary probably won't even win Michigan, and there frankly aren't enough states remaining to give Hillary the gains she needs to give SDs the cover they need to give her the nomination --- assuming they want to do that (very big assumption). Obama will win the nomination and then it is him against McCain.  McCain is not the mud thrower Hillary is, so his campaign will slowly regain some of the ground Hillary's camp has eroded from under the DEM party, Obama, and it's congressional candidates. I like McCain, but he is starting to have some high profile gaffes that could really start to appear to be the onset of Alzheimers.  He really needs to cross his \"t\"s before he says anything in the future to remain viable.  He doesn't have Reagan's charm and his VP likely won't either.", 9129, "3N1jZdsNaa", 0],
