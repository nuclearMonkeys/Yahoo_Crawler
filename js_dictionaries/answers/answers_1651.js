Once he doesnt have that anymore, give it time, and he will grow. Seriously.........a book? First he'd have to read it........ya think that will happen? He's had it to easy..... I'm sorry if I am being harsh,  But let me tell ya something..... My son is 22, in prison for 3 years.   Wouldnt go to school, hung out with the wrong crowd, and fell deeper and deeper into a mess. It all started when he was 15....... I kept saving him....... Why? Because I love him so much!  SO SO much. Now first of all he was just skipping school, but it progressed into skipping school and hanging with the bad crowd, then the drugs, then the getting arrested (Juvenile hall) I kept saving him. After a couple years of that.........he finally got a job.......got a paycheck and blew it......blew it so badly that at 19 years old and on probation, he was caught at a party and was under the influence of drugs and alcohol.  Before they actually caught him at this party, he ran..........and ran and ran up the street until they knocked him down flat on his face........... Sad day.....very very sad. Because he was on probation, and because he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, and because he ran.......... It all added up.........it added up to 3 years........Prison....... PRISON.........not my baby?       MY BABY I could no longer save him. Then I realized how much I felt at fault. My fault? I think so. Because I kept saving him from the fall he should have had a long long long time ago. Now it was to late.   3 years have passed by, and in October he gets out. I have no idea what I am going to do....... NO IDEA except  I wont take him in, and I wont help him. I wont  NOT ANYMORE EVER. He needs to be a MAN! A GOOD MAN. I will always love him with all of my heart and soul......all of my HEART AND SOUL", 9290, "B8Af2SAgaa", 1],
