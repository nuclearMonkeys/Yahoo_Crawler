You are still very young and will eventually find someone to make a life with and you can still have children by adoption. The first thing you need to do is call a local crisis center so they can hook you up with the help you need and deserve. Tell you aunt how you are feeling and let her help you get some help asap.

Perhaps you've missed all those reports coming from our \"Axis of Evil\" of them wishing to open serious dialogue with the U.S.  I have not.  They're being ignored, it's as if we want a terrorist war and nuclear arms scares. -The United States has covertly run assassination operations and prisons the world over for decades.  Most of South America's worst and bloodiest regimes were backed, trained, and funded by American interests.  We've killed hundreds of thousands on that continent alone.  Death camps and torture facilities are nothing new, we've had them for years to \"ensure democracy\".

There are only two numbers retired in the big four american sports, 99 in the NHL and 42 in the MLB.  99 was retired because Gretzky was the all time leader in points, goals and assists and all of them are by a huge margin.  Jackie Robinson was maybe the most important sports figure of the 20th century by braking the color barrier and was an inspiration to millions.  Jordan really doesn't have anything like that.
