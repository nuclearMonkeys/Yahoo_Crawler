	55578 : ["I think you only need to see the way that space and astronomy is presented to the public these days in order to understand why the public has lost interest. Back in the days of the Apollo program, space was presented as an inspiration and filled us with awe. These days it is just presented as silliness that seems to be aimed at twelve year olds. The awe factor has been kicked out of space, and in the public view it has now been reduced to an innane \"search for habitability\", as if nothing else matters. It now appears as nothing better than material for elementary grade school projects. Then we have twerps launching cars into space. Cars ffs. Mundane consumer merchandise! We used to turn to astronomy and space to get away from the innane trappings of suburban life. Honestly it has just become too embarrassing to be associated with it. People have moved on. Who would blame them? Perhaps if organizations such as the IAU and nasa pulled their heads out and stopped treating the public like idiots, space could regain it's former respect.", 7721, "bXMPytYEaa", 1],

I have no doubt that to be an amateur astronomer you do not have to be a good physicist. However, to be a professional you need a lot of physics. To a lesser extent you need some chemistry.

	55597 : ["Moon (big M) is the official name, in English, for Earth's natural satellite. It has official names in other languages, including Luna in Latin and Selene in Greek. Used as a simile (moon with a small m), it is used for any object that behaves, in some way, like our Moon. The word \"moon\" used to mean anything in orbit around a planet (including \"artificial moons\" - like Sputnik) but it is now restricted to natural satellites that are thought to have formed in a natural process around their planet (as opposed to a captured satellite). The word Moon comes from the same root as \"month\", which is the time period defined by the Moon going through its phases.  Seven ... seventh Moon ... month same idea. It is only in the USA that people were forced (by an astronomy magazine) to write the word moon with a small m, even when it refered to our Moon. The rest of the world has no problem accepting that Moon is the official name of the Moon, in English. In the same manner, Sun (big S) is the official name of the star we orbit. We can use the simile \"sun\" (small s) to describe other stars that have planets around them (although we now tend to talk about exoplanets = planets outside our Solar system) The Latin name for our Sun is Sol. From that, we get the adjective Solar (with or without a capital s) which refers to OUR Sun.  The Solar system is the system of planets around our Sun. Other stars can have planetery systems (or systems of planet). Our Galaxy (big G) was long thought to be the only one. Hence it did not need another name. The Milky Way was the name of a band of light (made from the light of millions of stars located in the two nearest parts of the arms of our Galaxy. It is a much older name... and means roughly the same as the word \"galaxy\" (from the Greek word for \"milk\"). Thus, the name Milky Way (by itself) is meant for that feature. Calling our Galaxy \"the Milky Way galaxy\" is OK, since it is the galaxy that contains the Milky Way.", 7741, "524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa", -1],

	55621 : ["No, I am most firmly against it and for a number of reasons. First, I do not think that we humans should colonise another planet and cause damage to another planet as we have to our home planet. Secondly, there is no planet that we know where humans could exist as they do on Earth. Therefore, an artificial environment would have to be created. This would be at very great expense. Another consideration is that we can stop polluting and damaging the Earth. We could take steps to repair and reverse that damage. That could be done at less cost than sending people to ruin another planet. Because of the great costs involved only a small number of people who were considered important enough to go to another planet or who were wealthy enough would be the ones to go. Most of us will be left behind to take our chance. I do no think I would go even if I had the opportunity. Today there is snow where I live and the fields behind my house look absolutely splendid. I would much rather stand in one of those fields and gulp in a lungful of cold air than live in some artificial environment. Nothing could be better than the natural beauty of this planet. I hope we do not go and spoil another planet. I think on this occasion Hawkings was very wrong.
