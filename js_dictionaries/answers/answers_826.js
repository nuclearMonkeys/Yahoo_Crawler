Scientists are at last telling us that rearing animals for meat is the single most destructive activity for the Earth by far! Not that we needed telling. The rainforests of Asia and South America are being decimated in order to grow soya, etc. to feed cattle and chickens, which  is incredibly inefficient conversion to \"food\" if nothing else! It's what the Sahara once was. Evolution is slow. Meat is a luxury, not a necessity. I haven't eaten meat for forty years of more. A dear friend of mine never are meat in her life.

Leo Tolstoy had said that \"veganism is not a lifestyle style, it is mindset \" Unfortunately, vegans who do not grow spiritually, often end up being very angry, cruel towards others. It's very difficult for them to accept and love people in general for who they are. While their  hearts are crying to save animals, they are also very closed. I'm not saying, they should all follow Jesus example. Just take these things into consideration. ", 6570, "lAGatG40aa", 0],

However the ability to follow a strict vegetarian/vegan diet long term for some, has only been around for just a little over sixty years. So there's not enough evidence to establish anything in the way that can be considered as solid evidence. Besides there are other cofactors involved that goes well beyond any reasonably healthy diet.

Personally I do eat a few eggs, but never buy any eggs that not free range. I also use a little local honey: no doubt some vegans will explain why they don't.  I stopped eating animals over forty years ago, and now scientists are telling us that rearing animals for food is the single most damaging activity for our planet.

	45920 : ["There are different reasons for people being vegan: Religion, care for animals, and health. So once someone decides to be a vegan they follow all the rules even if they don't have to otherwise they can't tell everyone they're a vegan all the time. Many don't avoid eating meat because they care for the animals, in some religions they won't eat pork, but it's not because they care about pigs, they'd feel defiled if they ate pork. Chickens suffer when they are packed into overcrowded sheds, never seeing the light of day. Bees for farming, including honey, is quite controversial with vegans. Because of the large number of bees used in industry they are crowded together in hives and millions die because of poor treatment farm scale bee use entails.

	45921 : ["Veganism, so far as diet goes, is simply not consuming any kind of animal products. There is no motive implied. A person might decide to be vegan because they don't enjoy consuming those things and/or can't consume them without ill effects, because they don't like the idea of eating parts of dead animals or something that comes out of an animal, because they think a vegan diet is healthier or because they come from a vegan background. Some people, of course, become vegan because they are against animals being “exploited”. They don't believe that animals are ours to use as we want. They think t is wrong to do this, unnecessary, and want no part of it. A person is either “vegan” or they are not: they can't pick and choose! If you think that chickens farmed for eggs do not suffer in any way, then you are mistaken. Chickens, in general, are one of the most badly treated animals that are farmed.

Those who eat vegetarian generally pay more attention to WHAT they eat. And whether or not we choose to get our protein from meat or from other sources, HALF of every meal SHOULD be vegetables (we are not talking about corn or potatoes here, since those two vegetables are mostly just starch). The problem is that many meat eaters do NOT eat as many vegetables as they should.  So they are not going to be as healthy as those who pay attention to what they put on their plate.
