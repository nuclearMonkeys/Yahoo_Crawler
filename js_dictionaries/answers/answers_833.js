	46261 : ["Losing 100 pounds in less than 10 months is usually not a good idea.  However, you did not ask about that, so I will refrain from saying more on that issue. The way to eat vegan is to think about protein.  You will have only a few protein sources to work with, and you really need to have protein everyday.  It is best, in fact, to have protein in at least two meals a day.  Sources of protein vegans can eat include nuts (which tend to be fairly expensive other than peanuts), beans, tofu, hummus, and tempeh.  Some of these sources need to be balanced with rice or corn in order to provide a fair amount of protein. So, assuming you are going to eat three meals a day, you might decide not to worry about protein for breakfast.  For lunch and dinner, simply choose your protein, and then some side veggies.  It could be you'll eat a meal of beans and rice with a side dish of broccoli.  It could be you'll eat noodles with a peanut sauce (including chunks of peanut) with a mix of spinach and kale.  It could be you'll eat beans wrapped in corn tortillas with a small salad.  As long as you have some protein with every lunch and every dinner, and as long as you eat enough veggies, you'll be okay.   And what about dessert, you ask?  A nice pear or banana or slice of cantaloupe would work perfectly.  Most fruit is naturally sweet, and they are healthy, too. Both rice and beans are easy to cook.  And, like a lot of other sources of protein, you can cook enough for four or five or more days, and then freeze them in one serving sizes, so you don't have to cook every day.  All you have to do is pop them in the microwave, make your side veggie, and you've got a healthy and hot meal. Hope this helps!", 6587, "rPdBoondaa", 3],

	46292 : ["The issue regarding old light guns & LCD screens is HOW the guns worked.  They utilized the PRECISE TIMING of the analog TV's refresh rate (29.97 Hz for NTSC, 25.0 Hz for PAL) & the interlaced means of rendering the screen & the use of a single (sometimes 2) \"hit detection\" frame(s) with each pull of the trigger to register a hit or a miss. With LCD TV's, refresh rates are generally higher for digital signals (60 Hz base for ATSC in the US, 50 Hz for DVB-T in Europe), but there's post processing as well as progressive rendering (rendering each frame in one go instead of taking 2 pass with just half the frame with interlaced).  These changes messed up that precision timing the games are expecting as digital TV's do not have a consistent rendering speed. With that said, there's some options out there without modifying the game.  Hyperkin has the Hyper Blaster HD (   ) which includes their own light gun & an game adapter to use with a top-loading NES console.  The adapter intercepts the necessary game code triggers to accommodate for the I/O lag. Other options include adding an adapter to the cartridge to outright modding the games in question to accommodate the change in display technology.  These aren't perfect, but it's what's available.", 6606, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 1],
