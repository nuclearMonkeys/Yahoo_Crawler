The DX-coding is for ISO3200, and Kodak advise that it has a suggested speed range of ISO1600 to ISO25000.

	49869 : ["You need to decrease the exposure.  Cameras will get fooled by the black area around the tiny Moon.  A camera's meter works by taking a reading of the light reflecting back from the subject.  It then comes up with an exposure to render that light level as a middle gray tone.  Since your phone is basically looking at a scene that is 95% pure black, the entire image is going to be way overexposed if you do not do anything. Next to our Sun, the Moon is the brightest object in the night sky.  On the Moon it is daytime, so your exposure used for the Moon should be equivalent to what you'd use to photograph something here on Earth in daylight. To solve this problem, you must be able to lower the exposure of the image.  You can do this by lowering the ISO, increasing the shutter speed, decreasing the aperture or some combination of all three.  Most phones don't have separate controls for the shutter, aperture and/or ISO. Most phones don't even have a variable aperture.  Therefore, you will likely need to use your phone's exposure compensation.  Set it to something like -3 or lower if needed.  If that still does not work, then placing a dark filter like a pair of sunglasses, an ND filter or polarizer over the lens will cut down the amount of light.", 7014, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],

Canon does make some (keyword: some) good cameras for video, but these are their top-end models like the 5D Mark IV or the R5 which out of your price range just for the body.  And that's really key here.  You will end up spending your entire budget on a camera body, and you will still need a lens.  Or, you can spend $1,000 or less and get a camcorder that is superior to any DSLR or mirrorless camera ever made. Camcorders don't overheat.  You can record for as long as you want.  They have very fast f/1.8 lenses with great zooms.  They have excellent image stabilization.  They almost always have external mic/headphone jacks.

You don't have to worry about the cops, as long as you have proof of valid insurance.  Cops only verify that the vehicle has valid insurance, nothing more.  They don't know or care about listed drivers on the policy, because that stuff isn't their job.  You'll only be in trouble with the cops if you can't prove the vehicle has valid insurance. The trouble comes when an accident happens.  That's because the truth always, always comes out after an accident happens, and insurance companies all have an effective way of dealing with untruthful customers.  It's called the misrepresentation / non-disclosure clause, and it's printed in every insurance contract everywhere.  Misrepresentation is the legal term for lying, non-disclosure is the legal term for lying by omission (failure to tell the truth), and either one is a total deal-breaker.  When insurance companies suspect misrepresentation or non-disclosure, they cancel the whole contract and declare all coverage null and void.  That means they don't have to pay for anything.  And they'll get away with it, because the misrepresentation clause is in the contract. That leaves your parents paying for all the damage out of their pockets, and it leaves them without any valid insurance on their vehicle(s).  With a cancellation for non-disclosure on their record, the only place they can get insurance for the next few years is the high risk market (insurance hell).  And with a name like high risk market, you can guess what kind of prices they charge.  There's only only one way for your parents to get out of this mess, and you're not going to like it.  They have to have you charged with stealing their vehicle, and they'll be required to testify against you in court.  ", 7021, "M0akEw8Vaa", 1],

The reason that makes manual mode the best for me is that I never have to worry about my camera's meter being fooled by a very bright/dark element within the scene.  As I move around, there could be something in the scene like a bright reflection of the Sun that will dramatically change the exposure.  In manual mode I never have to worry about that happening.  Furthermore, I know that my photos will have the same look (the same depth of field) since the f/stop used is the same for all the images.", 7010, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],

A mobile phone can not receive anything other than WiFi or cellular frequencies, and those only with the correct data formats. Unless someone is daft enough to use a WiFi connected camera - which could be picked up by anything with WiFi - a phone is useless as a bug or camera detector. Adding apps/software cannot change the physical capabilities of the phone. You can buy specialist \"bug detectors\", effectively a wide band spectrum analyzer, that can pick up radio signals from wireless bugs. One of those would also pick up a wireless video bug. However, any \"detector\" can only pick up a radio signal, so a bug or camera that recorded internally (eg. to an SD card) would not be detected. The chances of anyone bugging someone else house are next to zero. Unless they had regular access to be able to swap batteries every day or two, a video bug would also need to be mains powered - it could only be fitted in to something that has a permanent power connection, so it did not need regular battery changes.
