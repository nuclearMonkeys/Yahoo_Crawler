	35538 : ["First you can't put someone in jail just for being raciest.  A person has to commit a crime to be sentenced to jail/prison time.   Ali always insulted his opponents to build up the fights and thus draw more money.  But even he admitted he took it way to far for Fraiser 3.  But I am not sure if it was meant as a raciest thing.  I thing he was calling Joe dumb and Gorilla rhymed with Manilla.  He always had to make a silly rhyme.  Having said that, he also called Joe an Uncle Tom.  I think that is like saying Joe was a sell out to the white man.  Joe was a very good and decent man who just wanted to let his fist talk.  He wanted to support his family and did not care for all the hype.  That was his personality.  He also helped Ali financially during Ali's exile.  Joe was an awesome man like that. Ali made a living with his mouth.  Of course he usually backed up his talk in the ring, but he always hyped the fights up.  Keep in mind boxing had never seen the kind of money that it experienced with Ali.  Part of the reason we see multiple million dollar fights today is Ali.. He was a gifted promoter. I think if anything, Ali had some resentment against whites.  It was the 60's and 70's and that is understandable.  I don't think he hated all white people, but he hated the system at the time.  In many ways he was a head of his time.   But back to Frazier.  I think Joe never forgave Ali for the insults he received and to his dieing day took Joe in all the left hooks he landed on Ali's right jaw. Some of them were brutal.  I think their 3rd fight may have been the most brutal sporting event ever.  The temperature in the ring was over a hundred degrees with a very high humidity.  I heard some fans in the arena passed out from the heat.  Combine that with someone punching you constantly and it is deadly.  Perhaps the miracle is that they both lived.  ALI said it was the closest thing to death he had experienced.   After the fight reporters came to Ali's dressing room and he refused to answer any questions until someone would go to Joe's dressing room and apologize on his behalf to Joe's son for the mean things he said about his dad.  I suppose Ali would have walked over himself, but I doubt he had the energy at that point.  He was completely spent,  after the fight was stopped collapsed in the ring.   But he did apologize many times to Joe.  He had so much respect for Joe.  He often said Joe was the second greatest heavyweight of all time.  But I do agree he took it way to far with the insults leading up to Manilla. He admitted that much himself.  But if you anyone else has not watched that fight please do and keep in mind how the heat was possibly a bigger threat than the opponent that day.  Joe begged Eddie Futch to let him come out for round 15.  Joe's eyes were basically closed by this point and he took a beating in round 14.  Joe begged for Eddie to let him have that one more round.  Eddie said it's over but, \"no one will ever forget what you did here today\".  At, least among fight fans, Eddie's word were true.", 5350, "v6rD4P7vaa", 0],
	35539 : ["I think it's quite an even match up but I think Fury will probably have a bit too much for Joshua. I could see Fury stopping Joshua around about round 8 or 9.

	35541 : ["A lot depends on what kind of \"confidence\" you want to build and how much effort you're willing to put into each. If you're image conscious, weightlifting can give you a good physique...but it takes a good amount of effort, discipline and willpower to get there and maintain it.  If you're socially shy or fear conflict, boxing can definitely address that, but again you have to be willing to put in the time. The 'catch' here, of course, is that you have to some measure of confidence in yourself beforehand to stick with the rigors of each.  That's where good training and peer support comes in. Therefore, I think it's more important to find something challenging that you will also enjoy and get yourself a good trainer that knows how to support and push you.", 5342, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", 1],

	35550 : ["The towel came in from his corner because the assistant coach went over the head of the head trainer thinking that he had seen enough.  He should have been fired immediately, he didn't have the right to make the call as the assistant.  The head trainer and Wilder himself were livid and I understand why, he shouldn't have been pulled out when he was. When Wilder asked the ref what he was doing stopping it, he pointed to the towel but I'm not sure he knew the towel had come in at that point, he certainly didn't see it for himself as it came in behind him but there was someone from the commission trying to make the ref aware that it had come in but I can't tell if he understood him or not. One thing for sure is his own corner waved it off, the referee may also be guilty of doing the same independently of what the corner did but I can't be sure. ", 5335, "psOmJErtaa", -1],
