In science, the closest thing to \"human-like\" is the term \"anthropoid.\"  Generally speaking, it refers to all tailless apes.  Most species in that category are not human ancestors.  The term \"all human ancestors\" includes all kinds of species that aren't even primates, much less resemble modern humans.  Even most human ancestors that were primates don't resemble us any more than any other non-ape primates today.  And you seem to be specifically excluding other modern Great Apes. Given what your definition seems to refer to (all previous species of the genus H o m o) there really aren't any genetic traits they possessed that no other species did.   The only trait modern humans possess that no other land animals do is the capacity for symbolic language.  Cetaceans appear to have the capacity, as may some other species.  And several human ancestors (but not all) also possessed it. While intelligence appears to be a genetic trait, language is not.  It's more of a cultural development.

	6920 : ["We do not know if Neanderthals had more body hair than Homo erectus or not because hair is rarely preserved. We do know that Neanderthals lived in a cold climate, just like Europeans and North Asians. Both Europeans and North Asians evolved more body and facial hair as adaptations to cold climates, since hair insulates the body and face. Europeans and North Asians also have other, similar adaptations to cold climates, such as shorter arms and legs, rounded torso, taller and narrower nose bridges, light skin, thinner lips, and straight hair. These adaptations help conserve heat, although light skin is adaptation to absorb more vitamin D because of reduced exposure to the sun by wearing clothes, not a direct adaptation to a cold climate. We do notice however that Neanderthals have wide noses, even though they also have short arms and legs, and a rounded torso. So, Neanderthals have some of the same adaptations seen in cold adapted humans but not all of them. Therefore we cannot simply assume that Neanderthals also evolved more facial and body hair. Modern humans with abundant facial and body hair have high levels of DHT or Di-Hydro-Testosterone, a male hormone. DHT stimulates hair growth, but prolonged exposure to high levels of DHT can cause premature baldness and also fertility problems for women who have excess body hair. European women with excess body hair have a 10% chance of being infertile, compared to the 2.5% infertility rate among African women. 25% of male Americans, most of them Caucasian, have premature baldness. If Neanderthals did evolve more facial and body hair, then it is almost certainly an adaptation to a cold climate. If they did not, then it is also not surprising since they did not evolve a tall and narrow nose bridge.  Many Neanderthal reconstructions depict them with lots of facial hair. This is probably a safe assumption since it has happened independently in modern humans at least twice as adaptations to cold climates, but it is nevertheless an assumption, not based on actual available data. H. erectus also migrated to Eurasia. Neanderthals evolved from H. erectus in Europe. Peking man is a fossil of H. erectus. So, if Neanderthals evolved lots of body and facial hair, then there is also a chance that H. erectus that occupied cold regions may have evolved the same. ", 1123, "None", -1],

	6931 : ["Where to even begin with this ridiculousness... Firstly, human beings make for a very inefficient food source. The average human being yields less than 3 kilograms of meat. The average carcass weight of a slaughtered cow is 350 kilograms. While not all of that is meat, it's clear that domesticated animals yield much more meat than human beings can, making them a much more efficient food source.  Secondly, human beings are intelligent animals. One cannot simply put a human being behind a simple fence and expect that the human being will still be there the following morning. Human beings are capable of communicating with one another and are thus capable of devising and executing complex plans, making them difficult to keep. To go a step further, human beings mature at a much slower rate than other domesticable animals. While a fully matured adult male human might yield 3 kilograms of meat, females and young humans will yield much less, yet humans cannot mature without existing on a varied diet that would require the person raising that human to expend an incredible amount of food over the course of decades to be able to extract even a modest amount of meat. It's completely inefficient.  Think about the moral objections people have across the world when it comes to eating certain living things. Many people in Western countries are horrified and disgusted by the thought of eating what people in other societies eat on a regular basis. We have been conditioned to think of cats and dogs as pets, yet they are consumed in some societies where the people cannot fathom why people would be so turned off by the idea.  Lastly, even in those societies where cannibalism was not completely taboo, it has mostly been reserved for ritualistic or ceremonial purposes or only practiced during lean times when other food sources weren't available. In some societies, prisoners of war could be eaten, but people belonging to one's own tribe or to tribes aligned with one's own were off the table, so to speak. Most human beings wouldn't be able to deal with the psychological effects of consuming human flesh. Most people who had no choice but to resort to cannibalism in survival situations suffer from severe psychological trauma for the rest of their lives afterwards.  ", 1120, "None", 0],

The closest living relative of modern humans is the chimpanzee. The next closest relative is the gorilla and the orangutan is our next closest relative after the gorilla. Fossils that are intermediate between apes and humans are called ape-men or australopithecines (southern apes). They have ape-like skulls, with small brains, protruding jawlines and heavy brow ridges, but they walk on 2 legs. Our immediate ancestor is Homo erectus, and it is very similar to us except for heavy brow ridges, a slightly smaller brain and a protruding jaw line. Homo erectus is also the ancestor of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are not the same species as modern humans.  Because of all these fossil evidence plus DNA evidence, almost all scientists agree that we descended from an ape that was a close relative of the chimpanzee. That same ape may have been the ancestor of the chimp also Since the chimpanzee is relatively small, it does not have to walk on its knuckles. The orangutan is larger and it does not walk on its knuckles. Therefore it probably means that the ancestor of both the chimp and us were larger than the chimp, but probably slightly smaller than the gorilla. That means a large ape about the size of the gorilla but probably slightly smaller is the common ancestor of chimps and gorillas, and an ape that is smaller than the gorilla but larger than the chimp is the common ancestor of australopithecines and the chimp. Humans in turn descended from a species of australopithecine. The most famous australopithecine is called Lucy. It lived in Africa abut 4.2 million years ago.
