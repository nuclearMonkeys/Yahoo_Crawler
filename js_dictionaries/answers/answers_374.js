The Underground station for Kings Cross is called Kings Cross St Pancras. (This is because Kings Cross and St Pancras main line stations are next door to each other). The bit that can sound confusing at first is that trains of three 'lines' all go along that same track. Trains called 'Circle Line', 'Hammersmith and City Line' and 'Metropolitan Line' trains all go from Liverpool Street to Kings Cross St Pancras by the same route.  (The routes of each  'Line' divide after Kings Cross). At Liverpool Street, look out for signs for the Underground, then for signs for Circle Line and for Kings Cross. Once you are on the correct platform, every train from there will go to Kings Cross, passing through three stations on the way. Once you get to Kings Cross St Pancras, just follow signs for the way out to Kings Cross main station. The only way you can go wrong in this is at Liverpool Street, by getting on a train going in the wrong direction. As well as making sure you are on the Circle Line platform, check that it is the platform for trains going towards Kings Cross. There are lots of signs up confirming which trains go from each platform.

	20260 : ["I think the primary reason is how developed the city was. Chicago had a fire in 1871 and was rebuilt in a large portion. This allowed and encouraged a cheaper (as well as quicker) way to build a mass transit system. The \"L\" was started in 1892 and steam locomotives were used, coal fired locomotives make operation in subways very unhealthy. The \"subway system\" started operation in 1904 and was a replacement for the street car system. The object was to remove the mass transit system to where it did not interfere with street traffic. By this time electrified motive power and of course electricity to be developed to a point it was feasible. Keep in mind the supporting structure for the track would take away space at street level. Having been on the subway system of NYC, I can tell you much of it is elevated. But in the areas which have been developed for a long time it is underground because there just isn't room for everything at street level. There is also by the way a large rail system for freight underground and tunnels that are used for utilities including steam lines that are  used to provide heat to other buildings. It would be interesting some time to study more of what is underground in NYC and see how much takes place below ground that very few even knows happens.", 3330, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 0],

	20262 : ["I'm surprised that the airport would be cheaper than a local rental location. I've found that airport based car rentals often include lots of extra fees which makes the airport rental the more expensive option. Start by searching for airport shuttles. Most commercial airports have shuttle buses available from all the surrounding areas. You might be able to get there for $20 or less if you're willing to go at the time that the shuttle leaves. Also consider posting in local social groups like nextdoor or local groups on FB. Offer $20 in gas money to anyone who happens to be going that direction and is willing to let you ride along. If that doesn't work see if you can get a one-way rental from that local place. Their rates might be higher but it could be cheaper than a taxi.
