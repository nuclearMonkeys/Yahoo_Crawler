	101524 : ["You obviously are still playing as if you are the wounded child of yesterday, and are constantly reliving the experience whenever you talk or visit her. This isn't about your Brother and that should not be an issue because your Mother has set the tone for that relationship and he has played it to the hilt. You are an adult now and you have the power to decide what is acceptable behavior for you to accept and what is not. So when your Mother uses racial epitaphs and it makes you uncomfortable, you should just say to her can we talk about something else, I don't like where this conversation is going, and end it. The next time she asks for money you need to tell her that you have expenses too and that giving her money is not something that is in your budget to do. You should remind her also she has things and goes places that should allow her to make sacrifices to balance out whether she buys groceries or goes to the play and feeds the dogs instead of her and her husband. I think she counted on your Bother to be her meal ticket by allowing him to live on easy street, but in the end you got the better life lesson, by having to work when you were only 14. You have incredible power here and the potential to take your life back for yourself. Your Mother is counting on you to be the Parent and take care of her when she did not do for you when you were growing up, and that her feeling of entitlement is not deserved at all. This is not an oppotunity for revenge by no means at all, it is a time for you to embrace that child \"yourself\" and take care of her and not allow her to be bullied into feeling guilty over her own ability to survive and find peace and happiness. It sounds like your Mom had to children to worship her and forced into slave labor, instead of loving and nuturing those wonderful gifts into responsible adults, that do not \"owe her\" anything. I guess in the end it is all about finding peace taking the High Road an living with the ability to Love from a distance the people who have unintentionally alienated you from their world. Forgiveness is powerful and it allows you to reclaim the power you once thought lost. It does not mean you have to give your energy to ridiculous requests and abusive behavior, it is the power to reclaim your ability to find happiness and set new boundaries of things you will or won't allow to be done to you. I feel terrible for your Brother because it sounds as if he is walking around with a chip on his shoulder that would make Hercules slump forward. He was the one that lived with the idea that he was to be treated like royality and have a sense of entitlement instilled into his every waking thought or request for preferential treatment. I would almost hate to be the person who has to live with him. You can decide anything you want to do, it is your choice now and nobody should make it for you. You just need to turn 180 degres out of phase and tell people what YOU want and what is acceptable behavior for you to tolerate.

	101528 : ["Long before choosing Abraham, God had a relationship with Adam and Eve ; at that time no religion was needed because a constant state of communion existed between God and our first parents ; they were like the angels, constantly in the presence of God ; their experience of God made any Revelation unnecessary as they saw and knew God personally... And then they sinned and were separated from God. From that point on, what was known of God became an oral tradition that was passed on from generation to generation. In the bloodline of Seth, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and eventually Joseph, that tradition was maintained with enough faithfulness that Judaism could emerge ; it was God's Grace, no doubt, but these were faithful people... The rest of the world had been deceived by satan to worship elementals in nature... Favoritism ?... may be ; yet they did their part ; or at least they tried, and God rewarded their efforts ; the rest of the world, they we enslaved by satan ; they no longer had the freedom to choose God ; it took the Blood of Christ to restore that very freedom that we so misuse and take for granted.", 9786, "0z8XHKxuaa", 0],
