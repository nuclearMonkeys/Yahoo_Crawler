Unfortunately our society is rotten with ENTITLEMENT and LAZINESS, especially in relationships. These are the greatest enemies of satisfaction and happiness.

	81229 : ["Yes, there are ways of getting around school blocks. However, have you completely thought out the consequences should you get caught?  Each school district, and state/country laws are different. Are you aware whether or not doing so is considered vandalism or breaking and entering? It is in my area. Kids who get caught not only face suspension/expulsion, but time in a juvenile facility and probation for up to three years. I know school systems are making \"examples\" of kids who break the rules and have come down rather harshly to make a point to the rest of the students. They want to get the kids thinking about whether or not it is \"worth it\" if they are caught.  Plus, kids fail to take into account that the schools IT department has technology which monitors internet activity. Kids tend to think they are more clever than adults, and sometimes they are, but still, it is easy to locate a breach in security these days and locate the kid who breached the security blocks.  It is also normal for youth to believe bad things happen, of course they do, it is on the news all the time, but they always believe bad things only happen to \"other\" kids, never them. Each and every kid who has had something bad happen in his/her life once believed that very thing, that it only happens to others, not them. That is normal, kids just don't think that way.  It is normal for kids to try to get by with what they can. It is a part of growing up. It is also a part of life to make mistakes. We learn from mistakes. It is just that some people can look around and learn from the mistakes of  others, while some have to experience those mistakes on their own. I know I was one of the kids who had to experience it myself, I seldom looked around and learned from others mistakes. lol  I do now, learn from mistakes others make, that is, rather than having to be the one making the mistake. lol   It is up to you. Is is \"worth it\" if you get caught? Do you even know what all the consequences could be in your area? Are you aware if any laws have been created which makes it not only a school issue, but a legal issue too? What are the possible consequences for a first offense, a second offense, a third? Is your school making examples of students, and/or have a zero tolerance level? Find out what the consequences may be, and then decide if you wish to attempt bypassing blocks or cracking past your schools IT security.  Have you considered how being expelled from your school may affect your present life and your future life?  It is up to you, and I really do wish you the best.
