	49199 : ["It does not matter. Why? Because no lens can resolve enough lines per mm to take advantage of the megapixel count of APS-C cameras being sold currently.  So, when megapixel count is increased, sharpness of the photo does not increase. Instead the increase in megapixel count is done at the expense of pixel size. The smaller pixel means higher signal to noise ratio, because noise level is pretty much fixed, and the smaller pixel means less light energy is captured. That means the electrical signal that will result will be lower in amplitude. Less signal and the same noise level means a higher signal to noise ratio.  That means the picture will look grainier, not sharper. To reduce the noise, the software inside the camera may use noise reduction algorithms. That means to make the picture look cleaner, the noise and some of the signal will be erased and the picture may actually be less sharp.  That in turn means that if a person wants a sharper picture by having more megapixels, it is necessary to buy a camera with a larger sensor, such as full frame or even medium format. Of course not all people like full frame cameras. They think that full frame cameras are bigger and heavier (false) that full frame camera lenses are bigger and heavier (false) and that full frame cameras require sharper lenses than APS-C cameras (false). For these people, their idea of upgrading is to buy another APS-C camera with more megapixels every few years. Because there are so many of these people in the consumer market, camera makers will gladly give them what they want, and keep selling APS-C models with more and more pixels. These cameras aren't cheap either even though the APS-C sensor is dirt cheap to make. Many of them are close to the price of entry level full frame models. As some people said, there is a sucker born every minute, and many of these suckers buy APS-C cameras with lots of megapixels. ", 6917, "None", 1],

	49203 : ["I don't know English law, so it's difficult for me to provide any meaningful answers.  I can so, however, that I ran into a similar problem here in the USA.  I had a video card fail.  I got an RMA and sent it into EVGA for warranty repair/replacement.  I eventually got an email from EVGA's service dept. stating that they would honor their warranty because one of the accessory plugs was bent.  They provided photos showing an ever so slight bent in the card.  I informed them that this port had never been used and, more importantly, the failure of the card had nothing to do with the condition of the connection in the first place.  I made the argument that denying the warranty for the bent connection would be like a car a dealer denying a warranty repair of an engine because of a cracked tail light.  The tech responded by still refusing to honor the warranty. I then went online to find out about the warranty laws in my country and my stated, too (Federal laws & State laws are often different here in the US).  I discovered my rights and then sent a more sternly-written letter advising that I have sought legal advice on this matter, which of course I did by doing my own research.  This got a more favorable response and in a few days I had my replacement card.  And no, I will never buy another video card from EVGA again. The business who has the lens cannot prove who damaged the lens.  You have the upper hand in this because no damage was written on the repair form.  In the US, this means that the customer has the upper hand and that the business must take responsibility.  You need to find out what your local laws say in these matters.  Be firm and don't back down.  Do all your correspondence in writing to have a paper trail and proof as to who said what to whom.  If you talk to them over the phone, immediately send an email memorializing the conversation where you basically state that this is what I said and this is what you said.  Their failure to respond means that they accept and agree with your summary within the email.  After you do your research and know the law is on your side (and believe me, they'll know it too) send them a calm letter advising them that you've sought legal advice (Which is not a lie. You never said you hired a lawyer).

The store is under a Duty of Care to their customers: so it is unreasonable if they cannot produce that docket to show that the “pre-existing” damage was already present. But if the store simply “corrected” the docket before producing it she would have no proof of that alteration. If she tries a small claims court action and loses then all she forfeits is the registration charge.  If the lens was expensive it's probably still worth a try, but she should get legal advice first: most car insurance, building insurance, home contents insurance, breakdown recovery, and trade union memberships include some free legal advice.", 6918, "gjUpsUZAaa", 0],

The only other cause for half the frame being unexposed is a faulty shutter.  If this problem occurs all the time regardless of the use of a flash, then your shutter is faulty.", 6929, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],

	49229 : ["A camera is a light-tight box with a small hole (aperture) on one side equipped with a cover (shutter). Inside the box is a medium (film or digital sensor) that absorbs the light. Since it takes a carefully measured amount of light to create a clear photograph, there are ways to control the aperture size and the time the shutter stays open. There is also a way to change the light sensitivity of the medium.  Light that reaches the digital sensor is converted to electrical signals which is then translated to digital data. On a smartphone and on digital cameras in LiveView mode, the image can now appear (almost instantaneously) on the LCD. If the picture is taken, the digital data is then stored as a digital file in the gadget's memory card. Lenses? They channel light to the sensor and the way they do it can be modified by varying the qualities of the optics inside the lens. There are cameras that don't have a lens. Pinhole cameras only have a tiny hole.

	49230 : ["In the medical field, the procedure is called endoscopy, the process of looking into your innards. The traditional way is to use an endoscope which is a tube-like instrument with a small camera on the front end and fiberoptics to bring the image to the other end which could be a tiny screen or a connection to a computer and a larger monitor. Sometimes, there are also tiny robotic arms on the front end for performing surgical procedures. There is a new method, which should be more of what you are imagining. It is called capsule endoscopy and it is exactly how it sounds. The camera is inside a capsule, the size of a regular vitamin pill, which is swallowed. The images or video is transmitted wirelessly to a computer.

Consider also that using a still camera not designed for video, for video, comes at the compromise of essential video features.  Canon intentionally leaves out essential video features in the design of their DSLR/mirrorless cameras to not hurt their camcorder sales.  Therefore, you need to look at the features of both the BM and R5.

If you go up to 35 mm ISO-400 film, cameras create images equivalent to about 83,000 pixels per square mm.  Historically, digital cameras in the same price range haven't been able to come close to the level of resolution of analog film. The newest models of the Canon DSLR do approach 35mm analog camera resolution, rendering at peak 50.6-megapixel resolution, which is 78,000 pixels per square mm, but that resolution is its highest resolution, meaning it can be less depending on various factors. It is only just now that digital camera resolution is beginning to catch up with analog resolution. The benefits of digital cameras have been no film or developing cost, storage, and ease of photo-editing and photomanipulation. Obviously, the biggest benefit of all is being able to take as many pictures as you like and see how they turn out instantly, and while the cost of digital has been more on the front end, anyone who likes taking lots of pictures more than makes up for that initial cost on the backend by savings in film and developing, especially developing pictures that don't turn out. Anyone who's used an analog camera knows that you're lucky if you get a few pictures out of an entire role of film that are truly \"keepers.\" Nowadays, you can get digital cameras that outperform analog film, but you have to step up to a professional level camera, whereas the Canon DSLR isn't that but instead runs top of the line for amateurs, hobbyists, and those trying out photography, like students experimenting with it. Buying the Cannon DSLR gives you better resolution than a camera using 35mm ISO-100 film or any of the old cameras using less than 35mm film, like old 110 cameras and especially disc cameras. If you use mid-grade 35mm 400 ISO film, you will have at best slightly inferiors if still comparable quality, comparable enough that most people's naked eye won't tell the difference, but going up to 800, 1,000, and 1,200, getting into what more professionals use because of how extremely sensitive to light they are and an increasing proneness to over- or under-exposure when used by those who aren't photography experts, you won't be able to come anywhere near the same resolution with a Canon DSLR.", 6933, "None", 0],
