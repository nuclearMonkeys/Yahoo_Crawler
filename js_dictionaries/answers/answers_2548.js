My guess is that the Israelis watched the militants (terrorists) run back into that exact house.  It is okay for the militants (terrorists) to attack buses and pizza parlors but not okay for Israelis to attacks homes where they have seen the militants (terrorists)run into to hide.

Aside from that, if you want to talk about contributing taxes, then you should read up on the banlieu, which are full of unemployed 2nd generation immigrants who spend their whole adult life depending on state benefits.    Any way, bring on the ban.   Sorry but I actually know how to dress normally, not like a sl*t and not like a burka-woman either. Like 85% of woman. So how is a woman in a burka supposed to integrate with society? How is she supposed to drink something if thirsty, eat, respond to a smile from another woman, keep cool in 30 degree heat?! Even the majority of Muslims don't think a burka is advisable, that's a fact.    The reason the burka is unnecessary is because a headscarf signals that you're religious, whilst still looking like a normal person and a part of society.

But how many people are aware of how many lives are destroyed and families broken apart? We are talking about human beings, human dignity - about the destruction of a human life.  But of course, most people prefer to look away, because as far as their personal lives do not suffer any inconvenient they do not want to hear about things like that - as long as it's not them who suffer from the consequences of such an \"collateral damage\". This has to stop immediately; every single human life destroyed by such actions is a life too much.  I would wish that humans were as civilized as animals, because animals do not kill each other just for nothing… animals have more dignity than many humans.  Collateral damages = Killing the innocents!! Killing the innocents = Murderers!! And I do not give a damn for who is killing whom, because death does not distinguee between races, colours and religions.
