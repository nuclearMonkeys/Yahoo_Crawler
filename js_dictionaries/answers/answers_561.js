	31233 : ["It's not speaking individually.  It's actually referring to Israel who were the first to hear the gospel, Jesus came to the Jews FIRST - and they disobeyed and rejected Him, so then He sent the disciples and Paul etc., to the Gentiles who were last and they ACCEPTED Christ - so although they were LAST to come into the Kingdom, they are FIRST because many of the Jews are STILL on the outside looking in and STILL haven't accepted Christ as King of the Jews and their personal Saviour. That's why one has to be born again to really understand the spiritual messages being portrayed in the Bible.  You can't just read the print and understand the Bible - it's a spiritual book and needs to be understood by a spiritual mind because it's foolishness to the unregenerated and unsaved mind of natural mankind", 4776, "7gSkN9u6aa", -2],

Did you see >>>HIS<<< in Matthew 6:33??? MOST don't know \"the Kingdom of GOD\" is \"the Holy Ghost\" who is JESUS (John 14:18) and is why they don't know Matthew 6:33 is speaking of \"Seeking the Holy Ghost FIRST\" as JESUS commanded the disciples on the Day of Pentecost when HE commanded them to \"WAIT\" for the promise\" (Acts 1:4) of Holy Spirit baptism (Acts 1:5) so they could receive \"POWER\" (Acts 1:8) and be given the \"Spiritual gifts\" of \"wisdom and knowledge\" (I Corinthians 12:8) to \"UNDERSTAND\" what the Word of God mean so mankind won't feel like it's \"ROCKET SCIENCE\" because HE \"will guide you into all truth\" (John 16:13)!

I have been to Nepal many times.  It is not disgusting at all.  The people are very kind and decent and the majority have very high moral standards.  I would say the average Nepali is more moral than the average citizen of the United States.  In addition, Nepalis treat outsiders really kindly.  I always feel safe there.   The reason why Nepal is a poor country has to do with a lack of many natural resources.  In addition, they have no port (i.e. access to water-based shipping) so almost everything must come in either by air or by truck via India.  There are very few jobs there, so many men and some women go overseas to countries in the middle east or to Malaysia, for instance, to get what jobs they can.  While those jobs pay better than what they could get in Nepal -- if they could get a job at all -- they are still quite low paying.", 4779, "rPdBoondaa", 2],
