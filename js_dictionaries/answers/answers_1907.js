	101124 : ["There are several that come to mind following the same context of 1Thes 4:13-18. Most are VERY descriptive in details of we call the 'rapture' but do discuss or mention it in almost a passive disregard manner. Here: 1 Cor 15:23-24 - order of events believed to be passively discussing the rapture. 1 Cor 15:51-53 - Your rebuttal above in the sames sense supports this part 1 Cor as describing the repture. The spiritual body of the resurrected is indeed the result of your final being of the rapture. Personlly I feel these versus are among the strongest that describe the rapture. They tell us that at His coming a change will take place in the bodies of the called (it will happen in the twinkling of an eye). This change will be the oppisite of that what Jesus went through coming to earth (John 1:14). Flesh is sin or corruptable and cannot enter heaven therefor this change during the rapture must take place. The trumpet here is not one of the trumpets from the seven signs but one that God actually sounds Himself. (1 Thes 4:16). Only in the rapture does this change occur. There is no mention of such or any change during His second coming so this is describing the changed needed of the 'called' in order to enter heaven indeed during the rapture. Phil 3:20-21 - Again the change of our earthly bodies There are a few more that come to mind but these are the ones that more strongly describe the rapture and what is associated with it. When studying your Bible be sure to keep it in context and not solely choose verses from a passage and attempt to use them to support what some else had lead you to believe. The Bible when kept in context and with the guidance of the Lord it translate or reveal itself to you. It is indeed such a shame that so many 'Bible Scholars' attempt to use versus to support what someone else has taught them instead of forgetting everything you ever been taught and have the courage to discover the Bible and God for yourself and the strength to stand on what you have discovered on your own. God bless. ADDITION: Scribe: you mention at the bottom of your edits of a 'physical rapture.' There can be no such thing! As I mentioned above that the flesh is sin therefor our fleshly bodies cannot enter heaven. We will be remade or reborn into heavenly bodies both those of us that are still living at the time and of those that have previously died. All entering judgment in our new spiritual bodies leaving all the sinful flesh behind. Yes, you are right but the two are the same.

Even in advancing nations like India, no help is available and somehow the poor just refuse to pull themselves up out of the cardboard shanties and sewer line slums.  If this approach worked, there wouldn't be such an overwhelming number of them.  People who believe in this somehow think that children choose to be born into families whose parents have no education and do not value it for their children.  They expect the children to be able to behave as if this is not their environment and become scholars all by themselves.  They will sometimes choose to become entrepreneurs just like the ones they see around them - pimps and drug dealers.  That's all they see, so why would we expect anything different.
