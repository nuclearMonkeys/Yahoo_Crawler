Recently when my teen son went to Little Tokyo, he was with a friend who was visiting from Taiwan, and he spoke Chinese with some of the shopkeepers who didn't seem to speak English well. Go figure. My son's been there several times and apparently there wasn't much of a language barrier as he's come back with plenty of stuff at appropriate prices. (Lots of video game stuff.) In case you didn't know, Chinatown and Olvera Street are within walking distance of Little Tokyo, and you can easily see all three in a day.

I never liked Sabbath with Ozzy and never listened to the Dio Sabbath albums because of him (Ozzy) until till they reunited as Heaven and Hell and I kick myself for not knowing about the incredible music they made so long ago. But I am catching up on listening to it constantly now. Ozzy was a drug addict wife beater and Dio was just an all around good person that had twice the pipes for half the size.", 9029, "d5f9460fffed358dc6cc9543c9cc4ba9aa", 2],
	80462 : ["This is a complex question, with many factors to consider: Ozzy's early work with Black Sabbath both established a new genre of music,and set a standard within that genre that few have matched and none have exceeded.  Metal just wouldn't be metal without the Sabs, instead it would probably be Led Zeppelin. While Dio's work with Rainbow is not as widely known, it helped establish a viable sub-genre (classical metal) which is still with us, and often producing the most creative work in metal today. Technically, Dio was the better singer, and I like his albums with Sabbath much more than the last three that Ozzy did with them.  However, Ozzy's more of a personality, and personality counts for a lot. Of the two, I prefer Dio's solo work to Ozzy's (at least since Randy Rhodes died).  But Ozzy is still alive and producing music, so he has an undeniable Future advantage over Dio. OK, so what's my answer to this question?

	80467 : ["Only idiots believe that he ever molested children; it was a lie made up by someone who wanted his money and fame, so they decided to ruin it. Michael Jackson had a troubled childhood; his father hated him because he was black, and abused him also. That was why Michael changed his appearance; to feel accepted by his father. The nose surgery was because he had gotten it broken. I'm just saying that so all the a**holes know what REALLY happened. Don't jump to conclusions: you'll fall. I don't care what the reason was; he was a great person, an awesome musician, and many other good things the public didn't know. NeverLand was, as someone above said, a place he created with HIS money (and alot of it, I'm sure!) to give other children the childhood that he had never had. I'll remember that he was one of those pop culture figures that, while growing up, (I'm fourteen) I had thought would ALWAYS be there...it's strange to think he's GONE, and so suddenly! It was like Michael Crichton's death! Unfortunately, I'll remember the bad coverage he got in the 2000's, and how the media just wouldn't leave him alone (will they ever leave anything alone, damn them?) and the plastic surgery and nose surgery, and the FALSE accusations. But what's important is that I'll remember the good stuff, too! I'll remember Beat It, and Thriller, and Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, and the awesome dancing and crazy cool dance moves! And who will EVER forget the Moon Walk? I mean, really? God bless your soul, and rest in peace MJ. You were fantastic.", 9022, "None", 3],

	80488 : ["I absolutely love Michael Jackson. His music is amazing! I was born in 1982, right around the time he started hitting it big time. The thing I will remember most is my mom turning the radio up and cleaning the house to his music! Then she would pick me up and dance with me!!  I wish the media would have left him alone, along with all the people wanting his money. Although he lead a very strange life, I do not think that he molested those kids. He was only trying to give them the childhood that he didn't get to have. He grew up way too fast and was a star at 5 years old. That may have messed him up emotionally.  Thriller was and always will be the greatest music video of all time. Billie Jean is an awesome video too. The Black or White video is cool too, with all the different faces, etc. My favorite songs are Billie Jean, Thriller, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Black or White along with Man in the Mirror. We all need to take a listen to those lyrics and pay attention!  This man made many contributions to charities. He was a pure humanitarian! I hope he rests in peace. I can honestly say, with the world today, he is in a much better place than we are. Rest in Peace Michael.

	80489 : ["Regardless of what Michael Jackson did or did not do, he is a true legend. There's no denying his talent and passion for what he did. He changed music and made it what it is today; MTV wouldn't be where it is now without Michael Jackson. He could dance. He could sing. He captivated the entire world in only a short time, stunning us all with his iconic voice and his signature dance moves. Even his clothes were revolutionary. I've seen so many posts and comments that absolutely appall me. Turn the other cheek for once and have some respect for the dead. Pray for his family. Stop bashing him.  Maybe he did do bad things; I honestly don't know what is true and what isn't. All I know is that Michael had an amazing musical career. If we don't honor him for anything else, we should applaud him for that. What about \"Thriller\", \"Billie Jean\", or \"Beat It\"? Is the world so cruel that we would forget everything he did just to ridicule him for a few petty accusations? He came from nothing. He made something of himself. Michael Jackson has earned his star on the Walk of Fame. He's made an everlasting mark on this world, and that's not something many get to do. Rest In Peace Michael. The world has lost a truly amazing artist.", 9022, "LOMti5Zjaa", 1],
