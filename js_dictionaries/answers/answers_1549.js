But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\"  This is quoted from the American Declaration of Independence!      Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.        George Orwell  CAPITAL, n. The seat of misgovernment. That which provides the fire, the pot, the dinner, the table and the knife and fork for the anarchist; the part of the repast that himself supplies is the disgrace before meat.  Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914)  Politics: A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage.      Ambrose Bierce No government ought to exist for the purpose of checking the prosperity of its people or to allow such a principle in its policy.      Edmund Burke       The government is merely a servant — merely a temporary servant; it cannot be its prerogative to determine what is right and what is wrong, and decide who is a patriot and who isn't. Its function is to obey orders, not originate them.         Mark Twain  1835 -1910 Loyalty to the country always. Loyalty to the government when it deserves it.

Mark Twain \"The liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards; and it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors: they purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of treasure and blood, and transmitted them to us with care and diligence. It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle, or be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and designing men.\"           Samuel Adams  We should dare to read, think, speak, and write.     John Adams  1765 \"The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive.\"           Thomas Jefferson Government is not reason, it is not eloquence. It is force, and like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.        George Washington \"Our country's honor calls upon us for a vigorous and manly exertion; and if we now shamefully fail, we shall become infamous to the whole world\"        George Washington  “In politics, nothing happens by accident.
