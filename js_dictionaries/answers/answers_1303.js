	70747 : ["I completely agree with you Prashant. There is a big gap between the Ranji Trophy and the International Test team. Some of the veterans of the Ranji trophy never even got a chance to play in national colours. People like Rajat Bhatia, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Hrishikesh Kantikar have been prolific for their Ranji teams, but could not play for the nation. India keeps on saying they don't have this type of player, they don't have that kind of player & various other excuses for losses. I'll point out that, at a certain phase, there was no scope for a new face in the team with the likes of Gambhir, Sehwag, Dravid, Tendulkar, Laxman, Ganguly, Zaheer, Kumble,Bhajji in their prime! But post that period, there has been plenty of vacancies and a few experiments could've been done. BEEN. It was not done. Now, people are saying, they don't have replacements.  Batting was always strong for Team India. What let them down was their bowling. I'd reason the lack of lively wickets in domestic matches. Dead pitches with nothing for the bowlers are always prepared. The two good pitches this season was Mohali & Lahli, both up north where fast wickets are normal. The Captain of the national team is so worried about the pitches that are being given to him against a so-called weak subcontinental side! I believe it is also the duty of the International captain to follow the performances of the youngsters in the domestic circuit. After all, it depends in him, the team.  IPL is good. As far as domestic talents are found out, Yes. But then, teams mostly depend on their international stars than the domestic talents. There is very little \"Indian\" in the \"Indian Premier League\". They need to model it like the other Leagues and cut the no. of foreign stars. Make it more Indian.  Media? Indian Media. Do I need to say more about those bunch of hooligans? Some players think themselves to be \"undroppable\". And largely due to \"them\". Regards.", 8600, "69Kah9Xxaa", 1],

When he loses, he says lets play one more match, if he loses again he says one final match more, then again- grand finale match, then again- best of three series, and so on. (1) \"If we win at Mohali, we can hope to make it 2-2\" Even you can hope for 2-2 today (before Mohali match). Hoping is not banned. \"might have won 3-2 if it was a 5 Tests series\" And you definitely have lost if it was 3 test series, or even with a whitewash if it was just 2 test match series. Isn't? (2) Totally irrational, funny, illogical, irresponsible statement. In order to win the series, he should try to raise the performance level of his team, instead of raising the number of matches to be played, imaginably. (3) No ! Because we played till last ball in 2011 despite of the results. No Mercy, No escaping should be allowed ! (4) Its attempt to replace the tiredness with new energy. There is long interval. He already looks younger than his age. He was not supposed to go Taj Mahal (symbol of love) with his team-mates instead of Wife (love). So that was appreciable strategy (at-least better strategy than declaration we can say :) (5) Pitch-rotation policy is correct otherwise improvement of our team will stop if they play on similar pitches just to outperform opposition everytime with the help of pitch alone. (6) Nothing changed, its not extreme optimism. Its extreme imagining that what could have happened which couldn't happened. I hope India wins although it would be a high scoring match with high chances of draw. Its great feeling to beat Aussies always, no matter where or which pitch. Its not sudden burst of confidence, Clarke just has lost his consciousness after visiting the seventh wonder of the world Taj Mahal, which could have happened to anyone.

Not to mention actually help newer players bridge that gap with training both physical and mental. India's bowling problems have gone on too long and yet no specific steps have been taken to ratify that problem. One other clear problem, BCCI or the players simply don't have any interest in Test cricket. They don't have the patience, discipline, stamina or skill to get through 5 days. England should not have been able to do that to India, under the conditions of their choosing.  It really is time to cap IPL to 3 weeks. I agree merit should be the criteria players are chosen.

Yes as they say that Need is the mother of all inventions. We are not going to invent anything new but the NEED is there, to infuse fresh blood in the Indian team. It is going th. a very rough patch, even at home now. When R.Jadeja kind of failed T-20 & ODI player makes into the Test team, on the back of 2 triple tons, against the mediocre domestic bowlers, ques does arise, is this what team India going to witness. I am hoping against the hope that Jadeja would succeed, for India's sake, as we need a link b/w batsmen & the Indian tail. With Harbhajan gone, Dhoni struggling, Ashwin is not going to produce those kind of innings from Kolkata regularly, the tail is fragile, to say the least. I think for the past 4-5 seasons, maybe since the inception of IPL, players coming at international levels have been th. IPL mostly. Yusuf Pathan, Manish Tiwari, P.Chawla, now Awana & Jadeja are the products of IPL mainly. There lies our problem, 1st class has stood still, like a rock. Even today matches are being decided on the basis of 1st innings lead. Which shows that the bowlers are being murdered & Jadeja kind of mediocre batsmen are making merry. Let him fail & then see all the brickbats following in his failure. Still only for team India's sake I hope Jadeja scores a century & contributes in other departments to enable India to level the series. Its a very tough job, to bring parity in these levels, as not much attention is being paid to 1st class, its become a ladder to step into an IPL team, to make the ends meet, though handsomely after that. Today Mumbai lost a chance to pick a win, last when I heard, due to paucity of time. Their bowlers bowled out Punjab for a mere 59 but they couldn't go for a 150+ target, as both teams had batted for long enough. A long way to go but 1st class cricket has to be revamped, at least in India, to again start producing Dravids, Laxmans, Gangulys etc, in batting & Srinaths, Kumbles, Zaheers & Harbhajans for a bright future, else we will carry on struggling, if players from IPL kept on happening in the Indian team.
