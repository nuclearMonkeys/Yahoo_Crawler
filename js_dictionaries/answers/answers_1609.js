A baby doesn't know that it can't swallow a fork.  As we grow and live, we acquire experiences that add up to our \"common\" sense. Many things never occur to you because you've never been exposed to them.  For example, how do deep forest tribal villages brush their teeth?  Do you think it's \"common\" sense to them?  You may not know.  You may have never considered it.  How can you \"know\" anything that you've never spent time REALLY investigating? Same with these things you question.

I see no valid argument whatsoever against the legalization of gay marriage. That being said, I do think there's a logical flaw in what you're saying.  Like it or not, the government plays a gate-keeping role in the legal institution of marriage.  Government issues the marriage licenses, and determines who is eligible to receive one.
