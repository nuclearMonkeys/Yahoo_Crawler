In September 2001, terrorism was brought home to the US with the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and United Airlines flight 93. It appears that the Obama administration wants to erase these indelible images, by changing the focus from honoring the victims of September 11 to instituting a so-called “National Day of Service.” This would replace any reminder that terrorism is alive and well in the radical Islamic world. This is what we have to look forward to in September 2009. These events could prove to be pivotal during this month of September. September 12-13. An \"End the Occupation Conference” in Chicago featuring pro-Palestinian speakers, whose connection with President Obama are widely acknowledged, will speak to “the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation.” The speakers, who are also associated with radical Hamas and Fatah, have as their stated theme: “We aim to change those US policies that both sustain Israel's 42-year occupation of the Palestinian West Bank,Gaza, and East Jerusalem, and deny equal rights for all.”  September 26 President Obama will address at the United Nations and offer his vision of the \"Two State Solution.\" This is part of the strategy to make Israel disappear. Obama's plan is to sacrifice Israel in order to win acceptance by the Arab world. .", 8767, "9QBlKlFmaa", 0],

Iran is coming up nuclear \"potential\" which it of course does not want, in actuality that's coming up a nuclear bomb. 2. If Iran does improve a nuclear bomb below the radar of the west then it is going to be waiting to apply it in any way it needs because it has not signed the proliferation treaty. 3. The president of Iran is an entire and utter madman. he has already denied that there are any homosexuals in his united states of america and expressed a desire to \"wipe Israel off the map\". that's for those reasons that i think that the west ought to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran. it must be now in the previous that's in basic terms too previous due and we are up against a rustic with nuclear weapons.", 8767, "4oxQTOy2aa", 0],

	74457 : ["1.  They don't come up to you and wish you Merry   because you are a white girl in her late 20s.  That is all in your head.   They wish you a Merry   because it is culturally the thing people do in the U.S. at this time of year.    They also would not know you are Jewish.   I have a devout Jewish friend who says Merry   to me at   time.  2. I'm not sure \"Jesus believers\" as you call them get ticked off when they hear the phrase Happy Holidays as much as they get frustrated by those who insist that people should not be saying \"Merry  .\"   3. \"Can I say \"Happy Hanukkah\" back to people who say \"Merry  \" to me\"?  Sure.   Since you are Jewish and because of the proximity of Hanukkah to the   season it would not be inappropriate.  It might be even more appropriate to say both to the person greeting you if you feel you need to make a statement.  Merry   and Happy Hanukkah to you. :) Edit: \"... I'm just saying people shouldn't assume...\" Assume what?  They are not assuming anything.  They are simply wishing you a Merry  .   I think you have been receiving some pretty good advice here from certain individuals.   If you are more comfortable wishing others \"Happy Holidays\" then do that.  If they want to wish you Merry   then accept it in the spirit in which it is intended.  Even if you hear it 50x a day.", 8771, "X9jryPHmaa", 1],
	74458 : ["1) People typically wish people a merry/happy whatever THEY happen to celebrate.  If they celebrate   themselves, they're probably not going to wish you a Happy Hanukkah unless they happen to know for a fact that you're Jewish. 2) People get annoyed at the Happy Holidays thing because it's considered overly politically correct.  Most people who say it are only saying it because they're afraid they'll offend someone otherwise... or they say it because they don't have a choice in the matter... back when I worked retail, we could actually get written up for saying Merry   instead of Happy Holidays.  That sort of thing tends to aggravate people. 3) I've always just wished them a happy whatever-they-wished-me.  I guess my logic is sort of the opposite of yours, since wishing someone I now know is a Christian a \"Joyous Yule\" would be utterly meaningless to them.  In that case, it would be more appropriate to wish them a \"Merry  \", since, even though *I* don't celebrate it, *they* do, and thus would have meaning to them.  It just seems egotistical to wish for someone to have a good time on a holiday you know they don't celebrate.", 8771, "Gem96NQyaa", 0],

	74461 : ["Wow, after reading the answers you've gotten I don't know where to start. It says that Yahshua was in Jerusalem at the time of the feast of dedication (Hanukkah)  that it was winter would be obvous.  It never says that he observed or kept  Hanukka.  If Yahshua kept Hannaka then he kept it as an American would the Fourth of July or Thanksgiving. Its a national holilday and is not required nor is included in the scriptures except for one brief mention. One breif mention is not enough of a witness to establish doctrine. Should Christians keep Hanukkah instead of  ? NO! But if they keep Hanukkah with a right understanding then it is not a sin. However to keep   with any understanding is. Hanukkah is basically a Jewish Holiday that has mostly Historical signifigance and not relilgious at all. I'm not sure where Sol Scripture finds Hanukkah is scripture unless they are using the catholic bible but there is no \"Thus Saith YHVH.\" even there. It is not a commanded assembly. I would agree with Katie about those who abuse God's law but remember that to keep Hanukkah as anything but a show of solidarity with our Jewish brethern marking the dedication of the temple (some historians believe that what they were doing was keeping the Feast of Tabernacles because they were unable to do so in the Fall.) after cleansing it from the abominations that the Greeks had committed there then they are breaking scripture by adding to the word of God and are not better than those who would keep  . However, There is evidence in the scripture that he would have been conceived on the first day of Hanukkah going by the courses of the priest and Johns Father and when he would have been serving in the temple and the fact that when Mary went to visit Elisabeth that Elisabeth was 6 months pregnant. Also it is the eigth day after conception that a fetus first has its own blood. How interesting Hanukkah \"The festtival of lights\"  and Yahshua the light of the world and on the eigth day the blood that saves us first appears? This of course is conjecture and should not be confused with scripture nor held as doctrine. Its just a neat little thing. Oh and by the way IF Yahshua was concieved on Hanukkah and he was actually observing the festival then he was keeping his  birthday since in that culture at that time the time of conception was considered when you were born. Which is interesting when you think about the abortion issue.", 8772, "ZTPCOiJlaa", 1],
	74462 : ["I am a Christian and I celebrate Hanukkah! If you look at the menorah, it is the perfect symbol of the Bible. The Central candle in the traditional menorah is called the shamash (SP?) or Servant candle. It is the one that lights all the other candles. In comparison, Jesus is the light of the world. Jesus also came to serve not to be served. Also note there are 4 candles on each side of the servant candle and they are to be lit... one more each night... from one end to the other. Jesus/YHWH gave the light first to the Jews and then after Christ was \"lifted up\" (yes, the servant candle is typically raised) it was then given to the gentiles.   The way they are to be placed is the opposite of the way they are to be lighted. (The first shall be last and the last shall be first)   Also, Jesus Celebrated Hanukkah!  \"John 10:22 \"Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade.\" (this Feast is Hanukkah)  Personally, I find a lot more Biblical evidence that we should celebrate Hanukkah than to celebrate  . We see that Jesus was in the temple at that time, showing that He celebrated it. Also, we know when Hanukkah is because the Jews keep impeccable records. This is a celebration of how the Jewish nation was spared from annihilation by the Greeks. Had the Jewish nation not been spared, Jesus could not have come to save us all!     on the other hand, we do not know when it was. If God wanted us to celebrate Christs birth, wouldn't He have let us know when it was? We can tell from the Scriptures that it wasn't in December for sure. The Shepard's were out tending their flock by night, this didn't happen in December in that region as it was the rainy season. They stopped this practice about October. So we KNOW it couldn't have been in December. The fact that Pagan traditions are the major foundation for the celebrations should further drive us away from celebrating  . EDIT TO KATIE: I am a Christian and I think Pork is dirty too! I don't eat it either! Sadly, I use NIV because it is easier for me to understand but I get it your way too. :-)", 8772, "None", 3],

So the door is open for liverpool....but I seriously think that spark that they had at the end of last season is diminishing. With arsenals xi last saturday, they would have torn them apart to five nil last season and I was geniually suprised they didnt score more....and that they only scored when the gunners lost their centre defensive midfielder. So...ill say yes. But winning the premier league isnt for them this season, city look incredible at the moment, united are same as usual...so theres only third and fourth left and I do feel liverpool will take up one of the positions.

I made the mistake with my cat , Psycho B****, of underestimating the satanic powers she possessed. Woe to me for not respecting her true persona. Yes, I made the mistake of thinking I could bribe her with Tender Treats and top shelf canned food. I even did as you were thinking of Baptizing her. By myself, I held her in the sink full of cold water.  After I returned from the emergency room with 34 stitches and about a half mile of bandages wrapped around my chest, it occurred to me that there was a better way.  Trust me, this works. Grab the little darling by the tail and swing her around your head at least 20 times. Ignore the screams. Tough love is needed. When the cat hits a high C let go.

Man City, Real Madrid and Chelsea are gradually destroying football .. They buy plenty of players, players they don't need .. The players who are not getting playing time at these clubs are not allowed to leave; they are usually sent out on loan ..
