	27803 : ["Well done for going to your GP. It can be hard to take that first step especially when you're not being supported at home. You are trying and that's all your parents can expect. After everything you've been through it isn't surprising that you're struggling. I do think your parents are being too hard on you. Are they in financial difficulty? The fact is, if you got a job now with things as they are, chances are you'd mess up or the pressure would make your mental health a million times worse. With mental health it isn't always a case of \"throw yourself in at the deep end\". That can actually often have an even worse outcome, which is perhaps something you need to make your parents understand. You need to get help for your anxiety and depression. It may be that you are referred on to a counselor or prescribed medication - neither of which is anything to be ashamed of.  Breakups are hard under the best of circumstances, not to mention your age and the alleged abuse. Hang in there.", 4331, "BKqXVhzEaa", 0],

	27809 : ["Wow. I did not follow Islam and grew up in a conservative Christian church.  I believed the standard of not having sex before marriage. And I know it's a tough battle with a tug of war between hormones on one side and religious fidelity on the other. During my high school and early college years, I followed the letter, not the spirit, of the religious law. I began a rigorous study of comparative religions and gained an understanding of the underpinnings of major religions and their current fidelity to their venerated leader. I came to the conclusion that theology had interjected prohibitions and limits to the expression of religion that did not come from the paradigm of that faith, but tended to control many of the activities of believers. I hope you will cleave to the faith of your family while under their roof, but will carefully analyze the restraints put on believers and contrast them to the life of your prophet. I find it liberating to follow Him, as opposed to following the theology of the religion. May you find peace and a bountiful life as you grow older.", 4338, "98lD3z68aa", -1],

	27819 : ["The implied idea of \"Go back to your (own) country\" is that you, because of your distinctive racial/ethnic/cultural features (whether skin or clothing or speech patterns) do not belong here, are not one of \"us\".  Go back to your own country is only used for those who clearly do not belong, and there is only one way to judge that a person is not one of us (that is, obviously an alien, a foreigner), and that way requires application of bigotry based on stereotype. We can quibble over whether ethnicity is the same as \"race\" or not, but the term \"racism\" does not quibble about it.  The idea of \"race\" refers to ancestry; just a matter of level of detail whether you mean one of the few major races or their innumerable subsets, distinct ethnicity within a race. How can you see it as other than a rejection of the value of the target based on some superficial judgement of their location of origin?  The only way you can know for certainty where the person is from is when you know the person very well, as an individual, and it is pretty rare that anyone says \"go back to where you come from\" when they are aware that the\"you\" person is from here and one of \"us\". If you do not see that telling someone to go back to where they're from is not a very explicit declaration of \"you are not one of us and do not belong here with us\", then you are either a fool or in total denial.", 4316, "WbVE1cXKaa", 1],
	27820 : ["Because no one originally started in America they immigrated here so thier hypocrites . If your going to tell someone to go back to thier country then start packing pilgrim cuz you sure as hell didnt start out here either go back to your country .", 4316, "bVBZDoKmaa", 0],
	27821 : ["Well, to start off with, nationality has always been about race.  Nationalism developed in 18th and 19th century Europe and was based on ethnic/racial divisions.  Italy for the Italian, France for the French, Germany for the Germans, etc.  While we American often use \"state\" and \"nation\" interchangably they're different things, as shown by mutli-national states like the UK (which contains the English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish nations).  Nationalism can exist without a state, and even in contravention of the state, as shown by, for example, Kurdish nationalists in the Middle East, who are fighting a variety of states, most prominently, and violently, Turkey, in the name of nationalism.   But \"go back to your country\" is absolutely a racist phrase and one of the most common racist phrases out there.  That's because it's predicated on the idea that racial minorities don't really belong here and that they're somehow less American, or conditionally American.  We can see that clearly in Trump's statements which were directed at four American women.  Their country is America.  Three of the four women were born in America, which makes them as American as anyone else, especially Trump.  Yet because they are black, Hispanic, and Arab, Trump doesn't see them as really American.  Trump, sees nothing wrong with saying that someone like Rashiba Tlaib, who, like him, is a child of an immigrant, is somehow less American than he is.  Why?  Because of race.  He sees nothing wrong with saying that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose family became citizens around the same time his grandfather fled to the US to dodge the draft in Bavaria, is somehow less American than he is.  Why?  Because of race.  He sees nothing wrong with saying that Ayanna Pressley, whose family has been here for at least a century longer than Trumps, is somehow less American than he is.  Why?  Because of race.  He doesn't use this kind of rhetoric against white politicians who he disagrees with like Nancy Pelosi or Hillary Clinton.  Even though he thinks they're terrible people he recognizes them as American, because they're white.", 4316, "None", 2],

	27864 : ["I would look at this as a learning experience. Ideally, you'd want to have physical intimacy with someone you emotionally connect with. It really helps intimacy feel more special, rather than simply fulfilling a base desire. (Speaking from experience.) You mention that he \"doesn't really go deep into things\", and that he kept wanting to move forward despite your reservations, which bothers me. Good communication between partners is a critically important part of having sex. If he wanted to go ahead with things you're clearly not comfortable with and was not willing to learn more about you, then he was trying to use you. I know that probably hurts to hear right now, but it is important to look at each guy you have feelings for as a chance to learn about what kind of partner you /do/ want.
