	1308 : ["First of all, every antibody molecule in your body was produced against some foreign substance, molecule or organism that your body encountered at some point. There are no \"non-specific\" antibodies in your blood stream.  No antibodies produced against one virus are ever really effective against a totally different virus. So, there is no reason to imagine that the antibodies produced against the current virus or from the vaccines would neutralize any virus that isn't closely related to the current virus and its variants. So saying that the vaccine won't protect you against other viruses is just a dumb statement--of course it won't.The current Covid vaccines cause your body to make many different antibodies (a polyclonal response) to the spike protein of Covid. Any closely related variant should have spike proteins that are sufficiently similar that the antibodies produced should be at least partially effective. The current evidence is that the vaccines are pretty effective against the variants that have been seen so far. Might a new variant appear with a spike protein that is so very different that the current antibody responses don't recognize it at all? Sure, its possible, but pretty unlikely, particularly if large numbers of people get vaccinated quickly.", 214, "a4edf2e40162015de63a4dff47980bbbaa", 1],

BTW the snow thunder is rarer because the towering cumulus is rarer in the winter cold.  Typically snow comes from stratus clouds which don't usually produce lightning.", 199, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", 1],

BTW, the articles were interesting reads regarding how they work. MsBittner is, as always, reliable and right. Activated charcoal is the emetic used nowadays.  I remember my mother giving me mustard in water because we did not have Ipecac. (Ipecac was the doctor's choice in 1960 when she phoned. Mustard was either his no.2 or my mother remembered it from her childhood. Or my aunt Mary or our neighbor did- Mother's \"go-to\" women. There was nothing about children my aunt didn't know.) I think I vomited but I'm not sure. I just remember it was hot and hard to swallow. I wanted to throw up. I gagged for several minutes over a bowl. I must've thrown up the mustard at least.
