If you get hit with a particularly hard shot that damages you but not enough to knock you down (say really shakes you or gets your legs a bit wobbly), it makes more sense to go down rather than risk a follow up shot that could knock you out.

	36215 : ["The more I ponder on this GOAT thing, the more I realized that most of my prior thinking and very well true for most of other ppl's thinking is dictated by marketing, specifically the Nike marketing machine.  Think for a while, almost every iconic athlete - Agassi, Tiger, Jordan, etc are Nike clients.  Genius marketing immortalizes ppl and even things into icons.  For example, if Rolex does not sponsor sports like golf, tennis, and F1 racing, would they have the status they have now?  If a tree falls in a forest and there is no one there, we can safely conclude it never fell down. Back to basketball, LeBron clearly will have better stats if this makes a GOAT.  One could argue that's only because of his longevity but isn't that part of basketball?  Many potentially great players never reached their potential because of injuries.  Does number of championships make a GOAT?  Because this is problematic since Pipen and other Bulls players have same number of wins just by being in same team with Jordan.  To conclude, it is clear when the smoke clears, LeBron will have better stats and possibly a 5th title making him pretty close if not better than Jordan.  One thing Jordan never done is win in another team.  That to me is telling on how good one player is.  Brady clearly is GOAT by winning in another team.  In the end, I feel a lot of greatness ppl remembered of Jordan is pure Nike marketing.", 5438, "VWJRGn4Laa", 0],
