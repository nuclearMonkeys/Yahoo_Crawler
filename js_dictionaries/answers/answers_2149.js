(The tapes are also really good - read by the author with all the voices and even singing!) \"The Boxcar Children\" series by Gertrude Chandler Warner. \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"The Hobbit\" by J.R.R.

The \"Sherlock Holmes\" mysteries by Arthur Conan Doyle. \"Little Women\", \"Little Men\", \"Jo's Boys\", \"Eight Cousins\" and \"Rose in Bloom\" by Louisa May Alcott. \"Freckles\" and \"Girl of the Limberlost\" by Jean Stratton-Porter. \"The Hollow Kingdom\", \"Close Kin\" and \"In the Coils of the Serpent\" by Clare Dunkle.

I still enjoy them but your older daughter may think of them as childish .They are the most creative tales ever written. -Especially if they like animals, I used to enjoy a specific series by Thomas Brezina. I don't know the name of it in English, in German it's \"Sieben Pfoten fÃ¼r Penny\" -seven paws for Penny- and it's about this young teenage girl with vet parents who live in a big house with a small zoo,almost,and she has adventures concerning animals and her two dogs (one of them has a missing paw) always accompany her. I can't remember exactly but I really liked them. Brezina also has a series about a talking bike called Tom Turbo, your 9 year old may or may not be a little old for that, I'm not sure. -Enid Blyton. She has one series about a girls' school, the series was like 30 books,but the last ones aren't so nice.The first 12 are really good,though. I guess this would be more fitting for the 9 yr old. Blyton also has some mystery series-also for the 9 yr old. Really captivating. -Age 12 can actually read almost anything and would probably like to read some grown up literature rather than being treated like a child. At that age I was really into literature in my own language so I can't give you any ideas about that, but I guess she could like some Arthur Miller to begin with.

Particularly since anyone can have a speech written for them, Adolf Hitler had his speeches written by Himmler! Joseph Stalin had his speeches written, of course he rambled on and did not follow them very much. Obama has his speeches written, and he does follow them because he makes too many mistakes if he does not.  But Sarah Palin and John McCain both, just have some hand written note cards so they can keep the facts in their hands. The speeches however are off the cuff so there will be some trip ups.  Would you rather hear a human speaking what is in their minds, or would you like to hear what some pro speech writer and a team of psychologists wants you to hear, carefully choreographed.. It is truly refreshing to hear a human speak rather than just read a speech, and it is refreshing to hear a plain talking human being speaking rather than an automaton like Obama. This is what the Republican team brings to this election, not just a political machine but plain talking folks.  This is why the Democratic controlled news media (93% vote Democrat) wants to discredit and insult the Republican team. They realize that with all of the scandals, the corruption in Congress (also Democrat controlled), the corruption on Wall Street (the list of bankers and the list of Obama contributors is the same) that it is time for a change and that change is to clean house.
