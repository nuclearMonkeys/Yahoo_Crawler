	126772 : ["They bible simply tells what God did. It does not go into detail of how God did it. I think when they figure out the truth they will find that evolution occurred exactly in the stages that the bible says God said let...And man was created separately from the rest of creation. As for time the bible does not give the age of the earth. Verses one and two are before the first day and no time is given for them at all. Day's one through three are before the sun and moon were created. So you can't call them days as we think of days today.", 10910, "7KeGDQyXaa", 0],

	126779 : ["The Church lies to people because they don't want them figuring out what the real flesh of Christ is... a magic mushroom... The stories in the bibles are metaphors of a belief system very similar to what the Mayan indian beliefs who worshipped the sun and their sacred psilocybin mushrooms that they called \"The Flesh of The Gods.\" The bible is a book about the sun and entheogenic shamanism, the science of consciousness... written in childish little metaphors.

However, Twilight is mainly loved by teenage girl, and Harry Potter by almost anyone who likes a bit of magic. I like both, though not for the boys aspect and I certainly don't like the Harry Potter movies, which make me cringe because I've grown to dislike the main character. Harry Potter is more widely read so I suppose it's the best, but I'm still not satisfied. I supppose it depends what arguments you go for - which one is read by more people or other aspects such as likability of the main character, etc.", 10913, "c3wGqeEDaa", -1],

It was very popular among the Romans, especially among Roman soldiers, and was possibly the religion of several Roman emperors. While Mithraism was never given “official” status in the Roman empire, it was the de-facto official religion until Constantine and succeeding Roman emperors replaced Mithraism with Christianity. One of the key features of Mithraism was a sacrificial meal, which involved eating the flesh and drinking the blood of a bull. Mithras, the god of Mithraism, was “present” in the flesh and blood of the bull, and when consumed, granted salvation to those who partook of the sacrificial meal (theophagy, the eating of one's god).", 10916, "c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa", -1],
