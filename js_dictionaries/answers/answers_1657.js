	88546 : ["Typically, a 15-16 pound turkey will take about 3-4 days to thaw in the refrigerator. If you thaw it in cold water (changing water every 30 minutes) it may only take 6-8 hours. Here are some charts that might help you out: Turkeys can be thawed using one of three methods, but the most fool proof is in the refrigerator. The key to this method is to plan ahead and allow approximately 24 hours for every four to five pounds of bird weight for thawing in the refrigerator. This method is the safest and will result in the best finished product. Place the bird, in the original wrapping, on a shallow baking sheet in the refrigerator. The following chart provides good guidelines for thawing times.  Refrigerator Turkey Thawing Time (40 degrees F)  Turkey Weight Days to Allow for Thawing Turkey  8 to 12 pounds 2 to 2.5 days  12 to 16 pounds 2.5 to 4 days  16 to 20 pounds 4 to 5 days  20 to 24 pounds 5 to 6 days  If you need to thaw the turkey more quickly, you may thaw the bird in COLD water, in the original wrapping. The cold water must be changed every 30 minutes. Allow approximately 30 minutes per pound using this method.  COLD Water Turkey Thawing Time  Turkey Weight Hours to Allow for Thawing Turkey  8 to 12 pounds 4 to 6 hours  12 to 16 pounds 6 to 8 hours  16 to 20 pounds 8 to 10 hours  20 to 24 pounds 10 to 12 hours  The third safe method for thawing a turkey is in the microwave.

	88554 : ["Your thinking is confused, no doubt because you take man's opinions and reasoning which is deficient. There are no pious to be loved by God, only those that sinful man adjudges to be pious and then expects God to accept his defiled judgement. To be pious because loved by God does not make sense for it implies the heresy that you allege that any action could be good. The mistake that you and those you quote make is to locate morality in man. Only God is good but man has sinned and is sinful. Obedience to God is moral but man cannot obey God since all his works are defiled by sin. Even his attempts at obedience are from a selfish motive and mixed with sin. His righteousness is therefore far from perfect and is as filthy rags to God. Why do you suppose the Jews are rejected for their adherance to law keeping? Surely you can also see that the Pharisees were self righteous and did not have the righteousness of God?   That is why man needs God's righteousness which is perfect. God in His great love and mercy and compassion has provided for man the perfect righteousness of Christ's life that can be imputed to man through faith. Manifestly it cannot be imputed by man's works. In the salvation of Christ God gives three things which meet man's essential needs. 1. Forgiveness of sins which are judged in Christ. 2. The perfect righteousness of Christ's life imputed by faith. 3. A heart changed by the Holy Spirit Who indwells to enable obedience to God acceptable to Him. This last learned in this life and made perfect in the next. Your example of the slaughter of the Midianites is your attempt to judge God for His judgement of the Midianites. You allege there were some innocent, but they were not innocent. Notice it is obedience to God that is required. Life can only be taken by God and one reason He takes life is to put an end to evil. We are all subject to death. Mercy and compassion are right emotions but not at the cost of disobedience.  How can you think that any can know better than God Who gave the awareness of morality and teaches man right from wrong? How can man who is so limited in his knowledge and understanding be in a position to know better than God Who not only knows all things, including the motives of the heart but Who also deals with His creation in warnings and interventions and always does what is best for all in every circumstance? Man follows a morality based on law but this is not objective morality. The purpose of law is to restrain evil and to convict of sin. It does not nor cannot give life. Only God gives life.", 9298, "4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa", 0],
