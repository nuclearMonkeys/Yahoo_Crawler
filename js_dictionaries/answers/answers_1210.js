My mother is an intelligent woman who is white and lives in predominantly white community and stated that she would vote for Obama.

It is a fact that no one condition reflects sciatica and it would be prudent to refer to it as a generic medical term encompassing lots of symptoms that taken together describe a lower back pain that a patient suffers from. When someone complains of severe back pain that passes down to legs through his buttocks, even down to his feet and toes, doctors suspect him to be suffering from sciatica. Often sciatica presents itself as numbness or a tingling sensation that may not be anything like the severe pain commonly associated with sciatica.

That quotas are bad, or that this company should not have to obey the law because the law is a bad law? ___ <Nice to see how people judge an answer based on it's opening line.  Read to the end, please.> 40% is still not even equal.  What's your objection to this quota? They were given 4 years to come to compliance with the law. That's certainly a reasonable amount of time to make changes...even if that includes grooming some women to become non-executive directors for a bank....now they will face consequences.    I don't like it when our nation passes laws that are unfavorable to my preferences either, but I comply with the law or I expect to face legal consequences. Now, I do not agree with quotes personally, and I have my own objections to this situation in Norway, but  really, what is your specific objection here? EDIT:  Eoghan,  I don't like quotas either.  I'm asking for some clarification about which part of this the questioner objectionable.      I'm playing devil's advocate in terms of enforcement.   If you are a business owner and your governement passes a law giving you 4 years grace before reaching compliance -- what is unreasonable about that?    I see the challenge presented in the article...I agree that quotas set up a business to place unqualified people in key positions...but really-- in this case how could they **not** recruit the women they needed and train/groom them for the positions when they saw it coming?

If there is a tree by your pool, it probably fell from there. if there are no predaters around, leaves the bird in a safe spot under or around the tree.

You need to replace it where you found it..preferably in a scrub or tree so it is relatively safe from predators, and the parents should come back to feed it. If it is unfeathered...then look for a nest and if you can find it...replace it into the nest.  Do not worry about your scent being on the chick..birds have a very poorly developed sense of smell and will NOT reject a baby that has been touched.
