	108357 : ["I agree with 'S' and would add - get yourself some pepper spray. I feel you are taking this stalking too lightly. You are way too brave. Do go - and make a report. Hope you have thought to get a picture of him on your cell phone. The laws have improved concerning stalkers. This needs to be documented and I feel you should have reported him from the beginning. You scare me. Hope you have someone to go places with you - at least until he has been dealt with.  The police need to run a background check on him. Who knows what they will find?

But, for me. my problem is him and those nuclear codes. i don't like it. not even a little bit. Making the opposition nervous is all fine and good but i just don't sense competency in him. he behaves like someone who should be on prime time. not a leader. i expect them to be i-don't-know stronger. more important.  When i look at him i don't see any of that. i see a 70 year old child with a box of dynamite and i'm stuck in the room with this little ******* and a bunch of idiots are telling me he's in charge and to trust him. Wha? If we survive this disaster it won't be because Trump is great. it will be sheer luck. Cause i'm looking right at him and i don't see jack ****.", 10053, "7d56JJBMaa", 2],

	108362 : ["Um...I understand, and I have an anxiety disorder, but it does not reflect things that happen in real life, so to speak. I have the type where I can't watch people dive underwater, or drive over water, and I can't fly over water. I can't watch people or have myself put in tight spaces. I can't watch sharks on T.V. My mind gets flooded at night with horrible thoughts of me in the open water, or me falling into a sharks mouth...I believe it's called post-traumatic anxiety. So I know where you're coming from, and I know the attacks you can have. However, along with that, you can't expect someone to not do something that they wanted to do because you're going to throw a fit. That's like me saying that my husband can't go to the beach and swim in the water! I take a sedative and have him wake me when he gets home, easy as that! You need to calm down. It's not the end of the world if he's having a party and you're not included. You're in the wrong. Get a grip. You know how many times I've had to suck it up and cross a bridge? Go to the beach with my friends? I still get attacks, but you know what? Every single time I try something involving the ocean, I get a little better each time. You're sick because you want to stay sick and play the victim. Knock it off, and get a grip!", 10051, "0V875zvYaa", 7],

	108364 : ["Sounds like jealousy to me. I should know, because back in high school I used to be secretly jealous of my best friend because she was liked by the popular boys, while I was treated poorly. It took me a while to realize that it wasn't just her appearance that people liked, but it was also her personality. A tip from someone whose experienced the dangers of jealousy: Don't let it consume you. Jealous drives a wedge between relationships and it can become very destructive. Look past your friend's \"beauty\" and realize that beauty isn't everything.", 10050, "EdMEFZnaaa", 3],
	108365 : ["It is the person inside who counts. Develop a nice personality and become a person people will want to know. Beauty is only skin deep. Where ever you go in life you will always find a person who is more successful than yourself. That can be hard to deal with but work on all the things you are good at and don't be jealous or you will waste time dwelling on the situation and time waits for nobody.", 10050, "goNpAlLtaa", 3],

Not once in all that time did you tell him firmly to get out of your life and not to approach you again or you would consider him a stalker and go to the police. He may be a little on the loony side but he is more naive than any danger to you. The way you talk about him, it seems if he was tall, blond and handsome, you would have reacted differently to him. You sound like you are more dangerous than he is. He simply suffers from bad taste in women. You suffer from a Wyatt Earp complex and you want to shoot anyone who dares to mosey into Dodge who you don't like.", 10049, "q0yH9mrpaa", 0],

	108377 : ["It sounds like anxiety.... google some coping skills and relaxation techniques (mindfulness is good). and if they don't work then go see your doctor. Just so you know... your use of the word \"crazy\" is quite offensive. Mental illnesses are simple illness of the brain... like Lupus, or Crohn's or Vasculitis are diseases of the immune system, diabetes is a disease of the pancreas, eczema is a disorder of the skin..... the brain is simply an organ and diseases of the brain are just like any other disease.

	108380 : ["It's a common belief, to me, it happened a lot, but I have to say that apart from her personality which must be considered very well, if you think you're not comfortable or it doesn't make you happy when you're with her it's important to make her aware before something happens. She has the right to know if you're not satisfied with what's happening, but don't tell her \"it suck!\". Besides, if so many believe she's pretty she must be at least \"ok\" which means \"OK\"!!

	108383 : ["Rosie is a women that grew-up on the suburbs of Long Island, NY. She must have been taunted relentlessly, and lived quite a phony/double-life -- which worked to hone her early comedy (which attacked). But since she gained fame and a ton of money -- she feels she's in charge. She doesn't understand that TV (running her own show) was not the real world, and she's actually just an angry blowhard. She thinks she's cutting-edge by being an 'out' mother -- doesn't know there's more to people than wearing their sexuality on their sleeves (for identity). She sees Elisabeth as inferior -- because Rosie's built a SUPERIOR complex, that she's better than everyone where she came from, worked her own career from nothing, and is smarter than a reality show princess, etc. etc. Rose for all she ISN'T should be axed, to spare the people of this.

You do nothing, except 1. be really honest with yourself and ask yourself, \"Am I jealous of my friend for the praise and attention that she receives for being 'really pretty' ?\", and 2. If the answer is yes, learn how to extinguish jealousy from your life, because it will only serve to turn you into a bitter and unhappy person. Whether or not your friend is \"pretty\" has no bearing on your life. Her prettiness does not make you any more or less pretty yourself.
