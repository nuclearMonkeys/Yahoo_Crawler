	38709 : ["Well, you are doing EVERYTHING WRONG.  Do it right and see what YOUR insurance says. & YOU \"MUST\" TALK TO \"Your Insurance company\" because your insurance company will take care of you.  The other insurance company does not \"Care about You or your Loss\" so they will \"Low Ball you\" because the less they have to pay you, the more money they get to \"keep\" .  Your insurance company is like a bunch of \"hired HELL'S ANGELS bikers working FOR YOU\".    So they will extract the money out of the other biker group(which is what the other insurance company basically is) . Never fear the guys you \"hired to work for you\" . This is how insurance works.  Their fault? Then your insurance will NOT GO UP. . Dad should know this but obviously he doesn't. . The insurance basics...you \"insure the OTHER PERSON against losses you might cause them\"  Their insurance also does the same thing for you. . However, as insurance seems to be new to much of the U.S. and many people do not have insurance AT ALL(then you sue them which requires a lawyer). The U.S. is full to the YingYang with lawyers (people making money off of your misfortune)  If the other dude does not have car insurance, then chances are good he does not have any stuff(house, boat, stocks, bonds) so you are suing someone who cannot pay. - It is like getting blood from a stone.  It won't happen. There is something called \"underinsured motorist protection\" which is additional insurance you can buy for a few bucks more that would cover such a situation so YOU get paid.   All you are interested in is \"Getting paid\"  You don't care where the money comes from.  Understand, YOU don't get paid.  The autobody shop gets the money for repairing the car. . The only time you get paid is when the car is actually totaled.   Not something YOU determine. Not something the other insurance or your insurance determines either.  There is a 3rd party that gets involved, that is experienced in auto crashes to say whether it is totaled or fixable.      .  New cars are meant to crumple up. Then they unbolt the damaged piece and put in a new piece. Car is fixed.  You can't see or feel the difference. . This is how \"IT WORKS\". If it is your insurance offering, and you were not injured. - then that is what that scrap of a car is worth. Insurance WON'T DICKER WITH YOU.  It is what you insured the car for so that is what you get.  They tow a HARD LINE when it comes to money and contracts.

	38711 : ["No. But why were the tyre widths changed? 255/55 tyres have a sidewall height of 140.25mm. 235/55 tyres have a sidewall height of 129.25mm. Unless the 235/55 tyres are a return to factory standard then your speedometer will now be significantly over-reading your true road speed, and your odometer will be racking up more miles than the car has actually done. To meet the same sidewall height (and therefore overall wheel circumference) the tyre shop should have fitted 235/60. The shaking is almost definitely due to poor fitting (all new tyres are marked with a heavy spot which should be placed directly opposite the tyre valve). That minimises or even totally removes the need to add balancing weights. If your vehicle manufacturer recommends 255/55 as standard factory fit for 18” rims then you've been served by a totally incompetent tyre fitter and I'd suggest returning to complain in order to get the correct tyre size and proper fitting/balance.", 5693, "gjUpsUZAaa", 3],
