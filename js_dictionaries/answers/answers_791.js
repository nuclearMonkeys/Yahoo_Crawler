	43926 : ["Hey Wease! How's it going?  They deleted your post about Koshka (We affectionately call him KoshKuck). I post in YGW a lot now, and Koshka don't like me. He's an obsessed loon. For some reason, he thinks I'm Little Nancy Ninefinger and that I bother you. My posting here drove him so crazy that he used the Yahoo search box to look up several of my accounts. He traced them back a couple of years and often made reference to them here. He even made bunches of screen shots of my posts. That's how he linked to you. Koshka has this bizarre collection of socks with all these weird personas. The main account is a guy called Dirac. He's a 60 year old fart who pretends he has a job. He pretends he's a father. His Koshka persona is this weirdosexual who also protects Dirac as a mommy. Do you remember my Montana account with the Buffalo avatar? Well, the funniest Koshka story is when I posted an email here, jimsmithbozemanmontana at the gee mail. Koshka/Dirac was so stupid that he didn't realize I made the email account 5 minutes earlier. He thought it was my regular account. He spent hours searching guys named Jim Smith in Montana. Apparently, he found a Jim Smith who owns an archery shop and decided it was going to be me lol. And yeah, I have seen the Koshka account fishing around the military section asking about me. I guess he's making one last desperate attempt to track my identity. If you thought Ninefinger was disturbed, you should see this guy!", 6335, "J1j4zgTaaa", 3],

The word \"school\"only refers to the latter in Russia.  If you are talking about schools then probably yes, they are more...rigorous. At least when it comes to STEM subjects. All school education culminates with the Unified State Exam, so you can look that up and see example papers for yourself.  Universities...well...similarly to schools the curriculum is probably more demanding in theory. That is, in top engineering universities like the Bauman university maths and physics curriculum is very hard. In less prestigious schools though, where the students are much dumber and less motivated, you could easily \"pass\" subjects with very little studying.", 6340, "NzljUmQmaa", 0],

First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Chipped vaccines = mark of the beast. Sakashvilli and his wife are the heads of human organ harvesting operation during war in Ukraine. They send organs of civilians and organs of soldiers to Israel and America. Someone is hit by car or bullet, then their organs are harvested and sent abroad. mRNA vaccine by Moderna contains *Luciferin* dissolved with *66.6* ml of distilled *phosphate* buffer solution. ...mark of the beast...that's what it is... all vaccines are chipped all vaccines have cells of aborted fetuses in them Police stop you at checkpoint to check if you're chipped (aka vaccinated) Police check the car; let's say 4 people car but signal only from 3; so, police stop it to chip the notyetchipped; signal from 4 now and police let the car go. This is prophecy by saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov. Notice police chip (aka vaccinate) people at gun point in Africa; so, no more \"it's not gonna happen here\" 'cuz it will soon enough, capisce? Police do it on highways or when you leave your city... basically, you can't leave your city unless you're vaccinated; but vaccine = mark of the beast; so, escape now while your city doesn't have these rules; forgive me. Gov't sprays chemtrails so that people feel symptoms of flu 5G will kill vaccinated; just read Georgia Guidestones' commandment of 500 million max population on earth; it fits with Orthodox Christian prophecy of 7 percent of people left Russian Orthodox prophecy also says that there will be unbearable stench in winter. So, there you go. Russian winters are cold. So, they must have died from the new disease that doesn't have a name 'cuz it's caused by 5G. martial law; Constitution was suspended; New World Order read Book of Revelation; Chapters 13 and 14, please chipped people will be influenced by super computers to receive World Passport (grey plastic card with no name on it), but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays If you escape mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to permanent heaven how to escape it? by hiding within a small group (10 - 15 people according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov); no documents; no electronics Project Pogo = Alex Jones, QAnon, Adam Green, etc. videos are put out so that gov't tracks who watches them. (Project Zyphr annihilates people who watch these videos). Drone with scopolamine will drill a hole in your window at 4 am (when electricity for your region has been turned off). Once gassed, you will come out to the police van (waiting for you outside) yourself; you will be taken to underground camp to be tortured for adrenochrome. The rest of the people will be secretly (or even openly) chipped when they sign up for food in closed stores AI (artificial intelligence aka demons) will post on your social media as if it were you doing it while you're on vacation; it will even make phone calls on behalf of you; no one will notice that you're missing in action.", 6341, "None", 0],
