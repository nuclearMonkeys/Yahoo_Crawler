However, if this is not ok then I recommend you to remove the graphic card and check it to other computer. If it is ok on that computer, then the problem may be the motherboard to your computer. Otherwise, if the graphic card does not work on other computer, then definitely the problem is on your graphics card. Then you may need to purchase a graphics card to solve the problem. thanks.", 10040, "None", 0],

Check there isn't another socket, possibly with a plastic cover over it., it should be blue with 15 holes. Or maybe they took out the graphics card and forgot to replace it. You do get monitors with USB ports, but they just extend the USB ports on the PC to a handier location, basically the monitor has a USB hub in it. You still need the seperate video cable to get picture.", 10040, "ffqsWfZtaa", 0],

If it is a card it may have become unseated.  Turn off your computer and open it up.  All ways touch the frame before you touch any cards.  Verify that the card is seated and if not re-seat it.  If this does not work then your video card may have gone bad and will need to be replaced. One other thing to check for is to verify that none of the pins on the cables have been bent.", 10040, "1qONRB7naa", 1],
	108175 : ["I have had problems of this nature in recent times... I believe you may be having some problem with your board. There can be two possibilities: namely, your board may not be having even power to boot the system properly..... That is a good problem because you could also use another power supply that is working fine to boot your system. However, the bad problem is that your mother board might have become damaged!!! For this you have to change the mohterboard.... I had a problem with now over 5 computers in my office and it is always very similar to what you have described... The PCs that had such problems were normally the Dell computers... It is most likely that overheating, or current overload might have damaged the board. I will advise you run this foollowing test: Open the system, Switch on the power, wait for few minutes, switch it off from the mains and physically feel the temperature of the components on the board... The fan, the microchips... If the components gets out very fast.... then you have no option than to consider changing your board... Best of luck...", 10040, "62cfe374b5fe272a2290201d53df5513aa", 1],

Never buy from a retail store such as office max, office depot, or walmart. Buy online, its much cheaper for a much better product. I'd recommend buying something around th $50 range unless you game a lot then you might want something a little more expensive. You will also need to check and see what kind of ports you have to plug in a video card. Most mother boards nowadays have PCI-E. If so, then you should have no problem. Ports like PCI and AGp are getting outdated so you may have alittle more issue with finding those.", 10040, "None", -1],
	108185 : ["I think your your problem could come from your power source. I had a similar problem, and I found out that my power source was faulty. The motherboard uses 5-12 V, and in my case a 12 V wire yielded only 2.6 V, so the motherboard was unable to power the video card, hence I had no signal. The other components connected to the power source worked (hdd, cd/dvd, even the cooler)... video cards usually don't get faulty just so, but power sources do. So I suggest to try another source.  If it does not work, the check your CPU and video card.", 10040, "AA10862697", 0],
