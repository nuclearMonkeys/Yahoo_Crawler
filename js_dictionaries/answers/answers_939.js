	52327 : ["+$20 is $20 more than they had before the donation... That could probably feed a lot of animals - since in that situation all they need is to be fed - it doesn't have to be gourmet - but even basic pet food costs money. $20 a month is very generous IMO! I've never donated at that frequency, but I can't really afford it... just a little bit here and there... but again 0 verses some amount I'd say that 0 is worse than at least a little something and I totally tip my hat to $20 a month.  It is very thoughtful and kind. ", 7346, "749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa", 0],

	52346 : ["I live fairly close to Dawson City, Yukon.   Our new hospital here has 5 rooms, only 1 of which can be isolated.  Housing is in short supply up here, so many live together closely with others.  We have been VERY lucky with Covid so far!  Other paces in the North have not - look at Arviat for an excellent example.  If Covid did hit here, the medical system would be unable to cope beyond the first patient.  The hospital in Whitehorse is pretty much full already without Covid, so even being Medevaced would not work.  And, only Watson Lake has a hospital apart from Dawson, and Whitehorse.  Most places up here rely in a nursing station that is only open during the day.  If that; many places have nothing at all. I am VERY glad to have been able to get both doses of the Moderna vaccine. I live alone, in a remote place, but I still have to go into town for supplies, and my mail - where I will be with other people.  Not having to worry about getting sick, and dying is a good thing.  Remote northern communities are not well equipped to handle things like a pandemic.  It didn't take many doses to cover the population up here as well.", 7324, "msNXomjTaa", 3],

	52379 : ["A possible reason is that there are now far too many on this site who are so utterly deluded that they think they can get away with saying whatever they like. There may be a number of other reasons but that would appear to be a distinct possibility and also the fact that it is known that towards the end the shaytan will expose himself. Although it sounds far fetched that is not impossible on a forum such as this which does have significant media focus. However, all of these things are directly related to the fact that Allah (swt) allows to go astray whomsoever He chooses and if this site is full of seriously evil people it may be that none of them now deserve any sort of warning about what is shortly to come. It is a sad and tragic irony that only from believers can non believers ever hope to learn anything which might be of use to them in terms of saving their lives or being of even greater value/benefit in the long term.   Without the light man is left to wander blindly in darkness but, since man seems to prefer the darkness lest his bad deeds be exposed to all, we will see, in that short while, whether man actually enjoys a world without light.   What the owners of this site actually have, in large quantities, is definite proof or evidence of the fall of mankind as spoken of in the scriptures, whether they care to acknowledge that or not. I suspect that they are somewhat less than enthusiastic about what, exactly, they have witnessed on here.  Not trying to do something to stop individuals who are in the process of bringing about the end of the earth is a sin almost beyond comprehension if not a crime against humanity itself.  So be it.  Oh and btw they would appear to have an almost inexhaustible supply of excuses as to why no one, on earth, 'in their right minds' should try to stop them since they are the new 'saviours of the world' .........

	52392 : ["To answer your question. The English name Easter is of uncertain origin; the Anglo-Saxon priest Venerable Bede in the 8th century derived it from the Anglo-Saxon spring goddess Eostre.” Others link it to Astarte, the Phoenician fertility goddess who had the Babylonian counterpart Ishtar. Hares, rabbits: These are symbols of fertility “handed down from the ancient ceremonial and symbolism of European and Middle Eastern pagan spring festivals.”​—Encyclopædia Britannica. Some cultures believed that the decorated Easter egg “could magically bring happiness, prosperity, health, and protection.”—Traditional Festivals. The American Book of Days well describes the origin of Easter: “There is no doubt that the Church in its early days adopted the old pagan customs and gave a Christian meaning to them.” The Bible warns against worshipping God by following traditions or customs that displease him. (Mark 7:6-8) Second Corinthians 6:17 states: “‘Separate yourselves,' says Jehovah, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing.'” Easter is a pagan holiday that those who want to please God will avoid.", 7315, "dvmo9ooEaa", -1],
