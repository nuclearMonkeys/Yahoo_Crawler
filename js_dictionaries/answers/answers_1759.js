I will be certain that if Obama picks a woman or a Black or a Hispanic, it will be because he disregarded ability and qualifications. Obama cares nothing about properly interpreting the Constitution, he just wants someone \"who can empathize with a poor woman\".

Appoint enough Supreme Court justices with \"empathy\" for particular groups and you would have, for all practical purposes, repealed the 14th Amendment, which guarantees \"equal protection of the laws\" for all Americans.  The biggest danger in appointing the wrong people to the Supreme Court is not just in how they might vote on some particular issues-- whether private property, abortion or whatever. The biggest danger is that they will undermine or destroy the very concept of the rule of law-- what has been called \"a government of laws and not of men.\"", 9482, "a92cce07a2845569186ec10ae10457cbaa", 4],

	93663 : ["Hope it will help, These are the things I use/do to stay dry when it is needed:   1. Drysol is aluminum chloride hexahydrate and when applied to the underarms manages to block the sweat glands and plug the pores. It is a prescription medication and should only be used with a doctor's guidance.  2. Try wearing a ordinary, white, 100% cotton t-shirt underneath your normal shirts. This will be your first line of defense against sweat puddles shaping on your outer shirt. Also, the white t-shirts are easy to bleach/oxy-clean the stains out of.  3. Recall that if it happens to be your feet that are sweating excessively, try taking an extra pair of shoes and socks with you in the morning. Change both about halfway through your day. While it won't eliminate the sweating it will keep your feet dry.  4. Make sure you shower regularly. This will help to minimize effects of over-sweating. By showering as necessary you can eliminate as much of the bacteria that causes body odor. If you do sweat while you're clean you won't smell as much as sweating when you're unclean.  a. Try anti-bacterial soaps to neutralize additional bacteria while you shower.  5. Maintain less body hair. You may find with decreasing your body hair you can control body odors connected with over-sweating. Hair traps a lot of the bacteria and oils that cause odor when combined with sweating.  6. Drink plenty of water. It both dilutes the concentration of your bodily effluents and it cleanses the entire system.  7. Check the weather forecast each day and put on clothing appropriately.  8.Invest in a small fan to keep in your work area. You may sweat less because it is cooler and the air circulation will help perspiration to evaporate much faster.  9. Watch your weight. Heavier people have a harder time cooling themselves and may sweat more. Try getting to a healthy weight and your perspiration issues may solve themselves.

So if you don't want little sweat stain i suggest getting a clinically proven one from your drugstore, wich means that you won't have little sweat stains because it make you not sweat.

	93666 : ["I'm glad that a U.S. government-funded project was awarded the Nobel Prize.  That shows it has some merit!  Hopefully the researchers will put their prize money toward further research and not personal gain. Most research projects are funded by the government, you'd be surprised.  I worked at a university doing research for many years.  There is always more to learn, and I hope that we will continue to fund research that is going to help us learn more and continue to be a world-leader in this capacity.  Some research is b.s., make no mistake about that, but some is very relevant, and we can't afford not to explore the possibilities! Government research dollars will always be spent - way above anyone's health care or tax breaks or whatever - but as a world leader, we have to be on the front-line of innovative discoveries.  It is as important to fund research as it is to fund our military.
