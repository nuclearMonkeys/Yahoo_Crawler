I love how people say they aren't advocating anything or they aren't being derogatory or they aren't flaming and then proceed to do just that.  It would like walking up to someone and saying \"Hey, not trying to be mean or rude but... you suck.\"  Really?  You are, just you don't want people to call you on it.  \"But I SAID I wasn't trying to be mean!\" And by deviant you mean different from what YOU consider the norm.  Because its really all about what YOU'RE comfortable with, right?  I mean, not trying to be blunt...", 8498, "4ESlizXraa", 11],
	69290 : ["You \"seem\" to allready have your mind made up. Your comparison of pedophiles to same sex relations is a slippery slope fallacy. Why aren't you comparing straight relations to pedophilia, especially since the VAST MAJORITY of pedophiles are HETEROSEXUAL (since gays only make up 10% of the population)? Pedophiles are not BORN-they are MADE. When a pedophile preys upon child (& you read correctly, PREYS upon a child), that child is now more likely to prey upon children when they become an adult. Then that adult preys upon new children, & the cycle continues. The only way this vicious cycle stops? 1. Get those children who are victims of pedophilia counseling/therapy so they can have a chance of forming relationships with people their own age when they are ready for it. 2. Every adult who is a pedophile needs to be thrown UNDER the jail. Or, better yet, put them in with general population. The vast majority of prisoners have had some type of sexual abuse/assault as a child, & that pedophile won't last 8hrs. Pedophiles go after one of the most vulnerable segments of our society: CHILDREN. Children's minds, bodies, & reasoning skills are NOT fully developed. There are laws to protect children from harm, sometimes under the protest of the child/children the law is protecting. These children can be taken advantage of by an adult (ever heard of the saying as easy as stealing candy for a baby?). And THEY CAN NOT GIVE CONSENT. Period. Same sex relationships are between CONSENTING adults. The age of consent depends on the laws of that state/country/community (usually 18). Both parties know what they're getting into for the relationship, be it for sex, companionship, emotional connection, whatever. So, when you attempt to compare gays to pedophiles or people into bestiality, you are making an incorrect analogy. Our similarities end at the fact that we are PEOPLE, & we should be treated like everyone else for following/breaking the law. And for you to insinuate that we are the same is just feeding into the fear/lies of those who think that gays are the same as pedophiles, people who want to many more than 1 person, people who want to marry a close relative (closer than a 1st cousin here in the US), or people who want to have a relationship with animals. You don't have to like gays or pedophiles. But for YOU to compare the relationship between me & my wife to those adults who prey on children or those who have sex outside the SPECIES? Please use some common sense. Our relationships hurt NO ONE. Pedophilia will hurt that VICTIM, & other children if that VICTIM isn't given the proper therapy/treatment.  Bestiality can damage the animal and/or the PERSON performing the act. Deviants are found in the STRAIGHT community as well.  Why don't you post your question their about sexual deviant behavior instead of trying to insult our intelligence & our LIVES?", 8498, "spbqfjvbaa", 9],

I can`t believe how kind you are to that jerk of a man. He does not deserve that at all my friend. A partnership is all about sharing and caring for each other, and I can not see that you are getting yours at all. He is a no good vampire my friend, get him out before he takes all out of you.

But since you did ask, let me try to enlighten you. Homosexuals are consenting partners who mutually engage in sexual activities.  Homosexuality has been documented in most animal species around the world, so while it is not the most common form of sexual relationships, it is completely normal and acceptable behavior for any mammal.  Pedophiles are adults who need to have sex with children, usually through coercion or actual force and usually because they feel weak and powerless among their peers so they seek a sexual partner they can easily dominate.  Even if a child is a willing partner, they are of such a young age they are not capable of negotiating a fair mutual relationship with an adult.

We received a large box with all the mice in retail packaging, complete with the hole that they would be hung on a peg in a retail store.  Now, this does not mean you will get EXACTLY what we did.  You may want to order 10 or 20 of an item and you might get a big box with 20 smaller boxes in it, each item packed in it's own box.  It really depends on the company you purchase from.  ", 8510, "f841afbad67e2febaf16f5f41aea6d1eaa", 4],
