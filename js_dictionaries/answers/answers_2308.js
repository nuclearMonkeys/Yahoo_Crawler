Things seem confusing and meaningless now, but within a few more years the conflict will be taking on a definite form, and within 20 years at most there will be victory on one side or the other.

Even if the radical islamists win, they will be unable to stifle the spirit of creativity that will come after the war, though they will certainly have influence upon it.   I have noticed in my lifetime (I'm a Boomer) a change in the English language which may be comparable to the changes taking place in Chaucer's time.  When I was young, everybody understood Elizabethan English quite well, even though we didn't normally speak it.  This is because it was the language most commonly used in Church (except for Catholics, who used Latin, and Orthodox, who used their own languages) and in the most popular translation of the Bible, the King James Version.  Shakespeare and Mallory weren't hard to understand because we already knew the language.  But in the 60's there came a plethora of modern Bible translations and most churches modernized their worship services.  As a result, young people now are mostly not familiar with Elizabethan English.  At the same time, changes in technology and means of communication are producing changes in the English language.

	121224 : ["All sorts of factors affect the suitability of the human body fluids to sustain life; these include properties like temperature, salinity, and acidity, and the concentrations of nutrients such as glucose, various ions, oxygen, and wastes, such as carbon dioxide and urea. Since these properties affect the chemical reactions that keep bodies alive, there are built-in physiological mechanisms to maintain them at desirable levels. There are limits both of heat and cold that a warm-blooded animal can bear, and other far wider limits that a cold-blooded animal may endure and yet live. The effect of too extreme a cold is to lessen metabolism, and hence to lessen the production of heat. Both catabolic and anabolic changes share in the depression, and though less energy is used up, still less energy is generated. This diminished metabolism tells first on the central nervous system, especially the brain and those parts concerned in consciousness. Both heart rate and respiration rate become diminished, drowsiness supervenes, becoming steadily deeper until it passes into the sleep of death. Occasionally, however, convulsions may set in towards the end, and a death somewhat similar to that of asphyxia takes place. On the other hand, too high a temperature hurries on the metabolism of the various tissues at such a rate that their capital is soon exhausted. Blood that is too warm produces dyspnea and soon exhausts the metabolic capital of the respiratory centre. Heart rate is increased, the beats then become arrhythmic and finally cease. The central nervous system is also profoundly affected, consciousness may be lost, and the patient falls into a comatose condition, or delirium and convulsions may set in. All these changes can be watched in any patient suffering from an acute fever. The lower limit of temperature that man can endure depends on many things, but no one can survive a temperature of 45°C (113°F) or above for very long. Mammalian muscle becomes rigid with heat rigor at about 50°C, and obviously should this temperature be reached the sudden rigidity of the whole body would render life impossible.", 10663, "None", 0],

No one has a right to mock anyone. As my mother use to say, \"But for the grace of God there go I...\" Any of us could be that person, but we've been blessed. The thing is that I posted several questions this week about forum racism from Fred C...very few people criticized this. The only Filipino brother to speak out against this use of the \"N\" word was Kizmahwhat. I respect him for that. The thing is that Fred C actually got 3 thumbs up from people for his racism. To me, I respect Fred's honesty...I have a bigger problem with people who hide in the shadows with their racism giving him thumbs up and no one knows who they are. I think black people should start speaking out against all racism, even against Filipinos. I think Filipinos should speak out against racism against black people. Dr. Martin Luther King said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat upon justice everywhere.\" I we allow people to use racism against others without checking it, we must expect it to eventually find it's way to us. It is probably what we get for our own hypocracy. I have been called a racist in this forum when my wife is not black.

	121243 : ["\"School at Home\" means different things to different people, and it is not necessarily bad-- it just  isn't right for everyone. Here are the forms of homeschooling that I feel I can define with some degree of accuracy: Unschooling-  The child learns what they want when they want.  The parent doesn't require the child to study anything, however they do provide a rich environment with plenty of learning opportunities, and they do watch for interests that can be used to incorporate learning of certain basic skills and take advantage of those as they come up. Relaxed homeschooling- Similar to unschooling except that the child is required to do some basic subjects like reading, writing, and arithmetic, though perhaps not  all three every day. School -in-a-box method.  You buy the whole curriculum from one supplier and teach from it every day, trusting that the people who designed the curriculum know what your child needs better than you do.  (Can you tell this is my least favorite option?) Charlotte Mason method.  This method incorporates lots of reading out loud, nature study, using literature to learn about History.  Copywork, narration, and dictation are all used to teach Grammar, usage, spelling, and writing mechanics.  There is a strong emphasis on developing a love for learning in the child.  There is a lot of attention to developing good habits, strong moral character.  Latin is usually studied at some time, preferably by fourth grade. Classical Method. Very similar to the Charlotte Mason method, but there are a few key differences.  Classical Education always covers History in Chronological order, while according to Charlotte Mason's original writings History could be studied based on whatever literature the child was reading at the time.  Classical Education usually organizes other subjects around a four or five year plan for studying world history, so literature, science, art, etc. are all arranged around the history plan.  American History is usually studied only in the context of World History, rather than alone.  There is lot of emphasis on memorization.   Copywork, narration, and dictation are used, but in a slightly different way than taught by Charlotte Mason.  In addition, Grammar, Spelling, and mechanics is studied formally, rather than only through the copywork, narration and dictation.  Latin is studied, preferably starting no later than 4th grade. Unit Study approach-  Studies are conducted around a topic, while studying this topic you cover other subject areas.  For instance, lets say you decide to study birds.  You would read books about birds and perhaps write reports about them (Language Arts).  You would draw or paint pictures of them, or make birds out of clay (fine arts).  You would build bird houses and bird feeders (wood-shop).  You would track migratory paths, and calculate the miles traveled by certain types of birds (Geography). You might study the effects humans have had on bird populations throughout the years (History and Math).  You would study different birds' habitat, diet, mating habits, anatomy, and physiology (biology, natural science).  You would study how a bird flies, what keeps him up (Physics).  Many people who do unit studies also study one or two subjects separately to make sure they get covered adequately, math is a real common one to be studied apart form the Unit at hand. Units can also be designed around things like Character traits, though I think you would have to be more creative to integrate lots of other subjects around that. Then there are the eclectic homeschoolers like myself.  We research lots of methods and pick and choose what we like from each.  For instance, I like many things about the Charlotte Mason and Classical approaches, I also like Unit studies.  So I end up teaching History Chronologically, and grouping other subjects around History.  I incorporate lots of \"living books\" like Charlotte Mason, and when I get to the appropriate time period I plan to park for a while on American History by doing a Unit Study based on the Little House books, then I will continue with the classical outline of History.  When I do the copywork, I don't exactly follow Charlotte Mason's methods, I feel she required too much perfection.  But when it comes to rote memory I agree more with Charlotte Mason than with the classical method, I feel its important to memorize some things, like multiplication facts and a few Poems, but I just don't see the value in having my son labor to memorize the names of a bunch of Egyptian Pharaohs.   So you can see, someone who was strict about Charlotte Mason methods would disagree with me in how I do the copywork and dictation sessions, and someone who was strictly classical might disagree with me about the memorization.  Both would probably object to me taking a year to focus on American History through the Little House Unit study.   This is the beauty of homeschooling though, you can read up on all of these methods and blend them into your own unique method. Here are some books I recommend reading: A Charlotte Mason Companion. The Well Trained Mind Homeschooling, take a deep breath, You can do this. So You're thinking About HOmeschooling. The Everything Book of Homeschooling. The HOmeschool Source Book.

Unschooling, there is no formal work, you and your children live and work alongside each other, making use of teachable moments, and your childs questions and interests. 2. Unit study: you choose a topic and relate all your subjects to this topic, so if you chose water in one day in history you would discuss water systems in Ancient times perhaps, do clouds, rain, the water cycle etc in Science, find the water courses in your country on a map in Greography etc. Often these are very hands on unit studies, but not always. 3. computer based (cd rom)lessons, often linked to Internet 4.Classical education: focus on learning classic languages like Latin, Greek, and Grammar etc 5.Eclectic: a mix 'n match of various methods I can give examples of curricula to purchase for each type if you need.

I'm trying to take the prescribed \"Tolkien\" fantasy beyond what it's become because fantasy is too broad to try limiting to one type of story structure. News also inspires me. I read an article about a black family in my area whose son was shot dead and the police did nothing to solve the homicide because of their race. Or how another family whose siblings hate each other, didn't tell the hated sibling that their parent died. So that sibling missed the funeral, didn't get to say good bye and was completely excluded. Or how another family adopted a foreign child and ended up shipping him back to his country with nothing more than a sign taped to his shirt b/c the kid was psychologically unstable. etc. History and nature inspire me mostly in terms of world building. You wouldn't *believe* the stories behind some of the historical structures around the world. These stories are so touching I've cried. So I incorporate similar aspects of these things into my own stories. And since I'm trying to make my fantasy world completely unique and unlike anything done before in high fantasy, I mix and match aspects of nature in ways that are unexpected/impossible on Earth.  All the themes I address are those that I want to shout at people on a daily basis. I drop my daughter off at school, for instance, and hold the door for all of these parents and their kids. Not ONE of them thanked me. Or how this snooty \"mother\" kept pinching her daughter's side and telling her to stop complaining when her daughter said her new shoes hurt her feet. The mother cared more about appearance (nice named-brand shoes), over her child's comfort. This **** gets me going. I have a lot to say and the themes in my stories reflect this.

	121253 : ["An often-heard explanation is that it's because the Moon's gravity field pulls the water. This can't be the full explanation since the Moon pulls the solid Earth as well and does not pull the water *relatively* to the solid Earth. Also, somewhat contra-intuitively, there's high tide twice per day, namely when the Moon is highest on the sky but also when its on it lowest point below the horizon, when intuition might suggest that the Moon should be pulling water down rather than up. The correct answer is that the variation in the Moon's field of gravity (stronger the nearer you are to the Moon) causes the Earth to have a minimum of potential energy if it where slightly elliptic. Note that such an ellipsoid has a lower potential energy than a sphere even though the center of mass is the same. While the Oceans take the minimum-energy shape, the solid Earth is too rigid to get deformed into an ellipsoid. Maybe it's easier to understand this way: The Earth rotates around the common center of gravity for the Earth-Moon system. This rotation produces a centrifugal force directed away from the Moon. This centrifugal force is, on average, balanced by the gravity of the Moon.  The centrifugal field is F = r omega^2, where omega is the rotational speed of Earth in its orbit around the common center of mass, i.e. it grows linearly with r which is related to the distance from the Moon at a particular point of the Earth's surface, while the lunar gravitational force is F = - m G /d^2, where m is the mass of the Moon, G the gravitational constant and d is the distance from a particular point on Earth's surface to the Moon. The minus sign because the direction is the opposite as that of the centrifugal force. Now the total field affecting the ocean becomes r omega^2 -mG/d^2 differentiating with respect to r gives F' = omega^2+mG/(3d^3) which is always positive so that the field in the direction away from the Moon must be stronger the further away you come from the Moon. Since the average field must be zero (the gravitational and centrifugal force must balance eah other to keep the Earth in orbit), the field must be negative (i.e. directed towards the Moon) at thee location nearest to the Moon, and positive (i.e. directed away from the Moon at locations furthest away from the Moon.", 10665, "f9e0440f68f76a5bd4f5092af0531680aa", 0],
