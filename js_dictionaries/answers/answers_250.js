Scared not of the Yucca Man, well maybe a little, but mostly because my partner on guard duty disappeared. As a young Marine L/Cpl, I knew sh!t rolled downhill and I was at the bottom.

	12509 : ["I blame the astronomy community and some of the organizations which inflict ill-conceived \"outreach\" upon the public. Astronomy and space have become a joke amongst the scientifically-disinterested public, which means the vast majority of people. It is presented to the public as infantile idiocy. Expensive infantile idiocy at that. Just look at nasa. They spend a billion dollars to go to Mars, which is fair enough if it was demonstrated to the public that it was there for some noble purpose in the name of science, technology or art. But no. Nasa tells us that it is looking for ancient boogers! Boogers ffs! Here we are in the middle of a covid crisis and nasa spends a billion dollars to look for ancient fukking boogers up on Mars! No wonder people are appalled. And the malady doesn't stop there. Everything you read, see, or hear about space and astronomy drips with twaddle about \"life up in space\" Is this habitable. Is that a signal from boogiemen. Every time an exoplanet, moon, anything in space is the topic, the narrative inevitably turns to the possibility of boogiemen. What IS going on? Why the obsession with \"life\" up in outer space when we live on a planet with millions of species already? So now if you are game enough to let people know you are interested in astronomy, or worse, space, you get an odd look, a snigger, or just an embarrasing joke or nervous fidgeting as the person tries to get away from the \"nut\". Space has become a topic for infant school projects. Adults treat it as a joke. The suspicion arises that it is all fakery. It is up to us in the astronomy community, the IAU, and the space organizations to rectify this situation before the plug is pulled on all astronomy funding, and the masses come to the doors of the labs and observatories with pitchforks and clubs because of whatever pseudoscience has terrified them. It is up to us to present astronomy as a respectable science where we go to planets to do science, real science. Or we go there to demonstrate technology that is relevant to us here on Earth. Or we go for the brilliant and amazing imagery of landscapes that simply don't exist on Earth. We need to make astronomy and space respectable again. Lose the crappe about space boogers and the seemingly endless pseudoscience about \"habitability\" and people will once again treat the subject with the respect it deserves.", 2109, "bXMPytYEaa", 0],
