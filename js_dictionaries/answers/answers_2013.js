The other major difference is that in a film you deduce what the characters are thinking and feeling from what they do, whereas in a novel the writer has the opportunity to 'get inside their head' more and focus on their inner thoughts. A novel also gives you more opportunity to reveal backstory or background information (although this is a tool that should be used sparingly).", 9953, "g92UnU5eaa", 0],

I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary. 3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies. 4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means. 5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish. 6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life. 7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church. 8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise. 9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary. 10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven. 11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary. 12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities. 13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death. 14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ. 15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination. God bless! Dave", 9959, "None", -1],

	106438 : ["You have some very interesting ideas. You are right that science does not deal in absolutes. Of course there is more to this planet than the bible goes into. The Bible only focuses on one civilization for a course of a few thousand years. The Bible doesn't ans were a lot of questions, but it answers the ones that matter most. It tells us why we are here, who created us, how the world was made, how the first nations were formed, how we are supposed to live our lives, what is righteousness and what is sin. You could say that belief in God is both faith and fact based. Some facts that support this belief are: the Israelites managed to escape Egypt, the flood of the world left evidence behind, the prophesies in the Bible were correct, etc. Of course, one could argue that just because these things happened, doesn't mean that God made them happen, and they are right.

But when it comes to the spiritual realm, it cannot be known by the same methodology.  The spiritual realm exists beyond the grasp of our five senses.  Therefore the only way that we can know of it is if God reveals it to us.  And we must accept what God has told us by faith, since there is no other way we can know the truth about the spiritual realm. Nevertheless, we can be assured that we can really know the truth about this realm.  Christianity is based upon the premise that God Himself became a man in the person of Jesus Christ and revealed His truth to us.  This is clearly taught in the gospels.  And Jesus substantiated this by the numerous miracles He performed, the fact that He fulfilled many Old Testament prophecies concerning Himself, and His own resurrection from the dead, which was verified by hundreds, if not thousands of eyewitnesses.  And so because the messenger has been authenticated, we can therefore believe His message.  And the fact is, the gospel message of Jesus continues to this day to transform the lives of those who receive it by faith.  It is a supernatural phenomena.   And so we know the truth about the spiritual realm because God has revealed it to us in the person of Jesus Christ and clearly authenticated it by visible proofs so that we can be confident of knowing the truth about this unseen realm which we can only know by God revealing it to us.", 9959, "2U05EDTzaa", 1],
