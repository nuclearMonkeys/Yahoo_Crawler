Many people wrote of Christ's  actions, preaching, miracles, birth, death and Resurrection, but you claim there is no evidence.  Many wrote of God's many miracles, but you claim there is no evidence.  Many historical sights and places spoken of in God's word have been found and confirmed, but you claim there is no evidence.  \"Oh yea of little faith.\"  You have eyes but will not see and you have ears but will not hear. Your next hypothesis is equally erroneous in that religion is immune to normal skepticism.  As your letter it self aptly proves such is clearly not the case.  Atheists and skeptics such have yourself have been scoffing, to their detriment, at God's laws and words since biblical times.  However, it is my prayer that your eyes will be opened to God's love.

About a year ago, I realized that I believed in God for the exact same reasons I believed in   Claus. 1) It appealed to my Wishful Thinking 2) I was indoctrinated to believe in him from childhood on. The only difference was that eventually, everyone came clean about the   Hoax. People still try to purpetrate the God hoax on me. Just as with God, we had family discussions about who and what   Claus supposedly is.  Almost all of our friends also believed in  .  We grew up watching TV shows about   and how he wound up doing the things he supposedly does.  We sang songs about   in school, and in Sunday School.  People in public places, claiming to be  's helpers, would take our requests, and if that request came through, it was proof that   existed and loved us.  When questioned about the obvious physical limitations   would have to overcome to do the things attributed him, miracles and magic are invoked to explain/dismiss them. One might say that there is a big, big difference, that nobody with a rational mind would believe that reindeer can fly and that   could deliver presents to so many people over the world, but it is rational to believe that a virgin gave birth to a boy who would later regenerate limbs, cure diseases, raise the dead, and rise from the dead himself.

I believe how I do because my experiences, my searching, my own deep thinking on the subject confirm that God exists and that He loves me.  I don't know just know \"because the Bible tells me so\", I have countless examples from my own life where I feel that God has confirmed His presence in my life.

	87757 : ["How sad your life !!! You have bought into the irrational concept that ANY purely physical act can be immoral in and of itself.  That is incorrect!  To morally judge ANY purely physical act you necessarily need to know motivations and circumstances!   Furthermore, to call some act \"unnatural\" is to beg the question.  If it is a \"Natural\" part of nature, it is \"natural.\"  And if a relationship -- including one between same sex partners -- engenders true love, it IS MORAL.  And another problem:  Just because the Bible SUPOSSEDLY says something does NOT make it true!    (Please note that many Biblical scholars agree with my interpretation of scripture I spell out below). For 1700 years Christians claiming to be using the Bible, claimed that slavery was moral! For even longer Christians claiming to be using the Bible stated that women MUST be subject to the authority of men. Paul was WRONG about those things, and he is WRONG about homosexual acts.  Note how Paul talks about this.  He states that BECAUSE a man abandoned God, then God allowed his lust to drive him into engaging in homosexual acts. PAUL had NO real understanding of what homosexuality was all about.  How can you allow his irrational and ignorant lack of understanding rule your life? And YES I have studied the Bible.  There is a lot in there about love and committed relationships.  And NOTHING about condemning loving committed relationships between two gay people.  Paul ONLY understood homosexual acts from the point of view of LUST and abandoning God. But we now KNOW differently.  God made a certain percentage of us gay and there is nothing immoral about a loving relationship between two gay people. Don't do what I did.  Don't live 80% of your life before realizing that a committed gay relationship is NOT immoral.  Indeed it is a GOOD thing.  Both for the couple and for society. Your idea of a purely platonic relationship is not reasonable.  Nor is it necessary.  One of the greatest things in the life of a human being is a true loving intimate relationship with a person who CAN be our loving partner.  And for an exclusively gay individual, that must necessarily be another of our same sex. And if that relationship engenders true love, how can it be wrong? =========================== LOXLAND stated:  \"I am a Theology teacher and can answer you correctly. Homosexuality is not a birth defect but an acquired lifestyle, so both being gay and the act are perversion in the sight of God.\" BULL*****  Just because someone is a so-called \"Theology teacher\" does not make him right.   To use one's OWN suposedly infallible concept of right and wrong owned by one's own interpretation of a \"revealed truth\" in contradiction to truth uncovered by scientific inquirey flouts all good sense and reason.  It is this kind of person, using their own biases and prejudices as authority, who bring so much unnecessary pain and suffering into our society.  Truth can only be one and to dismiss a large portion of that uncovered by scientific inquirery because a tribal priest states something differently 3000 years ago, or a fanatical jewish pharesee, including mores from his fanatical and ignorant forebears, say different, is the epitomy of irrationality.  And ignores the need for justice. This person's reply shows that he is quite ignorant of knowledge not under his perview.  Note how he does not even allow the possibility of homosexuality being NEITHER a \"birth defect\" NOR \"an acquired lifestyle.\"  Neither is correct!  Sexual orientation IS NOT chosen!  Homosexuality is NOT an \"acquired lifestyle,\"  no more than is heterosexuality!   This person exhudes ignorance and bigotry.", 9268, "AA10311549", 0],
