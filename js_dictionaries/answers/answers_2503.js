	130972 : ["Of course, you are right. Government money should not be used regardless of the level of controversy surrounding the research. I wonder if Hillary would consider the death of unborn children so this \"research\" can continue a \"ban on hope.\" The dead children sure don't have any hope. Sadly, this is all about politics and not science. The research on embryonic stem cells has given us nothing. The best \"hope\" has actually come from adult stem cells.

	130977 : ["LOL.  They do seem to have more excuses than titles. I never understood the Bartman excuse.  It's not like it was the last out of the last inning.  He didn't even reach over the wall onto the field.   Had the cubs left fielder (I forget his name) not pitched a tantrum like a 3-year old, the fans would not have gotten so upset, and the team may have \"held it together\" better, and not blown the lead.", 11090, "None", 0],
	130978 : ["I don't' think you can prove a religion false or true? if you could... well, we would all either be religious, in one religion, or none of us would be? why do conservatives use such bad examples that prove nothing?", 11086, "cUvt0H5Zaa", -1],

	130981 : ["They use the term \"non combatants\", which means they (legally) avoid th Geneva Convention. It's a pity the US has lost all it's moral authority after 11./9/2001. This allows terrorist sin Europe to avoid being sent to the USA as it seems to have a  judicial system closer to the Yemen and Iran than a modern democracy. So, in the meantime those terrorists are kept secure in other jails and the American justice system can't judge them, basically GITMO has been a real backward step for America.", 11085, "lqPCAnI1aa", 2],

I was tortured for working on my prosthetic legs in the basement. I done absolutely nothing illegal or wrong. They thought that in theory it is possible to hide bomb in them. They saw an opportunity to get famous, so they were trying to torture me till I sign their insane story. They tortured me using more than 100 different torturing methods and trust to me waterboarding is not how they torture nowadays. I dont know where to find justice. I think that after 9/11 things got out of control. Freedom fighters became tyrants. In 1945, most Germans had an opportunity to learn about Nazis death camps.

If somebody does not meet these criteria then they can be classified as 'illegal combatants' and after a quick tribunal to verify that they in fact did not meet these requirements - summarily executed. The really sad part of this whole affair is the creation of a new international custom that there is no requirement to obey the laws of war in order to get the protection of the laws of war. Is it not ironic that the last enemy we fought who obeyed the laws of war were the Nazis?
