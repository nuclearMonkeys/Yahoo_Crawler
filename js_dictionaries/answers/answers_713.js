	39739 : ["Looking back, I see that I actually got involved here around \"a decade ago,\" based on Yahoo's timestamp of my answers. Yahoo helped me get through some tough times too, although not in the obvious sense.  I never asked questions, I only answered...but I think that's what was so helpful:  it made me realize that, no matter what I was dealing with, there were other people out there, going through something, or just looking for answers.  For those questions I chose to answer, I tried to answer them as clearly and completely as I could, in the hopes that I was actually providing some help. It also gave me a *little* of a sense of community--although again, not in the obvious sense.  I didn't make any connections with anyone here, and there were definitely times when I was curious how a particular situation may have turned out, but I didn't inquire further.  I think it was just a neat place to come to because, for me, there was always a new group of people here, asking and answering questions. Another thing I enjoyed--and which I will sorely miss--is the continuity.  There were times in my life when I checked in regularly over the span of a few days, answering questions and checking my feedback, and then there would be gaps of weeks (or even months) before I would think to come back, but I always enjoyed the sense of knowing that, hey, it's there, it will always be there...and there will always be someone who can possibly benefit from the advice I can offer.  *shrug*  It's a teachable moment for me, a reminder:  nothing lasts forever.  As the title for the last episode of \"Star Trek:  The Next Generation\" says, \"All Good Things...\" I don't know who'll read this, but I just want to say that I'll miss this place, and for those of you with whom I interacted, I hope that Yahoo Answers (and my answers in particular!) helped you get to a better place in your personal journey.  And, as I've often ended my answers: \"I wish you the very best of love and luck!\"", 5843, "kNMIp6J2aa", 0],
