I've heard it's more of a smoother high. wherein there is no choking or coughing that occurs. but  you don't need a filter, marijuana just needs a good cleaning and a decent roll job. and why would you fill your doob with anything else besides the pot? perhaps you should just smoke a bowl.", 10394, "None", 0],

	114699 : ["It depends on the year/series as to how easy it is.  I'm guessing you have an E46 325xi sedan.  The biggest obstacle you face is that BMW never made the E46 M3 as a sedan, so none of the factory parts will fit (at least, not at all easily) since the fenders and more are different between the coupe and sedan.   Instead you'll have to look to the aftermarket for a kit that gives you the M3 \"look\".  Unless you know what you're doing, it's difficult to get one of those to fit properly so that it truly looks factory, and paying someone to do it is expensive. If you want an M3 look, better to save your money and get the real thing.  That way you get more than the look, you get the mechanical goodies that are what an M-car is really all about.", 10395, "sCqdisvnaa", 0],

The serial number is used to identify the specific computer you have, which is only important to the manufacture if you send it into them for repairs because they track that information for warranty purposes and to track potential problems with the manufacturing lot, everybody else shouldn't give a flip about it because it doesn't affect a thing. -----------Since it looks like its the OS registration you need-------------- If you can't boot the computer up at all you'll need to contact the manufacture for the OEM registry for that model, and in this case the serial number is important, the manufacture should be able to provide you with this information, usually at no charge.

	114704 : ["Oh girl friend I feel your pain! I used to believe in soul mates. It is a great and wonderful thought. But bottom line is the reason people used to stay married for life is because of what society told us. back then they believed if you make a commitment then you stick to it. And you know what? Turns out that there spouse was their soul mate. Because they followed though. Did the right thing. Now a days things are disposable. It isn't right. Cheating is a high. Like all highs you will come down. Like all highs you may lose it all. And in the beginning of ANY relationship it is like butterfly's in your tummy. So wonderful. But as time passes they go away. And either you move on to the next level. or you divorce and or cheat. You are not rally happy right now. He fills a void. But in the end I bet you would end up where you are right now.

Your chances depends on your equities: how long you have been in the country, if you have American born kids, if you are married to an American citizen, Will your employer be willing to sponsor you. If you have lots of equities, then you or your lawyer can file for a waiver and go from there. But right now your biggest battle is to try not to be convicted of this crime, so start by hiring a lawyer who can work out a deal with the prosecutor to try to reduce the charges. Again that may cost you lots of money. You wanna play, you pay to play. Right?

Anyone who has to ask \"will i\" with the counts and charges listed is either unfamiliar with the legal system or making up stories to impress someone.  Now if you had said that you tried a new self controlled birth method, impregnated your sister or had a weapon/spray paint on you well I would have given you a benefit of doubt but hey two out of three ain't bad. \"Pls help reverse pullout possible pregnant?\" \"Pls help i pregnated my sister?\" If by some strange chance you are stating a truth may I suggest continuing schooling during your incarceration time.", 10398, "h6c0qGwaaa", -1],
