	79211 : ["If you are teaching driving you can ask the BMV, but if you are just teaching your kids I strongly discourage it. You need to teach your trainee that movement while driving is GOOD IF it has to do with the driving. For instance, if you are at a stop sign and you are showing someone what to do then teach by your motions- by turning your head, looking behind you in your mirror...hey, there is nothing saying you can't look in the back while you are telling your trainee things like, \" Now you are looking in your mirror right?\"... there is a lot to be said about literally SHOWING someone how to do something.    If you are an instructor i assume you need that whole demeanor as if you are in complete control and cool about things, so i can understand the mirrors.     One last thing, if you are a good driver then you can't go wrong in instructing someone. if you have bossy kids and the fly off at the mouth over every little thing then you need to stay 100% calm and collected while you are teaching them. You can be aggressive, but be relaxed too. Teach them that driving will become second nature and that going about it the right way develops good safe habits. Good Luck ,and I might look for the mirrors at JC Witney.", 8977, "1cCk1s5Vaa", 0],

Then we surely dated while i grew to become into 19. It grew to become into on and stale 'flings' i think in between those 5 years. as quickly as we finally made it respectable, we only dated for a month, even with the undeniable fact that it grew to become into the main intense month ever. He stopped calling in many situations and as quickly as we did communicate he grew to become into incredibly distant. It looked like he grew to become into making up excuses for not with the flexibility to hold close out or perhaps communicate on the telephone...and he did call for all time and that i grew to become into the affection of his existence etc. i could not understand why he grew to become into treating me that way. Then he finally only broke up with me and that i found out that he grew to become into snoozing with yet another lady a week later. He in no way cheated on me, yet he needed out so he could sleep with different ladies. i think i could provide him credit for that, good? It grew to become into super puzzling to recover from him and that i cried so puzzling each evening and the days only dragged on without him. ultimately, I have been given over him. by some means, after each little thing grew to become into reported and completed, we made pals back. I propose, we've been pals for 5 years before we've been bf/gf. he's informed me how stupid he grew to become into for letting me circulate and he observed himself settling down with me---he only wasn't waiting to cool down at that factor. And he's jealous of my modern boyfriend and this and that. i think confirmed for it. That i grew to become right into a stable lady buddy and he grew to become into interior the incorrect. So, i think my advice to you, is to easily permit him circulate. you're able to truly have been there for the different or long gone via a team of issues...and he could have informed you you are the affection of his existence...yet he's screwing around with different ladies. do not cheapen your self as a results of candy issues he tells you. movements talk louder than words and good now he's only enjoying video games. of path, it incredibly is lots extra handy reported than completed, yet in time you would be over it and with somebody lots extra advantageous.

For my son, the right time was at 22 months; that's when he was fully (day and night) trained.  Others don't until they're over 3.  I knew a little girl who was close to 4 before she got it.   You hit the nail right on the head.  You can't rush him if he's not ready; in fact, rushing him can delay the process even more.

Give it a month of talking on a friendship basis. If he gets another girlfriend within that time you have your answer. If he's still waiting for you at that time, you also have your answer.

The only thing they can't do is accelerate which isn't really a problem as if you don't want to continue driving you can just release the pressure on the accelerator. I would give it a try first.  If you are really worried ask your instructor to start you off in a car park or somewhere with no traffic so you practice taking control of the car with no danger of an accident. I also think that people who are more cautious when they start driving end up better drivers.  If you are over-confident you are more likely to crash.

	79239 : ["The evidence for evolution is and has been interpreted from a Philosophical and ideological Bias, The answers given by adherents to Evolution here in R&S is proof of the bias and agenda, Atheism has to have an alternate explanation—other than a Creator—for how the universe and life came into existence. Darwin once identified himself as a Christian but as a result of some tragedies that took place in his life, he later renounced the Christian faith and the existence of God. Evolution was invented by an atheist. What is sad is that Christians are falling into this Trap and trying to fit evolution into the Bible (Theistic Evolution) thinking they can make it fit. Lee Stroble in his video listed below “ The Case for the Creator” stated (5 min. 28 sec into the video) The Case for a Creator   That  “There is no way you can Harmonize Neo Darwinism with Christianity, I could never understand Christians who would say “ Well I believe in God yet I believe in Evolution as well” You see Darwin's idea about the development of life led to his theory that modern science now generally defines as an undirected process completely devoid of any purpose or plan,”. Now how could God direct an undirected process? How could God have purpose in a plan behind a system that has no plan and no purpose? It just does not make sense. It didn't make sense to me in 1966 and it doesn't make sense to me now. The Apostle Paul wrote to His Son Timothy stating that “ in 2 Timothy 4:3-4 “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, [because] they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn [their] ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.” Those Christians who believe in evolution have no idea how that effects their theology.
