They never show you that or any of the other anti-American, anti- Bush, or anti-Obama protests in the USA media either. Calling it sniper fire by terrorist is so typical of the US government, than admitting nobody likes them.

	65007 : ["The ACLU is only concerned about left-wing \"progressive\" issues, which completely follows their founding ideals.  Their ideals were based on socialist/communist teachings.  Roger Nash Baldwin founded the organization, and was a self-proclaimed communist.  His close associates, including Elizabeth Flynn, were also members of the Communist Party.  The group claimed that they no longer supported the Communist Party platform in 1940 after seeing how totalitarian governments in Nazi Germany and the USSR were becoming brutal, and they were also in fear of anti-Communist sympathies in the USA at the time.  They did not abandon their \"progressive\" socialist views. They get around the 2nd Amendment issue by claiming that this amendment only applies to the state national guard and that the founding fathers didn't really mean \"the right of the people\" when they wrote it, although the founders meant it everywhere else in the document.", 8292, "KTM5JEkLaa", 24],
	65008 : ["Sure they do. Don't let any ideologies with their own agendas fool you. A statement from the ACLU itself. \"Given the reference to \"a well regulated Militia\" and \"the security of a free State,\" the ACLU has long taken the position that the Second Amendment protects a collective right rather than an individual right. For seven decades, the Supreme Court's 1939 decision in United States v. Miller was widely understood to have endorsed that view. The Supreme Court has now ruled otherwise. In striking down Washington D.C.'s handgun ban by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in D.C. v. Heller held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms, whether or not associated with a state militia. The ACLU disagrees with the Supreme Court's conclusion about the nature of the right protected by the Second Amendment. We do not, however, take a position on gun control itself. In our view, neither the possession of guns nor the regulation of guns raises a civil liberties issue.\"", 8292, "k6BHL3IHaa", 0],
	65009 : ["Its probably because they only have been taught keynesian economics in the pubic schroools that are state controlled and never learn about supply side economics to any degrees worth. Its hard to believe so many people believe that raising taxes benefit the economy. Lowering taxes worked under both Reagan and Bush. The government ends up collecting more because of increased economic activity.", 8279, "U60KCkdcaa", -3],
	65010 : ["That's not it. It's not that we think the average person benefits from higher taxes on the rich, it's that we know the average person does NOT benefit from *lower* taxes on the rich. We reject the historically dis-proven idea that if you lower taxes on the rich jobs and prosperity will magically fall from the sky. When Reagan did it the only people who benefited were luxury businesses like jewelry stores and furriers. The answer to the deficit/national debt is to reduce spending and raise revenue. The key word there being *and*. It is not the liberals who are insisting that \"everything be on the table\" except for raising taxes. Taxes have to be part of the solution IN ADDITION to lowering spending, particularly defense spending. This question is better directed towards conservatives. ~~~~  I sympathize with your desire to simply ignore Bill Clinton's presidency as it blows your assertions completely out of the water. Unfortunately reality is not that convenient.", 8279, "XV2xtrplaa", 1],
	65011 : ["Because historically, when taxes have been high unemployment was low. When taxes have been low, unemployment has been high. What happened to unemployment since the famous Bush tax cuts? This is likely due to the fact that when taxes are low the rich just keep the money we pay them. When taxes are high the rich spend the money so that they do not have as much to pay taxes on. They spend the money paying more workers and on research and development.  This creates jobs. If you need to manage your debt, you cannot do it cutting spending alone. You need to increase revenue as well. You have to understand, the top tax rate is not there for people to actually pay, it is to get people to invest in business and to dissuade super-huge salaries. In short, if you made enough to get hit at the 94%, you'd want to do everything you can to drop your income, right? So you'd found a company, or take your salary in stock which means you'd be paid dividends, which is taxed at the lower capital gains. You'd be invested in your work, no point in jumping ship with a golden parachute if you then get taxed so heavily that you only get a fraction of it, yes?", 8279, "22ca5581dcd0b0b383647afbd8d78ea3aa", 1],

	65019 : ["I lean liberal, and partly, I don't.  Although, free birth control saves money and abortions.  It costs MUCH less than unwanted children on welfare. However, I'm embarrassed that so many Americans are not upset that the world's richest country  is not even in the top 30 in the world in highest life expectancy.  CNN admitted that part of that is our unhealthy habits, like overeating.  But they said health care for the poor is MUCH better in almost every other advanced democracy. I don't have a perfect solution.  Parts of Obamacare are good ideas, but the main thrust of it was to put poor people in the world's most expensive health care system WITHOUT CONTROLLING COSTS, and paying for it publicly.  Seems to me that controlling costs should come first.  Like I said, I don't know what to fix, exactly, but too many die from lack of access to quality health care.", 8281, "None", 1],
	65020 : ["college in the US is the most expensive for no reason.  We are ranked between 20th and 30th place on average in every subject when compared to other industrialized or allied nations. our healthcare is also expensive for no reason. Since insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies took over the healthcare system, prices have skyrocketed for greed alone.   again when compared to other countries, our medical system is no where near the top. and they offer free condoms at clinics, I never hear you people complain about that, for some reason sex ed and birth control are so offensive even though it has made unwanted pregnancies hit an all time low and did the same for abortions.  you support republicans even though they literally don't do anything for you unless you are a multi-millionaire or more.", 8281, "VFpbqOZNaa", 2],
	65021 : ["Tax rates are near a 50-year low, and it's not working very well. Republicans are somehow able to simultaneously say that things are going badly, the government is failing, and the cure is even more tax cuts.", 8282, "bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa", 1],

	65026 : ["How did we have such a strong and booming economy for almost 5 decades before Reagan, with a very high top marginal tax rate, and then get stuck with slow sluggish growth and a bubble economy during the decades following Reagan. You think oligarchs and banksters like Romney needs to pay even less than the 13.9% Romney paid, in the one year we know he paid anything in (as this is likely a lot higher than the years he won't show returns for)?  Or the non-existant corporate tax rate, which now has giant corporations operating tax free in this country. If we can get rid of these leaches, and replace them with people who actually want to do work, and behave responsibly, then I say good riddance to the Romney-like banksters and oligarchs.", 8283, "sSCCeZRuaa", -3],

	65030 : ["Millions have NOT been spent on this issue. Of the almost 60 cases on eligibility, Obama himself had to provide lawyers for only 3. Everything since the inauguration has been done by DOJ lawyers, almost every case before the election included other US and state officials as defendants and lawyers were provided by the DOJ and the states or by the campaign. Since no case has ever made it past the initial motions and motions to dismiss, no case has racked up significant lawyer time. Real estimates are more likely in the low tens of thousands.  \"sealing records\" is also cheap -- yours are just as sealed. Privacy laws lock up birth, school, travel, medical and other records.  The numbers come from FEC filings for the campaign, the election, the electoral college process, and setting up Organizing for America. Almost all of that was for non-birther claims. McCain spent almost as much up to the election and the EC process. Other presidents and candidates have similar numbers (including the folks in the 2000 lawyer-intensive process).", 8285, "fFnsJ7maaa", -1],
	65031 : ["Obama is spending millions in attorney fees to protect his real identity. One of the responders sais that all of the cases were thrown out. While that it true a judge does not automatically throw a case out unless there is a \"Motion to Dismiss\" Obama's attorneys have had a lot of success getting this accomplished with the liberal judges. Another responder states that Obama's Birth certificate is available for inspection, this is total Bullshlt There is a copy of a short form Certificate of Live Birth but does not prove he was born in Hawaii, all it proves is that he was born on a certain date. The only valid proof would be the long copy of his birth certificate. I do have a question about the one Obama has shown. Why is the date June 2007? I'm talking about the date from when the registrar stamped it. This was a full year before the question of his birth ever came up. Obama has had all of his college records sealed, you can find no publications from when he was in college and he will not release his thesis. There are no articles from when he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. This would be a first for any president of the Harvard Law Review. Why doesn't someone ask Obama what passport he used when he traveled to Pakistan in 1981. One of the dumber responders asked if Obama's last name was McCray would we still be asking these questions. I would like to remind him that in 2004 when John McCain ran against GWB they asked McCain for his birth certificate and tried to imply that he could not be the president. The difference is that McCain gave them every bit of information they asked for. The law at the time of McCain's birth was fairly complex so by an act of Congress McCain was found to be constitutionally qualified. When nominated by the DNC as candidate for President and Vice President, Nancy Pelosi and the Secretary of the DNC signed 2 copies of the Certification of Nomination. One copy said that both Obama and Biden were legally qualified by the Constitution of the United States to hold the offices. The second Certification stated that Obama and Biden were duly nominated.  If anyone thinks that Obama will run for re-election should consider that he will not get away with out answering these questions and showing empirical data to prove he is who he says he is. Watch for Jan 26th 2010, Judge Carter has set a tentative date for a trial to fore Obama to produce the requested documentation and has already rejected a two motions to dismiss", 8285, "1Fg7Tybvaa", 3],
	65032 : ["I think he is right, but I can understand why a lot of people don't feel that way right now. What people need to understand is that even if Obama is a great speaker, and a brilliant man, there are built in things in the way people vote that are going to work against him. And the notion that Hilary is more experienced has more to do with life experience than governament experience. I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but she probably has the best chance to win right now.", 8286, "xgsvHkJjaa", 3],
	65033 : ["I don't agree. Clinton, too often, contradicts herself and hurts others when she, herself, does not like being put down. Just saying. And her view on issues are somewhat strange.

For sure , I know she will get it if she can work out a deal with John Edwards at the convention.   John Edwards has nothing to lose at the convention and if he can get Hillary to agree to his terms he might possibly hand over his delegates.

Edit: \"Another example according science, is that men (generally) are better at solving logical problems and maths, while women are better at solving social problems and knowledge in language.\" Complete bull. If you know how society works, then you'd know that science and maths based subjects are catered MORE to men. If you look back at textbooks, then you'd see that most of the images would be of boys etc. Only in the last few years are they changing that. Small things like this make girls feel uncomfortable and put them off from doing these male dominated subjects.", 8288, "vIR1EhvBaa", -4],
	65040 : ["Feminism is an unnatural, artificial and abnormal product of contemporary social disintegration, which in turn is the inevitable result of the rejection of all trans­cendental, absolute moral and spiritual values.  The student of anthropology and history can be certain of the abnormality of the Feminist movement because all human cultures that we know of throughout prehistorically and historic times make a definite clear-cut distinction between “masculinity” and “femininity” and pattern the social roles of men and women accordingly.  The disintegration of the home and family, the loss of the authoritarian role of the father and sexual promiscuity have been directly responsible for the decline and fall of every nation which these evils become prevalent.     Some may argue that if this is so, why is Western civilization so extraordinarily vigorous and dynamic and despite its decadence and moral corruption, still unchallenged in its world-domination? Never has moral corruption and social decadence menaced mankind on such a universal scale as is the case now.  The adoption of feminist ideals degrades humans lower than the animals. For animals live by their instincts and cannot do anything opposed to their nature. Among animals, homosexuality is unknown.  The male is only attracted to the female of its own species. The male animal never goes with lust to another male or a female to another female. Among animals, the maternal relationship is completely severed as soon as the young are able to look after themselves. In most species, the father takes no interest in its offspring.  There is no such thing as modesty, chastity, marriage or filial ties among. beasts. These concepts are unique with human beings.  They are found in every culture at every stage of civilization and history. The feminists wish to abolish the very characteristics, which make man human and undermine the foundation of all his relationships and social ties. The result will be suicide, not only of a single nation as in the past, but of the entire human race. Islam and Feminism ", 8288, "None", 3],
