	42397 : ["Yeah but when some spoiled overgrown billionaire trust fund baby who never did a days honest work in his life puts down poor areas/neighborhoods, it's not right. What the hell does he know about growing up in that kind of an area? Some people didn't have any choice And they struggled with the desperate circumstances involved and don't like some fat waspy golf playing white dude sitting in judgment on them. I don't blame them. He should try keeping his fat mouth shut once in a while. Always letting it take over when his brain is on vacation.

Take a sandwich to work, brew your own coffee and eat lots of eggs.  Don't spend money on anything other than essentials.  'Bills' sound like money you did not need to spend.  Cut out everything that is not essential.  Rent, electric and water are essential, almost everything else is a luxury. If you still have a shortfall, start selling things that you own.
