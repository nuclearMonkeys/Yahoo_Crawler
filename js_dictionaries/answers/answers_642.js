	35913 : ["In the ring? No.   What made Tyson so formidable during his heyday was is raw physical talent and the underlying anger in his game.  That physically that defined him in his 20s simply cannot be duplicated in his 50s, and a lot of that youthful anger has also been mellowed with time. As for his public image, he definitely seems to be making a comeback of sorts.  If he dedicates himself to marketing himself and living a \"marketable\" life, he could possibly achieve more fame in retirement than he once had as a fighter.", 5391, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", -1],

	35915 : ["Yes. He was the epitome of pound for pound and he was a total package who could do it all. He was a legend amongst legends .

	35923 : ["That would have been a great match up. I remember Ali saying that Marciano hit extremely hard in their exhibition fight.  That is why I think the bomber will give him problems. I'll still give Ali the edge due to his speed and athleticism. I'll pick Ali to win 2 out 3 fights if they fought each other. ", 5375, "vrQdic06aa", 1],

	35925 : ["Who the hell knows.  Muhammad Ali was a greater champion, he had something like 19 title defenses compared to Rocky's 6. However, styles make fights. Marciano was a swarmer, much like Frazier and Norton, both of which gave Ali issues.    The cold truth is we will never know.    If you ask for my opinion, how i'd bet my money, i'd wager on Ali winning by decision. ", 5375, "xHsQFPsBaa", 2],
	35926 : ["Yes, but LeBron is \"woke\" and \"socially aware.\"  That's all that matter to the hacks at Ya-Poo Sports, or the Ethnic, Social justice and Politics Network.  That's why they want to shove all this \"LeBron as GOAT\" BS down the fans' throats because of his \"social activism,\" even though anybody with more than 14 functioning brain cells knows he's not even in the same zip code as Michael Jordan.  Jordan made the players on the court with him better, to the point where they won championships.  LeBron can't win without playing on a hand-picked team of stars of his choosing. Amazing, how the media overlooks James' hypocrisy by continuing to support the Communist regime in Beijing, the better to protect his Nike Money.  I guess it doesn't matter to media that Yellow Lives Don't Matter to James.
