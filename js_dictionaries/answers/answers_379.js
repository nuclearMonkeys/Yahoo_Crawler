	20556 : ["The only way to overcome your fear is to face it head on. That means, taking the opportunity to drive on main roads until you feel comfortable. Think of it like exercising a specific muscle. The more you do it, the stronger said muscle becomes. If you don't exercise the muscle you want to grow, then it leads to a deficiency and a lack of growth. The same when it comes to driving and learning to build your skills.  You could express your willingness to drive on main roads with your parents, and tell them why you need to get comfortable with it. The only way you will improve your driving skills is to introduce yourself to those situations that you don't know. Of course, the goal is to pass the driving course, but more than that, it should be to become a safe and skilled driver. There are a variety of situations that you will face, and the only way to improve is to encounter them. ", 3365, "XLXncQu9aa", 0],

	20561 : ["If a citation was issued, going to traffic school might be an option to avoid points and or a fine. In most states driving school is considered an interdiction and not a punishment. Having to take the practical part of the driving test is more likely.", 3367, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 1],

And the men are just as bad at it as the women. I am female and never have any problem backing up or parking. I have been told that here in Canada, in many cases, you don't need to know how to back up or park to get a driver's licence. They don't make you do it as part of the driving test.

No. If a thief sees something that he likes, he'll steal it. What prevents theft is your parking location. If you park under a light where it's easier for others to see, it makes it tougher for thieves. If you park in a dark area, it's easier for a thief to break in. ", 3364, "AQI7UBqpaa", 3],
