	18436 : ["The infrastructure bill will, if passed, be spent over IIRC the next eight years.  It will create a lot of construction and manufacturing jobs around the nation.  The border wall does create jobs, but it's super tiny.  It's also much less economically effective than the proposed infrastructure bill because the border wall is, at best, functionally useless and at worst actively destructive.  Economist John Maynard Keynes once quipped that the government should stimulate the economy by paying people to dig holes and then pay them to fill them in.  That's what the border wall is.  It \"creates jobs\" in that it pays people to do something.  But at the end of the day the work they did is useless.  The infrastructure spending has more impact because not only are we paying people to do work, but we're also ending up with a useful piece of infrastructure at the end of it.  We get a road, or a bridge, or better internet, etc etc etc.  This makes it much more worthwhile spending than the wall which was always useless from a practical standpoint and existed only as a political prop for Trump.", 3118, "None", 0],

	18474 : ["You don't have the first damn clue what you're talking about! Conservative voters got fed up with politicians who forgot why they got elected when they went to Washington. They get caught up in the politics, the political minutia and lose the nerve to do what they feel is right. Many Conservative voters thought they saw something in Trump and thought he wouldn't be prone to that. They turned out to be very right, more so than they ever thought. This is why support for Trump grew since 2016, even by those who are put off by his bloviating antics. Trump turned economy around, turning it into the strongest economy the country has seen in the last 15 years if not longer (prior to COVID-19) thanks to his use of Supply-Side Economics, including tax cuts and deregulation resulting in, among other things, the lowest Black and Hispanic unemployment on record (again pre-COVID). A number of those economic strengths are still there to fuel the post-COVID recovery if Biden doesn't screw it up with tax hikes and more regulation. Trump passed tax cuts that benefitted the average working-class to middle-class worker between $500 and $4,000 in tax savings. His policies allowed the US to become energy independent. This has been due to opening up more area for oil drilling, fracking and some coal production. Resulting in low energy and gas prices. Drawing more companies back to the US in the process because of that. He has taken on tough problems other presidents kicked the can down the road on for decades. This includes illegal immigration. It includes trade issues with China on issues like American intellectual property, trade imbalances and too much dependency on them in areas like manufacturing, this now on full display due to COVID-19. He pushed through a major new US, Canadian, Mexican trade partnership (USMCA), eliminating a number of problems with the old one (NAFTA). This put American interests more up front. He took a very visible stance with the pro-life movement as well being steadfastly behind 1st Amendment religious freedoms. He took bold steps in the the fight on terrorism, finishing off ISIS, including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He was not afraid to take the fight to the sources of terrorism, like Iran and Qasem Soleimani all without starting new wars the Left was SURE these these actions were going to do. He's been key in brokering a historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE. All without needing to drag Palestinian issues into it. The Abraham Accords has since grown to include 5 Arab nations and Israel. As for COVID-19, Trump implemented restrictions on travel from China in January 2020. Liberals literally called him \"racist\" for doing so. They were the ones who still hadn't got a grasp of the danger presented by the Chinese coronavirus yet, not Trump. More travel restrictions from other regions as well as other actions were implemented soon after. Trump has been ahead of the game from the beginning. There has been a bigger effort toward making a vaccine than anytime in American history, with government support. Three are now being deployed. He has been an outspoken critic of the violent social 2020 protests from the beginning (unlike from the Left), even pushing the limits of what he was allowed to do about them himself. His economic policies have brought back a number of manufacturing jobs, Obama claimed would never return to American shores, remember that? Having a Republican president brought the ability to place Originalism squarely in it's place as how to interpret law in the Courts. Trump did this this well, most notably the Supreme Court with 3 appointments to it. Describe just what constituted the pain and suffering if you have a rational, informed understanding of it. If you say it was all about what happened under COVID-19, explain if you possibly can just WHAT Trump should have done differently that he didn't already do!!
