	125686 : ["Everyone is a slave in the spiritual sense. We are either slaves to sin, which is our natural state, or we are slaves to Christ. The writers of the New Testament willingly declared their status as slaves of Christ. Paul opens his letter to the Romans by referring to himself as a “slave of Jesus Christ” (Romans 1:1) and his letter to Titus by calling himself a “slave of God” (Titus 1:1). James opens his epistle the same way, “James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ” (James 1:1). Most translations say “servant” or “bond-servant” in these passages, but the Greek word doulas means literally, a slave. In John 8:34 Jesus tells the unbelieving Pharisees, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.” He uses the analogy of a slave and his master to make the point that a slave obeys his master because he belongs to him. Slaves have no will of their own. They are literally in bondage to their masters. When sin is our master, we are unable to resist it. But by the power of Christ to overcome the power of sin, “You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness” Romans 6:18). Once we come to Christ in repentance and receive forgiveness for sin, we are empowered by the Holy Spirit who comes to live within us. It is by His power that we are able to resist sinning and become slaves of righteousness. Jesus' disciples belong to Him and want to do the things that please Him. This means that the children of God obey Him and live in freedom from habitual sin. We can do this because Jesus has set us free from the slavery of sin (John 8:36), and thus we are no longer under its penalty of death and separation from God. Romans 6:1-23 goes even further in this idea of a slave and his master. As Christians we aren't to continue in habitual sin because we died to sin. Romans 6:4 says that since we have been buried and resurrected with Christ we are now able to walk in that newness of life, unlike the unbeliever who is still a slave to sin. Romans 6:6 goes on to say that since we know that our old self was crucified with Him so that our body of sin might be done away with, we should no longer be slaves to sin. And Romans 6:11 says that we are to consider ourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.  We are commanded by God to not let sin reign in our bodies, obeying its lusts, but instead we are to present ourselves to Him as instruments of righteousness (Romans 6:12-14). In verses 16-18 we're told that we are slaves to the one we obey, either of obedience to sin or of obedience to righteousness. We are to be enslaved to God from whom we receive our gifts of sanctification and eternal life. We do this because the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 6:23).  The apostle Paul, the author of Romans, goes on to say that he knows how difficult it can be to not live in sin because he struggled with that even after he became a follower of Christ. This is important for all Christians to know. While we're now set free from the penalty of sin, we still live in the presence of sin while we're alive on this earth. And the only way we can be free from the power of sin is by the power of the Holy Spirit who is given to believers at the moment we come in faith to Christ (Ephesians 1:13-14), and this seals us in Christ as a pledge of our inheritance as God's child. The presence of the Holy Spirit in our life means that as we grow in our faith and come to love God ever more each day, we'll have the strength to resist sin more and more. Through the working of the Holy Spirit we are empowered to resist sin, not give in to its temptation, and live according to God's Word. Habitual sins will become more abhorrent to us and we'll find ourselves not wanting to do anything that might hinder our fellowship with God.", 10837, "CmLDcfMfaa", 1],

	125694 : ["Natural selection works because there are more offspring of a certain type. If the red flower attracted more birds and therefore pollinated more there would be more and more red flowers every generations. Here is an example happening right now in the animal world. Elephants are losing their tusks. This is because they are hunted for them. About 1 in a hundred elephants have been born with no tusks for as long as there are records but now its a third and growing. This is because no-one hunts the elephants without tusks and they live longer and have more children who have inherited the lack of tusks. Some theists will talk about evolution as if it is some far fetched kind of magic but it really is this simple. There only needs to be a few of these changes for there to be a completely new species. Say global warming makes Africa very very hot - there would be little water and the largest elephants would die first - elephants could become much smaller this way. Then they could be prey for big cats and the elephants with thickest hides would have more chance of surviving. Their hides could become much thicker until they were armoured. These two hypothetical changes could cause many African elephants to no longer be enough like elephants to merit the name - this would be a new species.", 10849, "None", 3],
	125695 : ["Well...that's technically not true. Flower colors don't necessarily attract birds and bees. Otherwise, we wouldn't have white or dark colored flowers, but we do. Flowers are colorful because of the genes that control their pigmentation levels. It's quite possible to have some genes become more prevalent in a population if they happen to be spread more successfully. That's the principle behind artificial selection; i.e., breeding, and breeding is the chief reason why we have so many different colored flowers: humans found the traits, such as coloration, more pleasing, and thus crossbred their favorite strains. That's the real reason why we have so many brightly-colored plants: we've been intentionally breeding the most colorful for centuries, and we love multiple colors, instead of prefering a single color per species or per region overall. If a particular color happened to be more successful in the wild--either because of cross pollination, or birds swallowing the seeds, or whatever, then you expect that, since the plants with the best colors breeds more often, that the genes responsible for those colors would increase in proportion in the population. That would be natural selection...a key component in evolution.", 10849, "urIm4YaBaa", 1],

	125708 : ["Hi Linda, your query is really in an intelligent way. The answer for your question is 'intelligence' Now we human are so limited with even english vocabularies. Most of us think that only human brain has intelligence. But the reality is that even an electron has intelligence. Intelligence as we go deep into its consequence, we realize that intelligence is nothing but directed behaviour. So molecules hydrogen and chlorine having intelligence get combined together with a pop sound to form hydrogen chloride molecule. But this phenomenon would take place only in the exposition of sun light. So intelligence is there to know about the presence of sun light. Lotus blossom as sun rises. You might have heard about the leaves, touch me not. When you touch those leaves they would close themselves. It is due to the intelligence inherent in it. So flowers too have different colours depending on the need. Fittest for survival. Hence evolution! Evolution itself takes place only because of the intelligence inherent. So intelligence is every where. You are one among those having a well evolved human nervous system and have been using that intelligence to search for the truth and now to safe guard yourself right from the domination made by such evolutionists.  Be confident dear. Dive within yourself. Better come out of the continuous chain of thinking and be so silent in the mental level that you will become so alert.

	125714 : ["Both Christianity and Islam consider Jesus to have been a prophet of their religion.  However, whereas Jesus' teachings have been lost from the creed and practices of most Christians, these same teachings are respected and evident in Islam.Let us look at some examples. >>Appearance 1.Jesus was bearded, as are most Muslims, but only the rare Christian. 2.Jesus dressed modestly.  If we close our eyes and form a mental picture, we see flowing robes, from wrists to ankles—much like the loose Arabian thobes and the Indio-Pakistani shalwar kameez, typical of the Muslims of those areas.  What we don't imagine is the revealing or seductive clothing so ubiquitous in Christian cultures. 3.Jesus' mother covered her hair, and this practice was maintained among the Christian women of the Holy Land up to the middle of the twentieth century.  Again, this is a practice maintained among Muslims as well as Orthodox Jews (of which Jesus was one), but not among modern day Christians. >>Manners 1.Jesus focused upon salvation and eschewed finery.  How many “righteous” Christians fit this “It's not just on Sundays” profile?  Now how many “five prayers a day, every day of the year” Muslims? 2.Jesus spoke with humility and kindness.  He didn't “showboat.”  When we think of his speeches, we don't imagine theatrics.  He was a simple man known for quality and truth.  How many preachers and how many evangelists follow this example? 3.Jesus taught his disciples to offer the greeting of “Peace” (Luke 10:5), and then set the example: “Peace be with you” (Luke 24:36, John 20:19, John 20:21, John 20:26).  Who continues this practice to this day, Christians or Muslims?  “Peace be with you” is the meaning of the Muslim greeting, “Assalam alaikum.”  Interestingly enough, we find this greeting in Judaism as well (Genesis 43:23, Numbers 6:26, Judges 6:23, I Samuel 1:17 and I Samuel 25:6). >>Religious Practices 1.Jesus was circumcised (Luke 2:21).  Paul taught it wasn't necessary (Rom 4:11 and Gal 5:2).  Muslims believe it is. 2.Jesus didn't eat pork, in keeping with Old Testament law (Leviticus 11:7 and Deuteronomy 14:8).  Muslims also believe pork is forbidden.  Christians … well, you get the idea. 3.Jesus didn't give or take usury, in compliance with the Old Testament prohibition (Exodus 22:25).  Usury is forbidden in the Old Testament and the Quran, as it was forbidden in the religion of Jesus.  The economies of most Christian countries, however, are structured upon usury. 4.Jesus didn't fornicate, and abstained from extramarital contact with women.  Now, this issue extends to the least physical contact with the opposite sex.  With the exception of performing religious rituals and helping those in need, Jesus never even touched a woman other than his mother.  Strictly practicing Orthodox Jews maintain this practice to this day in observance of Old Testament law.  Likewise, practicing Muslims don't even shake hands between the sexes.  Can Christian “hug your neighbor” and “kiss the bride” congregations make the same claim? >>Practices of Worship 1.Jesus purified himself with washing prior to prayer, as was the practice of the pious prophets who preceded him (see Exodus 40:31-32 in reference to Moses and Aaron), and as is the practice of Muslims. 2.Jesus prayed in prostration (Matthew 26:39), like the other prophets (see Nehemiah 8:6 with regard to Ezra and the people, Joshua 5:14 for Joshua, Genesis 17:3 and 24:52 for Abraham, Exodus 34:8 and Numbers 20:6 for Moses and Aaron).  Who prays like that, Christians or Muslims? 3.Jesus fasted for more than a month at a time (Matthew 4:2 and Luke 4:2), as did the pious before him (Exodus 34:28, I Kings 19:8), and as do Muslims in the annual fast of the month of Ramadan.", 10852, "None", 3],
