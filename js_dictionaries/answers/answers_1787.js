	95054 : ["The party lines change. Southerners used to be Democrats, now they're all violently red.  But I don't even use the term \"Liberal\" on the people who claim it. \"Liberal\" used to mean \"Libertarian\" or \"having to do with liberty\". Now, the proper term to use is \"Police State Progressives\". Although even the term \"Progressive\" is kind of hypocritical for them to use.  Think about it. The only place on Earth liberty's been given an honest, objective chance has been America. Trusting humanity that way is progress.  Tyranny, however, has been tried for millennia. That's regression. And yet that's exactly what Liberals want; extra government tyranny in every aspect of your life. The only thing \"progressive\" about it is the depth with which larger populations can be suppressed through modern technology.  Don't expect these people (or any other people who still cling to the two party system) to ever have a consistent ideology (I'll give a similar speech about \"Conservatives\" if prompted); the media's too smart to let them do that.", 9533, "WDARZpGWaa", 0],

Simply redefining a word doesn't create a reality.  In real life the democrats are politically, economically and socially where the Eisenhower Republicans used to be.  Today Eisenhower, Nixon, and Jerry Ford are RINO's, Teddy Roosevelt has exited right wing history and Bob Taft, once know as Mr. Conservative is nowhere to be found on Planet Reactionary.  Nelson Rockefeller?  Never heard of the bum!  Today the GOP/Tea/Fox/Jesus freak party exists solely to pimp for big money interests, 'the rich' and the trans national corporations now hiding out in COMMUNIST China. There's nothing in that party for the 95% of Americans who work for hourly wages and whatever miserable benefits they can get.  Their unions have been busted, their incomes reduced and there's the ongoing threat to Medicare and Social Security.  There's no forward thinking about climate change, a bloated military living totally on borrowed money, our rapidly failing social and physical infrastructure and any attempt to make HEALTH INSURANCE affordable for 'the peasants' is called 'Socialized Medicine'.... complete with Death Panels.

	95065 : ["Liberals are so opened minded their brains may have fallen out. They know so much that isn't so. The Liberal ideology is a theory , fostered by a delusional, illogical minority and which holds forth beliefs that have no basis in reality. They are Advocates of a policy that empowers a strong federal government to enslave its people with a high tax burden incident to the support of extravagant and unnecessary social programs destructive to both the work ethic among the lower class, and the incentive to innovate and succeed among the working class. \"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\" Liberals like to spend other peoples money!!

	95066 : ["It would be easier for me to take the Tea Party seriously if they didn't embrace divisive candidates like Palin, Bachmann, West, Gohmert and every other fringe GOP member.  They also have an attitude that says that someone must agree with them in order to be a patriot and they view compromise as somehow dishonorable.  The Tea Party faction in congress has made an already bad situation worse.  The bottom line is I don't care what overlap there is between liberal philosophy and Tea Party philosophy.  You can create a venn diagram and find overlap between many political groups.  My problem with the tea party has to do with their actions. And BTW.  Snarky comments like \"Do today's (so called) liberals even know what liberalism is?\" don't exactly help your own credibility.", 9533, "None", 0],

	95074 : ["While I find your anti-Islam ranting disturbing, and actually kind of repugnant, I do agree with one point you make - the UN is quite poorly organised and doesn't function as it should because it is a chain, and as weak as that chain's weakest link. Why however, is this posted in R&S? Got some religion to discuss, or just feel like venting some frustrations at the UN and muslims? Edit... and Jewish law advocates stoning disobedient children to death, yet part of your post is supportive of the worlds only majority Jewish country. I don't care much if you're ex-muslim or not, the fact is that you are not a self-appointed moral guardian of the world who has the sole right to determine what is \"acceptable\" and what is not. Edit again... in fact it does. If I had the patience I'd go find the passage for you. What strikes me as odd is you're prepared to defend this point by saying it only says to stone adulterers to death. How very civilised.  Whether or not the law is practised, it exists. The fact that it exists simply highlights where Islamic law came from, since their religion is simply a derivation of Judaism. That they still follow the law in some cases is up to them - laws are made by the society that keeps them. Its really not up to you to sit around determining what is appropriate and what isn't. Many countries have bad laws, many governments do bad things to their people. It's not an Islamic preserve - its a human preserve.  The sooner people like you start realising that finger pointing and name calling just makes you look intolerant and completely defeats any purpose you hoped to achieve in presenting what passes for an argument here, the happier the world will be.", 9532, "eDYXQxA9aa", 2],

I've often wonderred the same thing from the perspective of, \"What ever happened to the freedom loving, government authoritarian hating hippie of the 60's?\" Today, those people...being many years older...are the very ones pushing for bigger, more intrusive and authoritarian government. They see freedom as a threat to their collectivist ideal that they truly believed in back in the 60 and so, now that they are in the position of power, see no problem in virtually crushing any opposition.

The United States, unlike its European allies, has been very reluctant to adopt a communitarian perspective; Americans are a pull-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps, reject handouts, go-it-alone, individualist group.  As for geography, yes, we share borders with Canada and Mexico, but it seems they object to our actions on few occasions, and only when they are directly affected.  Our perspectives might be different if, like many other nations, we had to share borders with several vocal, culturally disparate states.  We might be more sensitive to other countries' concerns, as well, if we relied on them heavily for economic support.  When you're packed together with other, different people, whose support and cooperation is crucial to your own functioning, you're a lot more likely to value and respect their points of view.

They have worked for several years, have mortgages, families, and they have learned that providing stuff for free to people that did not earn it is not a good thing. Same for item number 2.  After several years of listening to liberal BS and finding out over and over again that no matter how hard you hope and dream the world is going to be the way it is, you choose to listen to someone that also realizes that. Percentages of blacks, jews, latinos, etc... in the Republican party are not that far off the percentage of them in the general population.  So, I would say wrong on that one.  In actuality, the question should be reversed.  Why does the Democrat party attract more then their fair share of minorities? As to what they GOP should do?
