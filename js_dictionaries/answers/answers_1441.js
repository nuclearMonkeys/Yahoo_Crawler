	77696 : ["These predictions of impending doom and gloom have been made for the past 2,000 or more years. We have suffered through earthquakes, storms, fires, and a lot of other things that hasn't wiped out the world as we now know it. Basically, you've been duped. The Mayans predicted no such end of the world on May 20, 2012. The December 21, 2012, date is based upon the end of the long-count Mayan calendar system. Keep in mind that the Mayan peoples never disappeared, neither at the time of the Classic period decline nor with the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors and the subsequent Spanish colonization of the Americas. Today, the Maya and their descendants form sizable populations throughout the Maya area and maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs that are the result of the merger of pre-Columbian and post-Conquest ideas and cultures. Scholars familiar with the Mayan calendar system say that the Mayans looked forward to the end of the calendar the same way we look forward to the end of our calendar -- a time for great celebration (New Year's Eve and Day). Take a deep breath and repeat after me: \"The world is not going to end in 2012. The world is not going to end in 2012. The whole 'end of the world' thing is a hoax to make money.\" Now go enjoy the rest of the year.", 8913, "LuN1unJ3aa", 5],
	77697 : ["Well, Nostradamus' quatrains are quite vague and can be interpreted almost any way we see fit.  I didn't know about the Mayan prediction, but they were only concerned with the return of Quetzacotal, their sun god. (Not sure I spelled that right).   Revelation from the Bible is a prophecy written by John while exiled on Patmos by Caesar Nero's order.  He writes to the 7 churches in Asia Minor in the 1st century about things that will \"soon\" come to pass.  It is written with apocalyptic language that the Jews understood figuratively, and it was all fulfilled in the destruction of the old \"heavens & earth\" (the Jewish Temple). Though no one but the Father knew the actual day and time of Jesus' return, the general time frame (one generation) was communicated clearly over and over again by Jesus, and writers of NT letters under divine inspiration.  The return of Christ is often assumed to be a physical event, but in reality, it was a spiritual event that signified God's Presence leaving the Temple and filling believers (the new 'temple').  His 'appearing' was likened to the High Priest coming out of the Holy of Holies under the Mosaic system. This occurred on the 9th of Av, 70AD. and Jesus is here now, reigning in His invisible, eternal kingdom.  If we could see it, it wouldn't be everlasting.  The Kingdom of God is within the hearts of believers.  :) So hopefully nothing bad will happen tomorrow.", 8913, "fcfJjFRhaa", 0],

	77710 : ["If you use the boxed mix and water, thats fine.  There could be a few problems.  You could be making the batter to thin, or not allowing the pancake to cook enough before flipping it, or making the pancakes to large makes it hard to flip them successfully.", 8914, "F08HDRvraa", 0],

	77712 : ["Practice.   But there are a few tips I've discovered: 1.  don't make pancakes much larger than the spatula you are going to flip them with 2.  batter will continue to spread on the hot surface even after you quit pouring. 3.  Use a griddle, so you can easily get under the pcancakes w/o a high sided pan getting in the way. 4.  Use a flexible non-scratch spatula and a nonstick cooking surface. 5.  And sounds like your heat is way too hot.  Let griddle warm up while you're mixing yoru batter.  Med-to-med/low is ideal. 6.  When you go to slide your spatula under the pancake to turn it, do it w/ conviction.  Not slow and wimpy, but a sure, swift \"slide\" underneath.  Then lift up to give yourself room to flip, and flip it down in the same spot. This is the best recipe I've found.  Use real buttermilk.  You can makeyour own w/ lemon jc or vinegar, but it's just not the same in this recipe. The Best Buttermilk Pancakes 2 cups Buttermilk 3 eggs, room temp 6 Tbsp butter, melted 2 cups all purpose flour 1 tsp salt 2 tsp baking soda 1 tsp. vanilla Put the buttermilk, egg and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Stir briskly until the mixture is smooth and blended. Stir the flour, salt and baking soda together in a small bowl. Stir into the buttermilk mixture only until the dry ingredients are moistened - leave the smaller lumps. Heat a skillet or griddle to medium hot. Grease lightly and spoon out a 3 TBLS of batter per pancake. Cook until a few bubbles form on top and break. Flip the pancake over and cook until golden brown..not too long.  These are the best pancakes and nothing else will compare after having these!!! Enjoy.  Makes about 12-15 pancakes.", 8914, "AA10928232", 0],

Turn it up and allow the electric skillet to preheat (I like it at about 400 degrees) Pour the mix and allow it to cook just until the bubbles on the top start to burst. Flip and cook the other side. These will cook real fast.  It only takes about a minute per pancake.   If they get dark to quick, turn it down a little. If they take to long, turn it up a little.....but watch that they don't burn.
