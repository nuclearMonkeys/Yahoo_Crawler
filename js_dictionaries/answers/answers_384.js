	20945 : ["Yes.  An electric oven can go in the same spot  It is piped for gas so there is the cast iron pipe that is capped until it is hooked up. To check to see if it is leaking, take a drinking cup and put in a squirt of dishwashing Liquid soap and a couple tablespoonsful of water and stir with a  icing brush or an artist paint brush the kids have.   Now brush the threads near the cap.   If it bubbles continuously, then you got a leak and it stinks like rotten eggs.  If it does not leak then the soapy water remains still. If a leaker, then phone the gas utility and have a guy come out and cap it properly. If you have further questions, the gas man is knowledgeable to know the answers to Electrical stuff (as it is all related to the stove) You do not \"need\" to get closer to the wall.  It is what it is. You will adjust.  The two utilities thought about the other guy.(for once) If it is piped for gas then that is an option to  choose.  Most houses I have worked in are wired for an electric stove which again is an OPTION.  In rentals they have the option. To have both types there is not unusual.  Usually there is a plug outlet on the wall with 3 long prong slots(220V).  This is not the normal 110/120V outlet which has 2 slots and a round mouth.  I am pretty certain that for a gas stove it uses 110/120V. Same like computer or vacuum cleaner or TV. . If you had to have the gas man come out and close the gas line properly, you can ask about the electrical questions.  He knows his ovens.   If the electric oven has a 4 prong that is more a dryer type outlet which is 220/240V .  It works too as electricity voltage surges so it is never a steady voltage(just close)  You match your cord to the OUTLET pattern on the wall. . You sound unsure.  Let a qualified gas man from the Utility company hook this up for you...just to be safe(not sorry) Or handyman can do what you can do.

	20961 : ["All Harrier variants could do that. So could the Yakovlev 141 but only 4 were ever built. A number of of VTOL jets have also been built in the past but not in any meaningfully true production capacity. The F35B/Lightning II cannot usefully perform true vertical take-off. In demonstrations where it carries no armaments and barely any fuel and has been stripped right down to basics it can do it, but in genuine service it's a short take-off model using vectored thrust and wing lift, and can then hover and land vertically. Vertical landing has to be with very low fuel loads, requiring fuel-dumping before landing if necessary. Otherwise it's really a short-landing aeroplane which again needs wing lift to help it to land. So it's really a STOVL (Short Take-Off, Vertical Landing) and not a true VSTOL jet.  VTOL is not that important these days, but during the Cold War the ability of the Harrier to land and take off vertically from wooded forest clearings requiring no airstrip and not even a short length of road was of critical strategic importance.  The F35B/Lightning II almost never happened. It was just far too heavy during development and still remains a heavy machine. The Harrier/AV-8 has the massive advantage that a single engine provides all of the lift for VTOL operation and normal forward flight. Every other hovering jet design including the YAK-141 depends on having jet engines devoted solely to vertical operation which then become parasitic dead-weight in normal flight.  To improve range all Harrier/AV8 variants were usually used in STOVL mode, despite all being fully VSTOL capable. The above answer ignores the huge number of jet-powered helicopters, and the jet turbine powered V-22 Osprey.", 3425, "gjUpsUZAaa", 5],

People are ignorantly saying that small aircraft are more dangerous than automobile incidents, but that is false. However, less experienced pilots start off on small aircraft, flaunting their safety record. As pilots gain experience, they fly progressively larger aircraft. Another misconception, sure small aircraft are vulnerable to downdrafts, but they are more agile than larger aircraft and large aircraft have crashed due to weather or downdrafts. Pretty sure there was a major crash in a US airline that did this once do to a downdraft.  Mechanically, small aircraft and big aircraft are both safe, although larger aircrafft are more expensive to maintain.", 3427, "uEVWbrkBaa", -1],
