	57708 : ["Your friend sounds like a control freak! She definitely doesn't deserve an apology as sweet as that one. If you texted her 8 times without a reply in the past but she didn't care back then then she must have just lost interest or got a better offer or something. She's a user and I don't know why you want her in your life you deserve so much better it's absolutely disgusting she ghosted you when you needed her most. I wouldn't even apologise if I was you. You wouldn't have sent her 11 texts if she had bothered to answer anyway! Any normal person would text \"hey are you ok? I'm a bit concerned about all these texts lately\" yes ok maybe she was thinking this. But it is not right at all to leave you feeling like this is your fault. Ghosting is psychological abuse. She caused this. You sound like such a sweet person, ask yourself why someone like her deserves your friendship. I really like your apology, but I don't like the way you blame yourself by saying you'll never forgive yourself. You didn't even do anything wrong. I think this girl has issues and i think you are better off without her in your life. However it does seem you think she is worth fighting for. So my advice is this. You've not heard from her since september yes? Maybe she just felt like your texts were too much too soon and couldn't bring herself to talk to you. Maybe just wanted a break. Maybe. Just maybe she has been wondering what happened to you since you stopped texting her. And maybe she has been tempted to contact you. But since you stopped texting she might think you've lost interest! So definitely make the first move. I would say 5 months after your last text is more than enough time for space. But if she doesn't reply to your apology, don't freak out! Not everyone replies to apologies, sometimes they just don't know what to say. Then leave her alone til her birthday or something. Just say happy birthday! Be the bigger person. Show her you've learned. Stay in her life, but only reach out once every few months. If after 5 attempts (greetings, phone, visit) she still hasn't spoken to you even just once, then you know you've dodged a bullet and should thank your lucky stars you saw her true colours! She might suddenly pop up again when you've moved on. If this happens, tell her to **** off.", 8000, "None", 0],
