America is basically a conservative country and after the election of Obama, a vast number of so-called 'change' dems will find the conservatives a much better place to be than the socialist change(s) being made to this country.  Obama was elected for two (2) reasons:  1) the 18-30 yo vote thought it was so 'cool' to elect a young dark skinned person.  2)  The remainder of the true dems had their heads in an unnamed place and now can see just what they voted for.  Of course there will be some who maintain that this is what the country has needed.  We don't want to become another socialist Europe............We're America, damnit!  We're the ones who save the socialist's as--es when there's a war.  I just hope and pray we can survive until 2012 and bad things don't happen on 21 December.", 9131, "din2kd3Oaa", -1],
	83508 : ["I'm an independent moderate that would love to see that. Unlike republicans, libertarians are at least consistent, and logical in their approach. From looking at the answers here, the republicans in denial about the problems connecting with the rest of the county... \"we need to take back the party from moderates\", they say....  Take back? Well the party hasn't been controlled by moderates in decades. Your problem is that your policies and stances are inconsistent and illogical. People with half a brain detect this in a second and go running. Examples? Ok republicans are for \"personal liberties\"... but not if that involves 2 men getting married... then the state needs to step in and enforce the removal of those liberties... That is so freaking insane... convoluted.. and just plain backwards thinking.  Libertarians have it right..  THEY are true conservatives. Republicans are just theists these days, who want to force everyone to be a Christian, while acting as though they are still giving you a choice. Conservatives are not evil, but the republican party IS. with the way it takes advantage of true conservatives for the purpose of establishing a state sponsored religion.", 9131, "None", 4],

Kindle Fire is one underpowered device to be even considered to be a media tablet. Instead take a look at recently released Nook Tablet - it's been getting rave reviews and it is the best device in it's class - much better than Kindle Fire. It's got Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Angry Brids, etc., the best battery life, the best screen, double the RAM and space for apps/photos/movies, microSD slot and a microphone for Skype (not on Kindle), physical volume controls on the side (not on Kindle). Also, it is $224 if sign up for Barnes & Noble membership. If you believe almost 800 people that left 1-2 star reviews on Amazon site for Kindle Fire and drop all 5-start reviews from Amazon employees and read middle ground 3-start reviews you'll understand that it is a deeply flawed device. It is confirmed at this time that many Kindle Fire units have faulty Wi-Fi and people have a lot of issues connecting to internet according to many user reviews. Other issues are that it runs hot to touch, video playback is jerky, touch screen is not responsive and it takes 2-3 touches to register, power button placement is very poor and is prone to accidental power off, all the hype of Silk browser is a fake where the browsing is actually slower than on other Android tablets, etc.", 9134, "None", -4],

	83523 : ["OMG NO.  The  reason Conservatives/Republicans lost the last  election was because John McCain was too much like Democrats,  not a true conservative, and then the charisma of Obama telling  voters he would makes \"changes you could believe in\" and you all  fell for that line. However, it became \"changing WHAT you believe\".....  a big difference. $9 Trillion dollars in debt (wow wee) and  releasing  terrorists.
