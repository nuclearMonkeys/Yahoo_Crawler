There are several available, but this tutorial is going to use Connect360 because it gives you the ability to start streaming movies. Download a copy of Connect360 from   and unzip it. You can get the trial for free, or pay a small fee for the full version. Step 2 Install the software by double clicking the .pref file to add it to your system preferences. You can now click go into your system preferences to change the settings. All of the streaming movies and music comes from iTunes, while the photos are pulled from iPhoto. Step 3 Before we start streaming movies and other content to your console, we need to tweak a few settings. From the system preferences Connect360 item, click the settings button in the lower right hand corner. Use this panel to add an additional video folder for streaming movies. Also insure the \"Enable Access Control List\" isn't checked. If you'd like to enable the controls, make sure you add your host numbers to the list. Click the \"Close\" button. Step 4 Click the new icon in the menubar at the top right hand side of your screen. The drop down should say Xbox 360 Media Sharing Enabled. This means your streaming movies, music and photos are turned on. If you don't see that, click \"Connect360 preferences\" and hit the Start button. Turn on your Xbox 360, and if it's connected to the same network as the computer you should see your console pop up in the Discovered Devices section. Step 5 On your Xbox 360, go to the My Xbox categoy. all the streaming movie options are in the Video Library, so scroll over to it and hit the A button to continue. Step 6 You'll be presented with several sources to watch streaming movies and other media from. At the top you'll see your Xbox drive. If you only have one computer set up to stream (the one we just set up) that'll be the only other source on the list. Choose that source and hit the A button to continue. Step 7 This will bring up a list of your video files. You can select any of these to start streaming movies instantly. If you'd like to play music or view photos, just navigate back to the My Xbox category.", 10415, "gZDf0mAdaa", 1],

	115131 : ["Sports bikes are difficult because they are ADVANCED level bikes.  Basically factory racing bikes.  A sport bike from today taken back just a few years would be beating full on race bikes.  You have to be fit to even ride more than a short time in the lay down riding position.    Until you are going fast enough for the rush of air to hold you up you are basically holding half a push-up. A 600cc bike is no wimp it still has an outrageous power to weight ratio is begging to wheelie most of the time.  1000 to 1400cc bikes are just stupid powerful.   Just hold the HP numbers up next to a cruiser...Harley 1450cc around 80 HP  Yamaha R1 180 HP and that is nowhere near the fastest or most powerful bike out there.    That should really say it all.  These bikes are in no way polite or user friendly, they are rockets. I'm basing my opinion on how fast a squid will end up road kill.  I think insurance rates back me up.

	115132 : ["Let's define \"difficult\"... for instance, as compared to a cruiser of similar engine displacement. If it means hard to move around with your feet while in neutral, a sport bike generally has a shorter wheelbase, and should be easier to maneuver than a big cruiser. If it means handling the bike at high speed through curved roads, the higher power-to-weight-ratio, better suspension, and superior brakes again give a sportbike the edge over the cruiser.  Yet riding position and ergonomics are the most important factors to many riders, as a modern sportbike's lay-on-your-belly position and board-hard seat don't really lend themselves to comfort. And when  you're uncomfortable, you can be distracted, which can make riding difficult. As others said, you can't have a big gut and stretch yourself over a sportbike tank.  And you can't have stiff joints either.  ;)", 10414, "9uyeJuZYaa", 0],

The Haunted Mansion was changed into a ride for the movie \"A Nightmare Before  \" and Space Mountain was changed to \"Ghost Galaxy\" (I'm not sure of the exact name, but it was something along these lines) where you see ghosts along the ride.  California Adventure was closed on select evenings because they had a trick-or-treat party.  I don't know what that is like but at the time, you had to buy special admission tickets to attend that.

That's because the chassis is wider on the newer models, and the riveted quarter-panels are mounted differently. Beside logistic and aesthetic issues, that leads to a lot of mechanical problems with the reduced space behind the body kits panels. Really what you described is not just a body working nightmare, it's structurally impossible.  The one alternative would be to have a custom body kit built for the Mustang that you have, to resemble an earlier model, but the body kit will still have to be as proportionally wide as the factory design specifies to accommodate the engine block and various components.

	115155 : ["They are faster, lighter and more capable than any other type of motorcycle on the planet, and take VERY little input from the rider to do anything. Just a slight push on the handlebars will toss a sportbike over sideways in an instant, and when the speeds involved are SO much higher than what you'd get in a car your reactions must be more finely tuned. For example, when I first started riding I figured it takes about 1/3 throttle to get my big, heavy Jeep to accelerate at a reasonable pace, so a tiny 650cc engine would take about the same, right? I let the clutch out and twisted the throttle, and promptly proceeded down the street faster than I had EVER taken off in my life!  It was all I could do to ease off the throttle and slow down, but that same panic could have easily thrown me into a ditch at 40mph.  I learned INSTANT respect for the power-to-weight ratio of motorcycles that day! So you get a newbie on a fast sportbike with NO experience, and there are many opportunities to reach that \"panic\" state and freeze up instead of doing the correct actions to keep themselves safe.  It is NOT intuitive, and takes time to learn; often years.  And all that a bigger engine will get you is into that panic zone faster.", 10414, "None", 1],

Riding a sportbike isn't difficult, though riding a sportbike well takes a great deal of skill. 600cc is more manageable for track or twisties riding... the front isnt going to come up on you as easily and you don't have to always worry about giving it too much gas in the corners like on a 1000cc. 1000cc is better for cruising around town because the gears are so tall and you have more torque.

My buddies and i usually put 429's in them when the 429 is available.If not we use the 460.These motors will take up alot of the space under the hood because fox bodys never had much to start with.You will have some brake master cylinder issues.You will have to relocate it or have to buy a smaller booster or just take it off and run non-power brakes.Next thing is the headers.They are an extremely tight fit.The other thing is the front suspension.It will need to be beefed up a bit.The stock springs were only made to hold a small block.When stuffing that large motor in there,most of the weight of the vehicle has been transfered to the front of the car which isnt good considering your gonna need all the weight of that little car to be in the rear for traction.Put the battery in the trunk too.There will also be some diferential concerns.A stock 8.8 mustang rearend will not hold up to a big block with any power.A good spool or locker will need to be put in it along with some hi-po axles.We use Superior axles here.Last,you should weld the axle housing where the meet the differential on the outside.This will strengthen the rearend.After all you could just have a Ford 9\" made for it which will eliminate almost all concerns of ever blowing the rear apart.You can sometimes find these rearends already made for fox bodys on Ebay.Also remember,your gonna need a tranny for this swap.A C6 Ford transmission is what is made for the big block Fords.These trannys are large and heavy and you will lose 60hp at the rear wheels just to turn it.We personally use the small block C4 tranny here with aftermarket adapters for the bell housing to bolt up to the big block.A C4 tranny only takes about 20-30 hp away from the motor,If you can find a rare C5 Ford tranny,GRAB IT!! You'll understand why after reading up on it.If you want to be different and money isnt an issue,keep with the small block.They do make a twin turbo for the 302 5.0's.Best of all and something i've never seen in person but i know they make is a twin supercharger model.This is available from Paxton for the 5.0.Take your pick!!If you think about it regardless if money is not a problem or not,keep with the 302.The money saved from not having to fabricate anything or buying a big block and tranny can be put in all the aftermarket stuff available for the 5.0.There are tons of mods for this motor.You can generate an endless amount of horsepower with these engines if you know what your doing and also depending how \"deep\" your wallet is.Good luck buddy,i hope some of this cool info has helped.After your car is done,you may want to keep alot of spare tires around for the rear.LOL!!", 10418, "EigB7rOTaa", 1],
