	54983 : ["It is not known if T-Rex actually had feathers. However, T-Rex was a theropod dinosaur, which comprises a very large group of dinosaurs, from quite large to small types. The fossil evidence indicates that birds evolved from  a small, feathered theropod dinosaur. It is now clear from their bone structure from the fossil evidence that at least some branches of the dinosaurs were warm blooded and much more active than their reptile ancestors. Numerous examples from the fossil record also show that many of these dinosaurs had evolved feathers, which would have originally been used for insulation. From that initial use other uses would have arisen, such as for camouflage or elongated for sexual display. Some of the smaller tree-climbing feathered theropod dinosaurs began using their elongated feathers on their arms for gliding. Eventually, they evolved into powered flyers. The earliest example of such feathered, winged theropod dinosaurs was that of Archaeopteryx, several fossils of which were found in the 1800s. It is clear that the skeleton is still more like that of a theropod dinosaur than like that of a modern bird, including having teeth, a long bony tail, and separate forelimb digits with claws instead of the fused digits of modern-type birds. Fossils of numerous other small, feathered, dinosaurs, including winged, have been found in the past thirty years, enough to make it clear that birds descended from feathered theropod dinosaurs. Do a search on YouTube for \"Microraptor: The Flying Dinosaur | Planet Dinosaur | BBC Earth\" and you will see examples of a couple of other feathered winged dinosaurs. (Y!A is currently having a problem when links are included within an answer.) Also, do a Google search for feathered dinosaurs and you will find more examples. These early ancestors of birds first arose over 150 million years ago and gradually evolved into modern-type birds before the end of the Cretaceous (which marks the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs). NO fossils of any modern-type bird is found in earlier Cretaceous strata. Furthermore, NO fossils of present-day species of birds appear in strata laid down in even the late Cretaceous, though a few examples of some possible ancestors of ducks appear in late Cretaceous strata. However they might just be examples of convergent evolution as an adaptation to similar environments. For that matter, absolutely NO fossils of present-day species of mammals, including human, appear in the same strata with dinosaur fossils anywhere in the world. That is because the present-day species of mammals did not evolve until LONG after the dinosaurs died out as a result of an asteroid impact (for which there is a great deal of evidence) on the earth 66 million years ago. The only mammal fossils to be found in the same strata with dinosaur fossils are of relatively small, early types having no clear relationship to present-day species.", 7670, "sdS6tLTPaa", 2],

	54988 : ["\"Something out of nothing\" is an ambiguous concept in the absence of an explanation of the term \"nothing.\"   For example, so-called \"empty space\" is permeated by gravitational fields and the Higgs field; it is also filled with vast numbers of virtual particles that pop into and out of existence.  No informed person says that the universe \"started with an explosion\" because the expansion of space itself is not an explosion. ", 7671, "0b6yxPlAaa", 0],
	54989 : ["Yes, wrong assumptions based on a misunderstanding of the science (and for big name creationists they continue to espouse these lies even after having been corrected numerous times). Nobody except those ignorant of the science or those who wish to purposefully discredit its findings claims that the Big Bang was an explosion. The name Big Bang was coined as a derogatory term to discredit the early hypothesis but it stuck and now people get the wrong idea about it because they associate the word bang with an explosion. However, the actual science describes it as a rapid expansion of space, not an explosion. And it is based upon a mathematical model, so the rapid expansion is just a way of us trying to describe what the findings show us rather than a definitive explanation. As for the \"something from nothing\" that is again a common creationist talking point that stems from a general misunderstanding of the science and is perpetuated by those who have been corrected and choose to keep spreading the lie because they can bilk gullible followers out of their money. The exact answer is that we do not know because the information we have does not tell us what was there at the start of our current perception of space-time. Mathematically we trace it back to a singularity, where all mass and energy were concentrated into a single point. In what world does :all mass and energy\" mean the same thing as \"nothing?\" That seems like something existed and the universe expanded from that something. We don't know what, if anything, came \"before\" the singularity, but that in itself is perhaps a meaningless concept anyway since space-time came into existence with the Big Bang, so if time did not exist until the Big Bang there is no such thing as \"before.\" They can certainly hypothesize and test to try to gather evidence that supports a cohesive theory, but as of right now the honest answer is simply \"we do not know.\"", 7671, "IWlrRgmCaa", -1],

	54997 : ["Judaism is a religion.  Being Jewish may be seen as a religion or an ethnicity; and in the case of DNA, it involves having the genetic traits common in that ethnicity. Throughout history, most Jews did pass their religion down to their children.  But there were and are converts as well. According to Jewish religious law, a convert to Judaism is just as much a Jew as one who is born to it.  It is similar to adoption in this sense - an adopted child is just as much your child as a child by birth.   Most Christians don't quite understand the concept of a religion being passed down by birth, because in Christianity this doesn't happen.  Christianity has to be chosen, either by the individual or, in the case of a child, by the parent on behalf of the child.   Both Judaism and Islam, however, pass their religion to the children at birth, though conversions happen also.  Thus you could have a Jew who does not practice Judaism; and her child will be a Jew by birth also, without ever practicing.   Jews also lots of times don't understand that nobody is born a Christian, they assume Christians are born Christian just as Jews are born Jewish - unless they are converts of course.   There are actually practicing Jews, isolated communities, in some parts of Africa; they are Black, but they practice Judaism the best they can and they have \"Jewish DNA.\"  The best known of these are in Ethiopia, but there are others as well.  ", 7662, "54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa", 0],
