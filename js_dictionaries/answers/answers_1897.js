Well the population is just growth and growth and that cannot be stop as impossible, and YES the world's population had strong relative to the Global Warming, because there more peoples, and some countries, does not available enough shelter for their peoples, and the pollution and all those risk to the planet might increasing very fast, so there still haven't got any solution to save our planet till the peoples working together!", 9746, "900769c1a3b272afb0e46549ce8ddb8eaa", 0],
	100588 : ["According to the best estimates, we must reduce world wide carbon dioxide emissions to less than one tenth of what they are today if we are to have any chance of avoiding the worst consequences of Global Warming. To achieve those kinds of reductions would require that we shut down the economies of all of the nations in the world. This would cause poverty, disease and death on a scale that we have never witnessed in modern history. You refer to the final solution which was the NAZI's term for the holocaust. It is true that if you did attempt to get these kinds of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions that you would kill several billion people in the process.  That would make the holocaust look like a Sunday School picnic. Essentially we cannot get the world wide reductions in carbon dioxide emissions necessary by moral means acceptable in a civilized society. The only other alternative is to accept the fact that Global Warming is the inevitable consequence of human civilization and start planning now how we will mitigate the effects of Global Warming. The sea levels will rise.  Fortunately coastal areas can be protected from flooding by dike systems similar to those used in Holland. Hurricanes will become stronger and more frequent.  We must help the affected areas upgrade their disaster preparedness programs. Droughts will become more frequent. We must help the affected areas with supplemental water supplies and desalination plants. We cannot stop Global Warming by moral means that are acceptable in a civilized society but we can mitigate the effects of Global Warming if we start planning and saving now so we are prepared to mitigate the effects of Global Warming when that time comes.", 9746, "None", -2],

	100590 : ["Certainly, Malcom Turnbull is a very smart business man, he has contacts in a lot of places and is a more driven and ambitious man than Costello is. Turnbull will crawl over the burning corpses of the election defeat to get what he wants, Costello does not have the ticker to fight for what he wants. This is plainly evident when Costello should have removed Howard from the top job at least a year ago but didn't have the guts to do it. On the other hand Turnbull has gone from a nobody in politics to being a high profile front becher in a matter of one term of office.   Watch this man closely, he will be the next opposition leader to defend the Libs at the next election, I hope he loses too.

	100591 : ["Had Costello stayed on i dont think Turnbull would have challenged him, i thought  Costello would be leader and Turnbull Deputy. I thought that would have been the winning combination in the next election. Its a sad day in my opinion that Costello has moved aside, the critics said about Beazely \"hes the best Prime Minister we never had\" , i think this statement is much more true about Peter Costello. So it looks like it may be a Turnbull/Hockey or Turnbull/Abbott party, Either way i imagine Turnbull will be the leader come Election time.", 9745, "D9uUg62maa", -1],
	100592 : ["Yes, definitely. Costello has the charisma and charm of a decomposing cadaver and very little chance of winning an election as party leader.

	100595 : ["There's not doubt that we have impacted the environment and I think much more negatively than positively so.  But, I'm not convinced that a system as vast and complex as the planet Earth is going to be irreparably impacted by a mere species.  There have been dominant populations in the past and they have all gone the way of fossil remains, being either caramelized or petrified...'recycled', so to speak. One great catastrophic 'natural' event would be enough to snuff us all out.  Earth has a tendency to do that, according to our geological scientists.  Aside from cockroaches and horseshoe crabs, it would appear that we are all doomed. I'm not so arrogant as to believe that we can control much of anything having to do with macro systems like a planet.  We certainly should do all we can to make our stay here as pleasant as possible.  And, I do believe we have a responsibility - stewardship, if you will - to our children, grandchildren, etc., to make this place as nice as possible.  But, ultimately, our population will be 'controlled' by natural processes.  In my opinion, it already has been acted upon in that respect and will continue to be in the future.", 9746, "42423a685bc300176bfe08543e359fb4aa", 0],

To stabilize CO2 stages the place they at the instant are will require devastating cuts in potential use, which will turn our economic device into something greater equivalent to that of Zimbabwe or Somalia. it will by no ability take place. we will proceed to hem and haw and placed it off for destiny generations, as we've been. If a factor, or all, of the warming is organic, then it is not significant lots what we do, different than prepare. Neither Obama, nor everybody else in government, says very lots approximately that. So, no, he will in basic terms attempt to get the little, painless cuts made, which will do no longer something in direction of fixing the subject, or making waiting for it.

	100608 : ["i think the death penalty should only be used in extreme cases where there is no question about guilt 100%. eg the jerk who shot 3 inocent people on melbourne a few weeks ago, the person who killed many people in tasmania about 10 years ago and any case of rape or child abusers that cannot be reformed. It has been shown that when they get out many do it again and also think of the cost of keeping them in prison for the rest of their life when they do not deserve to live. As i said though only in 100% guilt cases for extreem situations. I think in general the legal system is crap. To many people get of too lightly and too many people get huge payouts for nothing as well.", 9748, "85523a701ee64c3d1cb2af84e7bbfcf7aa", 0],
	100609 : ["What a fantastic answer from El Guapo! I wish I could put it as well but I can't.  No, it is not time to bring back the death penalty in the UK and it should be banned in every other country in the world. The existence of the death penalty is a stain on the human race and there is not, and never could be, the slightest justification for using it.  Put simply, killing people is wrong and 2 wrongs do not make a right.", 9748, "None", 2],
	100610 : ["I used to be pro-death penalty, but I have changed my stance, for several reasons: 1. By far the biggest reason is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. Look at all the criminals who are being released after years of imprisonment because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. No matter how rare it is, the government should not risk executing one single innocent person. Really, that should be reason enough for most reasonable people.  If you need more, read on: 2. Because of the extra expense of prosecuting a DP case and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life. 3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best.  In the U.S., violent crime rates are actually higher in death penalty states.  This may seem counterintuitive, but think about the mixed message it sends: we're trying to take a stand against murder…by killing people.  The government becomes the bad parent who says, ‘do as I say, not as I do.' 4. There's also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst of our criminals.  Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON'T have, until they rot of old age. 5. Your government is supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  For example, Matthew 5:38-39 insists that violence shall not beget violence.  1 Peter 3:9 argues AGAINST “eye for an eye”-type justice.  Leviticus 19:18 warns against vengeance (which, really, is what the death penalty amounts to).  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\"", 9748, "73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa", 2],
