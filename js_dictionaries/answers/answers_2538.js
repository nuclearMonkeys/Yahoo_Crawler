	132747 : ["Alright kiddo, let's iron this out real quick. First of all, you cannot enlist into a Special Forces group. You can, however, acquire an 18x contract that takes you to OSUT, Airborne, SOPC, and SFAS. After your first day of SFAS, it is entirely up to you to make it to group (about 70-75% will not make it to a team). By the way, many 18x's washout of the pipeline before they even get to Selection (SFAS). Getting through selection is not something you should be betting on. Even if you get through the course, you are not guaranteed to be selected. So, if you enlist in the Marines you must serve your time. When your time is done, you must enlist in the Army and hope they still have the 18x program at that time. Not trying to discourage you, just giving you the facts. Edit to add: SFAS is only the first step to getting into SF training. If you are allowed to continue, you still have at least 1.5 years left of training (and that is without any medical problems).", 11158, "1S79ogHAaa", -1],
