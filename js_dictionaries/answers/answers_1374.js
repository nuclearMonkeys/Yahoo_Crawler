That leaves Obama with only needing to win at most 2 of the states he flipped in 2008, which by all indicators he should do easily. I hate to break it to the Cons but realistically 2014 will be the earliest you can feasibly get some power back.  Thats just the cold hard reality of the political landscape right now, sorry.", 8766, "QEYFU5Lvaa", 0],
	74306 : ["Well, what I figure the Republicans should do is just sit back and ride out the Obama Experience as best they can, keeping meticulous notes along the way.

	74312 : ["I don't call myself \"Caucasian\" unless specifically asked if I am, such as on an application for a job or when doing paperwork for one thing or another that asks such questions formatted to ask specifically what the color of my skin is. Likewise, I don't know why such things should matter or are an issue for some people as it clearly is an issue with you. I am not technically white. White is a color that is clear. Such as white out. If I put white out on my hand, it would not match my skin pigmentation. Same as saying someone is black. Black is a very dark color. The darkest in fact. If you took a black marker and marked someone black with it, the black marker would leave a very visible mark that doesn't match the skin pigmentation. However, we still say white and we still say black when we talk about skin color, however inaccurate it is. Which is why, to be more accurate, some people have begun, in trying to be both politically correct and to be more correct based on actual color definition, to use terms like \"African American\" and \"Caucasian\". I see no problem with that. Why do you?

	74313 : ["OK then black and white, to be honest that makes more sense than saying African American and Caucasian American. So would that make Hispanic Americans brown, Asian Americans well they could be yellow, brown. What would one call Indian Americans? I see them as just words used to classify people by skin tone and ancestry myself. African American are people who's ancestors are from Africa, Caucasians, people who's ancestors come from Europe and so on. ", 8765, "1TrRrWMLaa", 0],

What you're basically saying is like why do the British call it snogging when you're f***ing kissing? It's kissing so they should call it that. Except with sports. Plus Americans are bullheaded.

The Palestinians show us everyday that they will not be satisfied until every Jew in the world is dead and the world ignores that.

In four years when inflation is out of control, people are on 6 month waiting lists for health care, and nothing is getting produced.

	74324 : ["I don't even know if he has talked to congress, he may have before leaving for Brazil.  Obama must give reports to congress and if he cites Section 4(a)(1) (50 USC Sec. 1543(a)(1)) of the War Powers Act he can keep them there for 60 days without congressional approval, longer than that he needs full approval or bring the troops home. Clinton cited this section and kept our troops in Kosovo longer but congress was unable to come to a resolution condemning or taking any actions against him since at this time the congress was controlled by the democrats. UN Resolution 1973, does give the authority to establish a no-fly zone but it does not compel the United States participation in these actions.
