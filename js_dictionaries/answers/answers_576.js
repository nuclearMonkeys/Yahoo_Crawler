	32605 : ["Because people think the game started in the 2000's and can't understand the following: 1) The Premier League exists because 5 clubs (LIV, EVE, MNU, ARS, TOT) wanted to breakaway from the EFL and did so forming their own league so they could get more TV revenue from this fledging group called Sky. 2) The Champions League has only existed since the late 1990's, because UEFA wanted to fend off competing entities AND wanted more money in TV rights as pay TV was becoming more common. Reminder for everyone that history repeats itself.  So in another 20-25 years you'll have some other group trying something similar. This nonsensical dirge about \"the people's game\" is pure crap.  It never was and never will be.  Chairmen in ENG/ITA/ESP don't want the German model, so they have what they have.  From a legal perspective, who's going to buy out FSG, The Glazers, Kroenke, and Bonesaw Petrostate FC (Man City)?  Do Supporters groups really have that amount of money and do they have legal standing to force a sale?  Hint- this gets decided in court. All of the talking heads on Sky are upset because if this Super League comes to pass, it devalues their Premier League rights because they're losing the six biggest clubs (they don't have rights to Champions League games; that's through BT Sport) and likely impacts domestic cups as well.  These former players welcomed Sky's money and did very well.  They liked Sky being a disruptor.  But now, they don't want to be disrupted. Prediction: similar to what happened in Australia during their Super League \"war\" in the 1990's.  1-2 years of two different competitions and more lawsuits than I can count, followed by a settlement, likely some joint venture clubs (where two clubs become one), and a slightly smaller Premier League.  Guessing that the players will sue UEFA on restraint of trade over being banned from international football and they certainly have a case.", 4999, "Pc0QjrQ4aa", 0],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death.

Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find.
