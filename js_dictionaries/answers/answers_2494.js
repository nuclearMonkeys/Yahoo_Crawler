	130524 : ["The problem with this question is that you already believe you have the answer.  And, anyone who would contridict your view will be in line for personal attack of their opinion. My view is:  No, Bush is not a coward.  It's real easy to isolate one small view of his presidency and call him whatever you wish to.  Take a look at the bigger picture. The US is economically, financially tied to China.  On top of that, it is already butting heads with them over Taiwan.  The USA has too much invested and too much already going on with this country to start more by skipping the Olympics.  Besides, skipping the Olympics over internal unrest in their own country?  Please.  This is not the Afghanistan/Soviet senario.  Maybe the Chinese actions against it's own people may be rough, but it's not our position to tell China how to deal with thier own problems.  Do you see the Chinese government telling the US how to put down College protests, White hate groups and radical militia groups within it's own borders? Here's a tip that many people need to heed:  Stay out of internal problems of other countries.  It's not your business.  It's never been your business.  If you want to start fixing the world's problems....start with your own back yard first.", 11073, "AA11571990", 2],

Nothing good can come from Bush dissing the Olympics - just more ill-will between our countries.  After the earthquake in Sichuan, I think we need to back off just a little on expressing our opposition to China's governmental and military policies and show our compassion through respectful attendance of the Olympics.", 11073, "dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa", 4],
	130527 : ["There are many ways to describe a story. One of the most effective in my opinion, is to set the scene. Many contemporary novels such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Merchant of Venice and Ethan Frome all use this technique.  However, if your story is more action based, starting a story with dialougue may be useful since it automatically draws the reader to what is happening. I call it \"Set Backwards\": You immediately go into action and set the scene as the story progresses. Other ways to improve a story is to use all five senses. Not everything should be based on sight e.g. \"In a distance, I saw a shadow\". It'll be more effective with other senses and proper punctuation too e.g.: \"The air was thin. As I walked through the gloomy, dark narrow road, I heard the rustlings of melancholy trees and shadows casted in a distance\". This is a lot more effective and helps the reader visualize what is happening. But the key rule to remember is not to always use big words. Throw them here and there. Using big words constantly will make it to obvious that you are trying to sound smart. As a saying goes: \"You are only as smart as the person you are talking to\". I would also suggest you visit your local library or Wikipedia. Read some novels (especially the introduction) and note down the plot, how they introduce characters etc. My personal favourite is To Kill A Mockingbird written by Harper Lee.  If your story is going to teachers, don't use childish things! Things like fairies are bound to put your teacher to sleep. Talk about racism, or the constant battle between good and evil etc. Adults are more serious, and they are your targeted audience so you must write it out as if you were an adult. Useful links include: Good Luck with the story~ 14 years old.", 11070, "None", 2],

	130529 : ["No matter which way you choose to write a story, the beginning should be something that grabs their attention and makes them want to keep reading. I like to start out with some sort of descriptive action, that demands the attention, and that they keep reading to know what is going on.  You can also start with a line of dialogue. I wouldn't start with a line such as \"Okay, I'll talk to you at four o'clock\", but something like \"Hold on to these really tight, or they'll fall and break\".

I Loved my BF, but i thought for sure he would book it once our daughter was born. But he didn't. On October 2004 We welcomed wonderful baby girl into this world! I was so happy, But so worried all at the same time. My boyfriend joined the Marine Corps after she was born. I am now 22 years old and my daughter is 5. My boy friend and i got married almost 5 years ago to my teenage sweetheart(the farther).  And we are now expecting Baby #2 on September 16th. My mom and i also made amends.

Usually to fix this on my own network I have all of my network components running (modem, routers, switches, computers etc.) and connected and then run the network setup wizard on all the computers.
