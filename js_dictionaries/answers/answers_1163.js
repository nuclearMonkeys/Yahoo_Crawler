It is located about 30 minutes from Dallas and its in a big metro plex. It is on the edge so there are a lot of wide open spaces. One of brothers lived there and loved it. My other brother lives in Phoenix, housing is real cheap now, but if you like to be outdoors summer is miserable. I know you think that a Missouri summer is humid and Phoenix is a dry heat, the oven is also dry. I've never been to Springfield, but I have been to Cleveland and Cinncinati.

I do not profess to understand the mathematics, let alone any of the rest, of the theory, but I do understand the scientific method and I keep up with what is happening in the peer-reviewed literature to some extent.

Years ago, I was a frequent reader of popular scientific periodicals and the NY Times Science section; at one point I had a pretty good layman's working knowledge of various topics (I fully admit I never quite got a handle on superstring theory). My recollection of my readings is not what it once was, but what I read and digested at the time made a lot of sense. Sort of like: I understand in principle how a car operates, even if I could not design/repair a car part. At the same time, I fully acknowledge the possibility that a better theory could come about. I support Big Bang as the best theory I am aware of based on the evidence I am/was aware of; I do not 'believe' it per se - I wasn't there and I have no way of knowing for sure.

I don't know.. and I don't know how the universe started. I am ok with that. I will wait for evidence that I can understand and accept without having to be a genius. If we find the real answer, we will all be able to gain new understanding. I am inclined to think that it is highly improbable that mankind has so easily found the answer, I admit we are ignorant, but I look forward to a time when we can dispell our ignorance about how it all started. PS As for the people comparing it to blowing up the materials to build a house and ending up with a complete and perfect home.. That is not a good analogy, you are talking about things that don't have complex interactions.. For example put a nail and a piece of wood together and they don't interact.. but put matter and anti-matter together and they do. We're talking about forces, not inanimate objects here. Forces interact with eachother as do chemicals and elements. It's not the same concept at all.. to say blowing up a printshop will make a dictionary..

I believe that a flaming monkey lives inside your rectum. Are you open-minded enough to accept my word alone as proof? If you are, then that's not open-mindedness, it's gullibility. That appears to be in your character. P.S. Research the origins of Christianity and your precious messiah with an open mind. Your unbiased research (no biased Christian websites or literature) will reveal that no evidence has EVER been unearthed to confirm the existence of Jesus; that the first New Testament was published by the Roman Catholic Church in the late THIRD century (how does that grab you, born-again Protestant?); that the earliest gospel (Mark) has been dated at NOT EARLIER than 70 AD, hardly an eyewitness testament to the alleged miraculous events surrounding your god-man. But I know you won't, because you're too comfortable in your delusion that heaven exists and the only way to get there is through your Christ. This alone makes you one very closeD-minded individual. My sympathies. Edit @ Sam P - Creationism was laughed out of the legitimate scientific community a long time ago. Nothing that you have cited is irrevocable proof of the existence of your God.  Even if there were an actual \"Creator\" of the universes, there is no reason to assert that it is the god of Abraham (a time-travelling celestial alien would do just as well). As a very intelligent human once said: \"When a natural explanation suffices, why resort to the supernatural?\" May I recommend that you Google UNBIASED non-Christian websites that will refute everything in the creationist websites that you're so closed-minded about? With an open mind, it will be revealed to you why creationism is pseudo-scientific hogwash.

	63666 : ["Right after World War I (May 1919), the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America held a meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, at which ‘the possibility of a new and a better world' was announced. One speaker asserted: “It will be a new world in which the principle of competition shall have given way to the principle of association and fellowship. It will be a new world in which the principle of unity shall have replaced the principle of division . . . It will be a new world in which brotherliness and friendship will have displaced all antagonisms except the war against evil.” Do the churches believe this new world will come by means of God's Kingdom government promised in the Bible? Actually, they looked --and obviously still look-- to political & other organization/s to bring such a new world.  One church leader said:  “What we speak of today as the League of Nations, is an indispensable and unavoidable implicate of all our Christian faith and endeavor in the world.” Church leaders of that period even promoted the League of Nations as “the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth.” The 'United Nations' is the second & final name for that League of Nations... Also, the \"Pledge of Allegiance to the United States of America\" states: \"...One Nation, under God...\" Many in government really seem to believe that they are doing God (as in The Creator)'s will.  However, Christ himself stated: “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.” --John 18:33-36, Dy. The \"antichrist” is spoken of as a composite at 1 John 2:18: \"There are many antichrists...\".  The word applies to everyone who denies what the Bible says about Christ, all who oppose his Kingdom, & all who mistreat his followers. It includes not only individuals & organizations, but also nations that either falsely claim to represent Christ -or- that improperly ascribe to themselves the role of Messiah by promising to achieve what only Christ can do--bring about true peace & security. \"Whenever it is that they are saying: “Peace and security!” then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them...\" --1 Thessalonians 5:3a Ironic, isn't it...?", 8212, "None", -1],
