A well regulated militia---The goal b. being necessary to the security of a free State,---The reason c. the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.---The means of accomplishing the goal. This is spelled out in a quote from one of the authors of the 2nd Amendment, Tench Coxe; \"Whereas civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as military forces, which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.\" The National Guard is a select militia, like the Second Amendment was passed to defend against. \"Congress may give us a select militia which will, in fact, be a standing army - or Congress, afraid of a general militia, may say there shall be no militia at all. When a select militia is formed, the people in general may be disarmed.\" -John Smilie Remember that Mao stated that political power comes from gun ownership, which is why the Government needed to impose gun control, so that the government would control the people and the people could not control the government. ALSO, the right to keep and bear arms is one of the defining rights of a free citizen, and the Constitution was amended to protect that, and the other defining rights, for all those born or Naturalized as American citizens.", 9135, "d718e68db0e03feea7b7b84e8684264daa", 0],

The 2nd amendment is in plain English, albeit 18th Century plain English. Read it for yourself - but be aware of 18th Century usage:  As ratified by the States: \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" - Well regulated = very reliable, capable. In the context of a militia it also means \"much like a regular Army unit.\" - Militia = Everyone ABLE to fight. The authors wrote extensively on this. If you COULD fight, YOU are the militia as far as they're concerned. - Security = surety - The people = individuals. When they meant \"the States,\" they said States, not people. - Keep and bear = own and use, deploy - Arms = weapons, specifically those suitable for combat against a professional Army No honest statistical information shows gun control as a good idea. 100% of times and places where more controls were applied, more violence ensued; 100% of times and places where controls were relaxed violence declined. No exceptions. Anyway, even if the opposite were true, RIGHTS are not subject to statistics.", 9135, "ASXeYOjAaa", 2],

It has nothing to do with bias...it has to do with sharks seeing blood and attacking.  Palin is a moron for pushing this book out too fast...she is a greedy woman...that is all.  She saw dollar signs and couldn't wait to do it properly, and now she will pay for it. Now you tell me...does it matter if they didn't fact check Obama's?

I certainly don't think \"Turn the other cheek,\" for example, is always the best policy; and if Christianity as an institution thought so, it would hardly have made it out the gate. I'm a \"moral relativist.\"  (Pause for horrified shrieking.)  I don't believe that there is a single moral code applicable to all people in all circumstances - in fact, this seems to me to be a matter of the most basic common sense.  So each injunction of Jesus needs to be evaluated on its merits relative to a given situation.
