Groups are branded by the US as \"terrorist\" based, not on what they do, but who they are.  Otherwise, they're \"freedom fighters\". The Palestinians are fighting the invaders who've stolen their land, disenfranchised them in their own country, and imprisoned many of them on a kind of reservation.  Sorta like what we did to the Indians here in the New World.  Since they're unable field an army, purchase fighter jets, etc., they are fighting back in the only way possible for a weaker group. Think of it this way: Say you rented a room of your house to me, and over time, I moved more and more of my relatives in, until finally, we were powerful enough take over your whole house, and we forced you out into the back yard, which is surrounded by a tall fence.  You know, because my great-great-great-great grandma once lived there a long time ago, I say the house really belongs to us. Nevermind that your family's owned it for generations. Say the only weapons you have out in the yard are sticks and rocks, but we have guns in every window pointing down on you.  When you start throwing rocks at us, trying to get us out of your house, (which we've re-named, btw), we're gonna tell all the neighbors you're a terrorist, and shoot at you with impunity.
