We have in fact created a God in our own minds with inherent boundaries... boundaries that we ignorantly presuppose to exist, but when you really examine the scope of our understanding of the universe around us, you begin to realize that we have only dipped our toe in a great cosmic ocean and there is far more that we fail to realize, understand, and comprehend... there are questions that we still do not have the capacity or understanding to ask!

	87222 : ["I will try very hard to be as erudition as i can:   First of all i see your very concerned, about the sentence that God has given to the Unbeliever. While it seems long to us in our current state of mortality,we all very soon i believe,will find ourselves changed,to a new state of being immortal. while this seem impossible to us,it is very easy for God. If you think about it He has to do this, we were created in His image and that is Eternal. Yes our Flesh the body dies but what about the real you the thing that can not be seen (The very You of You ) your spirit.   According to Gods word to be absent from the body, is to be present with the Lord for the believer, while Jesus gave us an example of the opposite The rich man that once he die He  was in hell. So God seems to have given mankind a great gift and eternal living spirit,those of us who refuse to take the Free gift of Faith of are own free wills are still eternal spirits and God must place you in a place that will be away from Him, don't forget about the Holiness of God, sin can not be anywhere near Him,   Now with this in mind you have said its not fair and its too long, if he lets you out would you repent, I think if you will not repent now the same will be true then, so it is written and it will be a place of no return your chance to get right with God through Jesus Christ is Now Only", 9255, "None", 0],

Others think it is fair that people work to take care of themselves.

OK, God woke up one day, like I did, about 20 years ago, and opened a restaurant, and ran it well, now I'm on to other things, with my managers running it.  Now, God, woke up one morning, in a vast darkness, and thought, wow, I'll make sparkly things, 'suns' and then planets started circling around them, sort of like waitresses and customers did around my restaurant, and suddenly, (In God's years, life came about, because of his miraculous wave of his hand)  OK, this would have been millions of years ago, then suddenly, we, humans wake up, an realize we are not just chimps and monkeys anymore, we really care about our spouse, mate, whatever, and offspring.

	87229 : ["Yes, this is an interesting argument. The loving God of Scripture revealed the answer to this question to me a couple years ago. It's like this: Mr Jim commits a sin. God offers forgiveness but Jim says \"No way.\" and doesn't want anything to do with God and so he lives his life the way he wants to until he dies. Now keep in mind that sinners can not be in the presence of God, who is perfect. So, Jim faces God and God judges him righteously and when he is found to be a sinner, he is SO afraid that he jumps into the lake of fire (Hell). Now, if God were to take him out of Hell, Jim would simply once again jump into the lake of fire out of fear, because he simply can not be in the presence of God, because he is stained with sin that he never allowed God to take away when he had the chance. and so, unless we accept the gift of forgiveness while we still can, we will never be allowed to enter the gates of heaven.  Hope I helped.  Please email me any questions you may have. Take care and God bless.", 9255, "FarcWPNeaa", 1],
	87230 : ["~Wow~ You know, this is a good question. I do not know everything there is about my Christ and Savior, but I would just like to mention a couple of things. First of all, if you want a book on why us humans are so terrible, read the King James Bible. It is the living Word of God, and if you truly want to know more about Him, He will reveal more of His nature to you through it. Secondly, YES! God is a loving and forgiving God, but we have sinned against Him. \"For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.\" (Romans). When God made the world, there was no sin. He created everything (people, trees, and animals, so there is NO EVOLUTION). The first two people He made were Adam and Eve. They lived in the Garden of Eden, and were forbidden to do ONE thing: Eat from the tree of life in the middle of the Garden. Eve sinned and ate from the tree, then gave it to Adam to eat. God cast them out of the Garden, because He cannot stand sin. Adam and Eve's sin has been passed onto us. You can go and try to blame Eve for our sinful nature, but if she hadn't done it, you or I would have. The wrath of God is terrible, but His love for us is like no other; that is why He made a way for us to be with Him forever. He did not want any of us to perish and go to hell, but whoever rejects him and lives for himself, is destined to eternity in hell. You can also go the other way: We only live for a tiny amount of years. Why do we have the privilege of spending eternity in Heaven with Him, where there is no pain, fear or sin???? Because God sent down His One and only Son to die on the cross for all of our sins (past and present), that \"Whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.\"  John 3:16.

This is the second death.\"  Seems to me that the Lord is just that He gives everyone a second chance, by at least judging their works. Abd whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life, was cast into the lake of fire.\"  Seems to me these are the ones, who mocked the Lord and blasphemed His name, and never called upon Him with a contrite heart and humbled in spirit.

Now we have to consider that there were many God fearing men and women throughout history such as the Patriarchs,Abraham, Moses etc, who loved and worshipped God, but they cannot be said to deserve Hell? nor could they enter the glory of heaven so what does this leave? For the Catholic church the answer is simple and it is the doctrine of Purgatory, The Catholic Church defines purgatory as a \"purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven,\" which is experienced by those \"who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified\" It notes that \"this final purification of the elect . . . is entirely different from the punishment of the damned\" Even those who before the coming of Christ who loved God were sinners to some extent, and so it is contended that they awaited the salvation of Jesus in that place of purification(Purgatory) God bless.", 9256, "0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa", 2],
