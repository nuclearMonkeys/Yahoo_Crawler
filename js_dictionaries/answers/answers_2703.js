Also, register as close to the shower as possible, as stock is rotated regularly, adn the thigs you register for may not even be in stock when your guests would be looking for gifts for you. We went through our lists in the stores right before the shower to make sure our guests could easily get the items on the registry, and STILL items weren't there when people tried to buy them. That's annoying for them!  We registered at 3 stores-Target, because they have everything, Macy's, because it was the only place they had dishes we liked and JCPenney's, because their prices for the exact same items were MUCH cheaper than those sold at Macy's. I felt like we had registered for so much stuff, but our lists were practically cleared out after the shower, and we only had about 32 people there! The most expensive thing we registered for was the Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer at $300 or so, and the cheapest was about a dollar. Many items were in the $20-$50 range.", 11490, "AA11603468", 0],

I got a lot of great stuff off my registry. You just need a lot of stuff in the 25-50 range.  Lot of choices because it's funny what people buy- no one wants to buy towels or china anymore!!

	140992 : ["It's difficult to judge extracts from the middle of a story, because we, as readers, don't have the information about the characters to know how well they've been established in the story, how their thought processes here may be similar or different than before. Beginnings are much easier to judge, because they're meant to hook, to entice, to lure in with good writing and establishment of story.  Also, it sometimes takes years for a real improvement to be obvious, especially in such small extracts. I compare my writing from ages 11 to 14 and it wasn't much different. But when I compared 14 to 18, it was eye-opening. And from 18-25 it was miraculous. Don't take our judgment as gospel truth. Just because we don't see the improvement yet, doesn't mean you're not improving. You might be getting better at things we can't see in the extracts: at crafting good plots, at having twists in your story, at coming up with interesting characters, at dialogue, etc. So DON'T be discouraged when people get it wrong. If you're a true writer, though, the discouragement won't last long and you'll keep writing, no matter what we think!!! :D But judging these three, I would say that none of them really stand out as \"wow! The writing is so much better than the others!\"  #1 is dull, in terms of story, so it's hard to focus on the writing. A \"literally perfect\" girl, bored and taking a break from life in a coffee shop? The writing isn't awful but the subject matter is hard to read through without becoming disinterested. #2 is funny, but too wordy. You use several sentences to say what you could say in a single sentence. The internal conflict is much more interesting than 1, but the writing isn't much different. #3 feels like a mishmash of details at the beginning that I can't keep up with, but I also feel like a story is being told through these details. Even if you're not doing it effectively, telling a story through details, letting the readers come up with conclusions by showing details, is an important step. But the thing that flags this as more immature writing is the excessive use of adverbs. 4 adverbs in one sentence, even! Briefly, Sluggishly, Blindly, Religiously... adverbs should be like spices, not main ingredients.  If I had to guess, I would say that Extract 2 was written most recently, as a 14 year old.  I feel like Extract 3 is better than 1, in terms of interesting story and details, even if it's not written well. Like I said, it's really a guess. None stand out as AHA! Keep writing, keep improving, and the improvements will become more and more obvious!", 11487, "AA10015648", 0],

It was really important that the style of dress i chose could be worn again by them with ease and little alteration if they needed a beautiful dress for future occasions that they may have to attend. I made sure that all my gowns had matching jackets, so the women who felt uncomfortable about showing their arms would not have to if they chose not to. (strap style dress under jacket)   I also chose an empire style waist seen in many popular women's fashions, and kept the body of the dress streamline(no flare, straight body) so they could cut the dress and turn it into a beautiful cocktail dress for their next occasion. (which they all later had them cut for cocktail dresses and got there monies worth and had the matching satin jacket for even corporate events if they chose). I kept all my dresses fairly affordable at a price range of $150-$200 and purchased as their bridal party gifts a necklace and earring set (clip earrings to accommodate ladies with unpierced ears). This way all my girls were wearing the same style jewelry (made for a more cohesive look) and saved them money. For my matron of honor, I purchased a similar jewelry set, but it was slightly different due to her being the matron of honor to make her feel special. and important. For shoes my girls went and got satin white high heel shoes from shoe store of their choice and had them dyed to match dress to minimize cost. (had free swatches provided to all girls from bridal salon to make it easier for the color match on shoes).  Hope this info. helps! Have a happy, healthy, and prosperous marriage!

	141010 : ["All of the extracts are not bad in the writing style but I found that the first one was not very interesting and there are some minor errors. e.g. You use the word 'troubles' too close to each other. Make the second one 'problems' or something similar. You also use the term 'literally perfect' when it is clear she isn't. I would suggest you add to the term so it reads something like 'most people thought she was literally perfect.' Would she really want to be known as 'the hottest place in town?' The second excerpt I liked a lot because you have captured how a lot of families act towards their children and their achievements. The touch of sarcasm at the end was in my view typical of the reaction such indifference would promote. Excerpt three is fine but why is it that no teenager seems to wash when they get up in the morning? Also don't use numbers unless it is the year. It looks more professional to write either \"eight fifty one\" or nine minutes to nine.\" I liked all of the excerpts but I would think that the first one was your earliest simply because of the use of the word 'trouble' in quick succession.
