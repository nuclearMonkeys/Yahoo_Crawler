I don't quite remember. The church was in debt for many years, and then we started increasing the stress on tithing. Now we are very profitable, and we are able to buy the best things for our temples. Is less than best good enough for the Lord's house? I think not. And you are mistaken when you said we \"revise\" our Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon stays the same. And don't even bring up that stupid 3,000 errors or whatever it is.

The high gloss paint-although it looks hard to paint over-really isn't any different than a low gloss paint.  Chemically speaking it will all work out the same. And let me give you a tip I learned.  Go to your local paint store (preferably Benjamin Moore if you have one) and get your paint from them.  Its really isn't any more $$ than the paint you get at Lowe's or Home Depot, and its so much better.  It covers so much more area.  Even if its a little more (maybe $3 per gallon) you will only need half the amount of paint than you will if you buy the American Traditions or whatever from the home improvement store.  Seriously.  I was amazed at the difference. (Unfortunately I didn't learn this until AFTER I repainted my house.  Work sprung for the good stuff when we remodeled and it was awesome.

	68053 : ["Yes, to the first two questions, but the existence of mistakes isn't justification for those mistakes. \"Does it mean we throw out the entire concept or do we work out the areas that need to be refined or re-examined\"? Sometimes it does mean we throw out the entire concept. It depends upon the situation. Sometimes things are broken beyond repair or have reached the maximum amount of good/bad they can do. \"Take for example the issue of quotas...this was an honorable attempt to correct a very real problem, but the result has been controversial. Could it be that mistakes are possible even though the original idea behind it was honorable\"? Not only is it possible, but we have a truism surrounding this very idea \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\".  \"And don't you think that society will smooth out these rough spots? Won't social evolution eventually iron out the mistakes if they are indeed mistakes\"? Perhaps, but then again perhaps not. It is impossible to tell the future. This very argument can be used against feminism as well though. \"Is it not reasonable to assume that correcting hundreds of years of inequality might produce remedies that are not always the best answers to a given problem\"? It is only human to expect some flawed decisions to be made but again that isn't justification for those decisions. \"Why can't people grasp that women don't want special rights, we just want equality\"? It's hard to say what \"women\" want as I don't believe feminists nor anyone else can speak for all women, only most women. Then there is the problem as to what is meant by \"equal rights\". Does that mean that there are separate buses for men and women? Separate schools for men and women? Or does it mean the same schools for men and women and the same public transportation? What is meant by \"equal rights\"? Sometimes it is the case that one can find people that support one of those ideas but not the other.  \"And there are bound to be mistakes made trying to achieve this? It doesn't mean the whole concept of equality is flawed, does it\"? Yes, chances are, there are going to be mistakes but the existence or occurence of such mistakes is not justification for them happening. This doesn't imply that equality is flawed, but true equality is nearly impossible, if not impossible, to achieve. It would take a great amount of government intervention or some other outside intervention to achieve and the effects of that intervention might be too big of a price to pay.", 8440, "crIDg6zAaa", 0],

The basic concept of quotas may be good, the implementation of that concept, I think, is flawed.  As long as people continue to think that women are being given preferential treatment because we are women, there will be resntment.  This does not mean we should throw up our hands and quit.   We wish to be treated as equal contributors and many of us are.  What we most desire is fair compensation for what we do.  The male nurse who makes more money than the female nurse because he \"has a family to support\" is a prime exapmle of just how unequal systems continue to be.  Historically female career paths have been and remain underpaid and undervalued.  Social Work is another one.  I don't pretend to have all the answers, but the problem continues to be clear. The quota system for women rode in on the coat tails of the civil right movement.  Quotas for black male employees came first, then women.  Is is clear in our history that the women's movement has always lagged one step behind the Civil rights movement.  How many remember that black men had the right to vote before white women did?  Not many. This is not a resolved social issue, but a very real immediate one.  Women are still not given equal value in or society.

For instance, there were very few activities that my children participated all of last year that were not completely or mostly funded by the church: boy scout camp(s)--there were several, girl's camp, youth conference, and many many youth activities each week that involved craft and art projects, food and cooking, ect. All paid for by the church funds. The same for adult activities, for the most part. We have fun very cheaply, and contribute very little outside of out tithings. If any member of the church needs financial help in any way, all he needs to do is talk to his bishop and explain the situation, and he will receive the help he needs. Of course there are conditions to that--a person must truly be in need and be truly worthy of help. But that is just a tiny thing--nobody ever speaks about it, but the church donates huge amounts to disaster relief and such. One young Marine in our ward joined the church after his experience in Iraq: He was tasked to unload trucks filled with food and goods for a village in Iraq, and saw on each crate the words \"Donated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.\" He said that interested him about the church enough to seek it out.

	68061 : ["I just painted my house the living room & hall ways. I didn't sand anything nor did I pay unecessary money for a primer. I used BEHR paint with a Satin finish. I purchased it at Home Depot. This is only the second time in 10 years that I've painted. If the previous color was a dark high gloss, I would recommend using a primer. Sanding is mainly to smooth out the \"bumps\" in the walls. Have fun painting.", 8442, "None", 0],
	68062 : ["It's all about adhesion, and primer is not always necessary for adhesion. Primer is necessary to seal up raw surfaces. Sanding is necesary for adhesion. Imagine what's happening on a microscopic level. When you paint, the paint needs to grab hold of something (this is known as a mechanical bond). Primer is made to have all sorts of little microscopic area where the paint can grab hold. Sanding serves this same purpose. Flat and eggshell Interior latex wall paints are so porous that there are lots of places for the paint to grab hold. However, glossier latex, exterior latex and all alkyd paint are smoother, and so sanding is necessary to guarantee adhesion. In those cases, sanding is even necessary for primer to have something to grab hold of (primer needs to bond also).  People at the paint stores only know what the paint suppliers tell them, and paint suppliers don't tend to emphasis the importance of sanding because people tend to not like to sand and if they actually told them the truth, they would sell less paint, or buy someone else's paint which doesn't tell people they need to sand. If you paint without being mindful of adhesion, the paint will probably hold for a while, maybe even for multiple coats. But as each layer of paint dries, it shrinks, which puts tension on the previous coat. Eventually this tension builds up until the paint comes loose at the layer of weakest adhesion. When sanding, it's not enough to just scratch the surface. Scratches are on a macro level compared to the bonding which happens with paint. You have to sand until the entire surface is dulled. Harsher grits do not guarantee better adhesion. In fact it's generally a good idea to not use so harsh a grit that the scratches show through the finish (it looks tacky). This is all for the sake of creating a mechanical bond between coats of paint. There's also what's known as a chemical bond. The most common example of this is lacquer. When a coat of lacquer is applied over another coat of lacquer, the new coat softens the previous coat, causing the two coats to meld together and form a very strong bond. This is also what liquid sandpaper does (alkyd only, not to be used with latex). If you rub a surface with liquid sandpaper until you feel the surface bite, then paint, the new coating melds into the old coat, forming a chemical bond between the coats. Your paint job will probably require two coats. The first coat will be un-even because parts will suck in to the sanded previous coat, but the second coat should then have the full depth and richness that you're looking for.", 8442, "AA11757354", 2],

I don't like that everyone in the house is (other than two people) a twenty-something who obviously is on the air to get \"discovered.\"  And I especially hate how stagey the show is, from the introductory videos of the individual housemates, which took a page out of MTV's dating show book at scripting testimonials, all the way to the polarizing factors of certain people in the house (Kail believes homosexuality is a choice, so she was obviously brought in to bump heads with Joe and Dustin at some point, which is as bad as bringing in a racist or a Nazi). A lot of the people (such as Jen, Joe, Danielle, Carol, and Jessica so far) don't even seem like real people so much as caricatures-- like they've fit a stereotypical mold, used that to their advantage to get on the show, and are now hamming it up even more for the cameras.   They should just call this season \"CBS' The Real World.\" I read a recap of the second episode about Jen crying over a picture, and that alone made me want to smack her. It was bad enough the way she was talking about herself during the introductions, like she's just Miss Perfect, and if it wasn't over something so petty, I would have enjoyed seeing her knocked down a peg or two.  I agree about Carol being voted out over Amber, too, though, because I think parents who come on shows like this really have motivated (and a good one) to do the shows.  They give up a lot to potentially win money that could change their kids' lives, but it's not an easy decision to make. As far as the guys go, I think Eric's great, but I'm afraid the America's Choice twist is going to majorly sabotage him, and I hope that's not true.  Nick is the most attractive guy in the house, physically, in my opinion, but he has that frat boy aura that will probably annoy me sooner rather than later if I keep watching.

Anyone who says anything wrong about feminism is called sexually inadequate, sexist and patriarchal. That I believe is wrong. If you're struggling for something, you should be open to suggestions and questions. Yes, women want equality and not special rights. Feminists do want special rights and advantages, and they've got them for women. You can't say that women don't take advantage of these rights in the least. What rights? We'll start with VAWA, abortion rights, Baby Moses law, the imagined wage gap and divorce proceedings. Feminists have a history of insulting and ruining the lives of people who criticized them instead of presenting counter-arguments. Why?  Since the advent of the internet, people have been able to criticize it anonymously, but people still find it hard to believe that feminism has strayed from its purpose. That's what has really happened. Feminism has stayed in places where women are liberated pretending that they're not, coming up with twisted 'facts' to get more of the above mentioned special rights for women. It didn't know when to stop and just got power-hungry. It has not gone to nations where women really suffer, for the simple reason that special rights are not going to be available there.

And men as a whole don't want to lose power.  Men as a whole aren't against women, just against losing out themselves because of women. And the only way they can see to prevent women from doing this that they see is to stop the movement.  But if they try to stop the movement directly they'll look morally wrong, like they are trying to subjegate women. So instead they try to undermine the movement by pointing out any faults.
