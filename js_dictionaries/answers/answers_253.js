	12663 : ["I think your mistaking Hollywood for all upper class. People who live in LA such as rich actresses are a lot different than the average wealthy individual. Part of their job is literally to dress up, wear a lot of makeup.. so it makes sense that they would translate it into everyday life as well.  I grew up in a pretty wealthy area in the state of Louisiana & people who are wealthy here prefer to dress down & keep their wealth hidden & on the Low.   There is just something so much more elegant about being wealthy & keeping it on the low.. instead of flashing all sorts of name brand things around. In my opinion flashing wealth can almost make you look tacky. Anybody who is actually wealthy knows that many of the retail stores like Louis Vuitton and Gucci actually are targeted towards poor people who want to appear wealthy. Keep that in mind bc much of the upper class knows this.  I would prefer to have the more polished middle class look any day.   Idk, I myself prefer more of a relaxed lowkey look and I'm someone who did come from money.   One of the greatest quotes I've ever heard is “some people are so poor all they have is money”.. let it sink in.   Life is about so much more than flashy things, wealth & looking good all the time. Life is about experiences, family & friends. ", 2124, "eW4ksnQEaa", 0],

Both were short lived and unexpected. The moods I was in were very different for each event. Yet I do clearly remember feeling strange immediately before the events. However remembering how I felt afterwards, that was a much tougher time for me. My patented blend of sophomoric egotism, skepticism and cynicism had proven unable to process what had happened.

Either a licensed *clinical psychologist* (PhD or PsyD) or a *licensed-clinical social worker* (LCSW) may provide an \"official\" mental health diagnosis and/or may administer cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt), for instance, which deals with how one's thoughts may affect one's behavior. A board-certified psychiatrist (M.D. or D.O.) or even a psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (NP) may administer a mental health evaluation, and/or may prescribe medication for those with mental health conditions, such as if recommended.

	12684 : ["I don't know what happened to Andrew. I haven't seen him around recently, although I have seen some anonymous answers that are very Andrew-like in wording and style. His name keeps coming up, because he used to be very active in this category, answering a lot of questions. He was well-read and knew what he was talking about, hence why you find other answers agreeing with his. To me he seemed like a genuinely nice guy, but he wasn't someone to sugarcoat anything, and he could occasionally come across as harsh and rude. I believe this was in part because he was fed-up with the trolls and some of the more asinine questions being repeatedly asked in here, just as many of the other regulars myself included, are. This is of course just a guess on my end. Maybe that harshness got him blocked/deleted? Or maybe he just reached his breaking point and decided not to bother with Yahoo Answers any more. I know I've been tempted to leave several times myself as well. In any case, I've missed seeing him around, but since the site is closing down, I guess it doesn't make any difference any more.", 2115, "5c7569b25d7c5784cb92c0ca179f21bcaa", 8],
	12685 : ["Andrew is a very talented writer and has a lot of potential and he would have to go down as a \"professional troll\". His trolling was hidden beneath scholarship that a Hebrew biblical writer would be proud of but as a lot of what he said was hidden inside great walls of essay which people rarely read he managed to spam the forum with some of the most obscene and vile acts of cyberbullying one could imagine. The person that asked an innocent and interesting question might be the only actual person to read this essay and what it contains is insults regarding the questioners mental capacity that would shock you to the core.  His advice usually included to stop using yahoo answers, take your meds, and after you have got a life, kill yourself. This was typical Andrew. His overall message would be that he is a genius telling you the truth and his opinion is shared by Yahoo Answers and the wider Yahoo community. Next, the questioner would sit and watch as Andrew's thumbs up went 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and this should give you some idea of just how many anonymous sock puppet accounts he had. However this presents a problem for the questioner, should the questioner respond with something obscene such as \"eff off you demented vile and disgusting person\", then everyone is going to see this and it could end up with the questioner being banned, whilst they do not even bother to read exactly what the eloquent Andrew's post actually contains. However Andrew eventually did get banned from Yahoo Answers and his posts finally removed, and this is why you will not be able to see them. However for those that know Andrew, they know he is still here hiding behind a copious amount of anonymous accounts.  Thank you.", 2115, "None", -6],
