The \"Dollars Triology\"  you can see I like certain old Westerns The Worst: 1. Bram Stoker's Dracula--terrible casting and it is really Cappola's Dracula 2. Saving Private Ryan-I find this movie repugnant morally because it condones war crimes by Americans; 3. The Dirty Dozen--Ditto 4. Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan--note Shatner screwed up the greatest possible lead in from a series episode to a movie with his ham acting and the \"watering down\" of the Khan character played by the immortal Ricardo Montalban.
