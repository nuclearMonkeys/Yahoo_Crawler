Most people who go into that line of work do have a broad take on all the orders but specialize in a few.

To get into an Entomology class doesn't require that you know much of anything about insects. The pre-requisites for the course are Zoology and General Biology. Once you take those, you can sign up for entomology. One thing that you'll learn in Entomology are the different orders of insect. Insects are in phylum Arthropoda, subphylum Hexapoda, class Insecta, and they make up many classes. Butterflies and moths are in order Lepidoptera, bees and wasps are in order Hymenoptera, true flies are in order Diptera, etc. Knowing some of this ahead of time may help, along with the evolutionary relationship between orders. In college you'll want to major in biology. After you complete college (if you want a career in entomology) you'll most likely have to go to Graduate School. There you'll work in you interested field.
