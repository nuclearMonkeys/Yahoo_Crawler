Eventually he will if you don't give up, I promise you that, but DON'T give up!  It's worth all the patience and tolerance you have to wait for God to answer in his time.  Don't throw your life away now at this tender age.  There is too much at stack.  When you leave God at a young age, destruction starts to set it and you are still paying for your mistakes many years later.  So, wait for the Lord and don't give in to the devil's tactics.

	125368 : ["Technically, these should all be separate questions. 1)  The Greek word used at Matt. 4:8 is \"oros,\" which is usually translated \"mountain,\" as it was here.  However, this word would more accurately be translated \"high place.\"  In this context, it's possible Jesus and Satan were high above the clouds, looking down on the earth.  Therefore, this is not an error. 2)  The Ecc. 9:5 argument is routinely used by cults such as Jehovah's Witnesses to teach an errant theology known as \"soul sleep.\"  Numerous sources throughout the Bible tell us humans (both saved and unsaved) are conscious after death.  For example, read \"The Rich Man and Lazarus\" beginning at Luke 16:19; see also Revelation 6:9-11, where the souls of Tribulation martyrs cry out to God).  Further, if you read Ecc. 8 in its entirety, you will see that the writer (probably Solomon) specifically states the dead body is dead, but the spirits of the saved live on.  This is not an error. 3)  They saw what the Bible refer to as \"The Angel of God.\"  This is different from seeing God's true personage, which would be too much for an unsaved mortal to bear.  See Exodus 3, for example.  This is not an error. 4)  You need to read the entirety of 2 Kings 16.  This is not a contradiction. 5)  You left out the remainder of 2 Kings 10:30 -- God's blessing was only good until \"the fourth generation.\"  Verse 31 then reads, \"But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.\"  So while Jehu rid Israel of Baalism, he then turned to idol worship, as did his sons.  After the forth generation, when Hosea was writing, God avenged this idolatry.  \"The blood of Jezreel\" is a reference to the work that Jehu did against Baalism, that was good at the time he did it, but was temporary.  This is not a contradiction.", 10831, "2df62b129c1a848c5b5f53b87e8f9620aa", -1],
	125369 : ["Ancient Greek is a dead language.  Since it hasn't been spoken that way in over 1,500 years no one knows how to read between the lines or \"think\" in that language. The disciples were not formally Greek, although they spoke and wrote it.  They could have been thinking in Hebrew or some Middle Eastern dialect. I have a friend who is Lebboneze and on some things he mulls over it by tranlating the English into ARamatic and thinking in Lebboneze.  He makes a lot of mistakes in comprehension that way, because he resists thinking in English even though he's speaking to a lot of Americans. This is where mistakes come from. A recent Codec gives the number of the beast as 616 not 666.  This has casued some confusion. I'm not sure, but I technically don't think Greeks think in terms of 6 score 60 and 6.   We don't think in score at all, today.  Most people have to go to a dictionary to translate Lincolin's 4 score and 7 years ago.", 10831, "None", -2],

	125376 : ["This is a synopsis of a book written by Meher Baba entitled \"God Speaks\" which I think answers your questions adequately. The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word \"Who am I?\". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.  Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to \"Who am I?\" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.  The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in water conversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.  When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.  So the original \"Who am I?\" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.  But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of \"humanizing\" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.  Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, \"When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms), it enters the spiritual path and turns inward.\"  Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of \"planes\" and \"realms.\" But individuality continues along this spiritual path, and there are as many ways to God as there are souls. Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, \"pran.\" There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.  The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. \"The loving of God and the longing for His union,\" says Meher Baba \"is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness.\"  The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of \"Who am I?\" with \"I am God.\" The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.", 10833, "None", 0],

You would both need to get a home study completed by that state and possibly have your home \"licensed\"  Honestly......if you do this and then say you only want a \"legally free\" baby.....you might be waiting a long time.  When you go through foster care...there is a lot of court process, as well as seeing if their are relatives for the child that has been taken out of their parents custody.

	125379 : ["I agree with the other poster, foster care is the best way to go about it. Many are scared to foster because they feel they'll get too attached and won't be able to deal with it once the child leaves. First tell the foster care agents that you really want to adopt an infant. They get many infants where the mother just gives them up...they'll make sure you get a baby that's likely to be available for adoption. Also, fostering will get you ready for having a child in the house. My hubby and I foster cared (had no intent of adoption, LOL) and got a newborn baby from the hospital. They said we'd have him 3 weeks...he turned 5 this summer! =)  He was officially adopted three years ago, and we also were able to adopt his biological sister when she was 4 months old.
