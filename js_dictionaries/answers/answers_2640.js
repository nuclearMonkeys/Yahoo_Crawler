One night, I went down to my cousins hotel room and they had Friday Night Smackdown playing on their TV so I just sat on the couch and watched it with them. I instantly thought it was very entertaining and funny at the same time, and I couldn't stop watching it. When we got back home, I casually would tune into watch Smackdown every now and then, and pretty soon I was hooked. I got familiar with all of the wrestlers and all of the storylines that were going on. After that, I started watching Monday Night Raw and ECW. I quickly became a fan that followed all three shows religiously and I always hated when I would miss an episode. Batista was actually my first favorite wrestler, and I saw him the first time I tuned in to Smackdown. But after awhile, once I got to know all of the wrestlers more, Matt Hardy became my favorite. Then, I started buying a bunch of WWE DVDs and that's how I became a huge fan of Bret Hart and Chris Jericho, as well as a number of others. So, that's basically the story of how a became a WWE fanatic, lol. :)", 11370, "fvMv1DT3aa", 0],

John Worsfold was at home one night watching the news, when he saw TV  footage of an Afghani teenager in Guantanamo Bay Detention centre. This  kid was some kind of athlete, could run like the wind, was strong as an  ox and had a vertical leap to die for. Worsfold was so impressed he got  on the phone, wheeled, dealed, and pulled every string he could and he  managed to get his man to West Coast.  He could immediately see his faith would be rewarded. So impressive  was the kid, that Worsfold named him in on a half forward flank for the  first game of the season. Just before the players ran out onto the  field, Worsfold took his new charge, and the rest of the forwards aside,  for last second instructions at which point he started gesticulating  extravagantly, mimicking the movements to mark the ball \"Catch...  Ball...\" Worsfold started, then drawing a circle around himself  \"turn...around...face... sticks\" he went on, motioning up and down for  the goal posts, before exaggeratedly pretending to kick the ball at  goal saying \"kick... ball... goal....\".  With this the young Afghani drew himself up and said to Worsfold \"Sir,  please, I am an educated young man, I speak English fluently\"..  Worsfold looked the kid in the eye and yelled at him, \"Would you shut up, I'm  trying to talk to Lynchy\".
