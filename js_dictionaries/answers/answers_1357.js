Kennedy. Files has subsequently been interviewed by others and discussed in various books pertaining to the assassination and related conspiracy theories.

	73454 : ["I know that you are talking about EO 11110. First, it was enforced and it was acted upon. Second, the belief that it would somehow bring an end to the Federal Reserve is a conspiracy theory myth and not even a very good one. I will explain it all to you, if you are willing to learn something. This EO (like all of them) is an instruction on how a part of the Executive Branch is supposed to do a certain job. You can read it at  In this case, it's an instruction to the Treasury Secretary delegating to him the president's existing authority to issue silver certficates. The Secretary of the Treasury previously had the power to issue silver certificates under a law that was repealed. In order to have the Secretary gradually phase out silver certificates, Kennedy delegated that authority to the Secretary.  All the Executive Order does is delegate the President's authority to issue silver certificates under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1933 to the Secretary of the Treasury. Here is some background on the power to issue silver certificates. Various laws passed by Congress have given the President and/or the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to issue silver certificates with certain restrictions since at least 1878. The Agriculture Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1933 (48 Stat 51) gave the Office of the President the power to authorize the issue of silver certificates in denominations of $1, $2, $5 and $10 as long as the Treasury had enough silver and the total issue did not exceed $3 billion. The Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (48 Stat 1178) also gave that power to the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury under similar restrictions. Any thing that you may have read on the Internet that claims an amount higher than that is false since there was a $3 billion limit. Beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the U.S. Treasury had to sell more and more of its silver reserves in order to keep the international price of silver close to $1 an ounce. If the price of silver rose too high, then people, businesses, and governments would exchange whatever silver certificates they had for the silver bullion. IOWs effectively removing that currency from circulation. In 1961, Kennedy asked Congress to pass legislation that would allow the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 bills and to generally phase out silver certificates from circulation. On June 4, 1963, President Kennedy signed a law which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (Public Law 88-36, 77 Stat 54). Read it for yourself at   That same law also authorized the Federal Reserve to begin issuing $1 and $2 denominations of Federal Reserve Notes (See section 3 of Title 1 of the previous link). On the same day after he signed that law, President Kennedy issued EO 11110 delegating his authority to issue silver certificates under the AAA of 1933 to the Secretary of the Treasury. That is all that EO 11110 did. Here is a question for all those who believe that EO 11110 would have ended the Federal Reserve. If the delegation of the President's authority to issue silver certificates to the Secretary of the Treasury would have ended the Federal Reserve, why didn't the Federal Reserve come to an end in the 29 years prior when the Secretary of the Treasury already had the power to issue silver certificates under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934? Also, if Kennedy wanted to end the Federal Reserve, why did he sign a law giving the Federal Reserve more authority? Note: The citations to law refer to the U.S. Statutes at Large which can be found in most law libraries and Federal Depository Libraries. The citations are in the form of \"(Volume Number) Stat (Page Number)\". Therefore a citation of 48 Stat 51 refers to Volume 48, page 51 of the U.S. Statutes at Large. You can find a Federal Depository Library in your state at    Finally, it is a MYTH that Federal Reserve Notes have to be repaid with interest. That isn't how the monetary system works. The government borrows money by issuing U.S. Treasury securities which are sold at auction where anyone may buy them, even you. However, the Federal Reserve is prohibited by law from buying these securities at auction and may only buy them on the open market. If you do not know what the open market is, then read an economics textbook written by a respected economist. The U.S. Government pays interest to all holders of the U.S. Treasury securities and not just the Federal Reserve. What is different about the amount held by the Federal Reserve is that the Federal Reserve is required by law to pay all of its net earnings to the U.S. Treasury every year. In 2013, the Federal Reserve earned $51.6 billion on the U.S. Treasury securities that it holds. However, it paid to the U.S. Treasury $79.6 billion. This can clearly be seen on the INDEPENDENTLY AUDITED financial statements of the Federal Reserve, which are public record for anyone who bothers to look.", 8731, "697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa", 2],

But the government has started many new laws (including ObamaCare) that hurt small business and have added regulations that make it more difficult to start a new business. So the primary job creators of our country have been hog tied, right when we need their ability the most. Investment creates wealth wealth creates jobs, jobs create more wealth. And so forth. Example : Investment creates science and engineering for a new widget - New small company gets created to make widget. The new widget needs to be made - people get hired - jobs created.

	73475 : ["The same thing was thought of the Great Depression. It actually ended in 1933. The sharp recovery didn't occur until 1940. People just thought the depression lasted (lingered) until then. The lack of recovery now is related to the same type of policies used then, \"prosperity flows from government\", \"government leads and the private sector should follow\" and \"the private sector cannot be trusted with the general welfare of the people\" socioeconomic attitudes. FDR did some smart, business-oriented reforms, mainly with the banks as soon as he came into office in 1933. The depression ended later that year. Then he went off on the above far Left Progressive Liberal attitudes, the effects of the depression lingered on for 7 more years. Then, despite himself, he was forced to buy planes, tanks, ships bombs, bullets and beans. This was supply-side economics aimed straight at business. The sharp recession, which should have happened in late 1933, happened in late 1940. American recoveries are supposed to start, sharply, soon after a recession is over, the last recession was over in July 2009, almost 5 years ago now. The attitudes above are in play now. In this case, one form has been in over-regulation. An avalanche of regulatory red tape has been spewing out of Washington, burying business, big and small in it. Business owners have been scrambling for cover until it stops. They don't want to expand, creating jobs, until it stops. Threats of tax hikes were another part of the problem during Obama's first term. 55% of all small business (it used to be 65%) and their owners are effected by income tax rates as well as hikes in them. Hiring is a long term commitment. They will not do it if business thinks that a few months down the line, they will be stabbed in the back by some new government-imposed burden. Now, in Obama's second term, Obamacare is an added big government-imposed burden. Two whole new business terms have come out of it. The 49ers and the 29ers. Obamacare says that businesses that employ 50 or more people must supply health insurance. Many businesses were willing to do so before, but the cost of Obamacare is stifling. They'd rather limit their employees to 49 instead of taking on Obamacare. Employees are considered part time if they work 29 hours or less. Part timers do not have to be part of the 50 employee equation. Far more temporary employees have been hired than before Obamacare for this reason. Economic indicators can eventually imply a recovery, but it the recovery is slow, no amount of lipstick on a pig can change that. They will always be on the verge of another economic downturn until business-oriented, smart politics are employed. Slow recoveries will always have more mediocre results than strong, robust recoveries.", 8736, "7gWhhJktaa", 0],
