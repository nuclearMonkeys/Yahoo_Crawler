	51295 : ["Yes you can but be sincere.  God will not be mocked so don't go telling people that you have been saved and are now a Christian just for laughs.  Being a Christian means that you will absolutely believe that there is ONE God and that Jesus is God's Son. You'll also accept that YOU are a sinner in need of a Saviour and that person called Jesus is actually equal with God and dwells with Him and He IS THAT SAVIOUR.  It is to those two that you should go for help, guidance, forgiveness etc. If you cannot accept that they will not just be at our beck and call now and then when you just happen to feel like that.

	51301 : ["ABSOLUTELY>>>  KNOWLEDGEABLE CHRISTIANS KNOW THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE RAPTURE, No, there's not. The “Rapture” refers to a passage in First Thessalonians, chapter 4, which talks about Christians being “caught up” in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Many Christians believe, and the “Left Behind” books promote, that this being “caught up” to meet the Lord will occur before the Great Tribulation which is headed our way in the near future. Christians will simply vanish, meet Jesus somewhere in the air, and then return with Him to Heaven to await the end of time. But notice, in verse 17, Paul says that “…we who are alive, who are left,” shall be caught up. Remember that…those who are “left” get caught up to meet the Lord. The “Left Behind” books get their name from a passage in Luke 17 and a similar passage in Matthew 24 which talk about the coming of the Lord being like the days of Noah and the days of Lot. Matthew 24 puts it this way: “As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man…they ate, they drank, they married and they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Then two men will be in the field, one is taken and one is left. Two women grinding at the mill, one is taken one is left.” “See,” Rapture enthusiasts say, “One is taken, one is left…the Rapture! Jesus takes the Christians and leaves behind non-Christians!” Two problems with that interpretation: First, Jesus' coming is being compared to the days of Noah and the days of Lot. After the flood, who was left? Noah and his family…the good guys…the bad guys were taken! After Sodom and Gomorrah went up in smoke, who was left? Lot and his daughters…the good guys…the bad guys were taken! Second, remember 1 Thessalonians? It says that those who are “left” get to meet Jesus in the air. The good guys are left behind to meet Jesus. In other words, you want to be left behind so that you can get caught up in the clouds to meet Jesus in the air and accompany Him back to earth at His 2nd and final coming. There will be no Rapture like the one the Left Behind books talk about…that view is not scriptural. ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N44R4rgrR58", 7217, "DxpNUSuVaa", 1],
