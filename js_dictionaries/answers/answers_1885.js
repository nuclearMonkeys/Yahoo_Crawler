The more the better (Youtube dose have an upper limit on the number though). c) A good video  description. d) A good network of friends and subscribers. e) Getting 'Likes'. f) Don't forget to 'Share' your video's and 'Post a Bulletin' to your friends. g) Video respond with your videos. So, good content is the hard one. There are no rules, but try to be original, or stick to a theme, or both. Here's an example. Have a  look at this: The trick is to engage your viewer from the start, and keep them watching till the end. Hard to get your video 'Liked', if it's not watched in total.   Tagging your video with as many of the right words is very important. People find your video's with these 'Tags'. Use many tags.  Always do a full, and detailed description of your video (this will help when Google 'crawls' for videos). Provide links as needed.   Make friends. Reach out to other similar channels, and [Add Friend]. Offer Sub4Sub to increase your subscribers.  Double check your editing (smooth transitions, clean/even audio, ECT) before uploading. Sloppy editing on your videos, effect your chances of getting 'Likes'.  Remember too 'Like' your own video (people in your network will see this, and be only one click away from watching your video).   After uploading: Use the [Share] button, to put your video's on FaceBook/Twitter/MySpace/ETC. On your channel, use the [Post Bulletin] to send your video (with a message) to all your friends. Post video response to your own video's. Seach for videos similar to your own, and then post your video's as a response. Multiple views: Thought should be given to your channels appearance (back ground, colour scheme, play list's, profile wording, ect). A nicely designed channel will encourage your visitors to stay and watch more video's.  Also: If you visit random pages and comment. People will see your avatar (one click, and there at your page), and have a link to you. Be careful of spamming. Some people get very upset.    Hope this helps", 9721, "None", 0],

	100019 : ["No they cannot track your exact address, but they could obtain vital information by starting with your IP address. The more details a hacker/cracker or malicious person has, the easier it is for them to probe to exploit a vulnerability leading to an exposure which results in a compromise of a system. Preventive measures can be implemented such as spoofing your address. This is the easiest way to deter someone from knowing your true IP address. It can be known to the outside world if you wanted to spoof say a range in Germany, it's not hard to do at all. If you are that paranoid perhaps using a simple proxy would hide your IP address if you don't have a NAT based firewall or router. The gentlemen that tracks people through email will only get information from hops that are dealing with mail servers. The Whois database used to be a nice starting point for folks probing networks not to trace assets but map them. With whois you have the capability of defining NETBIOS names for domain controllers then the real fun could begin. Each minor amount of information is a true hacker/crackers paradise.

If the anime/cartoon/book/movie is something that is a popular franchise, then the game will already have a large amount of potential fans that will buy it. For example the Star Wars series is popular, so bringing it to gaming it means they would have a better chance of making money then if they released an all new product with a setting and characters that the potential buyer might not be familiar with.  Also not all of these things might be popular before turning it into a game adaptation.
