I think that Lady Gaga would have made it as a brilliant singer without all the hair and makeup and wacky outfits,but she wouldent have been who she is today. I love all her songs, but my favourites are probably Telephone,Bad Romance, and Poker Face. I think she is a good singer, and she is pretty under all of the makeup no matter what people say. Here if a few videos of when Lady Gaga wasent famous yet ", 8062, "None", 0],
	59887 : ["It's not, and there is none.  First of all, not all Wiccans believe in Summerland.  Most believe in reincarnation and that's where the general consensus fades out. As to that, Heaven is where all the believers in the \"correct\" religion go.  Hell is where everyone who believes the \"wrong\" things go.  Since Wiccans do not believe that our deities demand the worship of people, nor do we believe ours is the only right way, Heaven and Hell don't make sense to us.  Most Christians view time as a line.  Wicca is an earth based religion, and in nature, all things are cyclical.  When the sun dies each day, and the moon each month, they don't just disappear.  They have to come back, just like the seasons, the crops, etc.   Summerland is a place of rest before one reincarnates.  It's not a permanent destination.", 8061, "KXQVRQdjaa", 3],
	59888 : ["Only Wiccans who have a vague, nebulous idea of the Summerland would consider it like heaven. That being said, the Summerland, unlike Wicca, is Celtic. Our original theology had no such concept, until some Wiccans in the 1970s added it. Some of us still do not add it.", 8061, "yAvTxh47aa", 5],
	59889 : ["Well, Wiccans don't believe in an 'absolute evil' so i don't believe we have hell (as far as ive read) Summerland is just a place to rest until we are ready for another life.", 8061, "6jITKUceaa", 2],
	59890 : ["I had my lip pierced and that didn't hurt at all to have done. I didn't even feel the needle go in. However the next day when it began to heal, hurt so badly because it was a new piercing. All new piercings are going to hurt. I am planning to get my nose pierced, because to be honest, nose piercings are known to be easier to take care of. Lip piercings are harder to care for as they're in your mouth where you drink and eat (obviously) and a nose piercing is not near your mouth. So to be perfectly honest, from what one of my close friends told me, their nose stud hurt more than their lip stud did. But all piercings hurt where ever you get them done. Always make sure you go somewhere respectable though and make sure your trust the person piercing you and makes you feel at ease. Hope that helps!", 8063, "vVajazI7aa", 0],
	59891 : ["No piercing is ever really painful. I would say the nose hurts a little bit more.  Still no piercing ever has pain to me, it is more pressure. The chance of scaring all depends on your body, how long you have the piercing and how you care for it. They both require about the same amount of care.  Only the lip you have to do oral rinses. Still the chance of infection all depends on how well you care for it. :] Good luck, always remember to ask your piercer any questions you have.  They are more than happy to answer them for you.", 8063, "zmjAccMFaa", 0],
	59892 : ["1st - I have never attended a Protestant church where the minister said \"can I get an Amen\".   In Presbyterian churches the minister does not look for a response from the congregation.   Besides that point, I don't think asking the people if they agree or not points to brainwashing.  2nd - I have never called Catholics brainwashed.  I was born and raised a Roman Catholic, served as an altar boy and considered being a priest.   Believe me there is no brainwashing.   However I understand, because of the rigid congregational routines (stand, sit, kneel, say this...), why some Protestants may believe this to be the case.    3rd - I do not believe Jesus taught that titles themselves were wrong (titles like father and brethren, are used in the New Testament).  The problem can be the implicit faith that people show to those with title, which can be a cause for concern. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  I do have numerous other concerns regarding the church of Rome.

As for the Eucharist (which I have always believed is the true presence of Christ even as a child as the way I was taught) To me anyone who denies that Jesus is not really present in the Eucharist, is denying Christ Himself.

Have fun, don't become overly invested in this, WHAT? you can't flirt? Move on, the writing is on the wall and it spells trouble.

At many shows you hear the phrase, \"Can I get a round of applause?\" and guess what? The Audience does it. But no one questions if their brainwashed.  Last and most important I think that this question is meant to divide not unite. This is why there is a problem between Protestants and Catholics.

My non denom church does not have a preacher that says a lot of \"Amen's\" but it is just say, \"do you agree with me\" usually after reading from the bible.  In fact my church has many many former RC's who left that church because they read the NT on their own. They all say the same thing, 'I read the bible and realized the RCC was going against God's word.\" IE: Mary worship, Idols, calling priest father etc etc etc †", 8060, "ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa", -4],
