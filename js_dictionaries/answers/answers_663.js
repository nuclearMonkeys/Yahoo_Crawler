Are the dogs old enough to breed?  Dogs should be at least 2 or 3 yrs old before you breed them.  So many things about dog breeding that you haven't a clue about.  Do not breed until you have studied dog breeding for a couple of yrs so you know what you are doing.  Right now you are very ignorant & don't know sh it about dog breeding.", 5526, "18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa", 1],

	36984 : ["You need to have a little patience. He's just a baby. Kittens are hyper, then they get tired and sleep, just like like a 2 year old child. Your idea of trying to get the cat to sleep all night isn't reasonable. Cats are NOCTURNAL. That means they are most active at night. My cat sleeps with me, but he also gets up and runs around the house. Do not give him catnip at night. It will make him crazy. It's like cocaine for cats, so save it for daytime. If you have any catnip filled toys, put them away at night so he doesn't bother you. Adult cats sleep around 12-16 hours a day. They sometimes get crazy, but not like a kitten. You shouldn't lock the cat in the bathroom all night though. Kittens get very bored and lonely at night. I've always let mine sleep with me. If he gets too hyper, just put him out of your room for a while.  You should get him neutered before he's 6 months old, but he's probably too young now. Ask your vet. You just wanna get him neutered before he hits puberty and starts spraying. Your kitten's behavior is very normal. They always like to bite fingers and toes. You'll have to have a little patience when you teach him not to do this. A squirt of water or a loud, firm “NO!” should help. They usually grow out of that when they realize that it's just your finger and not a mouse or toy. Little kittens can be a handful, but they're so incredibly cute. Once he gets a little older, he will calm down a bit. He will also get smarter. Kittens that young need a bit of supervision. Cats are independent, but kittens are just babies. As with humans and any other species, the mother is supposed to keep him safe and teach him to stay out of trouble. Since he doesn't have his mother, YOU have to be his mother. ", 5528, "lyTU7F3haa", 0],
