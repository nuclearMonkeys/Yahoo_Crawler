How does Satan deceives, go back to the Garden in the beginning Satan convinced Eve that you don't have to keep Yahweh's Laws.  Do you keep Yahweh's Laws or did one of Satan's preachers tell you the Laws are done away with?    Rom 6:16  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of SIN which leads to  death, or of obedience unto RIGHTEOUSNESS?  What is sin? 1Jo 3:4 Â¶ Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.  What is righteousness? Deu 6:25  And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these Laws before Yahweh our Father, as he hath commanded us.  Who did you say you belonged too?  Are you sure? Exd 13:9  And it shall be for a sign (mark)unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the Yahweh's Law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Yahweh brought thee out of Egypt.  Exd 31:13  Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it [is] a sign (mark) between me and you throughout your generations; that [ye] may know that I [am] Yahweh that doth sanctify you.  What mark do you have the one above? Or the one below? Rev 14:11  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day (SABBATH) nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

Stand back, relax, take a deep breath and look at this from the distant \"50,000 foot\" view ...  Even between friends there is almost never absolute truth ... or trust ...  Ditto between lovers or mates or married folks or any other association, no matter what the form. The simple truth is that we are all possessed of some fears, neuroses, doubts, angers ... and we all slip from joy and love to doubt and fear or anger now and then, no matter how we might discipline ourselves to remain positive and constructive in our thinking and actions to ourselves and others ...  Your boyfriend has just experienced a \"triple whammy\" trauma to his life  1. his MOM ... a primary FEMALE ... just almost killed him off by her actions ... and so you might just find that trust in ANY female ... is going to be a tad in short supply for a while ...  2. his SELF ESTEEM and LIFE CONFIDENCE (confidence in his ability to control his own destiny ... just took a huge hit ... I mean, laying their not knowing if he is dying or not ... zoned out on morphine certainly does not do a guys sense of being \"master of his fate\" exactly much good ... and folks who are not feeling in control are almost always feeling either anger or alienation ... or both ... ergo .. dont expect a trauma alienated man to cotton up to deep emotional sharing in the next 30 seconds ... 3. He has just spent a day or several days in pain and with odd drugs flushing his system and normal thought capacities out to zero ... and so dont expect that he really wants to start his days of fresher awareness and pain with the kind of obligations emotional or otherwise that a \"relationship\" entails. All in all, it would be odd as hell if someone fresh from a totally unexpected trauma was not trying to avoid the whole world for a little while .... Add to that that a single look in the mirror will give his \"am I lovable looking\" evaluation a shock ... he probably looks like a nasty specimen indeed still ... and folks who have ANY vanity or pride are not fond of having everyone gawking at how much their look like some vampire from \"night of the living dead\" and often even reject visitors totally .... In other words ... back of emotionally ... if there was committment, or even honest friendship, then stand by him, give him time to come back, and see what happens. Be a friend first in any case, and dont worry about the \"status\" of the relationship ... just be a friend ...  If it was meant to be, it will be, if not, good friendship is valuable and should not be easily discarded ... be understanding and patient. Odds? 70/30 ... in your favor for the relationship to restore with time (few months) ... if you are positive and patient ... a sure thing ... nope ...
