I would approach him and ask waht the issue is, but until then you can only assume that he does not eat these for this type of reason.  I think it is rude for him to react this way so you will definately want to check with him and see if that is the issue or not. \"Ever since the Dannoura battle, fishermen from the Straits of Shimonoseki have been finding the crabs with samurai face on their backs. Believing these crabs -- Heikegani -- are reincarnations of the spirits of the Heike warriors defeated at the Battle of Dannoura, Japanese fishermen kept throwing them back into the sea from their nets.\"", 9032, "None", 11],

That wrong my have evolved before refrigeration was available and so may no longer be applicable. Even so, there will be some who follow the tradition just because it worked for prior generations. For people who believed in the necessity for racial purity some people it was wrong to have integrated schools, shared restaurants and bathrooms. For people who believed in male superiority, it used to be wrong for women to expect equal pay. For populations that were dying because of disease or loss of life in war and natural disaster, one can imagine that homosexuality was discouraged because it diverted sexual energy from reproduction. I suspect that if you check the 10 Commandments you will find that each was described to discourage actions that tended to have bad results for those societies at that time and probably still does. In many cases, just as you have described and to the developed world of the 21st century, these bad results appear quite logical. In Biblical times, only a few understood the logic or had the wisdom. Moses was very wise indeed and knew that the long suffering Tribes would never have believed he could personally have such wisdom but if he described these as the words of God, well . . . . . .", 9032, "sIiKsKEeaa", 0],
