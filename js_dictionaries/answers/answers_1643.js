If our goal is to achieve our ultimate joy and peace, then our Creator is logically the answer.  We then seek God unless we either lose our desire for joy and peace (not likely) or we find proof that we cannot find God (which won't happen). If our goal is to live for little bits of happiness each day and we find that we are happy in being independent of any authority over us, then we won't seek God. We're all logically heading for where we want to go. If the atheist wants to live his or her life independent of God, then being an atheist is the logical thing to do.", 9269, "2MfMyh4Maa", 0],

The argument opposed to mine is something like the following: People that believe in god, affects how you live. How? because they're the ones who voted Bush, they are the ones opposing to stem cell research, they're the ones that hate gay people, and I can continue all day long. Yes, Christians affect our day to day life and if we have to do something about it is make them see how empty of reason and sense their beliefs are. They have to stop getting away with this faith thing that lets them say and do whatever they want.

His abiding presence is near us all, UNTIL your atheists school teachers brainwashed you into believing that this human body or any life could have just accidentally happened. Only a fool could believe that.  So no.  We are born with a presence of God, and evil folks drive that away. Before homes and schools took up TV and its evils, and taught children of sex, murders, and all kinds of evils, children were basically good.  The did what they heard and saw, which was growing food, doing good, loving.  Then along came someone who hated God and goodness,   said, get God out of schools...along came children MURDERERS. they are now doing what they see and hear all their lives = drugs, murdering, sex, denying god,  you are reaping the rewards of taking away the knowledge of God and goodness from the children of our land.

Science has shown atheists have a higher intelligence than people with a strong religious faith. The difference is 5.8 points according to findings in developmental psychology!!!     More members of the \"intellectual elite\" considered themselves atheists than the national average. Only 7 percent of members of the American National Academy of Sciences believed in God.

	87858 : ["Dear Xenomorph - Girl:  You have asked very legitimate questions about your Relationship with your Creator/Father.  Christianity has little to do with making answers to those questions  - clear.   This is really about  HOW  your Relationship with the Creator/Father WORKS! There was a Separation.  It was not in the Garden of Eden.  It occurred in Eternity - at home with the Creator.  It happened inside the spirit-minds that God created in His own Likeness.  He is Spirit-Mind. Physical life is the Separation. Earth is sanctioned by the Father as a school for learning.  That is what you are desiring to do right now.  To learn something about Him.  Our Return to Him was appointed by Him already.  You don't have to worry about that. You are safe here because you are an Eternal being - as He is.  Physical \"death\" is just being \"out of sight.\"  He created the Holy Spirit to be your Comforter and Guide while on earth.  He brought forth Jesus to be your Teacher and to reflect Himself - to you - that you may remember Him.  We no longer feel we KNOW our Father. YOUR FATHER'S NATURE:  He has no judgement in His spirit-mind.  Judgement is of the human ego-mind.  There is no Hell.  Hell is not a location nor a destination.  It is simply a Hellish MIND!   Your Creator is always focused upon the spirit within you that is like Himself. Your Free Will is an Absolute.  That is why we get to have the physical experience.  We wanted it!  The Kingdom is in Eternity, not on earth.  Remember Jesus said, I am in this World - but not of it!  Neither are you or me.   Hell is a human concept.  There is no punishment for His Children no matter what they do on Earth.  Man punishes each other.  God does not harm His Children.  You are a part of Him.  You are not God, but you are OF Him.  Traditional religions speak of Hell a good deal.  They speak of punishment.  They speak of an angry God, a jealous God, etc. When you are outside of right thinking and choosing harm for your Self or anyone else, the Holy Spirit will present a \"life lesson\"  to you.  No punishment intended.  Learning - your learning - is what the lesson is for.  As you learn, your behavior becomes \"higher.\"  There will be a return to the Creator - therefore, we need to reach a level of behavior and thinking that makes it possible for us to be fully aware of His light and love.  A mind that thinks lower than the Father; that does not feel love equal to His; that does not understand it's relationship with Him - is a Mind that is not equal in its Nature to Him - and can not withstand His Presence.  Lessons depend upon the personality that needs the lesson.  If one does not learn easily.  If one is stubborn about his/her patterns of harmful behavior, the lesson follows in that same exact strength.  If you learn easily - the lesson is more gentle.  If it is difficult to make you see and understand - the lesson has more POW to it!  It depends on us, individually, as learners.  Free Will is never a problem to Jesus or the Holy Spirit (The Creator does not keep His \"eye\" upon your human behaviors.  He Created the Holy Spirit and Jesus to do that!).  What matters to them, is how many hurts are you dishing out to your brothers?  Lessons are to bring you upward onto a higher level or mode of behavior.  There is no punishment.  It can feel like punishment if you are bent on continuing to hurt your Self and others.  The lessons become stronger.  But Free Will is sanctioned as long as you are learning.  You can't do anything else on earth!  But learn.   Do not allow others to threaten you with a Hell that is outside of your Self.  You may try all kinds of things - but then learn. I hope this is of some help to you.  If non-denominational teachings would be more free from the concepts of hell-fire and damnation or the Creator killing you (even through wars!), I would suggest the possibility of the book shown below.
