It is never our intention to make others feel lonely or left out when we joke with each other and exchange comments, but as you must know lots of us already have contact with each other away from YA. We either saw each other in real life, exchange phone calls, or at least messages and IM.  I remember when I first joined YA about a year ago I posted a few questions in other sections about my daughter then disappeared for a while. Later I discovered this section and posted a few questions ... one was about a topic that bothered me very much, and I just got 2 answers from regular members here ... after which I felt very lonely and more upset! I deleted the question and regreted ever posting it. However, later one of the 2 people who answered that question became one of my dearest friends here ... ilsit ruby omm za3bolla! I later talked to her about her answer and we laughed about it!  What I'm trying to say is, just give it time. Like real life, here too you need to know people better and to take your time in letting your relationships develop and grow. For starters, why don't you let us know who you really are so we could welcome you properly? You said you were not really a guy ... I'll take your word for it and send you tons of virtual hugs and kisses! XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOX Feeling a bit better? I really would like to know you better, so feel free to send me a message any time. Edit:  Hey relator, I just posted my answer and was really surprised to see yours above me. I'm so sorry you feel that way. You really don't know how much you are valued? Wow ... well, all I can say is that I personally value your presence here, you \"would have been relative\"! ;) Cheer up please doc ... your smile puts a smile on the lips of yourt patients, and you know how important that is in healing.", 10593, "lySon0Wgaa", 0],

	119864 : ["I am the same way. There are several at home treatments you can try. I find relaxation techniques such as yoga, breathing exercises stretching can work. Finding a happy place, a fun memory or favorite activity you can think about. For some people music will work, playing a favorite song can alter you mindset.

However, as a young man Henry was schooled in war and took particular pleasure from the legends of King Arthur. Henry's father was an excellent military thinker and incredibly manipulative, so Henry was socialised into women, war and ego. Women served more purpose's than just reproduction. Anne Boleyn, for example changed the face of Britain and helped bring about the revolutionary break with Rome and Papal authority. Catherine of Aragon was a politically sensitive allegiance with Spain through her parents Ferdinand and Isabella. However, the wives which were beheaded were not always popular - they played dangerous games with the affections of those at court, they often held radical religious belief which could divide the nation, and they also committed adultery or at the least indulged in flirtation, their families were manipulative and the wives egocentric. The real perpetrators of the cruellest acts were often the family of the wife. All of the wom", 10594, "5418463416e8caa309a081dd29995b76aa", 0],
	119880 : ["I told my brother that the hardest thing I ever did in a voting booth was voting against McCain. I'm very happy for America now that we truly have the first global leader as you can see by the reaction around the world, from Paris to Nairobi, but it breaks my heart to see a war hero and genuine nice guy like McCain to lose. Don't get me wrong, he knew going into this that if he started with the politics as usual, name calling and spewing out exaggerated accusations that it ran the risk of tarnishing his reputation, but still he fought the fight the only way he knew how. I want to say one last thing that everyone, especially us Obama supporters need to remember: Obama's victory isn't the cause of change; it is the effect of it. His election is the result of change that is more than two hundred years in the making. The founding fathers, who owned slaves, at least realized that people in the future might decide to change their conditions, and allowed the opportunity to do that by amending the constitution. Abraham Lincoln took the first step for Obama by signing the Emancipation Proclamation. All the people who fought in the civil rights act are responsible too. But most importantly, this change means nothing without brave men and women who wear our nation's uniform and fight to protect it. People like Obama only have the opportunity to be President because of the sacrifices of people like John McCain. Obama got to where he is on the backs of people like the man he defeated to get there, and I hope that Obama supporters realize and acknowledge this, because to forget this fact would be a terrible shame.

Of course it wasn't chivalrous, but you can't possibly attribute 21st century morals to the 16th century.
