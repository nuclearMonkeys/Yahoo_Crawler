	101710 : ["\"If a smoker came into a room and another non- smoker breathed it in.\" lol Why do smoke cigarettes if you don't think they're tasty?  Thats just stupid, destroying your body for something that you don't even enjoy. If you want tobacco products that taste good I'll give you a few examples that you should try. First, try shisha.  Shisha is flavored molasses cured tobacco smoked through a bong-like device called a hookah.  The health risks are minimal compared to cigarettes and it really does taste delicious.  Strawberry is my favorite flavor.  Visit your local hookah bar to try some, and you may like it so much that you buy your own hookah and shisha. Have you ever tasted a premium cigar?  They taste smell, and feel so much better.  It might cost more than 6 dollars per cigar but it is worth it because you can smoke it for about an hour.  I would smoke more than one a week and the health risks will be very low compared to cigarettes.  Kahlua makes a cigar that is absolutely delicious.  You puff, let the smoke sit in your mouth and then after you blow it out the flavors will sit on your tongue.  I really recommend that you go to a real cigar shop and try different premium cigars from double claro wrappers to oscuro there will be something you can enjoy. Natural American Spirits, if you're hell bent on cigs give this brand a try.  go for the ultra mellow lights in the yellow box, they are low on tar and nicotine levels.  and no chemicals to make them light!  they use a porous paper and dense filter to mellow out the flavor and reduce tar and nicotine yield.  better for you than the average cigarette, and they are the only cigarette I can bear to smoke.  I don't smoke cigs because they flavor is repulsive. Snus, a great alternative to dip and chewing tobacco.  Camel Snus is powdered tobacco in a small pouch made from the same materials as tea bags.  Place the pouch between the upper lip and gum for a nicotine rush.  No spitting required.  Low key for use in environments where smoking is not appropriate.  three flavors, original, frost, and spice.  I am not a fan of smokeless tobacco but I do enjoy snus on occassion.   Why not go for the ultimate smoking pleasure.  A pipe.  Buy yourself a nice pipe and get some quality pipe tobacco.  it is generally flavored and comes in vanilla, cherry, perique, and many others.  I'd have to say that pipe tobacco is the best.  You really should give it a try. That being said, don't smoke once a day.  If you continue smoking once a day you are bound to become addicted.  I only smoke two to four times per month, and I vary between pipes, cigars, and shisha-hookah smoke.  I use snus very rarely.  Cigarettes are terrible and I honestly don't recommend smoking them.  The health risks of cigars are lower because you don't inhale so it basically eliminates the risk of lung cancer.  You inhale shisha but the water purifies the smoke so its really not that dangerous.  As long as you smoke minimally, it will not be that bad.", 9787, "None", 12],
