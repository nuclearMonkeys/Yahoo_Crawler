How can the universe exist with the physical laws that it has? i.e. cause and effect, the laws of entropy. etc. It does also solve the problem of complexity. but its harder to explain.  Firstly the argument about complexity is usually used in biology and it needs to be taken in that context. also you need to understand that complexity itself doesn't need a designer, If I have some wires lying on the table its pretty simple but if they get all tangled up it gets very complex. You don't need a designer for that  . . We also know from Chaos theory that simple things can create complexity.  The argument of complexity only makes sense when there is also utility.  your eye or for that mater every cell in your body is complex and highly but it needs that complexity fro its utility. If it wasn't that complex it wouldn't be able to do the job as well. Just like a computer program or any other machine. The parts of the fractal are not needed in any utility and therefore once its set up it doesn't need any designer to make each part. they can just be repeated. my wires don't need a designer to be turned in to a mess because they have no utility.  So what kind of thing is needed to cause something with complexity that is needed for utility? The answer can be measured with entropy. the cause needs a lower entropy. It doesnt need to be more complex.  So when someone says that 'life is so coplex and therfore needs a cause' you need to take it in to the context that he is using that is complexity needed for utility.", 9270, "V0CJzkHXaa", 0],

What i mean is that when a religion starts it not really a religion. its more like a movement. and its  at that point where people are inspired to do good. and be better people. then it gets institutionalized and that's when it becomes a religion and at that point it doesn't really grow in that department. but the religion does keep the morality.  in fact I live in china and the government are supporting religion in certain ways because they recognize that it is needed for peoples morels. China is not like the US. There are different fractions of the government and they many of them of power in there own jurisdiction. So one side may go in one direction and the other will go the other way. Anyway I think that morality needs Inspiration it could be religion or it could be something else.", 9271, "V0CJzkHXaa", 1],
	87620 : ["Whilst many Americans claim that America is a shining Christian, moral nation blessed by God they could not be more wrong.  The higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy and abortion! The US is the world's only prosperous democracy where murder rates are still high! Rates for gonorrhoea in adolescents in the US are 300 times higher than in less devout democratic countries. America also has uniquely high adolescent and adult syphilis rates, and adolescent abortions! Research shows that the reason humans struggle with emotion to find equitable solutions is pinpointed the region of the brain called the insular cortex, or insula, which is also the seat of emotional reactions. The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity.  The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn. It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!! But Christians found a way round it! Government statistics show that christians are vastly over represented in prisons for sexual, violent and fraudulent crime whilst year on year government figures show  atheists make up only 2% of the prison population! The Catholic church is paying millions in compensation for the sex/pedophile crimes of their priests alone! Christians are vastly over represented in the divorce courts! Christians invented the concept of sin and then the idea that you could sin, ask forgiveness, get pardoned and start with a clean sheet!

This information has been handed down for generations and with the threat of Hell being there it has stuck and become just the way it is for some people. Maybe the universe didn't need to be created either maybe it just happened too. It only says in the Bible that God created the heavens and the earth, maybe it means what it says. He created only the Heavens and maybe it means literally the Heavens as there may be one for each life supporting planet in whatever Galaxy and he was bored so he made the earth and humans and animals and plants on earth and all that jazz.

Faith in creation of all things by God is something that we cannot put into words, it spiritually felt.
