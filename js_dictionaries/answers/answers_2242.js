	117892 : ["use 5W-30. here is the story on the Labeling on the oil bottles... Most engine oils available today carries a donut symbol on the front of the bottle. Across the top is printed \"API SERVICE SJ\", API stands for the American Petroleum Institute. This is an independent oil testing agency that licenses oil manufacturers to use the API Quality Mark on their oil containers, if the oil passes the minimum performance standards set by the APIâ€¦sort of like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for engine oils. As oils have improved over the years, the performance standards they must meet get tougher and a new letter designation is used. The current standard is API SJ. Previous categories, now obsolete are: SH, SG, SF, SE, SD, SC, SB, & SA.  I'll not bother you with the designations for diesel oil. Inside the \"hole\" of the API donut the viscosity of the oil is designated. The \"SAE\" stands for Society of Automotive Engineers, who set the standard for viscosity tests. The numbers below \"SAE\" are the viscosity ratings of the oil. Viscosity is a measure of the oil's thickness and ability to flow at certain temperatures. Most oils used and recommended today are multi-viscosity. Here's why: In cold weather oil will get thick and stiff. Starting an engine with thick oil is difficult, even if you have electric start. A 10W-40 designation, for example, means that the oil acts like a 10 weight oil when it's cold (thus the W for winter) and like a 40 weight oil at operating temperatures. If you started off with a straight 10 weight oil, by the time your engine had warmed up to operating temperatures, your oil would be getting very thin and not lubricating very well. Quick-Lube (and dealer) Problems to Watch Out For 1. SAE30 oil. Some quick-lube places have been known to offer advertised specials that use SAE 30 oil, as opposed to 5W30 or 10W30. Pay the extra for the proper oil, or better yet avoid merchants that try to pull this kind of thing because it's an indicator that they are less than honest. 2. Trying to use the wrong oil because it's what they have in bulk. Insist on the oil that is specified on your filler cap and in your manual. 3. Pumping the oil out through the dipstick hole instead of removing the drain plug. I came across this gem when I asked if I needed to bring my own copper drain plug gasket. They said that they didn't remove the drain plug to drain the old oil. This was the Oil Changer location at Kifer & Wolfe in Sunnyvale, California. Pumping the oil out through the dipstick hole is a terrible way to get the old oil out because it leaves a lot of junk in the bottom of the oil pan. This was a long time ago and maybe they've changed their ways since then. 4. Selling unneeded and overpriced services such as engine flushes. 5. Selling overpriced, and often low quality, parts such as wiper blades and washer fluid, PCV valves, thermostats, etc. Never let a quick-lube place do any mechanical work on your vehicle.. They do no use journeyman mechanics. 6. Using poor quality filters. You really want to bring your own filter, from the dealer, with you when you go to a quick-lube place. They may take $1 or $2 off the price if you do this but don't count on it. 7. If you have a vehicle that actually still has Zerk fittings to lubricate then be sure that they actually lubricate these fitting. Most cars no longer require lubrication but some trucks still do. 8. Do not let a quick-lube place change or add any fluids other than oil. No transmission fluid, no brake fluid, no power steering fluid, no antifreeze, no oil additives, no fuel additives. It is just too easy for them to use the wrong fluid and cause permanent damage to your vehicle. For some horror stories about Jiffy Lube see:   .
