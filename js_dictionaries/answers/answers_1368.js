He passed the NDAA, an atrocious piece of legislation that reduces the rights of an american citizen accused of being a terrorist (without trial). This is unconstitutional. He got involved in the Libya conflict and has plans to mess with Syria as well. I would have been okay with him had he closed Guantanamo and got us out of the wars, something that was in his initial platform. His rhetoric now is socialist to some degree, but the republicans support their own versions of socialism as well(such as medicare). I believe the NDAA is way out of bounds but Bush has similar expansions of power. You will find that both parties have \"differences\" in what they say and believe, but end up doing basically the same thing just called something different. I", 8754, "A8puKVt9aa", 0],
	74011 : ["Well, your first mistake was hating McCain and labeling Sarah Palin a witch.  With that kind of attitude (which was very prevalent during the election on both sides), it's hard to remain objective and decide who can actually carry through what they are promising. Anyone looking at the facts could see that Obama was promising much more than was possible and that he would have to drastically increase the national debt to deliver on his promises which meant raising our taxes.  Just the facts-no hate, no name calling.", 8754, "VfzlLx29aa", -1],

	74019 : ["Wow! This is a tough one. It would be a barn burner. And I wouldn't bet on it. In this match Rocky would actually have the height Advantage. (but not the reach advantage however.) The problem for me is does the Rock use this advantage? Maricano was always at a height disadvantage, so used a very low crouch/duck to make himself a smaller and harder to hit target. With actually having the advantage in height does he use it to good effect? Or does it disrupt and throw off his normal and usual pattern? Rocky might adapt after a few rounds, but learning to adapt against someone like Langford could get you killed quickly. But if the Rock uses his advantage here right off and stays in close and on top of Sam he could start doing his usual damage. Both these guys could really bang and both were tough. Rocky had the better heart (?) and maybe chin.  But I feel Sam was the overall better boxer. Makes me lean ever so slightly toward Sam. However, If I would have been alive during Rocky's prime bouts against Archie Moore and Ezzard Charles I would have bet on Archie and Ezzard, because they also were the better boxers (or so it seemed) So with this in mind I don't count the Rock out. I'm really uncertain but I'll pick Rocky in their first bout because Sam does not realize what kind of force he's up against. In a second fight Sam knows what he's up against and uses those boxing skills and reach advantage. He has the better pin-point accuracy + power and footwork to just barely keep the Rock at bay enough to win their 2nd. bout. And the third fight? I guess were right back were we started. I just don't think there is a wrong or right answer in this match up. James - \"I just cannot see a 5'6 180lb. man being capable of doing that\". With all due respect, I realize we are talking about Rocky's very hard head here, but, remember this 'smaller guy (Sam) had extraordinary punching power. Some of his KO's. \"Battling\" Jim Johnson - 6'3...220-260 lbs. \"Big\" Bill Tate (very quick for a large man, powerfull.) 6'6 ...220-240 lbs. George Godfrey - 6'3...220-260 lbs. Edward \"Bearcat\" Wright - 6'1 ...200-230 lbs. James \"Tut\" Jackson - 6'1 1/2 ...185-200 lbs.  \"Klondike\" John Hains - 6'0 ...190-210 lbs. Jack Thompson - ( good speed, strong, sizzling hitter.) - 6'0 ...195-208 lbs. Ed \"Gunboat\" Smith - (very good boxer, very quick and clever) 6'2 ...170-186 lbs. A man Sam's size Ko'ing these much larger and strong men is quite extraordinary. Not to mention others he Ko'd who were clever and quick boxer/punchers.", 8756, "83Js45cLaa", 1],

I am serious, and I will tell you how. 1) Wake up, 2) Organize you accounts checking, savings, 401 etc 3) Liquidate every dollar into metals, gold, silver, oil, Euros, Rimimbis, anything that has intrinsic value which will go up when the dollar goes down That is it. Why is this a revolution? Because you are taking control of their money and a run on the bank is the most powerful thing you could do right now. The politicians, banksters, The Fed, will get hurt and hurt bad they will listen if 10% of the population took a stand like this. And by the way the dollar, and stock and bond valued in dollars, will take an enormous hit in about 3 weeks anyway so you will be protecting yourself and making money. But how many of you including the guy that wrote the question will? Safest thing for you and your family to do, the risk is holding dollars and it accomplishes the most powerful protest possible without breaking any laws, organizing, assembling or talking, just a massive silent protest.

	74022 : ["The two issues have nothing to do with each other, the first was in order to stop the banks and major companies from going bankrupt which if it had happened would have caused the current recession to become a depression on the scale of that of the 1930's. Since when did the banks and major industries have slave labour. The alternative was what Bush did in 2008, the Congress enacted a tax rebate plan. This produced a slight, temporary boost to consumer spending and added billions to the deficit. The economy continued to decline. I think they would like everyone to forget that. Every Republican administration for the last 30 years has tried to stimulate the economy by cutting taxes, and every time, this has produced huge deficits. The AZ case is to do with civil liberties, something the democrats have always in recent history stood up for. In the constitutional system, the federal government has pre-eminent authority to regulate immigration matters,\" the lawsuit says. \"This authority derives from the United States constitution and numerous acts of Congress. The nation's immigration laws reflect a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian interests. The government is seeking an injunction to delay the 29 July implementation of the law until the case is resolved. It ultimately wants the law declared invalid.

If the Republicans go ahead and shut down the government then those who will be impacted are those that recieve money from the government. \"Instead of canceling congressional and czar pay-checks\" - dead wrong again. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a bill back in Feb to prevent congress and the administration being paid in the event of a shutdown. The bill passed the Democrat Senate, but Republican House leaders won't even put it to a vote. Why not?
