Now  I assume you are a minor - So swearing is probably not that great to do around you, and that just shows her lack of vocabulary! - But  LOL -  It does happen in some lessons -  But mainly when you are close to adulthood,  and really working on advanced things - Or difficult things.   But it should not be used in a begginer / intermediate lesson.    Dressage is great, however  you need to be able to ride what you want - I started in hunter jumpers  I LOVE HUNTSEAT!!!   But that is something you should be free to decide!     \"Trainers\"  are like musicians - very few make it big.  Do not be affraid to switch trainers - EVER!  nobody should be trainer dependent!  And do not let her intimidate you out of riding either.  Ifneed be, I assume you do not own a horse yet, soswitch barns!  Even if you do own a horse - you can always switch stables!   Just ride, and follow your heart -   Also what the person right above me said -  bring in your Mom :)  This dame giving you lessons obviously has respect issues with her clients, if she is trying to control what discipline you want to learn most.  So a parent would be very helpful!   To the person at the top of the group ~ A TRUE HORSE TRAINER ~ Can not only train horses, but train students to be trainers someday.   - But like I said they are a dime a dozen.   However  Iwouldnever \"Train\" with someone that couldn't give a lesson -    And though I have 27+ yrs of riding - Guess what - you NEVER stop learning EVER!   But some \"trainers\" fail to realize this - hence why they are a dime a dozen :)", 9872, "None", 1],
	104148 : ["It is your time and money and you get to choose what trainer you want.  I HATE trainers who swear - there is no reason for that. It also sounds like your trainer is more interested in doing what she wants you to do and not what YOU want to do. I would definitely switch, but be aware that there will be hurt feelings from  your old trainer.  Don't buy into her guilt that you're leaving or her claim that the other teacher is poaching.  Those are problems between the 2 trainers to work out. However, I would try to make this break as gently as possible.  First, get some time (perhaps away from the barn or at least when the other trainer isn't there) to talk to the new trainer about what you want to do and that you are interested in training with her.  Make sure she is the right trainer for you.  Don't bad mouth the old trainer, just make sure the new trainer is in line with what you want to learn and how you want to learn it. Once things are set up with the new trainer, talk with the barn manager, if there is one, and let her know that you are planning to switch trainers, but you are afraid that the old trainer will try to pressure you or say something bad about the new trainer.  Assure the barn manager that you are moving to the new trainer because it is a better fit for you.  If possible, avoid bad mouthing the old trainer. Finally, talk to the old trainer and tell her that you appreciate the lessons, but you would like a change and will be starting to take lessons from the new trainer next week.  You don't need to actually take any more lessons with the old trainer - but it might be hard to catch her if she is always running out when she's done teaching. Stay calm.  This is about you and what you want.  Don't give in to threats, guilt or any other pressure.  Think of it this way - if you went to get your hair cut by someone and they did a bad job, would you keep going back to them or would you find someone else.  Training is a business - and one that is built on good customer service, like any other business.  She'll get over it. She may still send you evil looks from time to time.  Again, you and  your new trainer will have to learn  to ignore it.  After awhile, she'll get over it. Hope this works - good luck!", 9872, "ZxScahN4aa", 0],
	104149 : ["First of all you shouldn't take your puppy's water away, that is quite cruel.  I recommend puppy pads you can buy them from most pet stores and supermarkets they have a smell on them to encourage your puppy to go just on them, they are also absorbent to stop the spread of urine.  In the morning they should be thrown away and the floor wiped with hot water and bleach to eliminate the urine smell.  This worked well with our puppy, he is now 6 months old and completely house trained!  Good luck!", 9871, "BD2SNJZvaa", 1],
	104150 : ["I,have a yellow lab, the way we trained was with the cage, it made it easy.it was a fair size cage but when a pup we put a divider in it  ,just give him/her enought room to turn in the cage .when gets bigger give more room. they will make it there bed they will not make a mess were they sleep, all the time.you have to lock it  at first, when he /she make a mess put out side ,and show the pup that it not good to make a mess,lock them in the cage for a bit .put the water in the cage  i would not take it away.i would not uses the paper. lock in the cage until he/her is trained.", 9871, "zLAXmO0Waa", 0],

	104157 : ["So let her get mad. So what.  I don't see why she should.  If she specializes in Dressage and the other specializes in hunter/jumper what's the problem.  Obviously hunter/jumper is not her turf anyway.  Personally myself, I think that dressage riding is good for any discipline and it can only help you in any type of riding.  That being said, if your heart is set on hunter/jumper lessons then go with it.  If you have tried numerous time to talk to her and even once she got mad then I wouldn't even bother with it any more and just switch.  She can avoid the conversation until the cows come home and the fat lady sings and by that time you will be old. LOL", 9872, "Y7AeEuPvaa", 0],
	104158 : ["It's your money, she works for you. Not the other way around, remember that.  You are not paying her to disrespect you, be late to lessons, or to teach you something you do not want to learn.  Have you mother give her a call and tell her that she does not appreciate her language during lessons, her being late, or the fact that she's pushing you into a sport you do not want to be learning.  I don't know your age but I'm assuming you're still a minor. If you were older, it would be best for you to confront her. But if you're under the age of 18 I think you should have your mother confront her (only if it's your mother's money paying for the lessons. If it's your money, then it's your responsibility.). The reason I think your mom should do the talking is because you're likely to be disrespected or not taken seriously if you confront her on your own. Ask for your mom's help.  Or you could just give her a call, say you won't be taking any more lessons from her, and then go sign up for lessons with the other guy. If she's mad, then it's her own fault.", 9872, "FAKjYXoraa", 2],
	104159 : ["Trainers schedule their time for lessons very specifically and usually do not have time to talk, I would call her and ask for a time when she can sit aside a half hour or so to talk with you and your mom, maybe at the end of the day.  Tell her your goals, it is very important to work with a trainer on what YOU want to accomplish, not what they want to see you do.  If the other trainer is more suited to your needs no one should take any offense to it, if they are true professionals they will agree that you should what is best for you and your horse. If there is too much drama at this place, you may want to consider taking lessons from another place, it is hard to ride somewhere for years not really doing what you want to and always worried about drama and your trainer- they are supposed to help you, not stress you out! :) good luck!", 9872, "WGKEqDwSaa", 1],

	104164 : ["Hey there! I saw your question two weeks ago. You need to talk to your mom, and then BOTH of you need to go talk to your trainer. Make an appointment with her to ensure that you'll be able to sit and talk. Then, ask her why she's putting you in dressage shows. It could be that she thinks you have alot of potential in dressage! After you let her talk, tell her that you would like to do hunters.Her job is to train you in what YOU want to do. While her advice and guidance is definitely needed, when it comes down to it, it's your decision where your riding career goes. It could be that it's time to switch trainers. Nothing wrong with that. Once again, this is a decision that you and your parents should make together. They will back you up. Sometimes adults don't take teens seriously. Bringing in your mom will help gain respect.
