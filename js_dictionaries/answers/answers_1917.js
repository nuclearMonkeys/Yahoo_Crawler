I would talk with this wonderful young man about what you have shared here. That's the only source for the answer to your questions. In terms of advice, I suggest you examine why you like to feel small. Why do you NOT finish things you start, not put in the effort required to become a fabulous pianist? What keeps you from investing yourself into something fully? Are you waiting for the right person to come along and admire you enough to make it worth your time? You can be that admirer yourself.  Every morning, look in the mirror and thank yourself for practicing your scales, or running through a few arpeggio exercises. And commit to a practice schedule that will allow you to develop into the musician you dream of being. This young man might have some tips to help you make that commitment. If things work out well for you, bless you both. You've managed a great accomplishment in an age of loose relationships and casual (short-lived) romances.", 9783, "VR9Yjvt8aa", 0],

I know it's hard, but I can promise you that you are because a guy that cute can pick any girl he wants, and he picked you. I definitely would not talk to him about your insecurities.

	101592 : ["I don't suggest that everyone in a bad situation follow my decision but I will share my experience in leaving my family. Each person has to decide what is best for their personal life.   I grew up in an abusive family and a narcissistic father, many kinds of abuse  (physical, sexual, animal cruelty/deaths, spiritual abuse -using religion to control and manipulate). As I got older my mom took the position that her duty was to support my dad regardless of what he said/did. She also seemed to take that position about my brothers abuse towards me and my sister. Eventually this carried on into making demands that I stay with my abusive husband....and so the cycle would continue if I did that.  I was an emotional wreck. After these events, every time I'd try to spend time with my family (specifically the abusive members) I'd feel confused and at times disoriented. It could take days/weeks to recover and regain my sense of who I was/am.  Eventually, with much guilt and grief, I came to the decision if I didn't want the rest of my life to continue as it was, I would need to leave in order to protect my sanity and stop the cycle for my children's sakes. I felt guilty about leaving but was very aware that I could not stay in the family and survive. They never understood why, regardless how many times I explained or confronted, and it took over 10 years to get them to leave me alone. It is still tough even after 20+ years but I know I couldn't go back.  It doesn't necessarily get easier in some aspects of leaving, but I have the wisdom to know the difference - what it was and what it could have been and wasn't.", 9784, "Yoxl7dKJaa", 1],

I recently went into hospital to have 5 tumours removed and was only due to stay in for 3 days. Unfortunately I got a pulmonary embolism so I had to stay for 2 weeks. During that time I saw numerous women come and go after just a day or two. I also saw some coming back in as they had complications and had in fact been discharged too quickly.", 9785, "9A2lfMVHaa", 3],
	101598 : ["The longest hospital stay for me was 16 days when I was a child of 9.  I had a tubercular gland in my neck which was removed.  I think that tests were probably done on the piece they removed and nothing then was done as quickly as now.  They would not have wanted to send me home until they knew that everything was O.K.  I cannot remember feeling ill for any of that time.  I just didn't like having the stitches removed. My mother, on the other hand, had a 7 months stay in hospital after fracturing her femur.  The same one she'd fractured 3 years before but this time is was in many, many pieces. She had a titanium pin going through the bone marrow and titanium 'wire' wrapped all around the femur to hold all the little pieces together.  Everything went wrong which could have gone wrong and all through human error.   1. The nurse who got mum out of bed the day after the op. insisted mum walked the length of the bed, even though the surgeon (who was mum's surgeon the previous time) said she would not be out of bed, on this occasion, for a few days.  The nurse would not go and check mum's notes because she was adamant that mum had got it wrong  If you're over 80 you are always considered to be the one who has misunderstood.  The mistake cost mum a lot but it wasn't the only mistake. To keep this story much shorter than it could be I'll just tell the last of the staff's MANY errors. 2. Mum reached a point where she refused to co-operate with the physios.  All they had her do was walk and it hurt her -  a lot.  They never did exercises with her lying on the bed even though she asked if they could be done that way.  Obviously weight bearing was causing her a lot of pain.  I live a long way from where mum was so my queries had to be by phone but my brother spoke to staff face to face. We were both told that mum was unco-operative, was not feeling pain but was imagining it because her mind was going and that some of the stupid things she was saying would be caused by the medication she was taking.  Story cut much shorter - - - after we demanded that her very painful knee be Xrayed it was proven that mum WAS INDEED in tremendous pain because the titanium pin through her bone marrow had slipped and was jabbing he in the knee joint. This had been ignored for such a long time that she now had septicaemia and her life was in danger. She was given a very powerful and EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE antibiotic twice a day (£500 per shot) for 21 days  (cost £21,000) and this saved her life.  She was then able to start trying to walk again but her total stay (which had originally been predicted to be approximately 3 weeks) was almost 7 months. Between us we could write a book about that hospital stay and it would have to be on the shelf with HORROR STORIES I feel.", 9785, "ZT05YtEnaa", 3],

Why drop LSU so far if you planned on bringing them back up so far and not look at the Tech loss to LSU a week ago and pay it much attention this week. People bring that game up everytime this argument arise about \"LSU beat Virginia Tech 48-7\". THAT WAS WEEK 2. These are not the same teams from week 2. Lets see some early season games that would be different. Do you think the outcome of these games would be same: Tennessee/Cal West Va/S. Florida Georgia/S. Carolina Virginia/Wyoming USC/Stanford This is just to name a few. But everyone hold that game against Virginia Tech like it just happened yesterday. But Virginia Tech is one of the teams playing their best football right now that people is not noticing except for the computer polls. They have scored no less than 30 points since the loss to BC. They scored 40+ points on Florida State, Clemson, and Miami and 30+ on Virginia and BC. FSU beat Alabama, who LSU struggled with. I thought the BCS was all about now along with winning conference championships. Virginia Techs only 2 losses came to teams ranked #2 at the time and they beat everybody else on their schedule. Virginia Tech is ranked #1 in the computer polls and LSU #2. But they came up short in the human polls.

I believe the judgmental approach results from a poor understanding of the grace of God which gently reminds us that all is not well within.
