Get a crate leave the door open put treats in it so she has time to know it is her safe place before shutting the door. Give it a few days atleast. read on line or get a good book on training.  Try not to use harshness and never hit a dog for accidents. She apparently had no socialization as a young dog and has had bad experiences so where does she feel safe? You need to find these places outside maybe a back yard away from noise..get on the floor at her level and do not make direct eye contact but hand feed her treats and tell her she is good,  Dogs are self motivated not being is simply mis understood possibly by others who have had her or in your ability to read her needs.. This is understandable when she is having such issues. But generally dogs do not have these severe issues without provocation so continue to be patient.

Don't expect her to play or socialize, when they are playing with other dogs you can't control if they will pee.

	138831 : ["Well, the main thing to remember about \"debt consolidation\" is that you can't borrow your way out of debt.   Consolidating your debts will not reduce the amount you owe, although sometimes - SOMETIMES ... and you need to be careful - it is possible to reduce the INTEREST RATE you are paying through debt consolidation.  It will not reduce the principal  amount that you still owe, though. So the question here is: what is it that is killing your budget:  the interest rate you are paying on your debts, or the total amount of debt itself?  If the answer is, \"the total amount of debt itself\" then consolidation won't help you. I would suggest that you make an appointment - in person, face-to-face - with a legitimate (usually non-profit) certified credit counselor to review your situation.  Not knowing how much you earn, it is impossible to tell whether your debt is repayable or not.  But it does sound as though you and your wife are working a lot of hours, some of which may need to be cut back when your child is born.  So the question is: after the baby comes, will you be able to give your child the benefit of actually knowing his or her parents, or will you still (both) need to be working at multiple jobs just to barely keep your heads above water (and pay child care expenses)? You need to actually sit down and do the math to figure this out.  You can't just guess. It sounds to me as though you may be a candidate for bankruptcy, and making an appointment with a bankruptcy attorney (most offer one free or very low cost appointment to review your specific situation) can get you an expert opinion from that perspective. Some debts (notably: domestic support obligations and student loans) cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, so WHAT KIND of debts you have may be a factor in what will turn out to be the best solution too. Good luck, and congratulations on your marriage and forthcoming child.", 11404, "None", 0],
