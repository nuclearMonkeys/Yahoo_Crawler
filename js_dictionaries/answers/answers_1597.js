Blair was referred to as Bush's poodle and they openly called Gordon - Brown Nose. Why? The Americans have never given any credibility to Labour PM's have they, why? - well in the main because PM's like Wilson and Callaghan ran up the ar*es of the Russians! Margaret Thatcher changed all of that and once again we earned the esteem of the President and his countrymen and women. We also were respected by the Iron curtain countries and Gorbachev gave Maggie the name, The Iron Lady. Ah, well, i suppose we could call Blair the Tin Man, Straw, the scarecrow, Darling, the luvvie and Brown - Brown Nose or inept plonker will do. Obama will find he's got a whole different ball game dealing with Cameron and Hague. They don't need his approval and won't ask for it, they're confident men on the world stage.

Obama, was not properly briefed since his staff are pretty clueless about the US oil business.  so I think it is a mistake... Hell Chevron had a spill this weekend?  where is the American out-cry now? It is all about Media being able to sell their add spots for a higher cost to show that they have the viewership to justify their pricing.

The major media is being dominated by blogs to the point that they acknowledge and discuss the talking points on this board. the Internet is truly \"participatory Democracy\" in a high-tech world. Barrack Obama has been on the cutting edge on this \"change\" in the body politic. By using the Internet a candidate can control his message to his followers through e-mails. he can control his fund raising efforts through the same means. He can even fight smears and lies in the blogisphere the same way. From this point on, all elections will be waged and won in this manner.

As far as the mainstream media, I agree with you on having to find the story behind the story and Americans not being motivated enough to delve into the issues.

The latter is usually said in a friendly, or at least non-threatening, non-judgemental tone, and I happily refer to myself as a poof. Poofter, on the other hand, is usually spat or ground out in an insulting, sometimes threatening manner, and I find it unacceptable.  I don't generally make an issue out of it, though: \"discretion is the better part valour\" is my motto at such times.

In terms of fuel economy, miles per gallon is the one you want to focus on. All you get in miles per tank is how large the fuel tank is, which has nothing to do with fuel economy. For example, my fiancee's Jeep (~20 gal) has a fuel tank about half again as large as my Honda (~13 gal). But since my Honda (30-35 mpg) gets about half again as many miles per gallon as her Jeep (20-25 mpg), both vehicles get about the same miles per tank. This difference is magnified by the fact that the Jeep costs much more money to fill up (due to the larger tank) than the Honda to drive the same distance.", 9197, "None", 0],

We can't afford it as we are bust ourselves. Just build a few cheap bombs of our own. That should do the trick.
