Also you will gain weight once you do start eating normally again which you will have to eventually or you'll starve to death. Your body is going into starvation mode since it is not getting enough calories to survive and is going to start storing all food as fat. You need to eat around 1200 calories a day maybe more depending on how active you are. If you want to lose weight eat many small meals through out the day to keep your metabolism high and workout to build muscle, muscle burns more calories than fat even while you are just sitting.

This is why the travel industry is a billion dollar corporation in the States. Thankfully we do travel and bring our economy worldwide, hurting now, but still green. We're not self-obsessed, but many cannot afford to go overseas. It's easy to travel country to country in Europe, it's ground and short ferry rides. I have traveled Europe and lived in Turkey for 1-1/2 years myself. We do have so much here as well - greatest country in the world - USA!", 8076, "4eaf14eb4320d14376ad304ee57a0e63aa", 1],
	60525 : ["I am an American.  A couple of years ago, I went to Italy.  In Rome, my husband and I got lost, and we stopped someone to ask for directions.  I asked \"Excuse me, do you speak English?\", and a nasty comment was made about how Americans don't speak foreign languages.  Nevermind that I speak French and Russian fluently; nevermind that I also have a pretty good command of Spanish; nevermind that I grew up outside the United States, studied in France, and visited over 30 countries in the course of my (still pretty young) life  -- to this person, the fact that I did not speak Italian was conclusive proof that I was a \"typical\" monolingual American, with no clue about life outside the US. Perhaps you shouldn't presume.  Americans indeed travel less internationally than do Europeans -- but that has more to do with geography and the quality of travel that Americans seek than with \"interest about the outside world\".  Much noise is made about \"gap year\" young people who travel widely -- but as far as I am concerned, bar-hopping in 17 different countries does not count as a particularly enlightening cultural experience.  Until very recently, Americans could visit a number of neighboring countries without a passport, and many Americans are dual nationals who travel on other passports. Some Americans are indeed ignorant, but that's true of every society.  I found that people who love to bash Americans for their \"ignorance\", uneuropean lifestyle, etc., are themselves very ignorant and know little of life beyond their own world.", 8076, "Wk2E4fmVaa", 3],
