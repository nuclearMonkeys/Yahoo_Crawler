	100643 : ["I know this sounds like a strange this to do, but you should reinstall the product, then uninstall it again. If you have the original CD or original install file - that would be the best thing to do. The reason for doing this is that you want to be sure that you remove all of the files. Going into Program Files on your hard drive and deleting the folder (as someone else suggested) is simply not going to remove all of the files associated with Norton, since there are Services that run in the background that will not be removed. There are also a number of registry entries that need to be removed. The registry is your computer's internal database and it needs to be kept tidy. So my advice is, reinstall the full product and then go into Add and Remove programs and remove it again. This way you can be sure that you'll remove everything. If you don't have the orignal installation CD or files, then you should go to the Symantec (Norton) support site, where there are some details on how to manually uninstall the product. One example is here: and here: I hope the above answer helps. Please rate my answer if you find it useful.", 9750, "AA10834300", 0],

Uninstall unneeded programs (especially those that run at startup and/or put something in the system tray), run Disk Cleanup, and defragment the drive. This is a good first step that will almost always take a few seconds off boot time and application loads for any computer. 2) Stomp auto-starting programs. Click Start > Run and type \"msconfig\" at the prompt. Click the Startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your PC. Do you really need \"Adobe Reader Speed Launch\"? Probably not. Turn off anything else that looks useless, but be careful not to disable your anti-virus and important system components. 3) Run a full anti-virus and anti-spyware scan. I would recommend using AVG Free Anti-virus, Spybot - Search and Destroy spyware remover and Ad-aware spyware remover. These programs are all free. 4) Clean up the registry. CCleaner, available at   is free and worth running.

They could learn even more about that history if they would read Macabees 1 & 2...but for some reason, those books were discarded from the Prostestant Bible. If they wanted to know the history of the church after Jesus, they could read Acts. The letters Paul wrote to the various churches, as well as the letters of the other Apostles would throw some light as well. After Constantine, they'd need to study World History to see what happened within the church...and there, things would get a bit hazy.  For instance, very few Christians realize when we are being taunted about the Crusades, that the Crusades were actually rescue missions.  The intention was to free people who had been conquered...and it was not Christians who burned the great library at Alexandria. A few more Christians are savvy enough to realize, when being taunted with the Inquisition, that this was pretty much Christians being tortured and martyred by the Roman Catholic Church (sorry, Catholics, but it is true) for not believing as they were told. There are many more such mis-conceptions that are popular among atheists, that more Christians could answer honestly if they knew a bit more about their own history... OH, and, just an added bit of information...the Bible is NOT \"one book\". It is a library of sixty six books...and, if one is curious and adventurous, there are many more \"sacred writings\" to be discovered and read that would confirm what we already know while adding to that knowledge, as well. Many Christians are content to nod in their pews, and let their Sunday School teachers and Pastors tell them what they ought to believe, without doing much reading and studying on their own.  Many atheists are just as lazy, preferring to let their teachers tell them what to believe...
