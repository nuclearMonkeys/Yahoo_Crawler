Speaking first hand as a retired stripper... when the alcohol starts taking over, the music gets turned up, damn, ladies get a lot crazier than guys around a stripper.

As a pro...ya have to be tuned into the energy. If the chanting starts up\" F em F em F em....80 percent chance the girls will help with taking the closes off, position her so all can see the show, and all have a wild good time.

William Charles, #5 and #64: Robert Frederick. Timothy Jackson, #110 and #25: Virgil Carl. 3. 1. Lea Nina: I don't like how they both end with A, but individually I like both names. I'd consider. 2. Helen Corrine: Again, I don't like they end with the same sound. I've never been especially fond of these names. 3. Arline Edith: Arline is nice, but I'd rather use it as a middle name. Same with Edith, though probably not a considerable option. 4. Virginia Martha: I can't get a break with these same-sound endings. I'd possibly conisder both as middle names. 5. Ollie Edna: I had to double check when I saw that Ollie was in the girl column. Interestingly enough, the same ranked boy name was Ira, and I thought I had mentally switched them by accident. I don't like this name, I think \"Ollie Edna\" sounds like a cartoon character. 6. Louis Hugh: I've never really liked either name, but they're okay. 7. Leonard Tommy: I prefer Leonard as a middle name, though I really like Tommy when Thomas is used as a full name. 8. Floyd Raymond: The two Y's bother me. Floyd reminds me of a cartoon on disney channel from when I was younger, so I'm not too fond of this combination 9. Robert Frederick: I like this one, but it sounds common, I feel like there is at least one bad person associated with this name. Maybe if there were two middle names? 10. Virgil Carl: I can't take this one seriously. Carl never seemed very formal to me, and Virgil is the name of my pet mouse. Favorite: Lea Nina. I love Leah and am learning to appreciate Nina. Least favorite: Ollie Edna. MAYBE separately. When used as a middle. Maybe. Mix-match combos: Arline Lea and Robert Leonard sound nice to me. -------- Really fun :) Took a while too!

Seriously, there seem to be some pretty decent names on that 1909 list, but why did I have to end up with the strangest ones? So, to question three... My two favorites are Ardella Katherine and Forrest Percy. I do not like the name Ardella at all, but it seems the most decent and flowing combo out of the ones I got. I do, however, like Forrest Percy (yeah, I'm a Harry Potter nerd :P). It's just kind of cute in a way. There are some other names I got that I like seperately, but not together. For example both Magdalene and Evelyn aren't too bad, but they make the worst combo ever. Margret Zella isn't too awful, either, but I've never been able to warm up to the name Margret (or any version of it.) Zella is interesting, though. Lily, of course, is a pleasant surprise, (Lily Margie is actually kind of cute... kind of.) and I also like Arthur from the boy's list. But then there are the truly awful parts. Bertha Elenora? You can hear the dust on that one! And then, Nat Willie, and Doyle Rollie... I do not like those nickname-y names people had going for guys back then. Russell has always seemed so heavy a name to me, I don't like it at all. And then there's Olan Alan *subsides into giggles\" Great question!", 8425, "RZQHB0g8aa", 1],
