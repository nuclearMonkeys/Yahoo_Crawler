Most were not in the Capitol nor support what those few people who stormed it actually did. The majority of Trump supporters in DC that day were peaceful and did nothing wrong.

Just for a reference, this image above is a 20-pound weight loss transformation… Diet You aren't going to get a weight-loss answer without diet being mentioned; it is very important to maintain a healthy diet. Because you want to lose 20 pounds in one month, you are going to have to be very strict and do the following things Cut sugar (fizzy drinks, snacks, etc.) Cut processed food (processed meat, other unnatural foods) Cut carbs (pasta, rice bread); the only carbs you should eat are sweet potatoes and quinoa. You should also eat a decent amount of low-fat protein. Chicken is good, however, grass-fed bison, whole eggs and white-fleshed fish are the best. You should also increase your healthy fat intake. Healthy fats consist of avocados, salmon, coconut oil, olives (if you want to find out any more, a quick google search will bring up a lot). In conclusion, be very strict with your diet. You can have all the information in the world, but at the end of the day, the only thing that's going to count is how strict you are with your diet.

	14722 : ["1. Begin with a 3- Day Detox Detoxing should always be the first step you take when wanting to lose weight, and especially lose weight fast. A detox cleanses your body and helps you to lose water weight really fast. Why is detox important? A detox is a process of resetting your system by getting rid of all the unwanted toxins that have built up over a period of time. These unwanted toxins build up through the consumption of processed foods and drinks and too many carbohydrates. When we consume too many carbs our bodies start to resist insulin. Of all the foods, carbs raise blood sugar and insulin the most. One of the best ways to reset your insulin sensitivity is to eliminate almost all carbs from your diet for a period of time. When we have a build-up of toxins from processed foods/drinks and too many carbs, important hormones in our bodies fail to work properly in digesting, absorbing, and dispersing nutrients from food. That's why starting with a good detox is one of the most effective ways to lose weight fast. This 3-Day Detox can actually help you lose up to 7 pounds in water weight and fat loss. And, you won't be spending three days sipping foul-tasting juices either! Mini detox plan Day 1 – 24 hours fast (no food, only water, herbal tea, or black coffee) Day 2 – 3 meals high protein low carb meals Day 3 – 4 meals high protein moderate carbs meals Or, if you want to eliminate the guesswork and have the entire detox plan laid out, meal for meal, when to eat, and exact portion size without counting calories, you can access my 3-Day Detox Challenge here. Rule number one – Always start with a detox! 2. Boost weight loss with green tea Green tea extract is a very commonly used natural ingredient when it comes to weight loss. It is used in many weight loss pills and supplements and is very effective. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat numerous health conditions and healing. Both my partner and I drink green tea when often to help boost our metabolism and help with weight management. A 2010 study shows that green tea had a positive effect on weight loss and is one of the best natural weight loss supplements for women. You can get green tea very cheap at pretty much any supermarket. Our favorite green tea supplement is Maximum Slim's Green Tea for Weight Loss. Maximum Slim Green Tea is an extremely potent green tea extract that offers many known health benefits. It is loaded with antioxidants to promote a healthy lifestyle and uses all-natural ingredients to help stimulate fat burning, Increase metabolism, support the immune system, and boost your energy levels. 3. Boost your metabolism by doing this… I'm sure you've heard about boosting your metabolism a lot! – make sure to boost your metabolism to lose weight faster. But do we even know what metabolism is? What is metabolism? Metabolism is the chemical processes that continuously go on inside your body to keep you alive and your organs functioning properly, such as breathing, cell repair, and food digestion. These chemical processes require energy. The minimum amount of energy your body requires to carry out these chemical processes is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR accounts for anything between 40% and 70% of your body's daily energy requirements. This percentage is generally dependent on your age and lifestyle. A slower metabolism is also described as a “low BMR”. To work out your own BMR, you can use one of the many online calculators that can work out your daily energy needs. Here are the 5 Most accurate weight loss calculators on the internet. While on diet, sometimes people tend to restrict themselves way too much. This can actually slow down your metabolism and hinder your weight loss. How to speed up your metabolism to lose weight fast Here are some healthy things to eat and drink to boost your metabolism • Protein-rich foods • Eggs • Coffee and green tea • Legumes and pulses – lentils, peas, chickpeas, beans • Spicy meals • Cacao • Chilli peppers • Ginger • Dark-green, leafy vegetables • Broccoli 4. Eliminate processed food and drink Eliminating processed food and drink from your diet is one of the most effective ways to lose 15 pounds fast. Whenever you take some form of whole food or ingredient and change it in some way, it is classed as processed food. Not all processed foods are bad. For example, tinned tuna, dried fruit, frozen veggies, they're all classed as a processed food too. The processed foods I'm referring to are the ones that have a whole lot of added sugar, salt, preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, MSG, refined flour, trans fats, sucrose, corn syrup, etc. The following foods are a perfect example of processed foods that will do your body and health no favors what so ever: • Packaged microwave dinners • Chocolate • Candy • Most breakfast cereals • Snack bars and packets (fruit rolls, nut bars, cereal bars, flavored corn thins, and rice crackers, etc) • Chips • Fries • Most bread (I recommend whole grain bread that has had the least amount of processing and additives possible) • biscuits, cookies, scones, donuts, cake • Fried food • Most plant-based burger patties or any “vegan/vegetarian' version • Soda • Juice • Alcohol • Sugared sports drinks Eliminate these processed foods from your diet and I guarantee you will start to see the weight dropping off! 5. Eat a high protein, low carb diet A low-carb weight loss diet plan is easily one of the most effective ways to lose weight fast without exercise. Protein is one of the basic components of food and is a very important macronutrient for growth strength and repair. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Protein provides collagen to the tissue of hair, skin, and nails as well as connective tissue. You should try and include protein in every meal regardless of whether you are trying to lose weight or not. How protein can help you lose weight Research indicates that boosting the amount of protein you consume can a significant effect on your appetite, metabolic rate, weight, and body composition. Eating more protein may actually help suppress your appetite for many hours after eating. This leads to a reduced overall food intake which of course results in weight loss. A diet higher in protein may also increase the number of calories you burn. Studies suggest a diet high in protein boosts metabolic rate by 20–35%, compared to a 5–15% increase for digesting carbs or fat. But that doesn't mean just any low-carb diet plan will help you succeed. First of all, a diet involving calorie counting is just setting you up for failure. Yeah, you might lose weight if it's calculated correctly, but it's certainly not something maintainable long term. Do you really want to resort to a lifestyle of counting the calories in every single thing you eat for the rest of your life to be able to lose and maintain your weight? It makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I could also think of hundreds of much better ways to spend my time. You can lose weight easily without counting calories! The 21 Day Weight Loss Diet Plan is a diet based around high protein foods, moderate fat and low carb, and zero-calorie counting. The 21-day diet plan is designed to reset and cleanse your body so you start to crave the foods your body needs.
