There is a type of adoption that you can go with and still be in contact with the adoptive parents of the baby and get updates on how the baby's doing but if your really against this i suppose you should speak to your boyfriends parents about the situation, maybe they could help you tell your parents if you decide to keep the baby or help you through the process of adoption or abortion if you go down that path but you should definitely take a pregnancy test, just in case your not pregnant and your just getting worked up about a situation that isnt really going on.

	105267 : ["If your period is not due for another 2 weeks, you probably have not even ovulated yet (most women ovulate 12-16 days before the start of their periods).  Once you ovulate, if conception takes place, it will be another 6-10 days before the embryo travels to the uterus and implants itself in the lining of the uterus.  Only AFTER implantation happens will the embryo start producing HCG, which is the hormone that causes pregnancy symptoms.  So you really won't feel any symptoms until around the time your period is due if you do conceive.   Bottom line -- it is WAY too soon for you to feel any symptoms, and you probably haven't even ovulated yet.  I suggest doing some research online or reading some books on how to conceive (when ovulation occurs, what to look for, how to time things, etc), as I don't think you understand the process yet.
