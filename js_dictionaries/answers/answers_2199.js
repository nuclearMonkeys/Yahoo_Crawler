There is no way to tell for certain unless it is surgically or DNA sexed.  DNA sexing is a little easier and less stress for your bird. You will need to find a company who can DNA test birds, they will send you a kit so you can take a DNA sample (usually a smear of blood or a feather) and you just send off the test and they give you the results within a couple of days. With the grey cockatiel you can sometimes tell by how bright the cheek spot is- it is usually pale in hens and darker in cocks- hope this helps.", 10439, "VdeV0jUqaa", 0],
