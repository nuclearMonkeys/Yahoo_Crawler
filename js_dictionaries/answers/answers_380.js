	20595 : ["EVERYTHING moved by train before there were cars. And it's STILL the cheapest way to ship and travel so it's high time to eliminate trucks from our roads and go back to trains. Trains are the greenest method of transportation by far.", 3380, "None", 1],
	20596 : ["It was the introduction of cars that caused the demise of passenger traffic on trains. More so in the US then many other nations. So, yes they traveled by train if it was any great distance and they were not relocating. If relocating and they did not have a bunch of stuff to take along, the train was also the transportation of choice. How ever not every city had a rail road connection, but often a rig (horse and buggy) could be rented at a local livery stable. A side note: A lot of cities elected to build paved roads for cars instead of investing in street car systems to reduce the costs of expansion of the city. Maybe if more cities had continued to develop mass transit systems at the turn of the 20th century things would be different today in many ways.", 3380, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 2],
	20597 : ["I understand what the instructor meant by claiming the intersection. Entering the intersection to establish presence because when the light turns red other traffic is supposed to wait till vehicles in the intersection have cleared it. Be advised, in some states this is not legal. A car entering the intersection is supposed to be able to clear it before the light changes. The key to the solution is how opposing cars making left hand turns are supposed to travel. Please check the drivers hand book for your state on this. That said, this in one time when the traffic traveling against you is supposed to pass on the right and not the left. The turn is supposed to be made short of the center of the intersection. So both cars share the right of way. That said- a left hand turn can only be made when safe to do so. They yield to all other traffic in the intersection. Getting hit while making a left hand turn is often seen as being the driver at fault. ", 3381, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 1],

It is defined by the road conditions, vehicles condition and drivers ability. To say how much above is not a true assessment of risk. The safe speed might be below the posted limit. Driving in the day light on a section of four lane high way in the desert is one thing. Driving a WV road in the middle of a ice storm is totally different.

They have a job to do and DO NOT CARE if you pass or fail. My elementary aged grandchildren can keep a mask on. SO CAN YOU if you want to. Book another test. Get some more practise and try again. When taking a drivers exam remember these two rules. Rule 1 DO as instructed by the examiner CORRECTLY. The examiner decides if you pass. Rule 2 If you are having problems with your test refer back to rule 1. Now if this person is a complete jerk take it up with their supervisor. You might get a free test but not an easy pass. Driver examiners and most of the planet are trying to avoid catching the virus. You have had a YEAR to learn how to wear a mask.
