Most children who are retained in kindergarten aren't retained because of their academic knowledge, or lack thereof.  It's more often \"readiness to learn\" issues, such as attention, following rules, inhibiting behavior, etc.  It sounds like those are the types of things he's struggling with and so an extra year of kindergarten - especially a more normal year - will likely help with that.  Boys also tend to develop these skills (called executive function skills) later than girls, so it's more common that boys have such difficulty in kindergarten; if he's on the younger side for his class, then he's more likely to have these kinds of troubles.   The pandemic has caused a lot of disruption in schooling.  I think there are more children than normal who are struggling because they entered school at this time and haven't had a normal year.  But it's also not really fair to pass them along as if there's no problem at all because they will just continue to struggle. ", 6392, "xif22nwoaa", 2],

That being said, in most of the developed world, one needs to be at least 18 to purchase tobacco products, therefore a seventeen year old would be breaking the law if he or she happened to be in possession of tobacco. If any of this nonsense is actually true, then the teacher you saw smoking was doing so after school hours, and her behaviour, while not setting a great example, probably didn't break any rules. Lastly, parents tell their children not to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, use illegal drugs, or have sex all the time, yet many parents themselves do some of those things.

You must have a certain amount of money in savings to qualify, probably something like $40,000 for every year of study, so unless you have $160,000 to your name, it's not going to happen. Lastly, even if you were admitted, your mother would not be eligible to piggyback on your visa. She would need her own.
