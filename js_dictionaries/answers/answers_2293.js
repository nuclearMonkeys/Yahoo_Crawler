Your being scared is normal, but not doing anything about it is so much worse. Go see your doctor, believe me you will be relieved after you do and probably feel silly about being so scared, btw scared is an understatement, petrified is more like it (the 4 or 5 years thing).

Just think, you can carry it in a thermos and no body will ask for a hit.  Cops won't stop you on the street.  Just don't drive a motor vehicle or operate any dangerous equipment.
