Then you sit the baby up and give a small spoonful to him with a baby spoon. This is food, remember - not a drink! He WILL spit it back at you at first, because he is learning the new motion of moving food with his tongue to the back of his throat. But he will get it with practice. Also, 4 months is okay to begin feeding cereal, but it sounds like your baby is getting plenty of milk already! Be sure you are not overfeeding him. Sometimes spitting up is from reflux, but sometimes it is from overfeeding. Ask your doctor about it when you go.  I have four children and started them all on rice cereal between 5-6 months. There's no rush to start solid foods. It's often more for mom's convenience than baby's need! Good luck to you!", 9814, "xRiQUZt5aa", 0],
	102541 : ["4 months is the absolute earliest to even consider starting solids, and unless baby clearly needs more than her milk (is nursing VERY often and is not satisfied, or  is drinking more than 40-50 ounces of formula a day -- and is also physiologically ready for solids [can sit up well with support and eat from a spoon]), I would wait until closer to 6 months, which is the usual recommendation. If you do opt to start now (or whenever you start) you ALWAYS feed it with a spoon, from a bowl.  You do not give solid foods from a bottle at all. (I'm sure you misread the box if you thought it said to put in in the bottle.)  If baby can't eat from a spoon (if he pushes the spoon out with his tongue, or spits the food out) he isn't ready for solids, and you should stop for a couple of weeks. When you start solids, it doesn't matter what you start with.  You can give rice cereal (mixed fairly thick in a bowl --- if it has to be soupy, baby isn't ready) if it's convenient and baby likes it. You could also start with oatmeal or barley, or with jarred food.  If you wait until 6-7 months, you can often start with table foods. Rice cereal is a traditional first food, but there is no medical or nutrtional reason you have to start with it.  It's no easier to digest or less allergenic than peas or peaches. (It became a standard 'first food' back when most babies were fed home-made formula, and so needed the iron in the cereal -- and when most babies were started very young, so the watery cereal could be force-fed to a baby who wasn't really ready for solids. Today, most babies get commercial formula or breastmilk, which contains ample iron.  And a baby old enough to eat, and need solids, can eat foods with more taste and texture.)", 9814, "vue9NOhYaa", 1],

My 2nd son (now age 9 months) I started at a few days short of 5 months, sitting in a high chair in a semi-reclined position, and did it on a spoon.  The safe thing to do is wait until they are old enough to eat the cereal off a spoon.  At first they will make faces, but keep trying.  Mixing it thin, with a little formula instead of water makes the taste more like his/her formula, therefore it will taste more \"normal\" to them.  It sounds like your baby is ready for cereal, based on my mothering, and working at a daycare that had 72 kids in it below the age of 5.

Wear a stop watch and ensure that you keep the rest period honest.         4. Wear a sweater so you can't stare at yourself in the mirror.         5. Wear a head set on that tells others ‘do not disturb.'         6. No girl friends allowed or wimpy guy friends who are going to compromise the intensity of your          7. Train with an intensity that scares the gym shorts off of every person in your path.

Some boys, and men, can still push them back up there, but this is fairly unusual after puberty. It's only a problem if the testicle becomes stuck, as it won't produce viable sperm at body temperature, it needs to be a few degrees cooler.

The problems start when they don't come back down again. This is very rare and testicles are more likely to fail to descend into the scrotum just after birth, not later in life once they have successfully made the journey. During intercourse, or even masturbation, the scrotum tightens as the penis pulls skin away from it. This pushes the testicles upwards, and they can disappear, only to return later. It is normal and there is absolutely nothing to worry about. I would strongly advise against any 'treatment'.
