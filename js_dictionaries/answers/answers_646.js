I do believe Kwahi makes the team better more than any of those 3. Next up is Curry and Lebron for me. It would be a fun Tournament in a best of 5 per player.", 5407, "ipY87wVVaa", 1],

	36112 : ["Corrales: Weight Drained, plus he was a shot fighter from too many wars. Castillo: too young, not yet in his prime, plus floyd lost. Hatton was in his prime but not exactly an elite fight.  The answer is no in my opinion. Floyd never fought anyone in thier prime. 👎.", 5427, "None", -1],
	36113 : ["I'd probably take Bird. Kobe is the better scorer, but Bird leads in rebounds, assists, steals and blocks per game.", 5420, "9YYyXzRBaa", 1],
	36114 : ["Bird... his style is more suited for \"pickup\" basketball and, with all due respects to Kobe, it'll ensure that other people get to touch the ball once in a while...", 5420, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", 2],
	36115 : ["Sadly and bluntly, I think youd just have to take what comes to you as far as hatred goes. We cant control society in that matter. We can prosecute it, but that wont truly stop it. Peoples moods may get less consumed with hate, but it will never go away. I say keep your close, diverse group of friends. Theres strength in numbers. I think youd be safer from racism around a diverse group rather than a group of only Asians. Dont be surprised if you even experience racism on the court. I hope that asians, including yourself, wont allow a few bad apples (in the grand total of a population) ruin what you love to do.", 5434, "X9bW7AJ1aa", 1],

	36122 : ["Elwood blues has half the answer. Also in the case of some, they are clever enough to throw earlier. Fury is quick for a heavyweight but a lot of that is his intelligence and ability to anticipate when to throw. He's quicker off the draw basically. The really good pure boxers, Floyd, fury, Hopkins, a lot of it is being 1 step ahead of the opponent mentally", 5428, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	36125 : ["Everyone said Wlad would crumble in the golden era of heavyweights. Well, we seen what happened when Anthony joshua, Tyson fury, and Wilder hit the heavyweight scene.  His career was over faster than a one night stand and this is not even close to being the best era of heavyweights. However, his brother Vitali was the real deal. He was more powerful, confident, and tougher.", 5429, "vrQdic06aa", 0],

	36130 : ["It's called the WNBA. There's no men in the WNBA for a reason also.  It would be unfair based on the way women are built (not always, but by majority).  Women naturally have a smaller stature and are shorter. This puts women at a disadvantage (usually) against men.  Not to say some women can't play against the best out there, but going with the majority here. Allie Quigley is a hell of a player and can shoot the lights out.  She actually holds the record for the most 3s made in a 3pt contest, across the WNBA and NBA.  What we could use more of, are male athletes advocating for women. You do see this somewhat in the NBA. Steph Curry largely advocates for women's basketball, Kobe did before he passed away. It would be nice to see more of this.  More women coaches, officials, announcers, could happen in the future too, and is already starting to happen. Women are slowly making their way into these professions, we just gotta keep fighting. Becky Hammon was the first woman to serve as head coach in an NBA game this year after Pop got ejected. That happened this year. I think she will be hired as a head coach in San Antonio after Pop retires, I have a feeling.", 5430, "rOsmiYd0aa", 10],
	36131 : ["The NBA  is in serious trouble and as usual the media is asleep but then they are just old fat white men who could not find a real job. Their all star game had the lowest tv rating ever for that game their regular season tv ratings are just awful America has rejected the NBA for what reasons well that is a complicated subject that has been ignored for to long .", 5430, "JkhREoVVaa", 1],

	36136 : ["How short is short?  I'm 6' tall- towering over a majority of the global population but a midget in the NBA world.  You can be a great basketball player, but if you're under 6', then your odds are pretty much zero", 5432, "75YsqYoMaa", 0],
	36137 : ["Despite all of these notions in favor of height, the fact is that short players absolutely have the opportunity to play basketball at the highest levels.

	36141 : ["If he can stay healthy, he'll make an impact. Injuries do take a toll but let's not count him out just yet. With people calling him a has been, he has something to prove. ", 5423, "evKZJHUWaa", -1],
	36142 : ["LAKERS IN 6 .......... ", 5423, "None", 0],
	36143 : ["One major reason is college. After Kobe you had a lot of guys going straight to the NBA. Nowadays they only stay for one year. College is where a lot of guys bulk up. They eat good food and have an S&C coach working with them everyday. While they could do the same in the NBA most guys don't. They have the money and freedom and think they're stars. Plus in the NBA they play so many games and are on the road so much that it's hard for guys to consistently get good workouts in.  It's NOT about steroids. Steroids were popular in major sports in the 1970s. By the 80s they were largely gone because of testing and the fact that they weren't necessary. Better training and nutrition combined with legal supplements could do just as much. On top of that. steroids would make you a worse basketball player by slowing you down and taking away your explosiveness  ", 5424, "None", 0],

	36146 : ["I give Kobe credit for not being afraid of big shots (unlike Lebron) but Robert Horry was a running joke because of the way he just walked on the court and hit a game winner over and over. Others that come to mind- Jordan, Derek Fisher and Reggie Miller. Bird probably hit a few too. ", 5425, "None", 1],
	36147 : ["I wouldn't go that far.  He had a lot of game winning ATTEMPTS, but he missed far more than he made.  And he'd rather shoot than pass to the open guy.  Have a teammate open for a game winning three pointer?  He'd rather go 1 on 3 to take the shot.  It cost the Lakers a lot of games.", 5425, "HSh6tamxaa", 2],
