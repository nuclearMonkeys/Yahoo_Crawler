Unfortunately, this individual didn't think of the dog as family, and he did what was best for his family. The dog is \"just a dog,\" right? Just an animal. However, you have absolutely no business buying or adopting a dog, cat, bird, or rat if you are not committed to taking care of that animal for the rest of its life. That dog did not ask to be brought into their home. If they had such little space and so many children, why would they adopt a dog on top of all that? It's not right. Abandoning your dog when something \"better comes along\" teaches your children a very lasting lesson about loyalty, love, and trust. It teaches them that you only have to be loyal and loving for as long as it suits you. It teaches them that comfort and prosperity are more important than family. Some people should never, ever be allowed to own a dog. I hope this family never gets another animal.", 8175, "u0na0YZDaa", -1],

	62630 : ["you can remove warts by surgery, freezing, laser, acid or with cream but warts can reappear again and again because warts appears when your immune system is weak! so you must build up your immune system because your body can get rid of warts by itself if your immune system will be strong! so  eat more healthy food, more vitamins and more sport activities! (No smoking, no beer/ale, no booze, no drugs, no junk food, no fast food garbage, no sugary sweet soda's. Get on a good, balanced, healthy diet including plenty of boiled or steamed vegetables. Drink P L E N T Y O F W A T E R , fruit juices & fat free milk. Snack on lots of RAW fruit & veggies. Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner. Make sure you eat a good, balanced breakfast daily. You get your energy for the day from your breakfast meal. Get 8 hours sleep each night. Flip your mattress over so it will level out to give you a good night's rest. Slack off too much coffee & tea.) HPV is the virus that causes warts. And HPV virus has many strains. In your case you have HPV virus strain number 2.  People can be infected with HPV and never show any symptoms. Others will develop warts. These warts can stay the same size, grow, or go away on their own. It depends on the infected person's immune system. A healthy immune system means your body may be able to suppress the virus and not show symptoms.  also you should use some herbal treatment! in that case Wartrol is a good (probably the best) product that gets rid of warts comparatively fast and makes you feel more confident knowing that they wont reappear again! it says that it is designed for Genital Warts but 	 it does not matter because warts are warts and wartrol works by stimulating your immune system to fight the HPV virus that causes the warts. of course it is better if you use full course (5 months - if I remember correctly). It worked and still works for me! I do not know if any pharmacies carry Wartrol but I do know that you should purchase it directly from the manufacturer and read more about the product here  good luck!
