After the Kaboom has been rinsed out and the smell has dissipated (NEVER mix chemicals) then use Windex and newspaper to get any streaks off (if there are any. You will probably only need to use the Windex on the outside. To prevent the mess on the inside, buy a little squeegee to keep in the shower and use it after every usage. This will prevent water spots. Good Luck!", 11425, "UnBu0JwFaa", 0],

Cannibal Corpse is a good death metal band to start out with, they are very basic as far as death metal goes.

Check out the Kill or Wretched Spawn albums.Mikael Akerfelt from Opeth also has a great growl.  He sings a lot in Opeth, so I suggest checking him out on Bloodbath's Resurrection Through Carnage album (His sideproject along with members of Katatonia).  Behemoth is a good starting point too. It took me awhile to get used to death metal growls too.  Once you get used to it though, it gets in your blood and there's nothing better.", 11426, "hHSSXJMNaa", 2],

Those kinds of fish are a standard for most shops, so it would not be any trouble to talk to your local pet shop about when they will get their next shipment in, or if that can make sure to order that species for you if they have the choice. in my experiences, albinos don't particularly mesh with other fish of their same species if they are not also albino.

But seriously, if most of them listened to the band Death, they would probably fall in love with the genre.  And yeah, even if its not your cup of tea, you should respect the bands for the music they make. Edit-- My opinion comes from the fact that I'm not picky with music. I think its meant to be explored and enjoyed by many. People need to show respect for an artist who is putting their all into making the music even if they don't like the style. I like brutal death... Its about what people think, what they enjoy, what makes them ponder, what talks to them unlike anything else. Art in general is a thing of one's taste. People like it because it speaks to them.", 11426, "None", 5],
	139377 : ["I like High on Fire and some other \"Death Metal\" bands, but I think the crucial problem is no one is really sure what death metal is.  It seems to encompass everything from Deicide to Impaled Nazarene to Dying Fetus to Dimmu Borgir; and some of the bands tend to flirt with mainstream success (which annoys hardcore metal fans who hate having other people like what they like) and others are nearly as extreme as black metal, and so they alienate people who think it's strange to glorify burning down churches.  In short, it just has a fuzzy place in the context of metal, it's not linked to a particular place, nor does it have strict stylistic conventions, it is rather just everything that isn't mainstream metal, or one of the many many many subgenres, so it catches all the flak with none of the credit, which is pretty unfair.", 11426, "VNoQpNRaaa", 1],
