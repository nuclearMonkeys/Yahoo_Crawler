	93906 : ["I believe that a baby should have the chance to have life regardless of how it was conceived. However,  It is a very complicated issue and unless faced with the circumstance of pregnancy caused by rape ourselves, we will never fully know the emotional pain that occurs to the woman/mother of the baby.  If continuing with the \"unplanned rape pregnancy\" I would suggest continued counseling during the pregnancy and after birth by a Christian counsleor who can help the mother through difficult choices and understanding why and how this happened using a Christ centered approach to the gift of children as a creation of God.   Every one of us has life breathed into us from God and once born we grow up with the choice to choose a relationship with Him.  I believe a mother who receives Christ centerd counseling will be able to love and raise a child that was conceived as a result of  rape, but a woman who receives no help may become bitter and dislike the child  - always seeing the baby as a rapists child instead of a child of God.   It's never the baby's fault, but a mother has a very difficlut decision to make and brutally harsh emotions to overcome.", 9490, "d0bCiescaa", 2],
	93907 : ["There is NO pro-life option for killing a baby conceived in rape.  Any one who considers themselves pro-life, that would allow this is only fooling themselves.  Selfishness and fear cause a lot of sins, even by people that are \"mostly\" pretty good.  I have to disagree with you on the  \"When the mother's life is in danger, it's a no-brainer...\" This is the only situation in which deep prayer and thought are needed.  You could not say that it is a no-brainer to kill your little sister or you nephew because it may save your own life.  The totality of the situation will help the parties decide whether you sacrifice one life to save another or what risks each will undertake to attempt to save the other.  A very difficult situation indeed.  Not one to be dismissed lightly.", 9490, "SPAe1Cwgaa", 1],
	93908 : ["I have similar feelings to you on this issue.  The rapist may get a term of prison (if he can be found), but what's a few years or months in prison, compared to a life sentence - either of guilt at terminating the child's life, or having to have the child and either bring it up or adopt it out? Either way, the victim is just further victimised while the rapist is free to move on and enjoy his life.", 9490, "jqNtWsi2aa", 3],

	93912 : ["Not anyone has answered with The Twelve Chairs which has always been my favorite.  Dom DeLuise is hysterical as the greedy yet camp Russian Priest.  Hilarious! \"A stylish, frantic fable and one of director Mel Brooks's earliest films, THE TWELVE CHAIRS is a madcap mystery set in revolutionary Russia. An aging ex-nobleman of the czarist regime, Count I.M. Vorobyaninov (Ron Moody), has finally adjusted to life under the commissars in Russia. But when both he and the local priest, Father Fyodor (Dom DeLuise), find out that a fortune in the count's family jewels is hidden in a chair's upholstery-the chair being one of a set of 12-they each separately return to Moscow to find the hidden fortune. Along the way, the count enlists the aid of a thief (Frank Langella) in the hilarious treasure hunt. Closer in style to THE PRODUCERS than many of Brooks' other spoofs, THE TWELVE CHAIRS is an overlooked comedy gem. DeLuise gives an uproarious performance in which he employs slapstick and physical humor liberally. There is a human side to this film, too, just as there was with Zero Mostel's character, Max Bialystock, in THE PRODUCERS, in the form of Moody's Vorobyaninov. Based on a Russian novel, THE TWELVE CHAIRS marries neurotic humor and cultural dilemmas in the same vein as classic Woody Allen films in later years. \"", 9495, "mlmSRkhGaa", 0],

	93917 : ["I'm sure this will get quite a collection of \"thumbs-down\", but I have a problem with sentencing an unborn child to death for the crimes of his/her father.  That's what we do when we allow abortion in the case of rape. The child was not responsible for the rape, and yet he/she is the one who will be executed.  That seems monstrously unjust to me.  An abortion does not cease to be murder simply because someone else committed the crime which resulted in the pregnancy.   However, the POLITICAL reality is that any attempt to legally restrict the murder of the unborn may HAVE to make a concession in the case of rape merely to get passed.  Its an ugly compromise, but one that must sometimes be made.", 9490, "kzd2fSzoaa", 0],

When the Palestinians are willing to allow a Jewish State to exist you MIGHT have an argument, until then you point is mute.  By the way, responding to terrorist acts us not terror, it is retaliation. Another question I have to ask is why, with Israel surrounded on all sides by Arab/Muslim countries why do Palestinians as well as Arabs/Muslims insist Israel give up their land to create a Palestinian Sate.

	93940 : ["For one thing, I know that you are going to get a lot of negative responses like mine, so I suggest you read mine thoroughly. Anyway, you are a horrible person to wish him to die or wanting to kill him. No one deserves to die or be killed because of mere jealousy. I understand how you despise him, but that is no reason, NO REASON AT ALL, to want to kill him. I also understand how you outperformed him in many areas, but you are also being very arrogant about it all, and that's only in one paragraph. You can't control who your parents are friends with, nor can they control who you are friends with, therefore you just have to deal with it in a calm way. If you think I am trying to be on your side, you're wrong, I'm just explaining my thoughts and yours. He did do wrong for coveting your abilities, but that is no reason to wish him death. I also hope that every other responder to your question believes you are terribly wrong.  Saying this: \"to the second comment....i'm a low key guy....I actually never competed with him....only he competed with me...I simply showed him through my actions not my words that I was better...trust me this kid is insanely jealous\" only furthermore caused responders to become against you. If you really understood your actions AND words, you would know that actions speak MUCH louder than words. It doesn't matter if he is jealous or not, because I highly doubt that he is going around saying that he hopes for you to die in a car crash. I know how many people despise long answers, but mine and many others are well worth reading. I may add more to this answer as I see you are adding details, so this response is not yet finished. I never break promises, because as you can see, I am still adding to this response. His parents are not the matter of the subject here, so please refrain from injecting them into the \"question\" you are \"asking\". You really need to get over the fact that he is jealous, because even though you know he is, why does it even make a bit of difference to you? It shouldn't. You know why it shouldn't? It shouldn't because even if he is jealous of you as a whole, it will not make one difference to you. As I am to know from the information you provided, you seem like the root of the problem. Also saying: \"also the part that kills me the most is hes so ******* fat and ugly....it's annoying to look at him when he talks in his loud obnoxious voice.\" even added more negative responses to your \"question\"! Unbelieveable, you are. Never in my life have I seen an arrogant person as you are. No matter what he looks like on the outside, and no matter what YOU look like on the outside, one thing's for sure, he's much better on the inside than you are. Furthermore, saying this: \"ASSHOLES I'M NOT INSECURE...AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THIS ISN'T A BIG DEAL...BUT THIS PRICK IS MAKING IT A BIG DEAL....I NEVER THINK ABOUT THIS STUFF...ACCEPT WHEN HE ****** BOTHERS ME---------HIS PARENTS CAME TO MY COOKOUT THE OTHER ****** DAY AND IT PISSES ME OFF THAT i DO ALL i CAN TO AVOID SAYING ANYTHING TO ANYONE ABOUT HIM, RESPECTING HIM IF HE COMES UP IN A CONVERSATION, AND BY NOT TALKIGN OR EVEN SEEING HIM. hE SEEMS TO BE ******** AND WON'T LET ME GO ON TO DO WHAT i WANT TO DO AND LIVE MY LIFE WITH THE FRIENDS THAT i ACTUALLY WANT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH.\" added more tension to the responses, causing them to steer against you. He is not stopping you from living your life, you are stopping yourself from living your life by caring so much about a little bit of jealousy. I not yet finished, even though in my head I am furious at the way you are with your arrogance and vain towards people. Again: \"Okay here we go again...listen...........I'd be over this...but like some sort of nightmare it just won't end and through no fault of my own. Heres an example.....this is a person who in 20 years would go out of his way to tell me he got a raise at a job...even if I had not seen him in that 20 ******* years. This is a kid who will would drive around my house 100 times if he bought a new car just to show me his new car. This is a kid who would brag about how he got a C+ on a test. It's not normal and I he deserves to die.\" by saying this, you STILL bring more negativeness onto yourself.
