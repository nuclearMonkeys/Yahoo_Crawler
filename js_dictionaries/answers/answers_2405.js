The Bible teaching in the book of James that pointedly says faith without works is dead; that faith without works cannot save a man; that Abraham's faith worked along with his works and by his works his faith was perfected; that a man is declared righteous by works and not by faith alone; that the demons have faith and yet shudder in fear; is this teaching from men or from God?  If you say it is from men, why are we being false witnesses of God?  If this teaching is from God, why do you question it?

	126072 : ["I like the guy already. Sounds like he's got a great sense of humor to create a gag designed to play out long after he's gone. I see it as his way of cheating death, and gaining a sort of immortality by keeping his memory alive – even if it's just to mess with the conspiracy buffs. It's no different then the hoaxers who admitted to creating the majority of the crop circles to mess with gullible believers. Plus, isn't the prime directive of an army information officer to give out misinformation when necessary? \"The influence of each human being on others in this life is a kind of immortality.\" — John Quincy Adams (6th U.S. president,1767-1848)  \"If you're not to be forgotten, when you're dead and rotten; write something worth reading, or do something worth the writing.\" — Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) As regards your question about how ET's mesh with people's religious views, I recommend reading Carl Sagan's book “Contact”. The movie was also good. It touches on how humanity's faith in god will likely be tested should life on another planet be discovered. After all, the Christian religion has taught us for two millennium that we are unique in all the universe. We are special creatures, placed at the top of the food chain by the Almighty himself. ET's would throw a wrench into the make-believe world of religious myth. Although, I'm confident it wouldn't take the bible worshipers long to invent an explanation to explain it away – something along the lines of “God works in mysterious ways”. Humble man is an arrogant creature, believing he alone was created in the image of God to rule over all of earth's creatures, and that he alone can outsmart death and his own mortality.  Likewise, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, the Church insisted the Sun revolved around the Earth, because man had to be at the center of the universe – burning at the stake anyone brave enough to dissent.  “It is setting a high value upon our opinions, to roast men alive on account of them.” (Michel Eyquem de Montaigne);   \"Man is a marvelous curiosity...he thinks he is the Creator's pet...he even believes the Creator loves him; has passion for him; sits up nights to admire him; yes and watch over him and keep him out of trouble. He prays to him and thinks he listens. Isn't it a quaint idea.\" – Mark Twain \"The idea of an incarnation of God is absurd: why should the human race think itself so superior to bees, ants, and elephants as to be put in this unique relation to its maker? Christians are like a council of frogs in a marsh or a synod of worms on a dung-hill croaking and squeaking 'for our sakes was the world created.'” — Julian The Apostate \"I once heard the survivors of a colony of ants that had been partially obliterated by a cow's foot seriously debating the intention of the gods towards their civilization.\" — Don Marquis Mankind's faith in God, I think, would be shattered if ET's were discovered. For a believer you have two options: either God did not create the entire universe - which calls into question the whole creation story and whether God really is Omnipotent, or God did create the entire universe, but man is not as special, unique and ‘chosen' as his ego has led him to believe. If we're just one of dozens of species “God” created, it also calls into question whether or not each of us really does have a ‘personal' relationship with such a being, and whether there really is an afterlife. Will heaven include space aliens or does God segregate? Otherwise, heaven might resemble the intergalactic bar from Star Wars. Or are there separate heavens for each of God's species? This infers separate hells as well. Isn't one hell enough? Are these other species on the same spiritual level as say dogs and cats and thus don't get 'chosen' to sit on Jesus' lap for eternity? What if God's two offspring – Man & ET intermarry? Which heaven/hell do their offspring go to? Since we are told God gives us all free will, is it their choice? Do these aliens already have their own god myths and creation stories? Are their god myths any sillier than any of the 3,000 creation stories humans invented? Can our god beat up their god? ET's creates a problem because alien species likely have never heard of Jesus or heaven and hell – foundational belief for Christians. So why would God create creatures that have no knowledge of Him? We should also question God's biblical instruction manual – if it left out such a key development such as We are Not Alone! Was God too busy dictating the bible that he never tuned into the X-files? Or was he just too offended by Scully's skepticism? Maybe behind God's desk is a missing bible chapter discussing UFO's, as well as the missing \"Book of Dino\" explaining how dinosaurs co-existed with man.  For the sake of intergalactic goodwill, somebody better warn our new friends about missionaries coming to ‘save' them from their life of sin. Yippee more unsuspecting heathen souls to save! \"They came with a Bible and their religion, stole our land, crushed our spirit, and now tell us we should be thankful to the Lord for being saved.\" — Chief Pontiac God, save me from your followers.", 10873, "b33e732ba4617b1ef438b4f57cac8028aa", 0],
	126073 : ["I would say it's down to academic/ Wanna-be academic snobbery. UK University's will get £8bn from Tax payers next tax year! (  The more students a University's gets the more funding they receive. So its in the University interest to sell the idea that higher education will provide students with a superior future lifestyles.  True or not (imposable to say), many students read into that, thinking they are becoming superior in intelligence and more importaint people. Not all students, but this is not uncommon. Its easy to brain wash a young mind. Acquiring knowledge has never made anybody more intelligent.  But many people still confuse knowledgeable people with high intelligence and wealth.  Bill gates is currently the richest person in the UK, He never had a degree. He has since been awarded an honorary degree (academics feel good factor) and would most probably not be at the top of the 'rich list' if he had wasted his time at university. He was savvy enough to quickly realize that. I find a lot of graduates are very snobby, I interview many people to work in my business.  The students who studied  hear, in this city tend to be some of the worst offenders. Without any people skills, they will not get a job offer. Once people realize a degree is a basic level standard and it will take many years to gain the skills my top employees have, I need to invest a lot of additional training for them, just like a non-degree candidate. The real advantage of a degree is very small, as its not mandatory for most jobs.

	126075 : ["Both.   \"Faith without works* is dead\" James 2:17 * Works can be defined as DOING, or PRACTISING.  You can have faith that God is love, but the works will make YOU loving too. <Edit> SirWilliam - Faith in Jesus isn't the ticket to salvation either, even Satan and the demons have faith.  You can't just quote one scripture and say \"there\".  You have to take the bible as a whole. Name calling like labelling JWs as a cult is just childish.  It would be much appreciated if you keep all your insults and lies to yourself. Maranatha - same goes to you <Edit> Unsilenced Lamb - Yes it is true that JWs are very pro-active, but is it better to be pro-active (teaching others all around the world about God's Kingdom hope for the righteous and judgment for the wicked), and going to church almost very other day to keep up the faith?.....OR....just be content with having our ears tickled (2 Timothy 4:3, 4) at church once a week, who's' ministers aren't even bothered whether an individual strictly abides by biblical teaching? (2 Corinthians 13:5) At work I work with a woman who considers herself to be a strong Christian.  One minute she's telling people that God loves EVERYONE and that it doesn't matter who you are and what you do...The next minute she's really judging everyone at work, backstabbing and saying that they will be going to hell if they don't watch it!  From what I can gather from her conversations is that her minister chums up the members by basically saying everyone else is going to hell except their church goers. Churches nowadays focus too much on God's merciful side, they'd rather just skip the whole of the Old Testament because of Gods judgment.  God wanted the whole bible in tact because he wanted people to consider the WHOLE bible.  The Old Testament is full of examples for us and parallels to our day.  For example, Gods people back then were claiming to be his worshippers, they went through the motions (sacrifices, temple worship etc) BUT their hearts weren't in it.  God was not happy with them just the same as God is not happy with people today simply going to church and thinking they're all ok. JWs teach that a relationship with God is earned.  Obviously God loved us first (He reaches out for us), but we, as individuals must prove our love for Him, it's not just a case of being baptized.  God gave us life, giving that life to him through our work today is what we can do to show our appreciation.  This world today is hard, but the future is the REAL life. Faith (and appreciation) in Jesus ransom sacrifice is one of the things required for \"salvation\", without it, we would not be forgiven.  So obviously Jesus' disciples is going to say that faith in Jesus \"saves\", but everyone who got baptized quickly back then already had a relationship with God and were living by His standards.  You can't be immoral and expect to be saved simply by believing in Jesus. The apostle Paul had to counsel the Corinthian church about a man who was sinning.  He told them to put him out the church.  Does that sound like faith is all that is required?", 10874, "oONpxHWVaa", 7],
	126076 : ["Filmmaker James Cameron is claiming he and some archeologists found the tomb of Jesus's family. All the casket-like things called ossuaries are empty. I wonder what the archeologists were thinking when they found an ossuary with Jesus's name on it. I can imagine the moment they removed the lid and looked in. If it were me, I'd wonder if I was going to see one of the following: 1. Nothing 2. Decomposed stuff 3. Jesus sitting up and saying, “What in Dad's name took you so long?” If you put an ordinary guy in an ossuary for 2,000 years, he'd clearly be dead. But if I were opening that ossuary I'd be wondering if maybe someone put Jesus in there after he died but before he arose. And maybe it's hard to get out once you get in. I'd be worried that Jesus arose inside the stone box, and he'd be totally pissed that no one let him out until now. I realize that this would not be the most rational worry in the world. But I like to base my worries on an expected value calculation. So for example, a 90% chance of getting a sliver would worry me about the same as a .000001% chance of a nuclear bomb going off in the backyard. In this ossuary example, I'd be looking at maybe a 2% chance of waking up an angry Jesus. I say that's worth a worry. If Jesus was in there, and sat up when I took the lid off, I'd first try to judge how angry he looked. If he had that money-changers-in-the-temple look, I'd go with a joke, like “Ha ha! Turn the other cheek!” Or maybe I'd try to explain to him that the extra suffering was extra good for humanity, and after all, that's his job. Then I'd say, “Hey, I don't like my job either, but you don't see me complaining all the time.” I know that some of you will say that if Jesus could move that big rock that was allegedly in front of his tomb in the traditional telling of his life, he'd have no trouble removing an ossuary lid. But he wasn't supposed to be in an ossuary in the first place, so obviously if this ossuary is genuine, some of the details of the story were wrong. And if God let Jesus be crucified, it's not a huge stretch of the imagination to think he'd let him stay in a stone box for 2,000 years. It makes sense to save your coolest miracle for when it's needed most. And I think you'll agree that this would be a good time for a messiah. And if you were God, you'd want James Cameron attached to this production. So it makes sense to me.  That's why I'd be a crappy archeologist. I'd be afraid to open anything.", 10873, "xkiSQjjZaa", 0],

	126106 : ["‘If Your Right Eye Makes You Stumble' 8 In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave sound counsel on morality. He knew that our imperfect body members can have a dangerous influence on us. Jesus therefore said: “If, now, that right eye of yours is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost to you than for your whole body to be pitched into Gehenna. Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost than for your whole body to land in Gehenna.”—Matt. 5:29, 30. The “eye” spoken of by Jesus represents the power or ability to focus our attention on something, and the “hand” relates to what we do with our hands. If care is not exercised, these body parts may cause us to “stumble” and cease ‘walking with God.' (Gen. 5:22; 6:9) When tempted to disobey Jehovah, then, we need to take strong action, figuratively tearing out an eye or cutting off a hand.  How can we restrain our eyes from concentrating on immoral things? “A covenant I have concluded with my eyes,” said the God-fearing man Job. “So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin?” (Job 31:1) Job was a married man who was determined not to violate God's moral laws. That should be our attitude whether we are married or single. To avoid sexual immorality, we need to be guided by God's holy spirit, which produces self-control in those who love God.—Gal. 5:22-25.  To avoid sexual immorality, we might do well to ask ourselves, ‘Do I allow my eyes to arouse in me an appetite for immoral material readily found in books, on television, or on the Internet?' Let us also remember these words of the disciple James: “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.” (Jas. 1:14, 15) In fact, if any individual dedicated to God “keeps on looking” with immoral motives at someone of the opposite sex, he needs to make drastic changes comparable to tearing out the eye and throwing it away.— Matthew 5:27, 28.  Inasmuch as improper use of our hands can result in serious violations of Jehovah's moral standards, we must be firmly determined to remain morally clean. Therefore, we should heed Paul's counsel: “Deaden  your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.” (Col. 3:5) The word “deaden” stresses the strong measures that must be taken to fight against immoral fleshly desires.  In order to preserve his life, a person is likely to be willing to have a limb surgically amputated. The figurative ‘throwing away' of the eye and the hand is vital for us to avoid immoral thinking and actions that can cost us our spiritual life. Keeping mentally, morally, and spiritually clean is the only way to escape the everlasting destruction symbolized by Gehenna. Because of inherited sin and imperfection, maintaining moral cleanness requires effort. “I pummel my body and lead it as a slave,” said Paul, “that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.” (1 Cor. 9:27) Let us therefore be determined to apply Jesus' counsel on morality, never allowing ourselves to act in ways that show a lack of gratitude for his ransom sacrifice.—Matt. 20:28; Heb. 6:4-6.", 10884, "gd43sKOJaa", 0],

Yes, God does expect us to do \"good works\" but it's not the \"ticket\" to Salvation...  accepting Jesus's sacrifice for sin \"is\"...  It's God's free gift to us.  The Brooklyn NY \"cult\" based head-quarters of the JW's has \"specialially\" re-translated Gods Word into a \"special\" exclusice translation that \"they\" only will read..  \"they\" are terrified of the Greek lexicon (the original texts) as \"they\" profess to know the real truth... sadly, they have skewed Gods Word very cleaverly to promote \"their\" cult.  They have diluted the Deity of Christ, extingushed the spirit of American Nationalizm (they will not display the American flag) and eclipsed   and personal birthdays as a part of their pseudo religious doctrines...

That's a large piece so it could be a few hundred to well over a thousand or more depending on where you live and who does it. I had a spinal one designed and one guy here locally (FL) was going to do it for $200. He moved away before we got around to doing it and now the other guys at the same shop will want $1000 or more. You really need to price it out in your area...or just find an artist you like and trust and then be prepared to pay whatever they charge. Good luck...looks like a kewl design!", 10877, "AA11447210", 1],

It really all depends on what shop you go to. Ussually artist wont schedule more then a 4 hour session due to Your pain AND theirs....
