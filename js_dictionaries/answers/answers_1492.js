Take a trip there. If it was at school, offer a journey to say hi to old teachers or something, or see how the building has changed.

You're a great artist.\" Ha, corny but whatever fits! Even physical things... \"I can't take my eyes off of you...\". - ... like if you love her eyes, please tell her so.

	80291 : ["Gas stoves today use two basic types of ignition sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame is between the front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match [Stove Lighting[1]. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a flame failure device, lighting when there's no power can prove to be a bit of a challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the flame failure device cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply. A modern ignited gas stove Although most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, many households (especially private student accommodation and properties occupied by pensioners in the UK) have gas cooking ranges and ovens that need to be lit with a flame. Electric ignition stoves use electric sparks to ignite the surface burners. This is the \"clicking sound\" audible just before the burner actually lights. The sparks are initiated by turning the gas burner knob to a position typically labeled \"LITE\" or by pressing the 'ignition' button. Once the burner lights, the knob is turned further to modulate the flame size. Auto reignition is an elegant refinement: the user need not know or understand the wait-then-turn sequence. They simply turn the burner knob to the desired flame size and the sparking is turned off automatically when the flame lights. Auto reignition also provides a safety feature: the flame will be automatically reignited if the flame goes out while the gas is still on--for example by a gust of wind. If the power fails, surface burners must be manually match-lit. Electric ignition for ovens uses a \"hot surface\" or \"glow bar\" ignitor. Basically it is a heating element that heats up to gas's ignition temperature. A sensor detects when the glow bar is hot enough and opens the gas valve.", 9023, "ZsD8GuFEaa", -3],
	80292 : ["Start with the layout.  Build around an efficient work triangle.  You want to be able to walk between the fridge, sink and stove easily. The next questions you have to answer. Sink:  How do you use your sink?  Do you need a big deep sink, or will a standard size work for you?  Are you a dirty dish \"soaker\" who likes to put broiler pans to soak overnight?  Then you need a larger basin.  Do you want one large side and one smaller side in a double basin? Work surface:  Do you want to put hot pans directly on the surface or will you always use something to protect the surface from heat damage?  Are you concerned about chipping, scratching, discoloring the worksurface/countertop?  If so, choose based on how you will operate in the kitchen. Hob (cooktop):  I prefer cooking with flames because the heat is instant on and off.  I have better temperature control, too.  I currently have a smooth cooktop and I don't like it.  It is hard to keep clean, the heat cycles on and off, slow to control the changes to temperature. Cooker (oven):  Gas or electric...I don't think this matters much.  Consider self-cleaning...gets really hot and cleans up well.  Consider a double oven or a warming oven that you can use to keep breads or other foods warm until serving time.

	80295 : ["1. Mmmm Massage! Light some scented candles, buy some massage oil, and practice on each other! Foot massages and back massages are one of the most natural ways to relax your body. Not only that, but you would be surprised at the stress it alleviates. Who knows, with all the rubbing going on between the two of you it just may lead to something else romantic! Even if that doesn't happen you two loving each other and making one another feel good should be enough for the both of you. 2. Midnight Picnic A classic simple romantic thing to do would be to have a picnic. Bring your aphrodisiac-filled meal outdoors to enjoy the beautiful scenery of your backyard, beach, or perhaps a recreational park. Make sure to pack a thick cozy blanket for the two of you to relax on and enjoy the stars. With nothing to distract you but the nature and eating in between talking you two are bound to truly enjoy the alone time with each other more then the date itself. Bring a bottle of wine and loosen up while being romantic. After all, it's just you two, with no distractions. Simple activities like this leave you time to really enjoy each other's presence. 3. Road Trip One romantic thing to do is to just get away from it all. Go on a road trip! Even if it's just a few hours away, explore a new town together. Stop at shops and restaurants along the way. Not only will you find new things to do not too far from home, you two will be with each other. Much like the other romantic things I've listed above, you will talk to each other to keep each other entertained. Knowledge is power, and the more you know about each other, the more you two will fall in love with each other. Enjoying new places is exhilarating for couples. Try to enjoy some time away at least once every few months to keep things spicy. 4. Flowers Flowers may be a standard choice, but they are still a great way to show your love for just about anybody. Sure, flowers die, but choosing your loved one's favorite flowers and surprising him or her is still a fantastic way to show you care. You can always go with silk flowers as well, if you want them to last forever. 5. Try Something Different One romantic thing to do with your partner is to do something you wouldn't regularly do that he or she likes to do. Show them you care about them by taking interest in what they like. Even if you don't like it you love him/her and you want to show them that. Not only will your love for them be obvious by the end of the event, their love for you will be stronger seeing that you've made an attempt to do something you really didn't favor just to please him or her 6. Sit in front of the fire If you have a fireplace in your home, then you should take advantage of it! Sit in front of the fire and talk to one another with a glass of wine or hot chocolate. Cuddling in front of the fire is mucho fun and romantic! 7. Send Cute Texts This one is pretty straightforward. An occasional “hey” lets you know that you're on his mind… but sometimes we need a little more than that. Once again, it doesn't have to be anything grand, just a cute little message to let you know you're in his thoughts. If you get something like “Hey, I just wanted to tell you thanks for coming out last night and that you looked amazing.” You're golden. 8. Dance Like No One's Watching Lastly, this one's just for you and your love. Be spontaneous; play your favorite song some night, and draw him or her into your arms. Dance together, just be together, and say “I love you” without words. hope you the ideas", 9013, "YIpKrcuEaa", 0],

	80300 : ["I would keep it simple. You are going to have three small ones under the age of five, and one a tiny babe, to boot, so I would keep it to day trips and not try to go out of state. Also, with the economy, a few day trips and a \"real\" vacation in-state can be fun! My husband and I have taken several in state vacations that have lasted 2-5 days, and we've seen so many fun things. The kids like doing this, too. Kids like to camp, especially young boys. This isn't so hard with a baby (yours will most likely be crawling by camping time!) if you take along a play pen to keep baby out of trouble. There are walkers that can be made immobile so the baby can sit and play, but not move about and get hurt. Zoos, indoor water parks, local fairs, hiking trails, farms with petting zoos, boating, train rides, and camping are all a hit with kids. Small children get tired and cranky if the day gets too long, if there is a lot of shopping involved, and if they are expected to sit still too long. Kids want to be moving and doing! They have a ton of energy and need to expend it. Find something that keeps them active.  Small babies often do not travel well or do well in a stroller all day, so make sure you have a baby pack that allows her to ride on either you or her dad's back or front so she will be more content. Small babies are so demanding and they make these trips a bit more demanding. I would try to avoid excessively long car trips (7-15 hour ones), all day scenes where the kids will get tired and not be able to rest, and over-stimulating activities. Look for kid-friendly places that the whole family can enjoy for a few days, and then, if you have family who will watch your children, perhaps a day or two away for you and hubby to reconnect would be nice. My hubby and I have done this before and it works well. We had family time, and then us time. Not too often, but a few times, and it was great. I love to go to fairs and festivals as these can be so much fun! Kids (boys) love to ride the rides, see the monster trucks and tractor pulls, and go on pony rides. And who doesn't like to sample the foods if it is a tomato, apple, corn, pork, or pumpkin festival? Ohio seems to have a festival for everything, including a moonshine festival! Check out your state and see what all you can find. And check out the adjacent states that border WV so you can find places that aren't too far from you. But overall, keep it simple, keep it fun, and make lots of memories! Kids just enjoy the adventure of doing something new.
