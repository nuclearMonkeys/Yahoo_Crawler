If you are wanting her to stay on the breast then stop with the bottles. but since you are trying to wean I would suggest pumping some milk and give it to her in a bottle.  I would do that until she is a year old but if you are not wanting to do that then do it gradually.  It will be better for you.  If you don't release the milk you will be in a lot of pain.  I would definitely pump and slowely reduce the amount that you pump until you are no longer feeling engorged or even full.

I took him to the doctor to make sure he didn't have an ear infection or was getting a new tooth I hadn't noticed.  There didn't seem to be anything wrong with him.  So after 8 days I waited until he was asleep then stuck my boob in his mouth.  He started sucking in his sleep and his strike was over.

Stay home and just have a nice day with your own family.  Then, since you broke the pattern this year, you will have freedom to break it again next year, and then you will never be under this obligation again and forever will be able to have your own dinner.

	108818 : ["I had very simalar issues as a child. The teachers would get so frustrated with me. They first put me in honors programs (started in Kindergarten with the first graders), but then they still wanted me to skip. My parents finally allowed me to do so. Then a few years later they wanted me to skip again. Now, I'm two grades ahead of everyone else. It's great learning wise and everyone knows you're smart, plus you're challenged. But there are a few downfalls, some being you'll get called \"nerd\" and sometimes be made fun of. In tenth grade, you don't get to take Driver's Ed with everyone else, and you're always the 'late' one, whether it be with puberty or anything. But other than that, it's great. I'm happy my parents let me skip two grades. It's really fun, in my opinion. I'd reccomend it, I know it's kind of a weird thought, and it can be kinda scary to start out with, but you realize that you're just with kids. They don't change much between grades, except you often go through bullying faster and get out of it sooner. That's nice.  You should talk to your son about it, ask him if he wants to. He may have to leave his friends, which he may not like, but he may not care much if he doesn't have many. I'd say this is a great oppertunity to have and I'd grab a hold of it.", 10068, "BLsZitfCaa", 1],

Since he was a boy it was harder on him during his high school years...when everyone had their drivers license he didn't and when people were dating he peers he was the baby...he said it sucked so he would not let our son skip a grade when recommended. I think we made a good choice taking my son's social skills into consideration...he is 11y/o and he is still ... my baby...when no one is watching. Schools look not only at academics but social skills and the child's adaptablity...also just because the child aces subjects doesn't truely mean they should skip a grade...it could be that the class is slower to reach his level...and your child is at the correct level.   Personally I think it all evens out when they hit middle school and high school because they do have gifted classes where kids can take more challenging classes....It is hard to watch and wonder if it is right to skip or not to...but if you are really concerned you should first discuss it with the teacher and if they recommend it the they will address the counselor and such....Good luck.", 10068, "None", 2],

	108833 : ["I skipped eighth grade. They mostly just made me take a test at the beginning of seventh grade to see if it was a good idea to incorporate a little bit of eighth grade material into my work. The only reason was because I had failed a grade before. They had me take the eighth grade standardized test at the end of the year, and I scored the highest percentage in the school (it was a small school), so they skipped me up a grade.

There's no problem about being a bit younger than everyone else. You get used to it. All my friends have started driving, and I haven't. It's all good though, as I get free rides. I think if someone stays behind when they should be accelerated won't perform as well as they could/should. The work would seem easy, the child wouldn't concentrate, and would generally get left behind from the class, as the work doesn't seem so important.

What to do NOW is this: It's probably nipple confusion.  Nurse nurse nurse nurse nurse.  Keep the baby as calm as possible when you try to feed him and he's refusing.  Dark room, soft talking, white noise or soft music.   Your baby will not starve himself. If you are TRULY worried, watch his output sans formula.  6-8 soiled diapers per day is the norm for that age.  If he does not wet 6, don't panic.  Simply express some breastmilk (or use formula if you have absolutely no milk to give) and use an eyedropper to feed him.

What happens in the US and UK, at least, is that of the very few who do exclusively breastfeed up to 6 months, peers and doctors encourage solids thereafter. Your breastmilk is an intelligent living tissue - it changes according to your environment and your baby's needs. Breastfed babies are smarter and healthier - that's what the data says. To suggest substituting mothers' milk for cow's milk is the healthy option is false - to say the least. By breastfeeding your baby you are giving his young immune system an all-too-rare boost that will serve him well through life. I suggest you wean baby at his pace. If you offer him healthy foods regularly he will take them more as he grows. But to try to force him off the breast risks all too common physical and psychological damage.", 10069, "o3UpdLCEaa", 0],
