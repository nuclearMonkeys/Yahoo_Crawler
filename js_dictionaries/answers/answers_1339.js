	72545 : ["It is understood that we do have, always have had a significant Greenhouse Effect. Increased solar output would then be expected to have a greater effect close to the earth even if there were no increase in that Greenhouse Effect. But was our evaluation of the upper layers adequately timely? This matters primarily because the warming of upper layers would be of very short duration.  Those upper layers do not have a Greenhouse Effect to retain any heat they build up, so they basically do not build up any amount of heat, it just flies off into space. So, if we take measurements of temperature way up there, they reflect only very current levels of insolation.  We know it would be too late now to do those checks because insolation has definitely declined off its maxima. But did we take readings too late to tell us anything? Do understand that this is not about whether we have seen an increase in our Greenhouse Effect. It is just about the attempt to use temperatures way up there to demonstrate it. We can have had both increasing Greenhouse Effect and increased solar output, just as we can have both an increase in Greenhouse Effect simultaneous with dimming resulting from volcanic dust in the upper atmosphere. And we can have both of those with variation in solar output. Drought and advancing deserts also can  very significantly influence not only the temperatures we measure, but even influence our Greenhouse Effect. (Drought affected areas consume far less CO2).", 8681, "7HKTDcvYaa", 4],
	72546 : ["Why is the stratosphere cooling? Well, its not, and if you had a more up to date graph of stratospheric temperature trends you would know that--yours ends in 1999, but even from there you can see that lower stratospheric temperatures plateaued in roughly 1994, and they have continued to stay flat. However, the lower stratospheric temperature trends are complicated by ozone recovery, so we can look at upper stratosphere and we can see that temperatures have not dropped for at least 12 years. Above that we have no up to date temperature trend analysis. Two papers by Laštovička et al (2004 and 2006) look at upper atmosphere trends ending in 1997. They both mention that geomagnetic and solar activity have played some role in the cooling upper atmosphere, but there hasn't been any particularly good assessment of the extent of their roles. And increased water vapor likely makes up a majority of the rest. CO2 is likely playing a role as well, but we don't know the extent. And in fact, a cooling upper atmosphere works well with a plateau in solar activity--having to do with the shorter time it takes for the upper atmosphere to reach equilibrium versus the oceans. Ken says: \"The actual analysis of RSS Stratosphere data (by RSS vs. some unknown blogger) clearly identifies a -0.313 K/decade cooling in the stratosphere\" Yes, the overall trend is negative, but that does not mean that the stratosphere continues to cool. And in fact, the only real cooling we see in the lower stratosphere comes directly after the two major volcanic eruptions of the last 30 years (Pinatubo and El Chichon). Though, like I said, the lower stratosphere is complicated by ozone recovery.", 8681, "gcTdkwO5aa", 3],

Well, with cardio exercises like running, the distance isn't exactly what is important, it's how LONG you're running for, you need to keep your heart rate up for AT LEAST 20 minutes, if you can jog at a brisk pace for 20-60 minutes you'll lose the beer belly if you do that and have a healthy nutrition. Lets use an example. ( not exactly realistic ) Lets say you run 2 miles in 15 minutes, is that enough? nope.

Additionally if you persistently did weight training you would acquire muscle however your metabolism wouldn't be as boosted, although it has been proven cardiovascular activities make your components more efficient the wastes in the system are expelled efficiently! I have encompassed cardiovascular activities on days I do not weight train so I can keep my metabolism intact and eliminate fat. Furthermore the most effective cardiovascular activity would be interval training( 30-60 seconds maximum effort 1minute-moderate pace) this is deemed by numerous people to be the most effective! Henceforth  to make distinctions between cardiovascular and muscular activites I'd say cardiovascular actives incorporates more rapid movements and muscular activites= more of the lifting aspect. Both cardio and muscular activites should not be neglected you should perform vigorous cardiovascular activities at least 3-5 times a week to keep your metabolism intact and weight lifting is essential for sculpting as well as chiseling your physique!

For a start you should consider a change in diet, try to eat less processed food and cut back on unhealthy snacks. It seems cliché but it really is the first step. Consult a physician and ask him what kind of workout would be good for you. My guess would be swimming, since it really burns off calories while the risk of injuries is considerably lower than in running. Your back and your joints have to support a lot of weight, so putting an extra strain on them by jumping up and down is not a good idea.

The only simple  way to loose weight fast is to raise your metabolism, to burn more fat. not to starve yourself because your body is very intellident, it can detect when you are lack of calories from food and makes u feel sleepy to restore calories for the body.  Eat negative calories or high fiber food: Asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, lettuce & zucchini. Because these food require a lot of calories to digest so in return the more you eat the more calories you can burn without doing anything.  Fruits that are good for you are apple, grapefruit ( as much as possible , no harm ) or any other type of citrus like pomelo or orange. Eat many small meals rather than 2 or 3 big meals. Because if u do so you will get your body to work all the time to digest the food and it will keep your body digestion up => burn more calories.  Drink a lot of green tea.
