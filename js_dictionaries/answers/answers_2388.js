	125223 : ["For me ... I think a great feud consists of great promos. The two wrestlers involved the the feud obviously have to be gifted on the mic. Also, the feud can't be predictable. If one wrestler dominates the other every Raw or every PPV, then it gets boring. The two must have good wrestling abilities. Also, I think a great feud consists of special matches, and not just one on one. The wrestlers also have to have chemistry in the ring together.  I think one of the main elements in a feud that helps a lot is there has to be something on the line as the feud continues. Instead of just the match being for a title, there has to be something more to spark interest in the fans.  A great feud in my mind is Cena vs Edge. These two are outstanding on the mic and had a ton of chemistry together. They may not be the best technical wrestlers, but they always put on great shows at the PPV. This feud also consisted of a TLC match which was terrific. Another thing I liked about these two was that it got personal. Edge went to Cena's house, Cena ripped Lita all the time. They might be great friends backstage, but during they're feud it seemed pretty legit that they hated each other. Like I mentioned, this feud has something on the line. If Cena lost, he had to move to Smackdown! That draws more people into it. Another great feud in my mind is Undertaker vs Edge. Again, the promos were great. They had the Wrestlemania match, TLC, Hell in a Cell, they about did it all. It was a bit predictable, or at least the Hell in the Cell match was, but the TLC match was a shocking moment, and most of Taker's Wrestlemania matches you know for sure he is going to win, but this one got me thinking Edge had a chance. The feud went back and forth and had a lot of twists and turns. I liked how they had the storyline that if Undertaker lost, he had to retire.  Feuds get boring if its just title shot after title shot.  A feud that wasn't so great in my mind was Orton vs. Kofi. Promos weren't great and I personally didn't they they're matches were great either.  bq -- do not have it sorry!!", 10839, "schgWbIsaa", 2],
	125224 : ["A great feud for me is when the 2 wrestlers have personal issues with one another, when there's no championship involved, yes because i never consider a feud over the WWE Championship a great feud because is obvious that people will challenge you for the title if your the champ. For example Edge vs Matt Hardy wass good feud because they had personal issues, it was interesting. Rock vs Austin was good because they were always feuding about who was the best. The reason why feuds like this are so good is because they are always able to tell a good story in the ring later.", 10839, "Q5fAfFmraa", 0],

This is the most chicken-like substance I eat, even my meat eating boyfriend likes it, it is low in calories, and it is complete protein) -Textured Vegetable Protein (aka TVP.  This can be bought for pennies in the bulk bins.  It comes dry and varies in size from granules to chunks.  Throw it in soups, chilies, stuffed peppers- anything that would generally require ground beef- but make sure to season it well because TVP has no flavor) -Wheat Gluten (aka Seitan.  This can be found in normal grocery stores, health food stores, and Asian markets.  It's sort of like chicken, and most Asian stores have an awesome selection of dried, refrigerated, and canned versions because it is a traditional food in many Asian cultures- and not just for vegetarians) -Tofu (yum once you season it... although it grows on you.  When I first became veggie it needed to well disguised before I would eat it but now I think it is delicious cold and unseasoned straight from the package.  Once again, Asian stores have a better selection for less money) -Tempeh (a great source of protein... I honestly can't stomach it though.  Perhaps something about the texture and the weird fermentedness) Other protein sources: -Eggs and dairy of all sorts (if you are not vegan) -Beans (the canned ones are pretty cheap and convenient, the dried ones are really cheap but not as convenient) -Grains (quinoa is a very complete protein for a plant source.  It comes dried and you cook it like rice- but make sure to rinse it well first because there is a bitter substance on the outside.  Many other are good too- kalmut, millet, take a look at the dry bulk bins) -Soy milk (including soy yogurt and the like.  Many of the fake cheeses are low in protein though so make sure to check the label before buying) -Protein powders (i.e. whey protein, hemp protein, soy protein... these are pretty flavorless but are good sources if you feel your diet is lacking.  Add them to smoothies or baked goods to bump up the nutrition) -Veggies in general (per calorie vegetables are a good source of protein plus they have all the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) Hope that helps!", 10828, "GwQoeHK4aa", 1],

Transfer to the Mississauga Transit 19 bus from there. Get off at Shoppers World Bus Terminal in Brampton. 4) Transfer to the Brampton Transit route 2 bus to the Brampton Bus Terminal in Downtown Brampton. You can use your Mississauga Transit monthly pass on the Brampton Transit service. I'm not sure if Mississauga Transit transfers are accepted though, but they are most likely. 5) From there, catch the Brampton Transit route 1 bus to the Bramalea City Centre. In order to connect to another Brampton Transit bus, a Brampton Transit transfer is required. 6) Take the route 77 bus from Bramalea to the Vaughan Corporate Centre (Interchange Way and Highway 7) in Vaughan. The 77 is shared between Brampton Transit and York Region Transit. Brampton Transit tickets, passes and transfers are accepted on YRT/VIVA buses. 7) Transfer to the YRT route 20 bus. As I mentioned, Brampton Transit tickets, passes and transfers are accepted on YRT/VIVA buses. 8) Arrive at the Wonderland Terminal. Based on those figures, the trip will last between 1.5 to 2 hours. Depending on the traffic, it may take up to 2.5 to 3 hours.  More time may be needed due to the transfers. I couldn't break down all the exact figures, though.  As for costs, here is your breakdown: Mississauga Transit fare - single adult: $3.00 Brampton Transit fare: $3.00 YRT/VIVA fare: $3.25 You can also opt in for the GTA Weekly pass which is $52.00CDN per week. This pass will allow you to travel on YRT/VIVA, Mississauga Transit, Brampton Transit and the TTC. For example, If you buy 1 GTA weekly passes per week in a month (altogether with a total of 4 consecutive weeks), you will spend $208 per month. This pass is also eligible for the Transit Pass Tax Credit.
