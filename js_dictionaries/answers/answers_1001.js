For life elsewhere in the Solar System, the best candidates are under the ice in the apparently massive salty oceans of Jupiter's moons.  Oceans that are kept warm by gravitational flexing rather than proximity to the Sun. Until we have some idea whether life can exist under those conditions, we can't make any prediction at all about the next nearest stars. If it does, then it probably exists somewhere around any star with planets.  If it doesn't, then nobody has any idea. Please note: \"Life\" doesn't mean \"technological civilization.\"  And especially not \"spacefaring civilization.\" Which is the only thing the \"Fermi Paradox\" applies to.  Advanced technological civilizations that either travel in space, or communicate in ways that can be detected at a distance through space.", 7704, "tsgP2JfBaa", 2],

I suggest look up the Fermi Paradox. Read it. Understand it. Then think hard about it's implications. You will then understand why we are alone. But why sweat over it? There are about eight million species of life right here on Earth. Isn't that enough to learn about, discover, and explore? What use would it be to detect a hint of biochemistry on a planet a thousand light years away? If someone was honestly interested in lifeforms it would make far more sense for them to become a biologist and study the many fast-disappearing species on Earth.", 7704, "bXMPytYEaa", -4],

And I am not talking about possible bumps in the roads, but do you feel a pressure on your body while the car drives constantly this speed? No? Same goes with Earth. The planet is moving with a constant speed, without speeding up, nor slowing down and this constant motion through space we don't feel. We even don't feel it's rotation because we humans are so small compared to the Earth and still it take 24 hours to make a single rotation. We are just too small to notice it. We are even that small that we cannot even see the curvature of the Earth, only when you see ships disappear behind the horizon.", 7705, "LfWBLDAeaa", 2],

There is no chance at all that any planet in our solar system has a civilization or has ever had a civilization.  Except our own planet, of course. The chance that we will ever meet organisms from another civilization seems vanishingly small, but it depends a lot on how long our civilization can survive as an advanced technological civilization.  Whether we will self-destruct or simply run out of resources is uncertain.  Bear in mind that organisms on some other civilized planet also have a good chance of either self-destructing or running out of resources.  BTW, \"climate change\" is a natural occurrence on any moist, rocky planet.  We here may be speeding up climate change, but every civilization would experience problems with climate change. So even if other technological civilizations have existed within our neighborhood in the galaxy, they may be already defunct.  Or there could be planets in our neighborhood where life has reached the stage of, let's say, dinosaurs, but not the stage of technology.   Just think, radio is only a hundred years old on earth.", 7730, "Kf4PiubQaa", 0],

	55573 : ["Entropy i.e everything decays. The decay of light is seen as stars. We can detect a dip in light when a planet transits a star. We can also detect the wobble of a star, caused by the orbit of a planet. Entropy also works against space travel. The longer the spaceflight, the more food needed for the trip. Entropy means that recycling is not 100% efficient, no matter the level of technological advancement. Currently, the amount of fuel needed for interstellar travel is very large compared to weight of humans. The faster the propulsion, the more fuel that's used. Maybe it would be viable to send humans to Proxima Centauri on a rocket one mile long. Even then, it would take thousands of years to arrive. It could use the atmospheres of gas giants to slow down. In the future, there could be better propulsion methods though. Antimatter is just about the best fuel possible. Humans have already created small quantities of antimatter using particle accelerators. The most remarkable application of antimatter are PET scans. Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that the primary mirror of the JWST is 6.5 meters in diameter, and it has 18 mirrors in total. That's how it will be able to directly image the atmospheric composition of exoplanets. JWST can collect very faint sources of light. Adaptive optics was also a major breakthrough in ground based telescopes. The moral of the story is that optics is progressing at a much faster rate than rockets. This is the same reason why laser weapons make missiles obsolete. Light is just better.", 7733, "E6IgnT59aa", 0],
