You might even want to pump a little of the top to get the milk flowing then put her to your breast, so it is instant gratification for her.  I was having trouble with sore nipples also, and my lactation nurse advised me not to use the cream.  Ultimately you want you nipples to build a callus and the cream only makes you nipples soft and constantly moist.  Instead, rub breast milk on them and let them air dry after each feeding and in between during healing.  After I found the correct latch technique everything has been going exactly how it should and I am having a great breastfeeding experience with my daughter.

It's really hard to understand if you aren't expecting it.  And I do send him up to ask for things sometimes.  I think it's good practise for him to learn that people won't always be understanding like I am and his teachers are, and to learn how to explain better.  He has improved a lot too.   I don't send him up if it's really busy and having him ask will hold everybody up, and I also wouldn't send him up if he was really self-conscious.

Will they be forced to advance socially to fit in with the \"older kids\"?  They can be brilliant but not emotionally ready for some of the concepts that the peers are dealing with. 3. When will they drive? Waiting for Junior or Senior year to drive can be tough on the kids confidence.  4. Would you rather your child be a leader or a standard student?  If he has to be given additional tasks but can maintain his leadership than it could be great, however you don't want them to get bored! Boredom leads to trouble.  I hope this helps.

I thought about it for a long time, and I came up with the fact that right now, she feels really smart and if I put her in a higher grade, what if she struggles and then gives up? Only being in grade school, this can make them hate school for life. So I chose not to. I just let them put her in the gifted math and reading class. So she still has her basics that she does with her friends, but once a week she has the gifted that teaches her more intense lessons. It is working out great. I even had people tell me that I should not want to hold my daughter back, and if she can be in a higher grade I should let her. But she has had the same friends since kindergarten, and she is really happy. So I talked to her about it, and we wrote down the pros and cons, and we really had to think on the pros, because the cons out weighed the pros.

	108863 : ["Let me encourage you, hon. My son Mikeal, who is now 18 and on his way to Berkley University, was once tested for retardation because he did not speak at all and when he did it was hard to understand. Mikeal was in the 3rd grade when I got that note. He was not doing well in school at all. Since he was about 2 I noticed that he was different and not talkative. He was my 3rd son and normally at about 2 they are all over you, asking for things, about things, and talkative. Mikeal was not and I was very concerned. I had taken him to a Child Psychologist thinking he may be autistic because I would have to ask him if he needed a drink or food or help; he never asked like my others did. The Dr. found nothing wrong and told me he would grow out of it. I heard that about a million times and felt frustrated each time. Once the school initiated the tests we all discovered that Mikeal was far from retarded. The tests showed that he was highly intelligent but that he had a speech impediment. With the schools help he eventually overcame the speech impediment, about a year later, and turned into an honor student and one of the most popular boys in high school sports and athletics. He is still on the quiet side though. Some kids, for some unknown reason, get to the same place as the rest of the pack in a different way. Never treat your child less than or like she is flawed she just might be one of the greatest minds ever. I look back and think of all the worry and stress and wonder why I put myself through it. Some of us are just different because, from the beginning, we think differently. Good Luck with your baby and know that she will be fine and probably lead the pack someday. : )", 10070, "EG72W712aa", 3],

My daughter was born Aug 2 which meant she had to wait until she was 6 to start kindergarten even though she was already at the same level as the ones who were 5, we fought and tried to get her in that year but in our state the cut off is Aug1 no exceptions.  The next year when she started kindergarten she was way ahead of the others and when she went in to 1st grade she was doing the work of a 2nd grader.  At the end of the year they wanted to move her to third instead of second.  That would have meant making all new friends and starting over, not to mention she would have the label of smart and teachers would always expect her to perform at a higher level.  She is now a Freshman and although at times she wishes she was a sophmore she is glad she isnt because she didnt have all the pressure on her.

He spoke when he wanted to say something but the words were not formed correctly because he had a lazy tongue. I finally convinced his pediatrician that he needed to see a specialist because no amount of medication was working to take away his ear infections. It took one X-ray at the pediatric ENT to tell me what was wrong.  He also needed tubes in his ears and his tonsils and adenoids removed. After the surgery and when he was in the first grade, he started speech to catch up  and did that for over 3 years. At 20, his tongue still isn't right, but he speaks clearly and he's in college now.

My daughter is almost four and she can string more intellectual sentences together than some 30 yr. olds I know. Don't be worried, be hyper vigilant about reading to her and she will make out fine.
