	67741 : ["Many words in modern day usage have a number of definitions pertaining to the field of science or philosophy/study they relate to.  Generally ideology is a belief, principles or ideals though substantiated by a sound premise remain ideologies because of the presence of an opposing polarity. For example goodness as the only and primary essence fo the human condition is a valid ideology thwarted by the pessimist who alludes that its opposition evil must exist to better appreciate the ideal of goodness, ludicrous to my mind but understandable where the knowledge that differing groups with varying genes tend towards the ideology that advantages the group than the greater good.  Like truth in general they remain ideologies until they are able to corroborate the position of their beliefs by falsifying the opposing polarity. To the fresh mind this sounds nonsensical but where one emphatically expounds upon the merits of one ideology or belief system the objectors then embark upon a series of arguments and actions that not only undermines but relegates the truth annexed to the realms of ideology.  For any statement or set of data or beliefs it must initially have rationale and logic. Thereafter until it has become an accepted truth by an equally vocal force it remains mere ideology. The system of data creation itself needs to be understood to fathom why these terms are abundant usage of what is a chaotic and confused modern day thinking. Prevailing religious, political and media ideologies may have little or no substance at all yet you find those sheep like people at the feeding trough of such an indoctrination system of an established ideology will battle for what keeps them ahead of the game. Contrary views seem equally as extreme and thus until one constructs an ideology that encompasses and incorporates universal values and dispels the false dictums then all that is is a market place of many ideologies all within a media that thrives not upon progress but sensationalism and controversy for its elect state. We are in a period of transition where many question the validity of each yet in confronted by fierce opposition truth remains as complex as matrix like as it were.   Many thinkers have a vision of what can be the ideal world, of justice, of civilisation that accords the greater good the highest freedom, yet where one standard or a non standard exists there the advent of new ideologies to replace the feeding trough of existing laws becomes itself the essence of the battle of freedom and its absence.", 8433, "P4sd5oCBaa", 1],

Then I like to get the cardboard whelping boxes rather than wood ones (for hygeine reasons) so that's another £75($110), and I refresh my whelping kit, say another £30($45). Then once whelped the dam gets extra food and supplements so through the next 8 weeks it will cost about £400 ($600) for all the food and worming, the puppy food costs another £200($300) for the puppy food for weaning a litter of 8. All the extra natural cleaning products for cleaning out the whelping room and area the puppies are in comes to about £50($75). We register the puppies which is about £70($100), they have dew claws removed another £80($120), worming £100($150), toys for their learning £30($45), puppy packs cost about £100($150), then the first vaccines are done which we get for £100($150). £1435 ($2150)all together. Each puppy is £700 ($1000)so approx £5600 ($8400)so we should make a profit of £4165 ($6250)but it doesn't ever work out as planned. Should we need a C-section or any emergency vet then it costs about £1000, or if a puppy dies you have to take it to the vet and I like to do a cremation and spread the ashes which does cost a lot.

	67763 : ["I got my Miniature Pinscher after she had a litter with her previous owner. A litter of 5 pups I believe it was. One passed away, 4 left. Total expenses from the backyard breeder = 60 dollars. 15 dollars per pup for tail docking and dew claw removal. No other veterinary care was done. She was being found a new home because she weighed 5 pounds, and the owners parents were convinced she wasn't feeding my dog, nor the pups. One pup was sold for 500 dollars. The others were given away. So even so, she made 440 dollars on the litter. Imagine if all 4 were sold. This is why backyard breeders and puppy mills are so keen on pups. Because if they're cute, they will sell for something, whether the puppy be a mix or not. When I was attempting to breed (which I changed my mind about after she didn't take the time I tried), I was doing it the right way. Perfect specimen of the breed, ideal temperament, genetic health all excellent, etc. I went for artificial insemination. The attempt was 100 dollars at my vet to collect semen. The male was uninterested. When he finally did deliver, she was inseminated. Vaginal swab was done as well as progesterone. 3 relaxin tests at 30 dollars a piece. That's 190. She was not pregnant. Full vet visit to determine the problem as she was no longer eating. Vet visit, 25 dollars. She had an infection. Another 30 some odd dollars. That vet visit was 80 dollars in total. 270 dollars in a few weeks period, no pregnancy, and an infection. I was going the reputable route. Homes were lined up for pups, spay/neuter contracts, etc.  Had she been pregnant, they would have taken an x-ray later on. 60 dollars. Prenatal vitamins, regular checkups, puppy food, towels and a whelping box, heat lamp and puppy replacement formula just in case, etc. Then the pups get there. Lets say there could be 4-5. Dew claw removal, 5 dollars a piece. Tail docking, 10 dollars per pup. Health certificates for all pups. 500 dollars for the whole litter. Necessary shots, registering the litter, parvo vaccines every two weeks, time and energy put into a litter, more checkups for mom, weaning of puppies, puppy playpen, etc. The cost of a litter would reach well over 2000 dollars via a reputable breeder. That doesn't include time off work and things of that nature for caring for the litter of pups, or a case where something goes wrong and mom needs a c-section, or puppies need urgent vet care, retained pup or placenta, water puppy, etc. Would it be worth it? For me, the experience of the litter and bettering the breed, yes. Profit wise? I would make 0 profit.

	67773 : ["Hmm, I thought you had asked almost the same question over the weekend, but when I went to check your previous questions and answers, I saw that you were hiding them again--that seems a bit ironic considering the nature of this question. I believe that most scientists (climate or other fields) are intellectually honest.  Usually in scientific papers people point out where theories, models, or observations fall short.  I'm not sure that always carries over to the popular press, probably partly due to the fault of the scientists and partly due to the reporters.  The few times I've been interviewed on television by reporters asking questions about the weather, I probably gave answers that were too equivocal for them.  I could tell they wanted me to blame everything on La Nina or Global Warming or say that the summer was the coldest or driest ever, etc. It's not good press to say that what we're experiencing is not THAT unusual when looked at from a historical perspective, but I think it's important to strive to do that. Sometimes when being interviewed scientists probably overstep what's completely proven in the effort to please the reporter.  Sometimes they may overstep in scientific papers, also, but I think there's a lot less of that because of the peer review process.  If anything, in papers I think scientists may not go far enough in the claims about what they believe to be true, because they know to do so would trigger a fight with reviewers that may prevent the paper being published at all. EDIT: It seems to me from your examples that you believe scientists are being intellectually honest when they support your denial--is that the case? How about Richard Muller, is he being intellectually honest because now he's convinced that the anthropogenic warming is real?  How about Anthony Watts, who was prepared to accept whatever BEST came up with...until they came up with results that he didn't like..is he being intellectually honest?  How about Nigel Calder, one of the stars of \"The Great Global Warming Swindle\", was he being intellectually honest when he talked about scientists promoting cooling in the 1970's, while neglecting to mention that he was selling books based on that idea? There are tens of thousands of earth scientists that work in the field of climate science.  If you have problems with a \"handful,\" then don't listen to them.

	67780 : ["In his essay 'Where Do Rights Come From?' Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz lays out possibilities. Some say human rights come from God. If we were all created in God's image, then every human being would be sacred and inviolable. Dershowitz rejects this as an answer, since so many people are agnostic. Others say human rights come from nature, or what has been called 'natural law.' They argue that nature and human nature, if it is examined, will reveal that some kinds of behaviors are fitting with the way things are, and are right.  However, Dershowitz points out that nature thrives on violence and predation, on the survival of the fittest. There is no way to derive the concept of the dignity of every individual from the ways things really work in nature. Another theory claims that human rights are created by us, the people who write laws.  Many argue that it is in the interests of societies to create human rights because honoring individual dignity means that in the long run everyone in the community is better off. However, what if the majority decides it is not in their interest to grant human rights? If rights are nothing but a majority creation then there is nothing to appeal to when they are legislated out of existence. Dershowitz, quoting Ronald Dworkin, argues that this third view human rights is inadequate:  \"It is no answer to say that if individuals have these rights then the community is better off in the long run... because when we say someone has a right to speak his mind freely, we mean he is entitled to do so even if this would not be in the general interest.\"  If human rights are created by majorities, of what use are they? Their value lies in that they can be used to insist that majorities honor dignity of minorities and individuals despite their conception of their greater good. Right cannot be created, they must be discovered, or they are of no value. As Dworkin concludes, if we want to defend individual rights, we must try to discover something beyond utility that argues for these rights. What could that something be? Neither Dworkin nor Dershowitz can really give an answer. Dworkin ends up appealing to a form of majority anyway. In 'Life's Dominion: An Argument About Abortion, Euthanasia, and Individual Freedom,' in 1995, Dworkin writes:  \"The life of a single human organism commands respect and protection... because of our wonder at the... processes that produce new lives from old ones... The nerve of the sacred lies in the value we attach to a process or enterprise or project rather than to its results considered independently from how they were produced...\" Law professor Michael J. Perry responds: \"The nonreligious source of normativity, for Dworkin, is the great value 'we' attach to every human being understood as a creative masterpiece; it is 'our' wonder at the processes that produce new lives from old ones... But to whom is Dworkin referring with his 'we' and 'our'? Did the Nazis value the Jews intrinsically? The conspicuous problem with Dworkin's... secular argument [for rights] is that Dworkin assumes a consensus among human agents that does not exist and never has existed.\" Perry's new book, 'Toward a Theory of Human Rights,' is very significant. Perry concludes that though it is clear \"there is a religious ground for the morality of human rights... It is far from clear that there is a non-religious ground, a secular ground, for human rights.\" Perry lays out Nietzsche's well-known insistence that, if God is dead, any and all morality of love and human rights is baseless. If there is no God, argues Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, there can be no good reason to be kind, to be loving, or to work for peace.  Perry quotes Philippa Foot who says that secular thinkers accepted the idea that there is no God and no given meaning to human life, but have not \"really joined battle with Nietzsche about morality. By and large we have just gone on taking moral judgments for granted as if nothing had happened.\" Why do we keep on dong this? The reason is laid out in a classic essay by the late Yale law professor Arthur Leff. Most people feel that human rights are not created by us but are founded by us, that they are there and must be honored by majorities, whether they like them or not. But Leff says: \"When would it be impermissible to make the formal intellectual equivalent of what is known in barrooms and schoolyards as 'the grand Sez Who'? In the absence of God.. each... ethical and legal system... will be differentiated by the answer it chooses to give to one key question: Who among us... ought to be able to declare 'law' that ought to be obeyed? Stated that baldly, the question is so intellectually unsettling that one would expect to find a noticeable number of legal and ethical thinkers trying not to come to grips with it... Either God exists of He does not, but if He does not, nothing and no one else can take His place...\" If there is no God, then there is no way to say any one action is 'moral' and another 'immoral' but only 'I like this.' If that is the case, who gets the right to put their subjective, arbitrary moral feelings into law? You may say \"the majority has the right to make the law,\" but do you mean that then the majority has the right to vote to exterminate a minority? If you say \"No, that is wrong,\" then you are back to square one. \"Who sez\" that the majority has a moral obligation not to kill the minority? Why should your moral convictions be obligatory for those in opposition? Why should your moral convictions be obligatory for those in opposition? Why should your view prevail over the will of the majority? The fact is, says Leff, if there is no God, then all moral statements are arbitrary, all moral valuations are subjective and internal, and there can be no external moral standard by which a person's feelings an values are judged. Yet Leff ends this intellectual essay in a most shocking way: \"As things are now, everything is up for grabs. Nevertheless: Napalming babies is bad. Starving the poor is wicked. Buying selling each other is depraved... There is such a thing as evil. All together now: Sez Who? God help is.\" Nietzsche, of course, understood this. \"The masses blink and say: 'We are all equal, Man is but man, before God we are all equal.' Before God! But now this God has died.\" Raimond Gaita, an atheist thinker, reluctantly writes:  \"Only someone who is religious can speak seriously of the sacred.. We may say that all human beings are inestimably precious, that they are ends in themselves, that they are owed unconditional respect, that they possess inalienable rights, and, of course, that they possess dignity. In my judgment these are ways of trying to say what we feel a need to say when we are estranged from the conceptual resources [God] we need to say it... Not one of [these statements about human beings] has the power of the religious way of speaking... that we are sacred because God loves us, his children.\" Leff is not simply concluding that there is no basis for human rights without God. He is also pointing out, as are Dershowitz and Dworkin, in their own way, that despite the fact that we can't justify or ground human rights in a world without God, we still know they exist. Leff is not speaking generically, but personally. Without God he can't justify moral obligation, and yet he can't not know it exists. If you believe human rights are a reality, then it makes much more sense that God exists than that he does not. If you insist on a secular view of the world and yet you continue to pronounce some things wrong, then I hope you see the deep disharmony between the world your intellect has devised and the real world, and God, that your heart knows exists.", 8437, "wB3AbJyLaa", 2],
	67781 : ["Hey Bruce, The answer is obvious. All of our rights come from God. The revelation of these are the fact that we can walk and talk and enjoy things like Nature, and that which the State feels we should have. It should be noted that the qualifier for these other offerings is the fact that these are subject to change at the slightest whim, or hint of another agenda. Mr. Obama's cause is a good study. While touting the \"advancement\" of the human race, the end result will be bigger government and more control. We are warned of these in the Bible, and we have seen a clear effort on the part of the Founding Fathers to avoid such situations. Sadly, not many know the content of the Constitution, and even more fail to see the manipulation of this present administration to that end. Even fewer even care, thinking that this is not their area of concern. However, I would suggest a read of the Revelation of Jesus for a \"heads up\" in this regard. The words are clear, and we have seen the beginnings of these things in our day. I would be hard pressed to suggest another outcome. It would seem therefore, that our responsibility at this time would be to have a voice, and to make it heard, though I seriously doubt that this will ever be the case. We, as a society, have become very comfortable with allowing our politicians to dole out subsidies hand over fist, rather than take responsibility for making our own way. The result is complacency of the highest order, as we allow our government representatives more and more control.  No, I suggest that God is the granter of all rights, if we choose to avail ourselves of them. While Nature may nourish, it is only by God's Hand, and the State can only grant rights which it is able to revoke, if and when they deem necessary. With that said, the question becomes,are they then rights at all? Be well.", 8437, "32xRsYa9aa", 1],
