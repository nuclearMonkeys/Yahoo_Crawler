	63291 : ["Great question Anouk! To me, selling out is simply when a band cares more about money and fame than they do their fans. In my opinion a band should never forget that it is their fans that give them their money, and their success. So when a band changes their sound or style cause they want too, or it just seems natural to them (Like Metallica and the Black Album, which I hate, but still respect) I have no problem with it. But when a band just changes their sound deliberately to make money and achieve major fame at the expense of their fans...that's what I call selling out.

	63307 : ["Well, there are 2 types of \"divisions\" during meiosis: 1) There is one division that occurs in all cell divisions. In this case, each chromosome divides in half, so that one half of each chromosome goes to one of the daughter cells.  Why does this happen? Because before this cell division started, each DNA macromolecule had duplicated. Afterwards, each of them concentrated to form one chromosome, and so these chromosomes have duplicate information, and they look different (for instance, if the chromosome normally has 2 \"arms\", now it will have 4).  When each chromosome divides in half, it goes back to normal. As I mentioned before, this happens every time that a cell divides (mitosis or meiosis), and in this way the transmission of the entire genetic information to the new cells is ensured: perfect copies are made, then each copy is distributed to a daughter cell .  2) The other type of division is quite different, and it's exclusive: it only happens during meiosis. In this special division, it is not half of each chromosome that goes to each daughter cell, but HALF OF THE CHROMOSOMES. But not at random: the chromosomes are present in a cell as homologous pairs, and it's one of each pair that goes to each daughter cell. This means that the resulting cells have only half of the normal chromosomes. And that's OK,  because these cells are gametes or reproductive cells. Each gamete needs to combine and fuse with another gamete of the opposite sex to achieve the full complement of chromosomes. When the 2 gametes combine,a zygote forms, and from it a new individual will develop. Thus, the members of a pair of homologous chromosomes come originally from the 2 gamete that fused. +++++++++++++++++++++ Update:  Sorry Gibbie, but normal human body cells have 46 chromosomes, that is, 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes of which 1 is the sexual pair (XX or XY). That is the diploid number, or '2n'.  The amount of chromosomes DOES NOT increase during DNA replication (a process that occurs before mitosis and meiosis); what gets duplicated is each DNA macromolecule, so that before the cell divides, each chromosome has twice the normal amount of DNA, hence twice as many 'arms' as it had before replication.  The only ones of our cells that have half as many chromosomes are the gametes. They have only 23 chromosomes (haploid number or 'n'),  including 22 somatic chromosomes, each of them corresponding tot one of the homologous pairs that got separated,  and 1 sexual chromosome (either X or Y).", 8198, "AA10112320", 0],
	63308 : ["It's on the X chromosome. If a man gets an X with the gene for color blindness, he automatically has it while a woman has two X's so if one X has it but the other doesn't, she doesn't have it. A girl needs both parents to give an X with the mutation. So men automatically get color blindness more often.", 8199, "sfalJdlAaa", 1],
	63309 : ["About 8 percent of males, but only 0.5 percent of females, are color blind in some way or another, whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation.[6][7]  The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome being significantly shorter than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one which carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome which carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 × 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.\" quote", 8199, "None", 0],
	63310 : ["The reason is that the defective gene that directs production of the defective pigment is carried on the same pair of chromosomes that determines the sex of the child. In a female child (who has two X sex chromosomes), a defective gene on one X chromosome is almost always counteracted by a normal gene on the other X chromosome; as a result, the girl is born with normal color vision. In a male child (who has an X and a Y sex chromosome), there is no matching normal gene to block the defect on the only X chromosome the boy has; the boy is, therefore, born color-blind. Red-green color blindness cannot be passed from a father to his sons, nor will his daughters be color-blind, unless the mother carries the defective gene as well. However, his daughters will all be carriers of the defective gene, and the daughters' sons will have a 50 percent chance of being color-blind.", 8199, "a2IzH88xaa", 0],

A band is a sell out bad when they stop making music based on how they actually feel and do it just to make money. Like it's not about making good, meaningful music. They just want it to be catchy and get on Billboard's Top 100.

	63331 : ["The half thing is confusing you.  Chromosomes are wound up DNA.   Humans have 22 chromosomes, plus 2 sex chromosomes, X and Y.  After mitosis (G1 phase), there are 2n chromosomes, each containing one copy of DNA.  2n is diploid; we get one chromosome from mom and another from dad.  During S phase, DNA divides, so the chromosomes now get two copies of DNA, each chromosome is now a pair of two chromatids, attached by a centromere.  There is now 4n DNA content, but still 2n chromosomes.  During M phase, chromosomes align along the metaphase plate, and each half of each chromosome (one chromatid) goes into a daughter cell.  Thus the daughter cells have 2n chromosomes, and 2n DNA.   Once you get that, meiosis is a snap.  During meiosis, DNA duplicates as normal, creating 2n chromosomes and 4n DNA content.  Then, during teh first meiotic phase, both chromosomes attach to each other, creating a single complex containing 4n DNA, this is for genetic recombination and is critical for genetic diversity.  Then, each chromosome is separated into a daughter cell (unlike in normal mitosis, the chromatids don't separate, and the daughter cells contain two copies of genetically identical chromosomes, ie just mom, whereas in mitosis the daughter cells contain one copy of each different chromosome, from dad and mom).  After that, immediately there is another M phase, and here the chromosome containing 2 chromatids will separate, just like in mitosis.  Each of these goes into a specialized daughter cell, either an oocyte or a sperm depending on sex of the adult.   See this picture, it's pretty simple.", 8198, "AA10800516", -1],
