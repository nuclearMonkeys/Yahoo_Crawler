Poetry just came to me. one day I woke up one morning feeling like a ton of bricks....I said in my head \"Look at the sun shine thorough my window...that can make it a better day\" So i just kinda picked up a pencil and wrote a poem about how the sun makes a bad day better, and when the clouds come in it all turns around. Since then poetry has been my escape from abuse. And whenever He makes my day feel like a death calling, I pick up my pencil and put my emotions on a page :) Poetry=my life (literately) It all I've got to live for", 11591, "None", 3],

	143709 : ["I doubt anyone can say for absolute certain when the doors of ER will swing shut once and for all, but it is known that the series has been given a commitment from NBC through the end of the 2007-2008 season, which will the season after next, and the 14th season in all. NBC has already announced that ER will return in its familiar Thursday spot - with 13 episodes running through December, at which point the time slot will be filled with a new series called The Black Donnellys, which will run into the spring. After Black Donnellys has wrapped, the remaining 9 episodes of ER will air. The two biggest things working against ER at this point are the departure of key talent, and a steady pattern of declining ratings. Goran Visnjic, who, it could be argued, is the show's top current draw, is only under contract through next season, and it's unclear whether he'll return beyond that point. Noah Wyle will return in a part-time, occasional cameo role again next season, but is not signed beyond that. For the season that just concluded this past spring, ER had slipped to the 30th most watched series on network television, with viewership numbers declining more than 20% over the prior season. Canceled programs, like ABC's \"Commander In Chief\", finished ahead of ER this season. As you noted, the longer a show sticks around, the more it costs to produce each episode - primarily because the cost of the talent increases year over year. I would consider it extremely unlikely, absent some huge surge in viewership this coming year or next, that ER would be renewed beyond the 2007-2008 season. Then again, as a long-time viewer, I think the argument could well have been made that ER should have wrapped up production somewhere around the time that Mark Greene died, in season 8.", 11603, "AA10176626", 1],

So you see, it is really very hard to pick just one song. I could name about 30 or more.

	143725 : ["I started to like nursery rhymes because of the musical sound it made, at the age 1. Since then, I was prejudiced that poetry should be like that. Anything said without rhymes should be as it is, non-poetic, or just prose. Then, when the compositions of the classic poets became available, I drew inspiration from them. How I admired the clarity of their message and the ingenuity in saying it. I usually dabble on simple rhymes for simple folks. To be awesome and mysterious, I thought, I could do not on purpose, when I poorly said it.(lol) I wanted to challenge myself into saying those ideas within a given frame and mode. That's why I usually choose the musically metered rhyme, though not so strictly, as I am not that expert. If for anything, I write just to express: The Measure of Time If Time could ever be measured By those moments we have treasured Counting the heartbeats we can hear So fast,  by that moment you came near Faster still as faces caressed And stopped entirely as we kissed.

So slowly it grew, broke up from the ground.  An untamed rose, unlike all around.  Slowly, yet surely, it continues to bloom.  Smelling so nice, like a lovely perfume. We planted this bulb, our bond was a power.  This rose started a seed, blossomed into a flower. With you as the petals and me as the spine.  The two form one: souls intertwined.  The thorns will grow, but onward we move.  Through the tests of time, our love we shall prove.  A rosebush needs water: water to be.  You are my only, a water to me.  As this rose ages, the petals reach for the sky.  This rose shall grow on, and never shall die. After just about two years she broke up with me which led me to write my more depressing work.
