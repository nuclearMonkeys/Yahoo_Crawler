	124619 : ["I agree with the others, you have to learn to accept that there are consequences for every thing you choose to do in life. If you did this bad thing you need to accept that you did it, realise why you did it and then realise what happened because you did. Hopefully this is a big enough lesson to understand that we all have to be responsible for our own actions. YES parents can be annoying, you cant blame them for trying to keep you good and honest. Best idea is to not pester, grow up a little, act responsibly and accept you might not get to this party. By behaving and thinking differently about the situation you will understand why it is happening. We have all been there and we all learned to do it different the next time good luck hun, be safe", 10795, "fd4e22aa96fb7676303e3d5ed694c4c5aa", 2],

	124640 : ["Ok, I just passed freshman year, with a lot of friends. Don't be afraid of high school. It's more work but it's really fun and you get a lot more freedom. Take your work seriously. All grades from here on in can be seen by colleges you apply to. DON'T dress like a slut. This means no serious cleavage, and no really short mini skirts. Otherwise you'll be labeled a slut and only be looked at by the guys as meat. If you want to wear a low V-neck or a scoop neck, wear a tanktop under it! If you want to wear a short skirt, wear leggings with it! And certainly don't bare your midriff. That's a big no-no. It's probably against your school dress code anyway. If you want to make friends, be yourself, and be very comfortable and relaxed with people. Always be confident, and wear a smile on your face. When the teacher's not talking, either before or near the end of class, initiate a conversation with the person sitting next to you. Help pick up someone's dropped papers in the hallway. Smile at passersby. Always be polite to your classmates. Don't swear like a truck driver either, guys actually don't find cussing attractive, and if you do this, they'll look at you as more of a buddy than anything. Anyway, I'm a girl and I find cursing tasteless. I only do it when I'm upset. Always have high self-esteem. This doesn't mean act cocky and stick your nose in the air and take billions of facebook pictures. This means believe in yourself, like yourself, and believe others will like you. When you walk down those halls, don't strut, but certainly don't slump and drag your feet. Keep your head high and your back straight, and your shoulders back. This is good posture and it gives off the impression that you have confidence. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO: Join clubs!!! Don't be afraid to express your interests and join coloring club, or drama club, or movie-making club. Even band, which isn't really a club but is a nice place to meet people. I'd say the place I made the most friends is drama club, I've always been into drama and have made many friends backstage and on stage. Drama club is really the best place to go, since a lot of people in it are nice, friendly, unique, and fun. We drama geeks know how to party too! But safely. :) So yeah, I would say, join backstage crew, which is a great place to meet people. But really, do anything you want. Also, don't do drugs. You WILL be pressured in high school. I was pressured, but I didn't do it. It's just something that gets you off-track and ruins you, and it's illegal. I know some people who it ruined their lives. I've seen friends go down the drain. Please don't follow in their footsteps. Make your own path! If you have any questions email me! Good luck hon! xxx Cait", 10804, "a2tKmlF9aa", 0],
	124641 : ["I agree that online it's easier but I did make some friends eventually through work and school. When I first moved to another town in 7th grade I had no friends what so ever, A lot of the kids were stuck up but I found a few that weren't and I also now have plenty of friends from other places.

	124644 : ["I would actually have to go out to make day to day, actual in person friends. I like the friend on line much better, anyway.

	124645 : ["First find a way to fix whatever bad you did, make sure both of your parents understand you are very sorry and you will make it up for them/never do it again/just fix it.
