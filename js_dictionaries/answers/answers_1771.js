Neither of the aforementioned are of any import when the possibility of their existence is recognized,... but when they aren`t ego and vanity arises and you become the scapegoat for another`s unadmitted inadequacies. All in the intent of honesty is open and without guile... Why cannot it be received as such? If you are of honest intent and let others know this ...you are vulnerable... For most do not wish to confront themselves and it is a better thing to them to conceal that which they truly are and put forth a surface image.In this there is no depth, nor reality..it is superficial and easily seen for what it is..but \"they\" never want to know this...", 9504, "None", 0],
	94265 : ["What you need to do with your brother is wait until you know him and his girlfriend are having a 'very private' moment.  Burst into his room and say 'Now do you realise why you should knock before you come in' :)", 9503, "e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa", 1],
	94266 : ["Get your parents and your brother together as soon as you can to talk about this. Start with the most important stuff first; how you sliced up your leg, how treacherous it is to get in and out of your room, and how you fear for your safety if there's a fire or another emergency. Make sure they realize how much this troubles you.  Then go through the rest; -you have almost no space for your personal belongings, just because you have the biggest bedroom; -how when you go in for surgery you don't know how you're going to get in and out of your room until you heal because everything is dangerously cramped; -how you feel like you have no privacy from any of them(like just because the room is storage they feel they can go in and out as they please, even when you're using the room to change) even though you make a concentrated effort to respect their space --also make a note of how you feel you shouldn't have to explain to your brother why you need your privacy; you are a girl, he should respect that and knock first -how even your brother goes through your things with their consent!!! even though that's the only space you have to keep very personal and private items in and you aren't allowed to do the same for his room, are you? -how not all of this stuff is yours, so it isn't just \"your room, your mess\" and you shouldn't have to deal with stuff that isn't yours(you are, however, willing to deal with your own part if they are theirs) -how you can't afford to move out at the moment and want to find a solution to the problems that won't cause problems for anyone else Don't be accusatory, but make it clear that this is an issue. Then talk solutions. Make sure your parents know that you respect the fact that it's their house, not yours, and that they are in charge of it, but that you can't live in these kind of conditions safely. Tell your parents that you'd be okay with a small space if it weren't for the privacy and safety issues, and offer solutions like: -switching with your brother so you take the smallest bedroom and he takes the one with all the boxes. -moving enough of the boxes so that you can: --have enough space to easily enter and exit, without having to do an obstacle course like you do now --have more room for your things, which cannot be expected to easily fit in one square foot --allow safe entry and exit, in case of an emergency --be allowed to have a lock on your room for privacy --(consider moving them to the other rooms? that way everyone can share the burden) Don't allow them to dismiss your concerns anymore, because you can actually be in danger by trying to keep living in this dangerous environment. And if they do, find a solution to as much as you can by yourself, and if it causes problems for them, tell them you tried to find a solution that would please everyone but they refused to help. Start with getting rid of any of the mess that is yours so they can't keep saying it's \"your mess\" and find a way to block the door so people can't just come in. Also see if you can invest in a lock box to keep your brother from just sifting through your private, personal belongings at will. I'd especially make your appeal to your father, because apparently your mum supports you, but not enough to actually stand up for you. Good luck!", 9503, "i522cJaPaa", 1],
