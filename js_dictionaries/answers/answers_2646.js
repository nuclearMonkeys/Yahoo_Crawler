The Hart Dynasty really stepped they're game up this year last year they were jobbing to cryme tyme but this year they went on to bigger and better things they took on all challengers who stepped in fron of them they made me believe that they were trying to bring back the tag team division. Breakout Superstar of the Year - From the looks of things I'd have to go with Alberto Del Rio, he's definitely making an impact. It seems like he's WWE next big Hispanic star when Rey Mysterio retires in a few years. He's got great in-ring skills, his mic skills arent't bad and I think that if WWE have him feud with they're top stars like Mysterio and Christian, Alberto can be big in short time. Shocker of the Year - Nexus Invasion. Probably the best angle WWE came up with in recent years according to fans. Yes I think the Nexus invasion would probably have to be shocker of the year. Nobody expected the NXT rookies to attack Raw during the main event during Punk and Cena. They completely tore up everybody or everything around ring side. They definitely dominated Raw over the summer. Rising Star - The Miz has definitely rised up the ranks this year. I don't think nobody saw him not only become United States Champion but also one half of the Unified Tag Team Championships, holding three titles. He then went on to win the Money In the bank which in my opinion shocked alot of people. A few years ago people though that The Miz would be released or a jobber but, he's definitely proven them wrong and from the looks of things, is on his way to the top.  Match of the Year: Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania 26. The match itself was a classic bout and there were so many exciting moments that it really kept the fans on the edges of their seats until the end of the match when Undertaker pinned HBK and ended one of the greatest in ring careers of all time. This was Shawn's last match ever as a wrestler and it was a classic no doubt about it. Diva of the Year: Laycool, both Layla and Michelle have accomplished and made history this year. But to be precise I'd have to go with Michelle McCool. She's really been on a role this year, having great feuds with Mickie James and Beth Phoenix over the womens title, also the fact that she's made history yet again by becoming the first unified Diva and Women's Champion.   Superstar of the Year: Randy Orton. He's definitely been explosive this year. The face turn for him was a complete success. He's been getting huge ovations from the crowd. Whenever he steps in the ring the crowd is on there feet. He's been on a dominant role as far as this year goes. He's only 30 years old and have lots to do with his career.", 11380, "oQIvuOQfaa", 2],

	138155 : ["I can't add much to what certain people have already said. My take is that it's not ruined wrestling itself, but the way we actually watch it. However, it is still pretty simple, if you don't want to know about it, you don't read it, remember, this is not a sport, this is high impact theatre, sports entertainment, and should be treated as such. Everyone knows what happens in Hamlet, yet people will sit and watch it all their lives, it has nothing to do with results, spoilers, crap matches, internet, etc, its all about the emotion, the spectacle that is wrestling, and it is not mean't to be taken so seriously. Granted, since being involved on the 'net, it has taken some of my passion away, but I choose what to look at. So if the net affects your viewing in a negative way, choose not to allow it. In addition, the IWC has certainly had a big factor in how the average fan view's the product (whether that product be TNA, WWE, ROH, etc) today. I know I can't speak for those who have watched it for 15 - 20 years (or even more) because I've only been watching since 97'ish. But the opinions that many \"fans\" have compiled for every single factor of wrestling at the moment has caused the average fan to look into the product too much. And, because of that, we are abliged to conform to other people's opinions and therefore we are forced to like or dislike the product accordingly. Thanks to the internet, I miss exactly what others miss about wrestling, like sneaking up early to watch a taped PPV and being mad when your favourite wrestler loses, etc. Back when it was fun, who really cared about how bad a wrestler was in-ring? Does anybody remember the Rock vs. Bossman and Bull Buchanan in a Cage match? Nobody cared how bad the other two were in-ring, everyone just wanted the Rock to win 'coz he was the good boy and the odds were stacked against him. If that happened today the internet \"smarts\" will go \"-**, terrible match, I don't know why they bother\" but back when no-one cared about the actual quality of the match, everyone would shout \"YAY, ROCK WON\". It's nowhere near as fun anymore, because the fun gets drained by these people who call themselves reporters, like that Dave Meltzer, everyone gets excited about his star ratings and no matter how good a PPV can be he will pull out all the bad points and all his loyal readers will agree and start off a massive chain that will go on and on until everyone on the Internet agrees. So to answer, the IWC hasn't \"ruined wrestling\" as the actual quality of the product hasn't declined over the past 3-4 years, but our perspective on it has.", 11381, "None", 6],

If you don't want the show spoiled, then don't read spoilers. Simple. Also, idiots on message boards have no impact on the product that's put out.

	138161 : ["The Internet Wrestling Community was both a blessing and a curse. You should subscribe to WWE Classics on Demand and hear the Legends Roundtable Discussions on topics such as this. The biggest thing that ruined wrestling was the WWF/WWE destroying all the other wrestling promotions in the United States and Canada. You mentioned the 1980's, during the 1980's I read Pro Wrestling Illustrated, The Wrestler and Inside Wrestling every month and went to WWF Wrestling Shows and NWA Wrestling Shows. On television every week I saw Mid-South Wrestling/Universal Wrestling Federation, The American Wrestling Association, World Class Championship Wrestling, The National Wrestling Alliance, The World Wrestling Federation, Powerful Women of Wrestling, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling and Pro Wrestling this week, hosted by Joe Pedicino and Bonnie Blackstone. 1980's Wrestling Promotions had better storylines and better matches than the WWE has today. You cannot blame that on the Internet. You can blame it on bad writing and the refusal to create and elevate new stars. Today, I go to WWE Shows, TNA Shows, ROH Shows, Dragon Gate Shows and Independent Wrestling Shows. I guess lazy people or people who do not have the money or inclination to go to wrestling shows sit on the computer and watch matches on the Internet, but to me, there is nothing as great as a live event, and we get to see things that you cannot see or find on the internet, or you hear about second hand on the internet.", 11381, "sqfjfR3iaa", 5],

	138164 : ["Fans have become too smart, thats the real problem. When I was 12 years old, I didn't know what a heel or face or blading was. The business is exposed now. Alot of people obviously knew the in-ring workings were scripted, but noone outside the business ever knew of any of the stuff we know about today, like backstage altercations, superstars getting hired/fired, who's coming in and who's leaving ect. I am in the belief that the internet did not totally ruin wrestling, but it certianly didn't do it any good. I think today, the wrestling business has to cater to the internet in many ways because it has become such a big part of the industry, whether anyone wants to admit it or not. It's been proven that WWE and TNA can still swerve the internet at times and keep spoilers unknown, but they just have to go that extra mile and work harder to do it.

Beating him could also further build a fued with Triple H that could last a few months, with Triple H eventually prevailing. Winner: Sheamus Orton vs Dibiasie vs Rhodes  Dibiase is the WWE's chosen one. I think they are trying to make him a star, so i see this as the push he needs. Winner: Ted Dibiase Money in the Bank Christian has to win. He has been extremely misused since his return, and Money in the Bank is a 100% guaranteed main event slot in the future. Also, I can see WWE banking on a Edge vs. Christian Match. Winner: Christian Bret Hart vs Vince Bret finally gets his revenge. If Bret loses, then all of the build-up was for nothing. This is just the match that you know what the result will be. Expect to see people like Kozlov interfere to help Vince, with Bret eventually prevailing. Maybe even some interference from Hart Dynasty?  Winner: Bret Hart Cena vs Batista I could care less about this match to be honest, but this storyline would be a complete waste if John Cena wins. The fued between the two hasn't gone on long enough for there to be a happy, triumphant win for Cena. My personal choice is to have Batista retain, but knowing WWE... Super-Cena will prevail. Winner: John Cena Punk vs Rey: OMG HE SAID HAPPY BIRTHDAY! THAT MONSTER!!! Winner: Rey Mysterio Miz and Show vs Truth and Morrsion Miz and Show haven't had the title long enough. I say Showmiz will prevail in a short match... And dats da Truffffffff... o.O Winner: Big Show and Miz Edge vs Jericho SPEAR! I mean really, do i even need a reason for this? Winner: Edge Undertaker vs HBK The Main Event, the Showstopper, the Icon, the Heartbreak Kid, the Boyhood Dream, the Rocker, Mr. Wrestlemania; Shawn Michaels, Vs. The Dead Man, The Phenom, The Undertaker. Personally I want Shawn Michaels to win. Undertaker's streak has had its run, and to be honest its becoming kind of lack luster. If Shawn Michaels can't beat the streak twice, then what will make us think that future challengers can? The only way I would feel comfortable with Undertaker winning, was if he retired after as well, but this isn't about my comfort, so without further ado, who I think will win (not who I want to win) is...
