That will make him so happy he will forget all about that awkward conversation.  And it will distract your wife with something new to complain about, which is actually a good thing.  You know she will find something to whine about anyway, so you might as well steer her into a direction you can manage.", 9177, "dWVp3mMKaa", 6],

	84863 : ["My God...the boy is 12 years old...not 5! Why can't you just tell him the truth?! You need to man up and explain things to him properly before you cause more damage.

	84867 : ["They're getting desperate.  They thought they had a real winner when they started backing Obama and letting Keith Olbamaman  have a free rein to say and do anything he wanted on his ridiculous show. Now they see Obama slipping away and they're trying to make excuses. Ain't gonna work.  Never thought I'd see Pat Buchanan as the voice of reason.  He sounds downright moderate on MSNBC.

	84869 : ["I would say Obama for two reasons: 1. The differences between Obama and McCain are much greater than the differences between Clinton and McCain. 2. As Hillary herself has stated on several occassions, Obama is a great orator (she's even claimed that this is a negative for him).  Obama is an excellent debator, and I believe that in a debate he could wipe the floor with McCain. I suspect that Clinton could too, but you asked who would be better.", 9179, "9c3d57b781184db8448192ff51aafff6aa", -2],

Therefore, they need to make Dems look as positive as possible - even if it's a stinking lie - and vilify Reps as much as possible - even if it's a stinking lie. The MSM is not a news source in America, it is propaganda agency for the Democrat party.", 9177, "None", 1],
	84880 : ["I haven't heard much about the illegal campaign funds.  I doubt that the candidates handle their own campaign donations and depend on their aides to take care of that.

Rueters grabbed it too but, I can't find one US periodical who cared. Clinton found himself on the same side as Castro in the Elian Gonzales case and Adolf Reno sent in the storm troopers. Now Castro says Hillary is 'Invincible'. I'm not sure I can used to calling my buddies comrade.

Castro endorses Clinton... well, not really; he said he thought she was likely to win.  Even so, are you recommending that American citizens cast their vote based on something that FIDEL CASTRO said? Because, personally, I don't care WHO Fidel Castro wants as President of the U.S.  Why do you need a communist dictator of another country to tell you who to vote for?", 9177, "d8466323a6d9157fa7ad5f14197407f1aa", 1],
