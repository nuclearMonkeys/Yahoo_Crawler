	135627 : ["It is significant that the early pioneers in modern science were men of deep Christian faith. For Copernicus, the first astronomer of the scientific revolution, God was personally responsible for all the activity in the heavens. His radical ideas were contained in his book On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, which was published in 1543, the year of his death. The regularity he was discovering in the movements of the planets was, for him, a manifestation of the faithfulness of a loving Creator. Galileo (d. 1642) invented the hydrostatic balance and discovered the laws of dynamics from observation of falling bodies. However, he is chiefly known for his achievements in astronomy. His discovery of the four satellites of Jupiter on January 7, 1610, with the aid of the newly invented telescope, revolutionised the study of astronomy. He has been called the first modern scientist and his work confirmed the observations of Copernicus. He regarded his science as illuminating the work of the Creator. For all his quarrelling with the church he remained a devout Christian until he died. Kepler, the German astronomer, a contemporary of Galileo, was also a devout Christian. His discovery of the three laws of planetary motion laid the foundation for Newton's theory of gravity. He regarded his study of the physical universe as \"thinking God's thoughts after him\". In The Secret of the Universe he wrote:  Here we are concerned with the book of nature, so greatly celebrated in sacred writings. It is in this that Paul proposes to the Gentiles that they should contemplate God like the Sun in water or in a mirror. Why then as Christians should we take any less delight in its contemplation, since it is for us with true worship to honor God, to venerate him, to wonder at him? The more rightly we understand the nature and scope of what our God has founded, the more devoted the spirit in which that is done.  The baton of scientific leadership passed in the next generation to Newton, born in the year of Galileo's death. Though he had problems with the Christian view of the Trinity, he was a strong believer. As a member of the Anglican Church he was involved in distribution of Bibles to the poor and the construction of new churches. He actually wrote more than a million words on the Bible and theological topics, more than he wrote on science. His well-worn Bible, with marginal notes in his own handwriting, is in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He became the foremost mathematician in Europe. He published Principia mathematica in 1667, \"a book that transformed the course of western science\". His work gave new direction to optics, mechanics and celestial dynamics. His work on gravity established the Cambridge reputation for mathematics. His studies of light produced the first reflecting telescope. His invention of calculus gave science the mathematical tool it needed for further exploration of the trails he blazed.", 11291, "AA11232725", 2],

	135648 : ["Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determines the goal, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up. But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding. This source of feeling, however, springs from the sphere of religion. To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational, that is, comprehensible to reason. I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith. The situation may be expressed by an image: science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.  - Albert Einstein", 11291, "MgBrUZxiaa", 0],

I was Avon rep. and researching examining and studying with a group if Avon rep. about expired cosemtics , we found out that there is more to things such as toys, computer, hair products, perfumes, everythings given.  Hair gel- Notice on the first day it looks pretty shiny with white gel in a container? Later it getting brown looking like moldy? Anyway it is a sign of it is old already it needs be thrown away. I would say it only lasts about 10 to a year depending on what kind is ingredients for examples if it has sls, mineral oil then it may get old faster. If it is by bathroom it may get older sooner because bathroom is always the warm place that gel cant hold up well. You may notice that smelling of it has change? It comes from Bathroom  Anyway it is same as perfume can't stay in warm place at bathroom or its smelling will change rather than its orginial. It might smell like bathroom only in 5 weeks or smell lacking. It is an explame of how hair gel works It has to be stored in dry cool place and tightly HTH", 11297, "BXieskdjaa", 0],
