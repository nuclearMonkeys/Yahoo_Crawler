	41040 : ["2020 was peak for NASCAR in my opinion and I'll say the same for IRL and every other series that managed to continue. Living alone during lockdown ain't been fantastic. However having the racing events on a Sunday gave me something to watch. Used to have a group chat on hangouts with my pals where we watch the races with a few beers and a laugh. It kept us relatively sane during that period. For that they deserve all the credit. I've always watched NASCAR, but during lockdown it gained a few more fans due to it simply being on", 5991, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	41044 : ["You mean in that race where all the cars have the same body? I don't care about NASCAR. I mean it, sports has the worst commissioners ever!  Like it's a syndrome. Find a Leftist who will stink up a sport, then put him in charge.  Maybe NASCAR, the NFL, and NBA think they don't need to be American anymore. ", 5992, "ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa", -1],

	41055 : ["If this were a second marriage for the two of you, and his net worth is significantly greater than yours now, a prenup may be reasonable for some people. For a young couple and a first marriage?  In my view, suggesting a prenuptial agreement is a screaming red flag from someone avoiding commitment and responsibility.", 5987, "RKD60nJnaa", 1],
	41056 : ["You can negotiate what you get out of it if the marriage comes to an end. For example, you can ask for how much your alimony will be based on how many kids you have, have many months you didn't work because you spend taking care of them, etc.  It's like a baseball contract where bonuses kick in for accomplishing certain goals.  A prenup is supposed to make a divorce less messy. It's supposed to save you attorney fees since it's a contract so there's no need to spend all that time and money in litigation.  It could also work against him.  Imagine if you're the guy that married debbi fields and made her signed a prenup.

	41061 : ["The driver can make the difference. Most racing there are at least 2 cars that are the same. In F1 every team theoretically has the same car. The difference between their finishing position is down to the skill of the driver. In F1 the only real measuring stick of a driver is their teammate. So this season we know Lewis is clearly better than Bottas, Max is better than Albon, Perez ahead of stroll etc. In Rally you have more drivers in the same car, so you judge against more drivers.", 6002, "TdmTjKt8aa", 1],

Later - Toto has now said whatever Russell does in place of Hamilton will NOT affect what might or might not happen between their current two drivers.   And especially not Hamilton's contract negotiations.", 6004, "iNsBFkZ3aa", 1],
