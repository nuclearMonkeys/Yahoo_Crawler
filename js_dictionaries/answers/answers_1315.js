If this were Diamond or Pearl, where your choice of Fire types is either Chimchar or Ponyta, I'd say go with Chimchar, BUT Platinum offers a few more Fires, like Houndour and Magmar (I think Houndour is the better one due to STAB Fire and Dark moves), so you can take Turtwig in safety and just pick up another Fire type later.", 8619, "nFCat62Jaa", -1],

	71347 : ["the Nintendo 3DS is a great handheld system. The 3D is simply amazing and it will blow your mind away. I played it with the 3D depth slider all the way up. Yes, sometimes things pop off the screen at you and the graphics are way better than previous DS systems. I played it for about 2 hours and I didn't get any kind of headache so I guess it depends on the person using it. I do admit, however, that the first minute you see the 3D you feel a little \"fuzzy\" inside your head but that's only because your brain is adjusting to the 3D, but it's no big deal at all. There are also lots of features hidden in the system and more to come.", 8614, "None", 2],
	71348 : ["I owned a PSP and sold it for a 3DS; enough said. I traded in my DS Lite to get a PSP, because of the Final Fantasy games for it. Well, a year past, and I learned these things. 1. Cheaply made.  The system has many problems, and the idiot who designed it, did a poor job. The thing is extremely loud. Discs, hah, funny. And, the screen has a protective plastic layer over it. With a convenient space in between them which is not sealed. And, as the system is covered in places for dirt and dust to enter, the space filled with dust. 2. The firmware Compared to the DS it seemed nice and easy to use. It has many bugs, even now. For example, I had a 3000. I plugged the official AV cables into it, so I could play on my tv, then I went to change the display. It asked \"Please plug in your AV cables\"........they already were plugged in. 3. The games Overall there are some gems, but the 3DS has more, even with its limited library. 4. Customer Serivce My Wireless switch kept giving me an error code, saying call it in. So, I did. I waited 45mins to be redirected, then 2 hours. The guy answered the phone. I explained my problem and gave him the error code. He said, \"I do not know what that error code is.\" YOU PEOPLE PROGRAMMED IT!!!!!!! So, he said if I pay for a new system they will send me a new one \"free shipping.\" I got frustrated and hung up. Yeah, who will I go with, Nintendo. I had only a few minor problems like the L + R buttons breaking. I call, and am talking to someone within 5mins. They pay for the whole thing and I get it back in a week. For the 3DS, it is worth the money, unlike SONY's clunky paperweight. I can imagine that the PSVita will have the same drawing appeal as the PSP had to the DS. But, like a used car, you can not tell how good it is until you drive it for a period of time. Knowing SONY, the Firmware will probably be good looking, but horrible. The casing will look shiny and nice, but it will have clear problems. And, the customer service will get worse. EDIT: Forgot this. The games may look nicer, but as they are on a disc, the take a LONG time, compared to the DS's flash memory which is almost instant. And, the discs are really loud. Let's just say, if you get one, do not go to a library to play it. You will get some looks.", 8614, "8AnG5Pguaa", 0],

	71354 : ["The game you have described was originally called Reversi, and was invented over 120 years ago by an Englishman named Lewis Waterman. The German board game company Ravensburger mass marketed it near the close of the 19th century. A Japanese game company standardized the rules and renamed the game Othello in the 1970s. The name \"Othello\" refers to a Shakespearean play in which the antagonist describes himself as \"two-faced.\" In this play, the character Othello is black, while Desdemona is white. The green board can be likened to the green field upon which Othello wages battle. The American board game company Pressman began producing this game in mass quantities in the United States. Therefore, both of these answers, Reversi and Othello, are correct. - LJS", 8618, "None", 0],

	71358 : ["I really hate bashing or defining my life about being all about one thing or another. It is really pointless and time is precious and should be valued. Having just written that, I will go straight to the point. There is a saying that states \"you get what you pay for\" and from what I can interpret from that is that if you give some business like Sony money, they are going to manufacture something for you. If you give them 150 dollars, you are going to get a PSP. If you give them +$1,000 USD, you are going to get a high quality LED TV with 3D.  In this day and age, what about if you pay $250 for a handheld made by Sony? The answer is technology and brand like Uncharted, Killzone and even new IP like Gravity Daze and, Escape Plan. Multimedia player on an OLED display. Etc etc. So, I think the best lesson I can give to you is one about value. \"Fun\" is kind of a vague concept to live by because once you learn about the value of something you can than go on an appreciate that while still having fun and enjoying your time.

How can I forget Snorlax...If you want a hearty meal and those with a good appetite must surely order for Roasted Snorlax meat...haha!!  Now on to your question! <^_^<) 1)Why do Pokemon always fant in battle and get injured, but none of them actually die?  [â]Even I always wonder about that!! Don't know the answer either..They never seem to die..But I know one thing, Pokemon age and they die when they grow old... 2)How come there are Ghost-type pokemon like Gastly, haunter, Gengar, Banette, Dusclops, Drifblim, Spiritomb etc. but Pokemon never actually die, dont Pokemon actually need to die first to become Ghost-Pokemon?  [â]Good thinking!! I never thought of that! Hm...And even if Pokemon did die.... they look nothing like the other pokemon...What I mean is, Suppose Pikachu dies, then does that mean, his ghost would turn to Gastly?

You can LOWER the VOLUME of 3D so it does NOT give you headaches for the first time in your life (if you're the kind of person to ever get headaches from 3D, otherwise just turn the 3D all the way up).   And you can also turn the 3D OFF Completely.   And 3D is good for working out your eye muscles & brain to keep them in shape as shown in this link:     And the Nintendo 3DS has downloadable 3D Music videos from today's American music artist which I have already downloaded the 3 free 3D Music Videos to watch anywhere and the 3DS has 3D \"Blue Man Group\" video and College Humor (in 3D) with the FREE \"Nintendo Video\" App that you can download (but its 4 3D Videos at a time and they replace them once in a while) and you can download cheap downloadable 3D Apps & 3D games costing from 99 cents to $5.99 and the Nintendo 3DS also has FREE downloadable 3D Apps & 3D Games, which I have already downloaded 3 Free 3D Apps and I have downloaded 2 Free 3D Games and the 3DS has a 3D Camera and I have already used the 3DS 3D Camera to take 3D photos and I have uploaded some of my 3D footage online using the Nintendo 3DS's Web Browser to upload my 3D footage online and I have used my 3DS Web Browser to also download other peoples 3D footage from the Internet on my 3DS Web Browser and I have view all sorts of 3D content on 3D Websites online on my 3DS's Web Browser and I have use my 3DS 3D Camera to play 3D Augmented Reality games as well and it's all in 3D without the Glasses using the 3DS 3D Camera and It has beautiful 3D HD graphics that equal to that of a 3D HD version of Wii Graphics and I have Streamed 3D Videos Online on my 3DS in the eShop and I have also Watch 3D Trailers for upcoming 3D movies coming to Theaters in 3D and I have done all of this in 3D Without the Glasses.   So you can pay $169 for a Nintendo 3DS and buy the greatest Games ever & all in 3D Without the Glasses like Cave Story 3D and Kid Icarus and Super Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart 7 using the MOTION SENSORS to play the game like if you were turning a real wheel to turn the Kart left & right and also play such other 8 GB 3D Games like TheatRhytem Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts 3D and Crush 3D and Shinobi and Animal Crossing and Rodea the Sky Soldier and Michael Jackson: the Experience 3D and Ridge Racer 3D and Super Street Fighter 4 3D and Monster Hunter 4 and Golden Sun 4 and Star Fox 3D and Zelda 3D and Sonic Generations 3D and Tetris 3D and Resident Evil: Revelations and Tekken 3D which also has the 3D Movie Tekken the Movie 3D in it to watch and also play other 8 GB 3D HD games as Spider Man 3D and 100% of the 3DS games are in HD 3D Without the Glasses. Also, the screen is perfectly fine, in terms of resolution. Anyway, it's the pixel density that matters, not the actual number of pixels. The 3DS pixel density is MUCH sharper than an average HD TV of, for example, 32 inches. It's perfectly fine. Not everything has to be 1080p you know. Since 1080p at 32 inches is worse than just 240p on the 3DS. And they're making Angry Birds 3D as a downloadable game.   And the 3DS has DLC (Downloadable Content) like Xbox Live for a bunch of 3DS games to add content to the game cartridge later on.   And 1 of the Free 3D Apps I have downloaded was Netflix.   And Netflix is getting 3D Movies in the next few months, so for $169 you can watch 3D movies on the free Netflix App on the 3DS in 3D Without the Glasses.   And 100% of the people who have said that they get headaches from 3D, have said that after up to 1 to 2 weeks of using the 3DS they NO LONGER get headaches anymore and that they now play with the 3D all the way up 100% all the time, non-stop.   But I have never had any problem with the 3D at all, but each person has a different experience with the 3D ON during the first week. And you can now pay to download Permanent 3D & 2D Videos on the 3DS. And the 3DS is getting Hulu Plus before the end of this year (2011) as a Free downloadable App and Hulu already has 3D Content. and you can check this Link below for more 3DS Games:     P.S. You will want to check these sites out for the Web Browser's 3D ability:           And the 3DS is getting a Wi-Fi Update this MONTH to RECORD 3D Videos and upload it to YouTube and all of this in the 3DS this Month by hooking your 3DS up to a Wireless Internet Connection like Wi-Fi or your own Home Internet or the Library and so fort during this Month as shown in this Link.", 8614, "9XPeFQBlaa", -1],
