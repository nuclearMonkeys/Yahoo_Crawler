Following the dual American successes of the first crewed lunar orbit on 24-25 December 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1 failures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end.", 7909, "HhZT5dqFaa", -1],

All of the suggestions so far are excellent, and even if you only implement a few of them, you'll continue to make a huge impact. I have only two suggestions.  Number one: keep doing what you are doing.  Like I said, the changes that you have already made go a long way.  But your willingness to do more, to investigate other options, and be open to suggestion will grant you the ability to make a much larger impact. My other suggestion, and this is the key to REALLY making a difference, is to do what these Yahoo Answerers are doing:  TELL OTHERS about the changes you have made, and ENCOURAGE THEM to make some changes of their own.

No one candidate is perfect; therefore, you have to consider the party as a whole, which is why I always vote straight party ticket.
