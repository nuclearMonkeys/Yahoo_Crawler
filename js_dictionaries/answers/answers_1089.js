Just put your big girl panties on and do it :D I waited til I was 30 to get my snakebites because I was all squeamish about needles and I soooo wish I had done it a long time ago! Another thing, better to go with rings than flatbacks. For the posts, since they are flat on the inside, they pierce from the inside out, then they have to go slower to make sure it comes out in the right place. With the rings, they go from outside in, which is a lot faster and easier ;) And DO follow the aftercare instructions! It's more painful when it gets infected :(", 8063, "dDuItUZfaa", 1],
	59938 : ["I guess it depends on the person and there tolerance...but I have a hard time believing all these people who claim it didn't hurt, lol. I have a monroe, which is probably pain wise the same as a lip, and I have had my nose done in the past, and I must say that the nose hurt worse...The needle actually going through the lips hurts, it's kind of unavoidably, but after the jewelry is in and its done, then it doesn't hurt at all...the nose however hurt way more! Take two of your fingers and then pinch your lip, then pinch your nose...the nose hurts more....but it is pretty much the same with the lip, once the actual piercing is over and the ring or stud is in, then it's nothing....but don't let anyone tell you it doesn't hurt, no matter how good you are with pain it's a piece of metal piercing your body, it is going to hurt...", 8063, "None", 1],
	59939 : ["It didn't hurt much. I recently got my tongue double pierced (venoms) and the piercing itself was maybe an 7 for 1-2 seconds while the needle was going through, then really felt like nothing for the rest of the day. One of my easier piercings, and mine was even trickier because they were each through the muscles of the tongue, as opposed to between the muscles like a central tongue piercing would be. The part I wasn't prepared for was the swelling and the pain in the days to come. Like I said, I had two piercings done in a row, so it was much worse that if I had only gotten one center piercing. Days 2-6 were miserable. My tongue was so swollen and I couldn't eat anything but icy drinks from Sonic for that whole time. Day 7-9 my tongue went back down to normal size, it feels much better and I'm just waiting it get my shorter bars in this week. But like I said, I got the venoms, so healing just one central tongue piercing would probably take 2-3 days instead of 6-7 days. But I bet the healing will be worse than the actual piercing, but so you're prepared! Eat lots of ice cream and milkshakes, it makes your tongue swelling go down and it tastes yum :) In sum: Peircing pain is about an 8 for two seconds, then you're fine the rest of the day. Peircing healing pain is about a constant 6 for a few days (how long depends on how many you get) Then when you get through that, you're home free! No more pain.", 8063, "5CRdU9iTaa", 0],

	59941 : ["They don't, and you are generalizing. There are some who operate like this, but not the majority. RC are more likely to mindlessly go through mass without much interest, due to rote ceremony and prayers. The Protestants are more likely to actively participate and interact with the pastor during the service. Home churches and cell groups are even better.", 8060, "AA10198840", -4],
	59942 : ["Well, it is not my opinion that counts.  It is God's.  According to the Bible, which is the Word of God, in order to be saved, one must be a Christian.  In order to be a Christian, one must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, sent to earth as a man to pay the penalty for the sins of mankind, through His death on the cross, even though He Himself was perfect and had committed no sin.  One must believe that Christ rose again from the dead on the 3rd day and that He dwells with God in Heaven, and that if we believe in Him and accept Him into our hearts, we can have eternal life in Heaven after we die.   Obviously the man on the cross next to Jesus did not have enough time in his life to live a life pleasing to God in his relationship with Christ.  He accepted Christ as his Lord and Saviour just moments before he died.  So it is not so much having the type of relationship with Christ wherein one grows in their Christian walk that is of importance here, but rather the belief that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for our sins, that He was resurrected from the dead and then to ask Him to forgive us from our sins and accept that forgiveness that counts with God. As to what makes someone a \"true\" Christian, that again is not for me or anyone to say, for only God can judge what is in our hearts.  Still, the Bible does say that we will be judged by the fruits of our spirit.  In other words, if we call ourselves a Christian but do not act like one, or if we bring dishonor to the name of Christ through our actions or if we turn others away from God rather than to Him through the way that we act, then we are not behaving as true Christians should behave.  God alone will judge us, and we will surely be judged for how we conduct ourselves as Christians.  The fact that we are guaranteed a place in Heaven by our acceptance of Christ into our hearts does not excuse us when we sin against God by hurting others in the name of Christ.  We ought to be the best example to others, a light in the darkness if you will, that we can be.  We ought to look to the life of Christ on this earth as an example of how we should conduct ourselves, for He set the example for us.   As for what denomination I am, I am a non-denominational, Protestant Christian.  I was raised in the Southern Baptist and traditional Baptist churches.  As an adult I attended Nazarene, Baptist, Assembly of God and Methodist churches, as well as non-denominational Protestant Churches (the majority of which patterned themselves after Baptist teachings).   As for who I consider to be saved Christians, I consider anyone who recognizes Jesus Christ for who He is, asks for His forgiveness for their sin and accepts Him into their hearts as their Lord and Saviour, to be saved.  As for if they were sincere in their asking and acceptance, and if their life bears the fruit of being a follower of Christ, that is for God to decide - not me.  I can only say how someone appears to be, and with some people, their fruit appears to be rotten, while others appear to have the sweetest and most abundant fruit.", 8060, "ZuzSUymFaa", 0],

Then I saw the real ending ( movie ) and was like *insert emotion here* ( not spoiling anything )  So yeah, I really liked Full Metal Alchemist and thought it was pretty complete on it's own.

They should have just left the anime alone =/ To Boo00ooo: Those \"Dumb fckers\" were asked to change the plot by Arakawa, the manga-ka for FMA, because the manga wasn't far enough in the manga for a real plot.

	59956 : ["This is something that we can't fight. Every group whether it be religious, political, etc. will have its ups and downs; and people who focus entirely on the downs. We do the same to christians very often, as we accuse them of being ignorant, arrogant, blah blah blah, all the time. Not all christians are the same; not all Wiccans are the same. Like christians, wiccans are going to have our bad eggs who go out and spread the wrong message, who are just as ignorant as the ones they accuse.  There is also the problem with magick. There is a lot of fuss on whether  magick is good, evil, neutral, or both. Many wiccans say that magick is not evil and that we would never do anything to harm anyone (It's in our rede, and the problem we are discussing), so those wiccans go all out and try to make this a concrete fact. This isn't necessarily true, as many wiccans have casted hexes,binding spells, and there ARE magickal systems that call on demons (Goetia). That being said, other pagans and witches don't like the way wiccans think, because they feel that since our rede says we harm none, we are just a bunch of \"brainless little fluffballs\"\"who focus solely on doing good. The only way to fix this, in my opinion, is to educate everyone and show them that we aren't who they think we are, but that is impossible. For now, we should just sit back and laugh at them.

	59957 : ["I know this is to Fellow Wiccans, but I felt I should reply.  Is there any truth to it?  Yes and No.  Wicca has become a place for a lot of different people.  The problem is, it's drawing in people who have no clue what Wicca is really about, put on aires for others and promote a horribly bad image of the religion itself - hence the fluffballs comment.  That's not to say that the other Pagan Traditions don't have their fluffballs.... we ALL do.  And yes, there are plenty out there who give other people the impression that we all have wands and brooms and we act like little idiots in the woods, prancing around a bonfire and giggling like little school girls.  Other Wiccans have given this image to us.... and it's a shame, because most of the Wiccans I have come in contact with don't act like that at all....  I see it mostly online... and mostly by misguided teenagers who may or may not be going thru some phase in their life... teenage angst, rebellion against religion and/or parents...  That is what the public sees.  Very few outsiders ever talk to the Elders of the religion... and that's where you will find out the more serious side to it.
