This summer i worked at a preschool camp and the children loved this treat and truly enjoyed making it.  you need toothpicks, jumbo marshmellows,2  bowls, chocolate syrup, and rice crispy treat cereal. You put rice crispy treat cereal in a bowl and chocolate syrup in the other bowl. have the children take a jumbo marshmellow and put a toothpick halfway through it (like if you were going to roast it.) Then have them take the marshmellow by holding the toothpick and rub choclate syrup all over it by putting it in the bowl and moving it around.  Right after that put the chocolate marshmellow in the rice crispy treat bowl and move the toothpick around so that the cereal sticks. Set out on a plate and leave for about 25 minutes, the chocolate will harden and you will then have a delicous chocolatey snak.
