	133165 : ["\"Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying\" from Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of the best quotes. One of my favorite scenes from one of my favorite movies is from \"A Time to Kill\" Background: In a racially divided city in Missisippi, a 10-year old black girl is raped by two redneck men. When they are set to come for a hearing, the little black girl's father pops out of a janitor's closet in the courtroom and blows them away, accidentally injuring a cop in the process. THe cop loses his leg.  Now the black father is on trial for murdering the two rednecks Favorite scene: The prosecution thinks the lame cop will make a stellar witness to incite rage in the jury against the father, and prove who was the shooter. THe cop limps to the front on crutches and one leg, and the prosecution asks him to correctly identify the shooter, which he does. Meanwhile, the father asks his attourney to ask the cop if he should go to jail. THe attourney is hesitant, it's the prosecution's star witness afterall, but the defendant insists.  The defense attourney goes in front and askes the cop if he thinks the father (defendant) meant to shoot him. The cop says no, it was an accident. Then he asks if the cop thinks the defendant shold go to jail.  The cop says \"No. He did what I would have done.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I got a little girl...somebody rapes her, hes a dead dog, I don't care, I'll blow him down just like that man did. He's a hero... you turn him loose!!\" So the prosecution's \"Star witness\" starts yelling at the jury to turn the guy who shot his leg off lose!!
