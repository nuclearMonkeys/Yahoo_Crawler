	33509 : ["I don't know if it's a conspiracy or not-but it certainly drives down Watson's trade value. I am sure the Texans will be very willing to help him redeem himself in Houston!", 5091, "e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa", 0],

	33515 : ["He put up big numbers in a pass-heavy scheme, the same as Mahomes.  Being great in college has never been an indicator of greatness in the NFL. What do you mean he didn't get a shot?  He was signed by 2 different NFL teams.  He was cut both times.  He had his shot, the talent wasn't there, and he moved on to a different career.  But you've seen some college ball on TV, so you're definitely a better evaluator of what a player is capable of than the guys who watched him at practice every day.", 5107, "oZkGVsMDaa", 0],
	33516 : ["Shut up dunny... U actual give ursel away with the spaced comma.. That's actually quite annoying almost as bad as Dan's *a* in front of vowels rather than *an*.. I wish rangers would fk off down to England and take their fans with them... We ain't no needing loyalists in Scotland  And u are delusional to think that rangers would ever be bigger than any of the prem teams.. Maybe make it into top of league 2 if lucky ", 5108, "TFF5DuXGaa", 1],
	33517 : ["Yes But they aren't the biggest club in SCOTLAND. Celtic have played in a World Club Championship Final (lost after a 3rd game ; when they could've won on the Away Goals rule) ; won a European Cup and lost another final aet. Rangers have a defunct Cup Winners' Cup (although Celtic beat them in that Scottish Cup Final, to do the double) ; but they were annihilated 4-12 on agg. in their ONLY European Cup semifinal by Eintracht Francfort - who've never won the trophy. The Germans were in turn thrashed by Real Madrid 7-3 at Hampden. HAD Rangers made it, Real would've won by at least 11 - the number of Intercontinental/World Club Championships that separate the two teams -; and it would have been Hampden Park's and Scottish football's biggest-ever humiliation Celtic also have the most SPLs (22) - the teams play each other up to 4 times ; twice as difficult as the ole Div 1 - and the most second spots. The most Scottish Cups (40) and the most finals. Even Celtic's SECOND SPOTS - see above - are better than Rangers' Rangers're living in the past : counting a defunct trophy, easier Div 1s and inferior League Cups. QUALITY AND quantity beats quantity ! The closest Rangers'll GET to Real Madrid - they were thrashed 0-7 on agg. in their only European encounter - is indeed an unofficial and unimportant gala match between the team with the most trophies and the team with the best trophies  ", 5108, "2ifr1sIRaa", 2],
	33518 : ["It depends on how you judge size. Fanbase, yeah sure. Commercial wealth, hell no. Quality of team? No. I think the big club argument is only used by fans who are envious of other clubs. Being a big club is irrelevant if you are successful.", 5108, "TdmTjKt8aa", 2],
	33519 : ["Every season a new era of rules and players come in to play,, can't call anyone a goat, passing is done more today than ever because of rules,, can't hit the QB anymore leaving them more time to throw and easier to do it.. just because someone won many super bowls means nothing, team sport and he was lucky he played on good teams..", 5109, "None", 0],

	33527 : ["That all depends on how sour this situation with Watson becomes. There are now over 16 women who are making allegations of sexual assault. The fact that the number has risen to that much, it is definitely an unsavory situation for both Watson and the Texans. The Houston Texans were never going to trade Watson willingly, because for one, he's a top 5 QB. Despite the record of the team and the missing pieces of the offense last year, Watson played well enough to conjure up decent stats.  However, statistics aside, even if the Texans were to trade DeShaun, they would end up losing in the end because it would be a rebuild of the team at the offensive level. What QB would they have if they removed Watson only to get another less than average or average at best player? Watson is the type of QB that is difficult to find and to even draft. By him remaining, at the very least the Texans have the leverage to force him to play by making him sit out while he waits for his contract to end in a few years. As far as other teams, while they might want him based on talent, the PR nightmare would haunt any team that takes him if the accusations against him are true, or they continue to mount. ", 5112, "XLXncQu9aa", 3],

	33534 : ["Talk is cheap. Can you imagine how good Russia would be if those big bad Russians played American football? They would dominate the NFL. Right?", 5102, "SFbhubsiaa", 0],
	33535 : ["They would have won 1 by now but i doubt they'd dominate. Part of this is the American attitude. For some reason the English speaking countries never learn from others. England stuck to 4-4-2 for a long time when the rest of the world had moved on. America to be the best consistently would have to learn from other countries. You need to evolve and adapt. I think much like England tried to stick to the english way and have won nothing since 66, i fear the Americans would constantly try to do it the American way... Edit - U Bin Called, in football the top players still play international football. Unlike basketball, winning a world cup is arguably the biggest prize in the sport.", 5102, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	33545 : ["It's possible.  That sort of thing DOES happen.  And not always for money.  Recall the Duke Lacrosse situation.  That woman simply MADE UP her accusations and never had any comprehensible motive for doing so beyond that she was cray-cray.  And the Prosecutor then ran with it because he thought it would help him win an election. But it seems unlikely.  Especially when multiple women are making the accusation.  I'm of the opinion that we should all just relax and let the legal process play out and let the facts come out rather than overreacting to early news reports and sticking our flag in the ground on one side or the other when NONE OF US knows what happened or didn't happen other than Watson and those women.", 5100, "3Cd8Iq5gaa", 2],

Even if this was the reason it's not Robbie's fault. Are you supposed to keep a guy just because he's depressed? It's like the people who stay with their partner because when they try leave the partner is all like \"noo don't go I'll kill myself\" lol", 5101, "q1BX2eXuaa", -1],

	33554 : ["suck at all sports is an exaggeration when in fact you are just pi**ed off at losing a basketball game. the fact of the matter is that among many ncaa teams who perennially make the playoffs, the individual players do not always give 100 per cent because schools make millions off of the bowl/madness appearances, the only thing that can happen to a player is that he gets injured. 'Postseason is for the school' is a common excuse for giving only a half a** effort, especially if you might make the pros.
