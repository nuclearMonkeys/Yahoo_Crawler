	40983 : ["Has there ever been a particularly adored competitor that fans have stayed close by for such a long time, tensely anticipating him to win a Sprint Cup title? Not in NASCAR.  In any case, in the event that you look to different games, Earnhardt shares a great deal for all intents and purpose with at any rate two other enormous name competitors who were large fan top choices yet always lost a title in their particular games: Chicago Cubs Hall of Famer Ernie Banks, who never arrived at the World Series, and Miami Dolphins Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino, who always lost a Super Bowl. While there honestly have been a few surrenders from the positions of Junior fans throughout the long term—principally on the grounds that those fans became weary of seeing their driver miss the mark many more than one season—there are still millions who keep on pausing, wish, trust and petition God for him to win a Sprint Cup title. NASCAR director Brian France has even said on various events that a Junior title would be useful for NASCAR and that as Junior goes, so goes the game.", 5997, "N2CY3QPWaa", 0],

	40988 : ["Yes actually, it was among the best seasons, if for  no other reason than because the audio mix was far better.    The microphones that were being used to pick up  the ambient track sounds, and the in-car mics that were  a 'great' addition, did not drown out the rest of the broadcast.  You could actually \"hear\" every last scintilla of the commentary  from the booth and the on-track reporters back in the day.  Nowadays, I rarely watch any NASCAR event on FOX networks  because the person who is in charge of the \"final\" audio mix that  goes out over the air, should've been replaced a very long time ago. ", 5991, "Fw6ThAsPaa", 1],
	40989 : ["False. 2006 was the peak - Jimmie Johnson won his first Championship (his 2013 championship season and Austin Dillon in 2013 was the downfall of NASCAR), it was the final season with Benny Parsons as the commentator, and Kasey Kahne was NASCAR's hottest driver with six wins (one at California Speedway i remember watching)  2006 was also the year where notable current or retired drivers either tried to start their first race or competed in the ROTY in Denny Hamlin, Clint Bowyer (now retired), J.J. Yeley, Martin Truex Jr., AJ Allmendinger (did not qualify in 2006 anyways in three races), and Juan Pablo Montoya.    Only Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr. are still racing, J.J.

	40995 : ["No... There's been some good seasons recently. If you only focus on the winner then of course its boring, but then again 2000-2004 was boring in that sense, 1992 & 93 were boring etc... Last season was superb from a racing POV outside of Lewis. Every decade has had its boring bits and we often gloss over them with rose tinted glasses. 2004 was horrendous as the rest of the cars could not overtake so you had little midfield action. Same with 2002, 1992, 1988 etc... Basically what I'm saying is every decade is the same, has its good seasons and its bad.

	41004 : ["Let's lay it on the line from a man's perspective. In today's world, with family courts being hostile to men, a man considering marriage who does not consider the consequences of divorce is nothing but a fool.  Read that again because it's the truth. Women file for divorce in 70% of the cases.  College educated women getting divorced file in 90% of the cases. A man has a 50/50 chance of his marriage not falling apart.  This doesn't account for remaining in unhappy marriages and staying for the sake of the kids. A man going to court for a divorce is going to be raped by the court.  Oh, yes he is.  That's how family courts work.  Lawyers are encouraged to take as much from the man as they can and give it to the women regardless of her behavior in the marriage. She could have been caught red-handed in the very act of cheating with three different guys at once and the courts would totally overlook that.  He gets his kids taken away, loses half of his stuff he worked hard for, and has to pay an exaggerated amount each month for spousal support and child support for nearly two decades for each child.  Then the children grow up calling another man \"Daddy.\" Basically, there is absolutely nothing in it for a man to get married.  With the hostile courts, a man has to do what he can to protect himself from them.  This doesn't even begin to address the many cases where a judge has taken a properly prepared prenup, signed and agreed on by both parties, and just simply thrown it out. A marriage is a contract.  The courts view it as a legal agreement between two parties, and they already have rules in place on how they are going to proceed in the event the contract is to be terminated, and it's never in favor of the man. Dr Stephanie has already resorted to name-calling and muddying the waters by suggesting that the preemptive attempt to protect oneself in case of a hostile divorce predicts negative behavior of a man in a loving marriage.  You don't buy a new car with the attitude that it's going to be involved in a crash and totally destroyed, but you do buy insurance for it just in case. Dr Stephanie is viewing things from a woman's perspective, so her attitude is typical, and it's expected. I'll bet that not one of the men responding to this has ever gone through a divorce.  This is not an attempt to avoid commitment and responsibility.  This is an attempt to preserve some of what a man has worked for over the years and avoid it being ripped away from him to be unfairly given to a woman who has become something he did not marry. There is nothing in it for a man to marry.  In today's world, with family courts being hostile to men, a man considering marriage who does not consider the consequences of divorce is nothing but a fool.  Yes, that was very much worth typing twice. .", 5987, "5P6m4Gs4aa", 1],

However I don't think it will happen because Mercedes know the best way to win the drivers title is to back 1 driver especially if RBR get closer. Bottas is the ideal second driver.
