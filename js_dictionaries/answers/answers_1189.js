	64942 : ["Joseph's response was dead on accurate.  However, I would add one important detail he left out:  Why does Hillary not allow her college transcripts, specifically her college thesis on her adoration of Saul Alinsky, be made public domain?  The answer of course is that she is a true believer anti-American and pro-Marxist devotee who truly believes that the destruction of American Exceptionalism and the Capitalism and Free Market that created it is what she and her 'idol' Saul Alinsky not only believe but also wish to promote in her never ending obsession for absolute power at any cost.", 8285, "oNATwfvcaa", 0],

	64951 : ["WRONG Uncle Tom is a term used to refer to a black man who sides with whites in matters concerning black vs. white. It is a slanderous term mostly used by blacks against other blacks whom they view as traitors for being friendly with whites rather than to blindly side with blacks all of the time.

	64960 : ["From what I understand, there is a semi-automatic version of it, and that would probably be legal except in a couple of totally dumbo states (such as CA and MA). For the fully automatic, I would guess you'd have to go through a lot of paperwork, if you can get it at all. However, you need to ask at a couple of gun stores in your state, to confirm what I've said, or to tell you what's more accurate. P.S. I just noticed another poster has noted the name of the semi-auto version.", 8291, "None", -1],

	64971 : ["I am sure she would try to nationalize \"Big Oil\" but it thankfully won't happen.

	64980 : ["What do you care what liberals realize?  Do you think that the wealthy will flee?  Why? Where are they going to go? Other developed countries have higher taxes. Developing countries are often not as attractive to many of the wealthy.  Rather than focusing on liberals, perhaps you should examine for yourself the historical effects of the tax policies that reduce taxes on the wealthiest Americans.  If you think that trickle down works then find a way to justify it. Also note that the proposals include returning to the top tax rate under Clinton.  Were rich people fleeing the country then?", 8283, "t3QAaSN9aa", 3],

	64984 : ["Your question is false and misleading – either deliberately so or due to ignorance.

He also picked Al Gore, not George Bush.  He did pick Bush against Kerry.  But I have since heard him indicate that he picked Bush the 1st time.  I have watched his show since it's been on and he picked Al Gore to win in a very close election.", 8286, "None", -1],
	64990 : ["Personally I want Obama to win. But yes I do agree that Clinton has the best chances. First of all, she will be the first female president, second, most people think Bill Clinton was great while in office and that he will have a big effect on her actions.", 8286, "None", 1],
