If he knows any one that's willing to cut his hair for him at his home, then he should try calling them.  You can try to cut it for him, but if you have no idea how to do this, then it's probably not a good idea to do it. If he doesn't have to do any thing important that he needs to get a hair cut for, he can wait for the red zone.  I'm also in Peel region, also a gray zone. It's been more then 6 months for me since I've had a hair cut. I don't care that much since I'm trying to grow it out, but it's starting to look a bit weird. ", 6779, "I1x1vy2laa", 2],

	47865 : ["Use a wool pilot cloth, Melton, brushed wool flannel, wool duffle, or soft woven velour or wool fleece. Wool Velours is not that stretchy velvet used for sweatpants, wool velours is a softly draping wool with a softly napped surface. The costume department tried to use the fabrics that would have been used by real horsemen back in the middle ages and there are fragments of wool capes found on dead bodies from the era. Wool is soft, warm, drapes nicely over the body and looks authentic because it is authentic. The cloaks in the.movie are unlined, if you wish to line the cloak for winter a fabric called Kasha will add warmth and the smooth satin face allows the cape to glide over whatever you are wearing underneath. Wool course, wool duffle, wool pilot cloth or any medium wool coating will work. Wool Melton might be too heavy, I would look for a lighter coat fabric first. If you want the super deluxe luxury soft light warm and beautiful to work with fabric then look for a cashmere merino blend coat weight fabric. It is my favorite fabric ever and I love working with it. Again, a Kasha lining will add warmth and keep the soft fabric from sticking to your clothes.  A cloak pattern is very simple, it's usually a half circle, three quarter or full circle. Search for patterns using Google, there are hundreds out there -some free. Wool is not difficult to sew. Be sure to gently press seams with a steam iron as you work. Use a regular home sewing machine, straight stitch for seams, zig zag the cut edges. One warning, some wool coat fabrics can be expensive and others can be cheaper. It's easier to find wools on line than in stores unless you live in a large city. I buy from the fabric shops in the fabric districts in Toronto and Hamilton. If you buy on line buy from your home country, wool import and export taxes and tariffs can double and triple the price when the fabric crosses the borders. That 5$ a yard fabric from China can be 50$ a yard when it arrives at your door. Hope that helps. I loved to costumes from LOTR. The amount of research and work that went into them made them beyond perfect for every character and every scene.", 6784, "None", 1],

	47869 : ["The fashion trends of the last 20 years or so have been ghastly. The off balance look. The fluttery stuff dragging everywhere look.

	47873 : ["Forget about the celebrities as their income affords them the designer clothes that us mortals don't have that kind of money to spend. wear clothes that fit you and that are clean. It's pretty simple. Go shopping. See what is to your liking and try it on for fit. Create your own sense of style, defined by what You like. If you need some help, aska female friend to go shopping with you. It is best to buy CLASSIC clothing that is well made so it stands up to the test of time. Check the cleaning label instructions and follow them. Unless you want to iron, pay attention and buy permanent press only. Also, our clothing go through a lot of wear and tear in the washer and dryer, so zip up those zippers and if you can, dry lighter weight clothing on hangers. Sure, prices may be good in lower end department stores, but those clothes are not well made and typically are not made of good quality fabric. Buy good fitting jeans, nice slacks, upolo shirtsand buttonup shirts, a belt or two, some nice leather shoes and, of course sneakers ← in black.", 6786, "9MJS6I6Laa", 0],
