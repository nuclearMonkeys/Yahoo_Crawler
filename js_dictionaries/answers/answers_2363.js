(PC-to-PC calls might still work for you) The only work-around for this problem is for you and all your contacts there to TRY to download the US version directly from a different website, and SAVE it (not run). Downloading directly from the Yahoo website gives you a local version depending on your geographic ISP location  - no voice or video calls allowed. These governments say this is an attempt to prevent terrorists from communicating. (Iran is excellent at monitoring web traffic, and cell phone traffic as well.) Occasionally, downloads directly from the Yahoo site are incompletely installed, or uninstalled, so delete the program completely (do a Search for Files in Run ... Yahoo! Messenger) after uninstalling through the Control Panel, and delete all references in Windows Explorer. Notice the exclamation mark in 'Yahoo! Messenger' ! Once again, download and SAVE from this web site  directly and install once the registry is clean. If you also chat with friends in your own country (which is likely), have them do the same thing to enable voice and video calls. If you use Internet Explorer 8 as your browser, Yahoo Messenger 10 will not work properly without Flash and Java programs also installed, and possibly  the .NET framework update.
