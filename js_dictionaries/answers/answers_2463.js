	128992 : ["People will one day look back on that match and they will say it was a classic match. I know people hate both Triple H and John Cena but overall the match was highly entertaining. I thought it was a great match. I watched it with a bunch of friends some disagreed entirely other liked it but wouldn't call it a classic and others hated it. But the match itself had good fan reactions. I think Cena and Trips did a fine job. And mark my words in many years people will consider that one of Cena and Triple H's best performances. It will be on a best of Wrestlemania DVD and in Triple H and Cena's career ending stories. Personally though what made the match for me is Good Ol' J.R. I can still remember him yelling at the top of his lungs \"It's all on the line can The Game hold on\" that line will be remembered for along time I'm sure of it. BQ- I don't hate John Cena, but I am not a John Cena fan either. But honestly I am yet to get a good convincing argument to hear why John Cena is so awful. I can't find one and until someone convinces me to hate Cena I won't hate him. The only time I bash Cena is when I watch Raw with my nephews because it is fun to bug them and I enjoy watching them think I'm nuts for cheering for Sheamus. I don't think there is a legitimate argument out there to hate Cena. He is actually funny when he works the mic and does it with a lot of charisma and passion for wrestling. If you hate him of course you'll find him boring because you've already told yourself you hate him. The WWE gives him the belts because they know they can depend on Cena and he is so well loved by the fans. Cena has a lot of heart for the business and I do respect him for that. He isn't the cause of PG the WWE decides this stuff Cena is just the face of the company. You'd hate The Rock if he were from this Era and was the face of the company during the PG Era and had not been apart of the Attitude Era.  -- Cena haters nine times out of ten aren't willing to give him a chance. They have it built in their head to hate him so obviously everytime he picks up the mic they think he is boring. He isn't amazing in the ring. But he is decent and he is entertaining if you're willing to give him the chance.", 11006, "S0u3HKzhaa", 6],
	128993 : ["Personally, I thought it was a very good match, but definitely not a classic. In my opinion both Cena and Triple H are way overrated  but they did put on a good match. BQ: I don't dislike John Cena as a person. But as a wrestler, he has a monotone Voice and cuts terribly boring childish promos. In The ring he has about 5 moves that anyone on steroids can can do. And he buries talent by taking DDT's on the cement floor and then 2 seconds later applying the STF to Darren Young and walking out of the ring like nothing happened. He could make his matches a little more realistic. All that can be improved despite the fact that WWE is PG, so that isn't an excuse.", 11006, "XRA1vNd5aa", -2],
	128994 : ["Generally those who spew the term \"tax cuts for the rich\" or who seek to raise taxes on the rich don't understand atleast two things. (1) The bulk of taxes are already paid by the top 25% of all wage earners (86% total); the poor pay very little in taxes; (2) Taxing the rich tends to slow the economy down because it is the rich who start business which create jobs; taxing them reduces incentives to invest their money. (3) It's not just Dems who don't understand basic economics. It's not taught in schools, not required in universities, so people babble about raising the minimum wage without having any idea what it will do in the long run.", 11003, "69f94e8a67e517a047bb3fdbbf7812e8aa", 0],
	128995 : ["The Fed survived without taxing any income from 1776 until 1918.  Why would they need to tax anyone's income now?  If they tax anyone's income at all it should be a straight rate across the board no matter the level of income.  Any other system is completely unfair.  The Feds spend in security nearly equal to what is raised in the type of taxes that were collected before the income tax was established.  All the income tax does is redistribute wealth from the successful to the unsuccessful or lazy.  This is what is known as socialism.  Why do Americans sit by and let the government do this?  Socialism is an evil way of the government controlling the citizens.  It appears some do not mind the control since it fattens their wallet or puts food on their table, drugs in their pipes, etc.", 11003, "61f38035c35a18e4bbf4a28d41e6a151aa", 2],

	129003 : ["I decided to vote for Obama for several reasons:  On healthcare, his plan would cut costs whereas hers would mandate healthcare. She would enforce her plan by cutting the wages of anyone who does not accept it.  On Iraq, he has opposed it since day one and although his withdrawal plan would take longer, it seems more feasible and less damaging to US and Iraqi interests.  As for the economy and immigrations, they are more or less the same.  However, what really pulled me to Obama were the personal factors.  Hillary promised not to campaign in Florida (along with all the other democratic candidates) since the Democratic National Convention revoked that state's right to send any delegates to the National Convention since the primary was moved up ahead of schedule. However, she arrived in florida right after the primary to meet her supporters there.  She has constantly mentioned her experience, despite only being in Senate for 1 more term then Obama. She counts her marriage as political experience, which I don't feel is reasonable. She constantly talks about how ready should we be \"on day one.\" Obama brilliantly retorted, \"It's more important on day one to be right than ready.\" It also seems that Obama could be a unifying candidate who can bring people of all demographics and beliefs together.  All these factors considered, I feel that Obama is the better candidate and better person.  Hope this helped you come to a decision.", 11007, "3f19b7b0a8db95af87dd6e4722c6df2daa", 5],
