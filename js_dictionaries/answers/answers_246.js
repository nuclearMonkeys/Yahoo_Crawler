We and modern monkeys are cousins - we share a common ancestor (though one that looked much more like modern monkeys than modern humans).  Modern species don't evolve into other modern species.  As for mermaids, why would they have come about?  Evolution doesn't aim for a specific result, in this case intelligent bipedal sea breathers.  Our ancestors had no need to establish lives underwater, and it's awfully hard to evolve gills *in addition* to lungs.  Lungs, I think, came out of gills (or what became gills), so we'd have to develop a whole separate new portion of our breathing system, which is much harder to do than modifying something existing. The only way I can see us heading toward mermaids would be through genetic engineering - but you'll have to wait a few decades before that becomes anywhere near feasible.", 2046, "P8dIznazaa", 0],

	12306 : ["It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is a fact, not theory, and that what is at issue within biology are questions of details of the process and the relative importance of different mechanisms of evolution. It is a fact that the earth with liquid water, is more than 3.6 billion years old. It is a fact that cellular life has been around for at least half of that period and that organized multicellular life is at least 800 million years old. It is a fact that major life forms now on earth were not at all represented in the past. There were no birds or mammals 250 million years ago. It is a fact that major life forms of the past are no longer living. There used to be dinosaurs and Pithecanthropus, and there are none now. It is a fact that all living forms come from previous living forms. Therefore, all present forms of life arose from ancestral forms that were different. Birds arose from nonbirds and humans from nonhumans. No person who pretends to any understanding of the natural world can deny these facts any more than she or he can deny that the earth is round, rotates on its axis, and revolves around the sun. The controversies about evolution lie in the realm of the relative importance of various forces in molding evolution. - R. C.

	12312 : ["Some things you may consider that may help: -Experience: Remember that experience often helps with feeling competent in things. That is why many teenagers and young 20's have less confidence than older adults - they just don't have the experience to say, \"It is O.K.\". -Caffeine: Cut out all caffeine from your diet, and cut way back on sugary items. Caffeine can cause anxiety and irritate heart issues. -Heart palpitations: Caffeine can also cause an increase in afib. Afib is a word for palpitations of the heart. If you have skipped heart beats, racing heart, jumping heart, etc., this may be a sign of palpitations. Along with a bout of palpitations, can come anxiety because of the adrenaline the heart causes to be pumped through your body. This may be a \"chicken/egg\" question, but people with afib often find they become anxious WHEN they are experiencing palpitations. If this may be an issue for you, see your doctor, and ask to wear a \"holter monitor\" for 24 hours. -Plan it out: Think about what you are attempting to do. If you are planning something and worried about it, then try working out the details that bother you the most. Consider what you might do or say in certain circumstances so you are prepared.  -Praise yourself: If you have accomplished something that you were uncertain about, then PRAISE YOURSELF. Give yourself a pat on the back, and an \"attaboy/attagirl\". It is O.K. to tell yourself you did a good job!  -Friends: Hang out with people who are positive. Positive people have a way of uplifting us, and making us feel better about ourselves and things around us. Hang with people just to hear what they are doing and how they are doing it. This can help, too.  -Ditch the negative: If you have people who say negative things, then find someone else to hang with, or something else to do. It is too easy to copy these habits, and it is not terribly helpful. -Your skills: Determine what you are good at, and take a class, join a group, talk with others about it who also are interested in it. Learn about it and utilize your skills. -A pet: Get a pet to care for and possibly accompany you some places. No, pets can't go everywhere, but perhaps just a couple places will help. Pets are great at making us feel good, too. -Volunteer: Volunteer somewhere to help others. You might help people, animals, whatever. In doing this, you will also feel better about you.  -Self-talk: Write down good things about yourself and things you have done. You can use anything that fits, but write it down so you can look back on this and \"log\" it into your brain.  -New style: Maybe a new outfit, new hairdo, new look may help you feel better. Even if you don't have a lot of money, even second-hand stores have lots of stylish clothing.  -Baby steps: If you are worried about a certain thing, then take baby steps to accomplish it. Get out the door. Sit on the steps. Walk down the block a few houses. Tell yourself: Good job!! Next time work off this accomplishment to another step until you are where you want to be. -Book: Read the book, \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\", by Dale Carnagie.  -Speak up: If someone is putting you down, it is O.K. to speak up for yourself and tell them that does not help you. Don't argue, but then just walk away if they are not receptive. Or: \"Thank you for your opinion. But, I know I did a good job\". -Counselling: If you need counselling, then get that. If you are not certain how to begin, consider going to your general physician for a reference. -Hotlines: There are hotlines for suicide and depression. Look these up if you feel you are not doing well.  -Call a friend: Just call a friend and talk. Friends help one another by just being there. Just talking can help us feel better.  RGIS Inventory is a worldwide company that hires people to do inventories. They hire for both days and nights. But, be sure you TELL THEM what your schedule should be: \"I am available these days. Not those days\". Stick to it.", 2033, "p7ZdohGTaa", 4],

These two get confused pretty often; basically, when you're envious you'd like to have something another person has, whereas being jealous means you do NOT want another person to have what you have. The concepts are related but not the same. Anyway, I'm not here to lecture you on word meanings but it seems that you resent your friend having overtaken you. The solution, if such a petty thing (I'm sorry to be so frank but that's what it is) bothers you, is to also read those books and novellas that your friend has read - and then some more, so you'll be ahead of it again. Another, more healthy alternative (if you ask me), is to try looking at the situation with a more mature view. You have no exclusive rights to read these books (as you very well know yourself) but now that your friend has acquired a liking to that writer, you now share that passion with your friend, which should be a unifying rather than a divisive thing.

	12344 : ["Movements are made up of people.  PEOPLE do things, and there have been some just amazingly distasteful actions that the entire movement gets tarred with. The video of the woman pushing a guy off a short cliff claiming he sexually assaulted her, trying to make it a feminist issue, totally unaware that she was being video'd.  There was Sarah Silverman claiming that she had received less pay than her male counter parts for her few jobs and then having to retract that when reporters actually talked to her former employers and they checked the records. That kind of thing can't help but make all feminist action a tad suspect. And then there are the big broad actions like threatening OXFAM with defunding if they supported male victims of sexual violence in the Congo, but it was acceptable to fund female victims. Or continuing to push for female driven programs in schools where more women are graduating than men. But laws? In the US, it's been awhile but there have certainly been actions by feminists trying to make the assumption of custody female with male financial support.  I guess the most recently blatantly sexist move (2 years ago) was the successful installment of a California law that requires at least one woman on each major California corporation, but no such requirement for men. The thing is, that's not really the way that feminist sexism rears its head.  VAWA (with the exception of the name) is actually pretty gender neutral but the implementation, where the money goes, is incredibly sexist.  Feminists will eagerly support battered women's shelters but claim every dollar that goes to battered men should be going to women - resulting in there being literally no battered victim shelter available in Canada.  Built into the law?  No, but the effect is the same. And of course, the legal system is incredibly sexist, continually finding women less culpable for their actions or punishing them less harshly for the same actions, given the same crimes under the same circumstances. It's not the law, it's the judges, it's the juries. How is that feminists' fault?  They have continually pushed the concept that women are almost always the victim and men are almost always the perpetrator - and they have pushed it so hard that it permeates most (American) media, the court systems, the school systems, etc. Reality is that in domestic violence cases, women are as or more likely to instigate the violence than men, but we STILL get this kind of thing: Feminists will claim they are actually fighting against that kind of thing, but they are the same people who tried to excuse the well known actions of Wanetta Gibson (false rape accuser) as \"insane\" rather than fully culpable. Feminists are people.  There cause is tainted by their actions. Consequently, since I believe in pushing for equality of the sexes (races and creeds), I not only do not use the title \"feminist\" (though I used to), but urge others not to.", 2056, "8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa", 0],

Society as a whole benefits when more women work and fewer get taxpayer funded welfare. It's to everyone's benefit that unwanted children aren't being pumped out into the world because women can't access birth control. Given that fewer men than ever can afford a stay-at-home spouse it's good for men too when affordable childcare is available, because that means his female partner can work and contribute to the bills. It's only if one frames these things as only benefiting women that the disconnect comes in.
