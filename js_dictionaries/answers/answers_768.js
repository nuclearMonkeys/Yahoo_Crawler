	42660 : ["Criticism can be extremely ruthless & hurtful when there's truth to it. Abject poverty in a Rich State is inexcusable even for one who may hide behind special privilege of a protected class. The congress man put his state & districts interest in the back burner over his own, and will even spread lies to promote himself. Bernie Sanders stated in 2016 that \"Baltimore is like a 3rd world country\". The Baltimore sun published Trump was right, \"Declare Baltimore a Disaster, rebuild it\". Now, if the elected representatives truly cared about their city & states then they should've made these issues their priority, but instead these issues were ignored for many decades, & simply got worst. If Baltimore was a business company, those ruining the city will be fired for failing at their duties. The voters should open their eyes with these elected politicians who's only duties in office seems to be to enrich themselves by simply filling in seats & self promoting themselves. Blue states socialist policies pushes the poor out of homes into the street. Despite all their virtue signaling. (D) have a great ability of making things worst than solving problems. Ignoring the problem & encouraging it to grow will always end in the worst outcome, which was the case with the Border Crisis, Crime, drug addiction, poverty in Baltimore/West Coast Cities & water bombing cops in NYC.  Calls for increasing the minimum wage sounds good, but hides what minimum wage increase actually does. Increasing the minimum wage results in prices 3-5 times the amount of the increase. A $1 increase in minimum wage means $4 or more increase in prices. Why? Manufacturers' will increase salaries to $1 for minimum wage earners, Warehouses will do the same to cover the cost, transport/logistic will do same to cover the cost, & retailers will do the same. All in All prices will go up from 4 to 5 times, if not more, defending on the cost that needs to be covered. Slightly above, moderately above, & way above (very highly skilled labor) minimum wage will all get a pay cut except government employees, elected officials & representatives. In socialism there isn't really minimum wage because everyone not in government earns minimum wage no matter what profession their in. Getting the poor addicted to duplicates of unlimited great society program assistance have the same effects of foreign aid given to 3rd world countries in keeping 3rd world countries dependent, irresponsible, & corrupt for decades. Lastly Illegal Immigrants are brought in to undercut Americans (Natural or Naturalized) & Legal Immigrants. 1/3 of illegals also end up homeless, 1/3 engage in criminal activities (Drug, Human, Child Trafficking, home invasions, rape, murder, extortion, identity theft). 1/3 will be on government assistance paid for by U.S. citizens & Legal immigrants not their country of origin. Overall illegal immigration simply add more to the crime, homeless & poverty rate. If illegals acquire jobs, they're simply replacing Americans & legal immigrants.  (D)'s are using illegal immigrants as tools to gain more congressional seat in the same manner to how the slave state wanted full representation for the slave population for the slave states to have more power over the free states, but the (D)s today want power over free citizens as most of their supporters are addicted for handouts & highly dependent as they grow exponentially. (D) staffers are in Mexico coaching & abetting illegal immigrants to continue flooding the detention camps as they want the crisis to grow & pester this administration that is why they never did anything to prevent & discourage caravans after caravans from coming. They called it a Manufactured Crisis. Sanctuary states are transporting Illegal immigrants in their states to a non-sanctuary state's city like San Antonio, Texas. Ironically Sanctuary states don't want illegal immigrants transported in their cities. In the end the poor & smaller minority citizens are disenfranchised even more. Many countries (non European or Europeanized (N, America/Australia) countries) do not have the willingness to accept 10%-90% population of illegal immigrant's country of origin as it puts tremendous pressure on the host country's land space, poverty, over crowding, food production, tax expenditures, cost of living, schools, health care, housing, waste & environmental pollutions.", 6159, "Own8J1VGaa", 2],
