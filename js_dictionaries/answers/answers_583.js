Basically you have 2 separate categories Competition payments This should be equal. And using made up numbers here but here we go Lets say a base fee of $1000 per game A $500 bonus for a win a $100 bonus for a draw This can be doubled for world cup games and tournament games Commercial PaymentsThese are not based on sporting merit. This is based on all tv revenue the respective team makes. So if the USWNT earns $100000 that gets split amongst the womens team. If the mens team earns $1000000, that gets split exclusively amongst the mens team. It would be wrong to expect actors to be paid the same regardless of how much their movie brings in. Equally its regardless to expect the womens national team to make the same money if the mens team draws more viewers or gets more sponsorship etc. Sporting wise, yes i agree, commercially, hell no...", 5030, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],
