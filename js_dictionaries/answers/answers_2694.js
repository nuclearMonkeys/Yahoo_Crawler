I wouldn't worry...cats know more than we give them credit for, and they recognize scents. If you are their parent, they will recognize you, especially if you were an integral part of their developmental stages. I wouldn't worry....I love my baby Milo with all my heart, and no matter how long I am gone, he still crawls up my leg and begs for back scratches....which is how it has been for all my cats. He loves you, and sees you as his parent....I wouldn't worry. You've been a main part of his life, and he won't forget (or she has). As long as your cat is familiar with your scent, I wouldn't worry. Cats have a relatively long memory, especially in comparison to dogs, though it is more selective. Scent is the key, and also, they won't forget the scent of someone they are comfortable with and surrounded by, especially if they are exposed to it regularly.", 11474, "None", 0],

There is a VERY good chance that your cat will remember you, considering you raised him from birth.  I would be willing to bet that he will, but there is always that slim chance that he won't.  Your cat, from your description, seems to love you very much and cats have a very good memory.  I would bet that he will remember you as his mommy when you come home.

In other words, my priorities have changed over time from those that I thought would make an impact to those that I know will make an impact to those I love. The Sex Pistols fit well into that category as do other anti-establishment bands such as Rage Against The Machine.

While AWA would have increased it's public profile or popularity after such an event.It would be of Montreal Screwjob proportions in the WWF, but a bonus for AWA.With the likes of Nick Bockwinkel, Baron Von Rasche and Mad Dog Vachon on the roster, having Sheik as the WWE title holder would have been a ratings winner.It could also have meant that maybe stars like Sgt Slaughter or Bob Backlund could have been the \"draw\" for others to get signed up. Iron Sheik for sure did the right thing.He was a committed professional who would have seen the financial gains to be made from a high-profile feud with Hulk in WWF.He was a shrewd businessman away from the ring and would have seen the logic in not double- crossing Vince or Hulk Hogan.", 11467, "54A3cDoEaa", 0],
