Looking back at what we went through, what HE went through, it seems amazing. He endured great suffering and nearly died. We have pictures of him that look like he was starving. He couldn't eat, due to the pain.  I could never have guessed we would not only endure all of that, but actually overcome it. He was once in a wheelchair, which was normal to us. That's just the way it was. Since then, he has had his hips replaced. In fact, he called me today and told me how happy he is. He spends a lot of time working and with his children.  People adjust to whatever life gives them, which makes them either stronger or embittered. I look at my nephew, after all he's endured, and I am extremely proud!
