	134724 : ["Here are my questions. Please answer them as thoroughly as you can. Thank you! :) 1. Do you believe in god? Why or why not?   YES 2. What do you believe was the cause of the universe as we know it? (I.e., creation, big bang, etc.) Why?  GOD BECAUSE HE IS CALLED THE CREATOR OF ALL THINGS. 3. What religion/spirituality do you claim, if any?  JEHOVAH'S WITNESS 4. Are there any doctrines/teachings/messages/etc in your religion/spirituality that you do not agree with, or do not understand?  NONE I DON'T AGREE WITH, THERE MAY BE SOME I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SO I RESEARCH UNTIL I DO 5. What other religions/spiritualities besides your own do you admire/like/draw inspiration from? NONE. THIS IS THE TRUTH AND PROVIDES ALL I NEED. 6. If you are unsure of your spiritual path, are you comfortable with uncertainty, or do you seek to join some kind of faith? I DON'T SEEK TO JOIN A FAITH AND I AM NOT UNSURE.  I AM WITH MY FAITH BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IN GOD AND I HAVE FAITH THAT HE IS GOING TO PROVIDE A BETTER FUTURE AND THIS CAN'T BE ALL TO LIFE THAT THERE IS. 7. What do you think happens after we die? Do you think there's any way to truly know (besides actually dying)?  THE BIBLE TELLS US WHAT HAPPENS.  IN ECCLESIASTES IS SAYS THAT THE DEAD ARE CONSCIOUS OF NOTHING...SO WHEN WE DIE WE ARE AS SLEEPING. JESUS USES THE TERM TO \"WAKE UP\" WHEN HE REFERS TO RESURRECTING DEAD ONES AS HE SAID TO  A LITTLE GIRL AND TO LAZARUS.  WE DO NOT ASCEND TO HEAVEN BUT WAIT TO BE RESURRECTED TO PARADISE ON EARTH AFTER GOD WAGES WAR WITH SATAN.  SEE 2 PETER 3:13 \"But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.\" 8. Do you believe the living can communicate with the dead? How? Why do you believe this? Do you have any personal experience with this? NO. THAT IS AGAINST GOD'S LAW AND IT INVOLVES SPIRITISM.  IF ONE PROFESSES TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD, IT COULD BE A DEMON PRETENDING TO BE THAT PERSON.  THAT IS WHY GOD FORBIDS SUCH ACTS.  9. Do you believe in heavenly beings like angels, cherubs, and seraphs? Do you believe in hellish beings like demons? Why or why not? YES WE DO BELIEVE IN ANGELS.  WE DO BELIEVE IN DEMONS BUT THEY ARE LABELED AS SUCH BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED REBELLIOUS ANGELS.  THEY RESIDED IN HEAVEN UNTIL MICHAEL, THE ARCHANGEL, BATTLED WITH THEM AND CAST THEM, WITH SATAN, DOWN TO EARTH. See Revelation 12:7 And war broke out in heaven: Mi′cha·el and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled 8 but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 9 So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.\" 10. What is your favorite thing about your faith (or lack thereof)? IT ENCOURAGES ME TO BE POSITIVE AND I HAVE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. 11. What is your favorite spiritual practice? (I.e., meditation, prayer, communion, etc) READING THE BIBLE AND STUDYING IT. I GUESS MEDITATING ON GOD'S WORD. 12. Do you think religion in general (not just yours) is helpful, irrelevant, or destructive to society as a whole? RELIGION IN GENERAL CAN BE DESTRUCTIVE IF THEY ARE NOT BEING EDUCATED FROM GOD'S WORD THE BIBLE.  ONCE THEY DEVIATE FROM IT THEN IT BECOMES FALSE INFORMATION AND THEY ARE NO LONGER RECEIVING GUIDANCE FROM GOD, BUT FROM MAN.  THIS INFORMATION BECOMES FROM IMPERFECTION AND CAN LEAD TO DAMAGING INTERPRETATION.  IE WAR, SEXUAL ABUSE ETC., 13. What religion/spiritual practice did you grow up with? How has this changed as you got older? JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES. IT HAS NOT CHANGED. 14. Do you believe in the concept of heaven and hell? If so, describe this concept in detail (for instance, are heaven and hell physical places, or are they states of mind, or...? How does one get into heaven or hell? Why?) HEAVEN IS REAL.  THAT IS THE HOME OF GOD, JESUS AND ANGELS.  HELL IS NOT REAL.  ONE CANNOT GET INTO HEAVEN UNLESS THEY ARE PART OF GOD'S KINGDOM.  THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE CHOSEN (144,000) TO BE CO-RULERS WITH CHRIST IN HEAVEN. THE REST HAVE THE HOPE TO BE RESURRECTED OR CONTINUE TO LIVE ON EARTH.  See Revelation 7-14.  HELL IS A MAN'S CONCEPT THAT IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THE BIBLE. 15. If you are atheist or agnostic, what is your opinion of religion in general? What has been your experience with religion? Has it been a good or bad experience?  N/A.", 11226, "lvDrdC8Zaa", 2],

	134729 : ["I have a mare. Her barn name is Blu (Blue). I started riding her as a training project but fell in love with her and all of the unlimited potential she has.  She is a sleek and glossy grey, purebred american quarter horse with some of the best bloodlines you can get.  She is special to me because out of all the horses I have ever ridden she has the most distinctive personality, she is mischievous and smart and there is never a dull moment. Blu also doesn't like other people but her and I click, and I know this is smug but it makes me feel special that Im the only person who can ride her. She is on the small side standing at about 15.0 hands but when she runs it doesn't matter because she is outright faster than alot of the other horses. She runs with more heart and drive than any horse I have ridden and after ward she comes right back down and is as mellow as can be. I show Blu in gaming events and barrel racing. Her favorite event is pole bending  we also do sorting and team penning and I am breaking her out to the roping box.  We have done some western pleasure but she dosen't like it much becouse she is very dominate towards other horses and dosen't like when they come trotting up from behind. Her dominance makes her an awsome cow horse but a cruddy horse to ride on the rail.  On the same note she loves dressage. I mostly do dressage with Blu to keep her mind sound and to teach her to respond to the slightest movement I make. It's kinda funny really she's a rip roarin rodeo horse one minute but the next she is tucking her head and prancing down the center line. I don't have one set favorite moment but one thing that happend was at a show a girl in front of me was being a real brat and was chewing out her friends and parents becouse she didn't win her class. I was trying to keep my mouth shut to this spoiled girl so I just stood there and minded my own business but Blu must have read my mind becouse before I could say \"NO\" BLu reached out and nipped the girl right on the butt! She hadn't bit the girl very hard but it was still funny Me and all the people around us could hardly keep from laughing. Sorry for rambling on but I love this horse to bits and to me she's just a rare gem.    ", 11224, "d5QOZXPDaa", 1],

	134746 : ["IT'S A LITTLE LONG, BUT INTERESTING In the Bible the words translated “spirit” (Hebrew, ru'ach; Greek, pneu'ma) basically mean “breath.” Thus, instead of “his spirit goes out,” the translation by R. A. Knox uses the phrase “the breath leaves his body.” (Psalm 145:4) But the word “spirit” implies much more than the act of breathing. For example, in describing the destruction of human and animal life at the time of the global Deluge, Genesis 7:22 says: “Everything in which the breath of the force [or, spirit; Hebrew, ru'ach] of life was active in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died.” So “spirit” may refer to the life-force that is active in all living creatures, both humans and animals, and that is sustained by breathing. What, then, does it mean when Ecclesiastes 12:7 states that when a person dies, “the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it”? Does this mean that the spirit literally travels through space into God's presence? Nothing of the sort is implied. Since the spirit is the life-force, it “returns to the true God” in the sense that any hope of future life for that person now rests entirely with God. Only God can restore the spirit, or life-force, causing a person to come back to life. (Psalm 104:30) “SOUL” AS USED IN THE BIBLE First, consider the soul. You may remember that the Bible was originally written mainly in Hebrew and Greek. When writing about the soul, the Bible writers used the Hebrew word ne'phesh or the Greek word psy·khe'. These two words occur well over 800 times in the Scriptures, and the New World Translation consistently renders them “soul.” When you examine the way “soul” or “souls” is used in the Bible, it becomes evident that this word basically refers to (1) people, (2) animals, or (3) the life that a person or an animal enjoys. Let us consider some scriptures that present these three different senses. People. “In Noah's days . . . a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (1 Peter 3:20) Here the word “souls” clearly stands for people—Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives. Exodus 16:16 mentions instructions given to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna. They were told: “Pick up some of it . . . according to the number of the souls that each of you has in his tent.” So the amount of manna that was gathered was based upon the number of people in each family. Some other Biblical examples of the application of “soul” or “souls” to a person or to people are found at Genesis 46:18; Joshua 11:11; Acts 27:37; and Romans 13:1. Animals. In the Bible's creation account, we read: “God went on to say: ‘Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls and let flying creatures fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse of the heavens.' And God went on to say: ‘Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.' And it came to be so.” (Genesis 1:20, 24) In this passage, fish, domestic animals, and wild beasts are all referred to by the same word—“souls.” Birds and other animals are called souls at Genesis 9:10; Leviticus 11:46; and Numbers 31:28. Life as a person. Sometimes the word “soul” means one's life as a person. Jehovah told Moses: “All the men who were hunting for your soul are dead.” (Exodus 4:19) What were Moses' enemies hunting for? They were seeking to take Moses' life. Earlier, while Rachel was giving birth to her son Benjamin, “her soul was going out (because she died).” (Genesis 35:16-19) At that moment, Rachel lost her life. Consider also Jesus' words: “I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.” (John 10:11) Jesus gave his soul, or life, in behalf of mankind. In these Bible passages, the word “soul” clearly refers to life as a person. You will find more examples of this sense of “soul” at 1 Kings 17:17-23; Matthew 10:39; John 15:13; and Acts 20:10. A further study of God's Word will show you that nowhere in the entire Bible are the terms “immortal” or “everlasting” linked with the word “soul.” Instead, the Scriptures state that a soul is mortal, meaning that it dies. (Ezekiel 18:4, 20) Therefore, the Bible calls someone who has died simply a “dead soul.”—Leviticus 21:11. THE “SPIRIT” IDENTIFIED Let us now consider the Bible's use of the term “spirit.” Some people think that “spirit” is just another word for “soul.” However, that is not the case. The Bible makes clear that “spirit” and “soul” refer to two different things. How do they differ? Bible writers used the Hebrew word ru'ach or the Greek word pneu'ma when writing about the “spirit.” The Scriptures themselves indicate the meaning of those words. For instance, Psalm 104:29 states: “If you [Jehovah] take away their spirit [ru'ach], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” And James 2:26 notes that “the body without spirit [pneu'ma] is dead.” In these verses, then, “spirit” refers to that which gives life to a body. Without spirit, the body is dead. Therefore, in the Bible the word ru'ach is translated not only as “spirit” but also as “force,” or life-force. For example, concerning the Flood in Noah's day, God said: “I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force [ru'ach] of life is active from under the heavens.” (Genesis 6:17; 7:15, 22) “Spirit” thus refers to an invisible force (the spark of life) that animates all living creatures. The soul and the spirit are not the same. The body needs the spirit in much the same way as a radio needs electricity—in order to function. To illustrate this further, think of a portable radio. When you put batteries in a portable radio and turn it on, the electricity stored in the batteries brings the radio to life, so to speak. Without batteries, however, the radio is dead. So is another kind of radio when it is unplugged from an electric outlet. Similarly, the spirit is the force that brings our body to life. Also, like electricity, the spirit has no feeling and cannot think. It is an impersonal force. But without that spirit, or life-force, our bodies “expire, and back to their dust they go,” as the psalmist stated. Speaking about man's death, Ecclesiastes 12:7 states: “The dust [of his body] returns to the earth just as it happened to be and the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it.” When the spirit, or life-force, leaves the body, the body dies and returns to where it came from—the earth. Comparably, the life-force returns to where it came from—God. (Job 34:14, 15; Psalm 36:9) This does not mean that the life-force actually travels to heaven. Rather, it means that for someone who dies, any hope of future life rests with Jehovah God. His life is in God's hands, so to speak. Only by God's power can the spirit, or life-force, be given back so that a person may live again.", 11226, "AA10260693", 2],

Anybody can be a racist.   A cult is a religious belief that has a single human leader at the top of the organization making all the rules.  David Koresh was the leader of the Branch Davidians.  There was some guy who had a following of about 20, I'd say, people who honestly believed that Jesus was coming back on the Hale Bop comet, and they all killed themselves to join Jesus on the comet.  Jim Jones is another cult leader who initiated a mass suicide/murder of his followers in Jonestown Guyana in the late '70s.  He fed them all poison hidden in Kool-Aid.  There were many who took it willingly (mass suicide) and some who didn't (mass murder).

	134765 : ["The soul, according to many religious and philosophical traditions, is a self aware ethereal substance particular to a unique living being. In these traditions the soul is thought to incorporate the inner essence in each living being, and to be the true basis for sentience.  In distinction to spirit which may or may not be eternal, souls are usually (but not always as explained below) considered to be immortal and to pre-exist their incarnation in flesh.  The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly, even within a given religion, as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material. Spirit -  An incorporeal but ubiquitous, non-quantifiable, substance or energy present individually in all living things. Unlike the concept of human souls, which is believed to be eternal and preexisting, a spirit develops and grows as an integral aspect of the living being. This concept of the individual spirit is common among traditional peoples. It is therefore important to note the distinction between this concept of spirit with the concept of the pre-existing or eternal soul because a belief in the soul concept is quite rare among traditional peoples.

I think the gist of it is the soul is pre-existing and eternal, whereas the spirit learns and grows and takes on attributes from the individual.", 11226, "AA10965497", 0],

At other times the soul means the part of us that includes our thoughts, our personality and our will.  In that sense even animals have a soul.  The spirit is that part of humans that makes us above the other animals.  It's the part of our \"heart\" that God lives in when we accept His Son as Savior.", 11226, "AA11128022", 0],
	134767 : ["Sadly, there is no law forbidding this, so the only thing any of us can do is keep spreading the message to people not to buy poorly bred dogs. No demand, no trade. You could perhaps google Rottweiler UK rescue and show them the links, or take them to any rescue shelter to see all the homeles and needy dogs that cannot find suitable homes. # I am sure, once they have had to raise and find homes for one litter they will never attempt it again! Rottweiler Welfare are so overburdoned they cannot help any more dogs for 4 weeks already!", 11225, "5rfnEQnGaa", 5],

Tell them the cost of having a litter, the chances that the b*tch could die, the chances that no one will want a mixed breed puppy from an ill-tempered dog, that statistically half the litter will be rehomed or put in the shelter, and that the puppies are likely to have genetically passed down ailments. If that doesn't work, I don't know what will. They're stupid people. They might/probably won't listen. They'll say you're a \"snob\" and you need to \"get a life and mind your own business\". But THEN, you can put an ad out when they put an ad out (and trust me, they WILL put an ad out) and spread the word about the mutts in shelters and why NOT to buy one. Talk to people about it. That's the best you can do.", 11225, "c3NWW1Nzaa", 1],

Otherwise the puppies can die. Sounds like these people are being very stupid and just want to get some money from the puppies. I would still talk to the RSPCA and see what they say...maybe they can give you some help without interfering. I hope that will help you! Take care!", 11225, "16yq6Kfdaa", 3],

But definetly look into an older, matured horse who can be gentle, forgiving, stress free and show you the ropes. I think for my first couple of beginner type horses they weren't over $1500. I do recommend you speak to a trainer in your area though. Are you taking lessons now? They can help you find the right horse to fit your needs.", 11224, "zMCLlOwuaa", 2],
	134771 : ["Your first horse does not need to expensive. You could think about doing a lease, a care lease where you pay for the expenses is pretty common.  I would look for an older horse, something 12+, something 18-20ish would not hurt at all. Young horses can be a big handful. Going with an older more mellow horse for a first one is a great idea! Just because they are older does not mean that they don't have alot of life in them! I would think you should pay $1000ish, though my first horse was a free, she was 25 and the owners just wanted her to have a good home. Horses do not need to be expensive to be good.  A quarter horse or a paint would be fine, though I might look into a good old mutt of a horse. Unless you are doing breed shows having papers etc is not a huge thing.  Make sure that you take someone that knows about horses with you when you go looking at them. Also shell out of the money for the vet check, it will save you problems later!

The socialist aspects of the economy are impossible to exonerate with out causing malfunction and thus it will never be a true and complete capitalist economy.
