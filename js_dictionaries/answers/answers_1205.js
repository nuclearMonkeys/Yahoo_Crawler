	65742 : ["Hey sweetie. know who the biggest users of Medicaid were?  Wal-mart workers. They paid most of their staff below minimum wage by not calling them full timers, by very strictly limiting their hours so they were fifteen minutes below regulations for full timers. So your glowing spiel doesn't cover the negatives, Like Wal mart gets tax breaks or they don't build, and when those tax breaks expire they move on leaving a huge empty lot for the town who thought they would be seeing a long term business with decent jobs. The government isn't running the health care system, but frankly business doesn't do a great job either, look at the airlines,  are you happy with its decreasing service and increasing costs? Or maybe the banking industry?  Love those artificial low loans and creative accounting they use to qualify people who trust them, because 'if the bank thinks I'm  good for it I must be.\" I can't tell you the number of businesses large and small that have gone out since the seventies, you probably aren't old enough to remember TWA, and what about Enron, and AIG. Nope, Wal-mart isn't a golden touch for me, I don't want them running the health care industry either. They might tell me they don't cover my operation fifteen minutes before I go in. Your mention of the problem of health care is true, and very self defeating, since your friend couldn't afford health insurance she had to be careful not to make too much money or her family wouldn't be covered, and that would lead to an even worse situation for her. I also know of people who had to be careful not to make too much, they usually had kids with asthma or  sickle cell, or other preexisting conditions. Their choice is to make ten dollars more a week by working the 38.75 hours or losing the health coverage that kept their kids alive.  Not a tough choice to make. Even Wal-mart was embarrassed by that working poor problem and began to offer their own insurance to their workers, at least, their full time workers. BTW I don't blame Wal-Mart at all, its a business and I don't think any business needs to provide insurance, I do think we need to have a market where affordable insurance is possibility A living wage would be a dream for anyone on the floor at a Wal-mart. That's why government programs are needed, why working people should be expected to subsidize a company is beyond me.  Old Sam may have be paternalistic but the group that took over at his death is bloodless. There never will be a perfect world where all the benefits are just right for everyone, but  I'd rather err on the side of a few extra dollars for someone on disability, and SS disability is notoriously difficult to get, requiring a court and lawyer and their doctor and yours to be in agreement on the proportion of disability,  than cut their throat. Thanks for the interest,  we are all slightly tired of the cold and snowy winter, but it just makes spring more luscious when it comes, and believe me, I'm looking forward to the first brave crocus popping up under the oaks.", 8304, "5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa", 0],

	65747 : ["They could ... or they could realize that if ALL the young people got together on the internet and on the streets and sent in a \"write-in vote\" they could still make Obama president. Pardon me but I just have to tell you this true story about when I was in college. Up in Davis, CA home of University of California, Davis, the stores put up signs that said \"No more than 3 students allowed in store at the same time\".  The local cops shunned students.  The city council was also negative towards student needs.  So what did the students do?  Since the town had a population, back then, of about 30,000 but only half of them might vote at best, and the population of UCD was about 30,000 students, the students got together and EVERYONE registered to vote.  They went to the polls and students took the mayor's position and the majority of the city council available seats.  In other words they took over the town.  The police were ordered to treat students with respect and not harrass them.  The store owners were asked to be more understanding.  The whole town was converted from \"anti-students\" to \"pro-students\" ...  AND THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS COUNTRY!!! The problem is that we \"old people\" have our parties, and political get-togethers, and both parties keep their numbers informed as to where the party is moving and what to expect from the candidates.  It's very covert, nearly silent, and it's as if all the \"old people\" have ESP with each other or something.   When I was in college we bitched about a LOT of stuff.  But did we REALLY try to do anything about it?  If I were there NOW I would start political clubs designed to \"sculpt\" student's thoughts and desires.  I would tell them that ANYTHING is possible.  How is it that 50% of old people voting can overpower the younger votes?  It's b/c the younger people are not organized like the older people.  But the younger people CAN be organized ... and if they ALL voted in a block can you imagine what would happen to the political process in this country? In my day we rioted in the streets and voiced our opinions.  But people just turned their TV volume DOWN a bit and called the police to get the radical, noisy, students off the streets and along came the tanks and the national guard and ... poof ... no more noise, no more students. BUT ... had we gotten together and EVERY young person in the country went down to the polling place in 1968 and voted for someone OTHER than Nixon can you imagine what this country would be like today? Had the students gotten together in 2000 and voted for someone other than Bush can you imagine us NOT at war and spending the money on the country instead of the war? WELL HERE IS YOUR CHANCE ONCE AGAIN!!! Are you going to sit there and *****?  Or are you going to get ALL of your friends together and work to get all of THEIR friends together and get ALL students and people under 30 together and STRAIGHTEN THIS COUNTRY OUT???? WELL? Get mad ... get busy ... get voting ... and make people RESPECT the YOUTH VOTE in this country.  EVeryone from 18 to 30 should be out there voting and you should all be huddling in chat groups discussing who you are going to FORCE into the presidency.  But don't stop there ... vote in your local elections ... find a college student worthy of the post and make him the MAYOR of your town.  Vote students into the City Council.  Don't ***** AT these people.  BECOME these people.  BECOME THE RULERS in this country.  It can be done.    Now .... do it!", 8303, "izY3JNhqaa", -1],

If only the world were so simple, then simple solutions would work.   By the way, none of us here want government run health care, but that really isn't a worry, since \"Obamacare\" isn't government run health care at all.  Don't let complicated facts get in the way of your certainty, though.   And if you want to fix corruption, then fix campaign finance reform.  Otherwise, you're never going to get more than the best money can buy. Edit:  Feel free to enlighten me by providing evidence of the sections that are included in the health care reform act that will lead to government run health care.  Although in  a way, you might be right.  Since insurance companies are currently controlling health care, having that insurance subsidized by the health care reform act might lead to the government controlling that tiny percentage of the insurance that controls health care.  I hope some day you will consider reading something that doesn't agree with you.  You might learn something.
