Grindcore was close, but at least lots of the instrument work is actually complex... Example: August Burns Red Example of good metalcore band: Unearth Most technical - Mathcore and tech death stuff is awesome. Examples: Arsis, the Faceless, Protest the Hero, Necrophagist Most brutal - Death metal and tech death. Examples: Necrophagist, Brain Drill, All Shall Perish Not really sure for most intense.
