	125013 : ["Was Stephen praying to Jesus? No, he was not. One's worship and therefore one's prayers should go only to Jehovah God.  Under normal circumstances, Stephen would have appealed to Jehovah in the name of Jesus.  In this instance, though, Stephen had a vision of “the Son of man standing at God's right hand.” (Acts 7:56) Fully aware that Jesus had been given the power to resurrect the dead, Stephen spoke, but did not pray, directly to Jesus, asking Him to safeguard his spirit. some may ask, ‘does the Bible not report that both the disciple Stephen and the apostle John spoke to Jesus in heaven?' That is true.  These events, however, did not involve prayers, as Stephen and John each saw Jesus in vision and spoke to him directly.  Bear in mind that simply speaking even to God does not in itself constitute a prayer.  Adam and Eve spoke to God, offering excuses for their great sin, when He judged them following their sin in Eden. Their talking to him in that way was not a prayer.  Hence, it would be incorrect to cite Stephen's or John's talking to Jesus as evidence that we actually should pray to him. There is nothing to indicate that Christian disciples so expressed themselves under other circumstances to Jesus after his ascension to heaven. Thus, the apostle Paul writes: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.”", 10819, "AA10260693", 5],

The truth is that death leads to immediate heaven or hell, depending only on whether the person believed in Jesus for eternal life, or not.. .. The truth is that Jesus loves you and wants to bless your life freely :) Most of all, Jesus wants you with Him forever, and not in hell. The truth is that every belief except one will lead to eternal torment in the lake of fire for every person. Because nothing pays for our sins except the death and blood of Jesus, the sacrifice of Jesus that is already accomplished by Him . Jesus loves you!

Nothing else pays for our sins, not works, not deeds, not religions. So the only way to heaven and to avoid hell, is by believing in Jesus for eternal life (John 6:47), without adding any of your own works (Romans 4:5). Believe in Jesus to take you to heaven, and you will be in heaven, no matter what, guaranteed. That easy, thanks to Jesus!

	125024 : ["The “Hearer of Prayer.” Though some claim that prayer may properly be addressed to others, such as to God's Son, the evidence is emphatically to the contrary. True, there are rare instances in which words are addressed to Jesus Christ in heaven. Stephen, when about to die, appealed to Jesus, saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” (Ac 7:59) However, the context reveals a circumstance giving basis for this exceptional expression. Stephen at that very time had a vision of “Jesus standing at God's right hand,” and evidently reacting as if he were in Jesus' personal presence, he felt free to speak this plea to the one whom he recognized as the head of the Christian congregation. (Ac 7:55, 56; Col 1:18) Similarly, the apostle John, at the conclusion of the Revelation, says, “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.” (Re 22:20) But again the context shows that, in a vision (Re 1:10; 4:1, 2), John had been hearing Jesus speak of his future coming and thus John responded with the above expression of his desire for that coming. (Re 22:16, 20) In both cases, that of Stephen and that of John, the situation differs little from that of the conversation John had with a heavenly person in this Revelation vision. (Re 7:13, 14; compare Ac 22:6-22.) There is nothing to indicate that Christian disciples so expressed themselves under other circumstances to Jesus after his ascension to heaven. Thus, the apostle Paul writes: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.”—Php 4:6. The article APPROACH TO GOD considers the position of Christ Jesus as the one through whom prayer is directed. Through Jesus' blood, offered to God in sacrifice, “we have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place,” that is, boldness to approach God's presence in prayer, approaching “with true hearts in the full assurance of faith.” (Heb 10:19-22) Jesus Christ is therefore the one and only “way” of reconciliation with God and approach to God in prayer.—Joh 14:6; 15:16; 16:23, 24; 1Co 1:2; Eph 2:18; see JESUS CHRIST (His Vital Place in God's Purpose).", 10819, "83QxTKYZaa", 3],

They were in a meeting talking about the formation of the modern state, and somebody posed the question, then what will be our flag? Then someone grabbed a cloth quickly and designed a flag with Jewish symbols on it and they displayed it at the meeting. They chose the blue stripes because that is the design and coloring that comes from the male tallit, a prayer shawl. And they further designed it using the Magen David because that has been a Jewish symbol denoting the \"shield\" of David. It is a flag for a modern country and all modern countries have things on them that show significance to them. I would not go by any other internationalist interpretation of another's modern flag. It's really not their place to determine what another's flag means and they tend to give it negative connotations for their own political or religious reasons, they try to \"propagandize\" it and give it other that its actual meaning. The people that live under the Israeli national flag are the ones best apt to interpret what the flag means to them and history shows that the intent provided at the time the flag was made meant \"prayer shawl, shield of David.\" This interpretation comes from Israeli historical sources, directly when the flag was being produced for the first time, and they know best their intent on the flag and the meaning it has to Israeli people today.

	125041 : ["Question: What is the meaning of this passage from the NWT? Did Jesus die for all of mankind or only those who were written in the book of life? If Jesus only died for a select few then some who are resurrected are not saved from the first death, they will be judged again for the first death and killed again. 1. All the dead from the sea, death and Hades were released from their respective places. 2. They were then individually judged. 3. The next part tells us they were then thrown into the lake of fire; therefore, their judgment had already been made before they were released from their respective places, Hades, death and the sea.  4. They did not get the option to spend 000 years with Satan locked up, trying to follows Gods commands. They were already judged. However, the bible clearly states Jesus died for everyone, not just a select few. \"For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all...\" And the result of the ransom gave us freedom from the first death upon our death. \"For the wages of sin is death...\" After death and Ha´des give up those who are dead  they will be judged individually according to their deeds. Again....If everyone is judged upon resurrection then they will not have time to have any deeds to be judged on, they will be judged upon Adam's sin and not their own. Christ died for only a few not everyone as the scripture points out. Instead, the first or Adamic death will no longer have liberty or power over men, as it has had for the past six thousand years; no longer any will die for Adam's sin. (Romans 5:12; Jeremiah 31:29,30; Ezekiel 18:2) From that time onward the new covenant, sealed with the precious blood, will be in force, and only willful transgressions will be counted as sin and punished with the wages of sin — death — the second death.

	125042 : ["And they went on casting stones at Stephen as he made appeal and said: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”  The answer is no.", 10819, "None", 3],
	125043 : ["Greetings, Some point to where Acts 7:59 where some translations read that Stephen \"prayed\" to Jesus. The Greek word is EPIKALOUMENON. It literally means \"*appeal, invoke, aid, request, call, or call on.*\" (Strong's Greek Dictionary pg. 31; Thayer's Greek Lexicon pg. 239) It is used else where in the Bible by Paul for instance at Acts 25:11 where he \"appealed,\" or \"called on\" Caesar (cf. Acts 25:21, 25; 26:32; 28:19). Certainly, Caesar was not God, nor did Paul \"pray\" to Caesar! Paul did not consider Caesar God; but he did make an appeal to him as one in a position of authority. Thus, we see that \"calling upon\" Jesus hardly means that Stephen is offering a \"prayer,\" or \"worshipful address\" to Jesus. We know this because Matthew 6:9 tells us to \"pray\" to the Father.... The Greek word here translated \"pray\" is \"PROSEUKHMAI.\" This word means to \"*pray, offer worshipful [address], supplicate*.\" (Thayer's Greek Lexicon pg. 545; Strong's Greek Dictionary pg. 61) It is NOT the same word as used in Acts 7:59. Jesus clearly promised his disciples: \"If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.\" Does this require praying to him? No. The asking is addressed to Jehovah God—but in Jesus' name. (John 14:13, 14; 15:16) Many Theologians have perpetuated the idea that we can pray directly to Jesus because it agrees with their theology. Yet, in examining the scriptural evidence we can see that this teaching is not Biblical. First, we have the explicit statements by Jesus himself which show that prayer is *only* to be addressed to the \"Father\" who's name is Jehovah (Mt.6:9; Ps.83:18, KJV). Every direction by Jesus clearly states that prayers must go to God the Father \"through\" or \"in\" Christ's name, not \"to\" Jesus. This being the case, then it seems that any Christian who prayed to Jesus would be going contrary to Christ's direct teaching. Second, we have Christ's own example where he always addressed his prayers to the \"Father\" as his God. Further we have the example of the Apostles; in every instance where the one prayed to is explicitly mentioned it is always addressed to the Father not Jesus (Col 1:3).  (As a side point, since prayer is always worshipful address of a *superior,* the fact that Jesus himself prayed to God the Father is evidence that Jesus is not Almighty God (Jn.14:28). (Christ's example when it came to choosing the apostles demonstrates that prayers were addressed to his God, the father (Lk.6:12,13; Jn.10:29; 17:2,6,9). Scripture also shows that only God the Father who has ultimate authority to answer prayers (Rm.1:3; 1Cor.12:27) At Mat.20:23 Jesus made it very clear that he could not be the one prayed to fill this position in the foundation of the heavenly kingdom. So, while it might be proper to *request* help from Christ's in such matters, as God's agent, it would be impossible to address him in holy prayer as if he could make the ultimate choice.) Scripturally, prayer is addressed only to the Father as the ultimate source of power; then Christ, as God's representative can act on our behalf. In fact, all help requested of God in prayer comes \"through\" Jesus (Php.1:9-11; 4:6,7). As described in Scripture, prayers are a form of worship that belongs exclusively to Almighty God. By addressing all our prayers to Jehovah God, we give evidence that we are Christian since we follow Jesus' direction to pray: \"Our Father in the heavens.\" To support the idea that we can pray to Jesus, some use various scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 1:2 where it says that  we can call upon Jesus Christ. But, this interpretation ignores that in the original language the expression \"to call upon\" does not necessarily mean prayer. It can simply be an acknowledgment of his being the Messiah and Savior (1Jn. 4:14; Acts 3:6; 19:5, Cf. Acts 10:43 with 22:16). Therefore, The Interpreter's Bible states that the phrase \"to call on the name of our Lord . . . means to confess his lordship rather than to pray to him.\" And we literally say Jesus' name whenever we pray to God through him. So, while showing that we can call upon the name of Jesus, the Bible does not indicate that we should pray to him.—Eph.5:20; Col.3:17. Yours, BAR-ANERGES", 10819, "None", 6],

	125052 : ["The New World Translation is a fairly accurate Bible translation. This passage of the NWT does not differ greatly from other English versions. First, the question of a thousand-year test. As with most Bible texts, Revelation 20:13-15 is best understood in context. Read Revelation 20:1-3. An angel comes down out of heaven with a key to the abyss and a chain in his hand, and binds Satan \"for a thousand years.\" He's sealed into the abyss, \"that he might not mislead the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be let loose for a little while.\" So, to answer your question, the verses in question do not mean that there is no thousand-year punitive period- the final test, however, comes afterward (Revelation 20:7-10).  In Verse 13 the dead are released from the common grave- the sea, death and Hades each play a part, but these terms are not mutually exclusive- think of Jonah, who described himself in Sheol though he was also in the sea. These are individually judged. (John 5:29) It is not resurrected ones, but \"death and Hades\" that are hurled into the lake of fire in verse 14. \"This means the second death\"- the end of death from inherited Adamic sin. (Romans 5:12) This is a fulfillment of Isaiah 25:8 and 1 Corinthians 15:26, which says, \"As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.\" And so are those \"not found written in the book of life\"- goatlike, rebellious people who have been judged after having been given the opportunity to take their stand for Kingdom rule. There's more information at the link below. Next, The everlasting fire referred to is not proof of eternal suffering. It is symbolic of everlasting destruction. All of the verses you refer to use this symbolism. The tortures of a fiery grave wrought with suffering have not even come into Jehovah God's heart. (Jeremiah 7:31) We are even promised that there will be a day when not only death is no more, but mourning and outcry and pain are all gone, passed away. (Revelation 21:4) To be among those experiencing life as it was intended, we do our best to worship Jehovah whole-heartedly, in spirit and truth.", 10827, "ca79b399a91a3937df70d9352f2b1546aa", 2],
	125053 : ["Yes, he prays to Jesus", 10819, "ywAzJKgiaa", -3],
	125054 : ["The answer is really quite simple. The prayer offered by Stephen when he was being martyred is recorded at Acts 7:59, 60, which tells us: “And they went on casting stones at Stephen as he made appeal and said: ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong voice: ‘Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.' And after saying this he fell asleep in death.” Rather than indicating that Stephen understood both Jesus and Jehovah to be the same person, his prayer shows that he knew they were not, because he differentiates between the two. His request to Jesus he does not address merely to the Lord, but to the Lord Jesus, thus doing away with any ambiguity. Further, his statement shortly prior to this, as recorded in Acts 7:56, indicates two persons: “And he said: ‘Look! I behold the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God's right hand.'” He does not say the Son of man, Christ Jesus, is Jehovah God, but that he was standing at God's right hand. Not only does Stephen's request, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,” not prove the trinity, but Jesus' similar fervent prayer, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit,” conclusively shows that Jesus is not the same as his Father Jehovah. Luke 23:46. In the wording of his prayer Stephen showed that he understood the difference between Jehovah and the Lord Jesus as set out in Psalm 110:1 and applied by Jesus at Matthew 22:42-46. He was not perplexed by Jesus' application of it, as were the Pharisees to whom Jesus spoke and who were silenced by his answer. Jesus had taught his followers that the Father authorized him to raise others to life. (John 5:26; 6:40; 11:25, 26) So it was proper for Stephen to petition Jesus over this matter, and his prayer indicates proper understanding on his part. It does not support the trinity. (Acts 7:59-60) And they went on casting stones at Stephen as he made appeal and said: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 60 Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong voice: “Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.” And after saying this he fell asleep in death. (Acts 7:56) and he said: “Look! I behold the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God's right hand.” (Luke 23:46) And Jesus called with a loud voice and said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” When he had said this, he expired. (Psalm 110:1) The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: “Sit at my right hand Until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” (Matthew 22:42-46) “What do YOU think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David's.” 43 He said to them: “How, then, is it that David by inspiration calls him ‘Lord,' saying, 44 ‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet”'? 45 If, therefore, David calls him ‘Lord,' how is he his son?” 46 And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him, nor did anyone dare from that day on to question him any further. (John 5:26) For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself. (John 6:40) For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.” (John 11:25-26) Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life.

Let's be clear on this point.The president doesn't have the power,nor the right to do either act,only congress can make and make laws governing the American people.It is my belief that if these acts by the president are challenged in a court of law,he would lose as Truman lost when tried to force the steel companies to do his bidding on their production,We,like a bunch of \"sheep\"have not raised enough \"hell\"with out lawmakers over this,and these\"misfits\"will keep on breaking our laws until we do.Congress could have stopped this\"crap\"in the bud,but either were on-board with it,or too scared to open their mouths and protect our \"Rule of Law\",which is what we put them there for.Every American has a\"dog in this fight\"and had better wake up before we loose all our rights.Mark my words when I tell all of you that there is a \"storm\" just over the horizon about to sweep over our precious country,and when it comes a lot of good citizens will hurt in the process!History will show that we have the largest group of\"misfits\"in office running this country that America has ever had!

We've seen more insanity from this administration in 3 months than I've seen in my lifetime. There's nothing constitutional about this crap. Hell there's not even anything American about it. Unbelievable arrogance is what it is. These people have decided to make their own rules..the constitution be damned!

	125059 : [". The Star of David , known in Hebrew as the Shield of David  or Magen David (Hebrew מָגֵן דָּוִד; Biblical Hebrew Māḡēn Dāwīḏ, Tiberian [mɔˈɣen dɔˈvið], Modern Hebrew [maˈɡen daˈvid], Ashkenazi Hebrew and Yiddish Mogein Dovid [ˈmɔɡeɪn ˈdɔvid] or Mogen Dovid) is a generally recognized symbol of Jewish identity and Judaism.[1] Its shape is that of a hexagram, the compound of two equilateral triangles. The hexagram has been in use as a symbol of Judaism since the 17th century, with precedents in the 14th to 16th centuries in Central Europe, where the Shield of David was partly used in conjunction with the Seal of Solomon (the hexagram) on Jewish flags. Its use probably derives from medieval (11th to 13th century) Jewish protective amulets (segulot). The term \"Shield of David\" is also used in the Siddur (Jewish prayer book) as a title of the God of Israel.", 10826, "kIVxb7mWaa", 3],

Those not worthy of life, such as those that killed Jehovah's people through out history. Such as Adam and Eve(I don't think that they will be allowed to live again), they have killed everyone, those responsible for the death of Jesus Christ, serial killers, Hitler for killing Witnesses in camps, etc. 4. Those who are now dead who deserve another chance to follow Jehovah. Such as those who died before Jesus' arrival on Earth, those who lived in places before having a chance to hear about Jehovah in recent history or when there was no one to spread the Good News. 5. I would think upon death. 6. They are with those in death and hades. 7. All those dead in hell, hades or sheol will be resurrected after Armageddon and allowed to prove themselves worthy of following Jehovah God's instruction for a thousand years, those who are not will go into the second death or the symbolic lake of fire. 8. The eternal punishment means the constant reminding of the judgment against them from Jehovah and his people and is not a fiery torment. Steve", 10827, "None", 0],

I don't want to answer off the top of my head so I'm going to do some research and come back with answers from the Holy Scriptures.  I will also star your question so some of my brothers and sisters may answer as well.  TY Nevermind.  On further investigation it appears by your questions and answers that you are not really a seeker of truth but rather a person who merely ridicules.  Too Bad. Matthew 7:1-29 1 “Stop judging that YOU may not be judged; 2 for with what judgment YOU are judging, YOU will be judged; and with the measure that YOU are measuring out, they will measure out to YOU. 3 Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother's eye, but do not consider the rafter in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to extract the straw from your eye'; when, look! a rafter is in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First extract the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw from your brother's eye. 6 “Do not give what is holy to dogs, neither throw YOUR pearls before swine, that they may never trample them under their feet and turn around and rip YOU open.
