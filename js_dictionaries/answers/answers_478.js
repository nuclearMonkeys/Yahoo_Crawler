Not a pet, no, but a living creature just the same. I was about 5. I am 65 now, and I have never forgotten it. But has it caused an actual mental illness? No, but some sorrow and stress, yes.", 4155, "kcVcgnu1aa", 2],

	26441 : ["People tend not to train and socialize small dogs as often because they can get away with more. If a chihuahua charges someone angrily more people will be understanding and not as scared as if a larger breed like a labrador retriever came angrily charging - not to mention larger dogs will, naturally, cause more damage when aggressive and untrained. It's unfortunate and shitty that small dog owners don't take training as seriously but it's how it is. ", 4139, "k7fQrSSzaa", 2],

	26446 : ["You need to cut down on light. 8-12 hours is recommended. I would reduce to 8 and go from there. You may want to turn down the intensity of the light since it gets light from the sun. Adding plants and snails can help too. ", 4147, "aQZ25sJJaa", 2],
	26447 : ["Two suggestions: Avoid natural lighting as much as possible unless you need it for aquatic plants.  At least in theory, green light would be the best. Chlorophyll absorbs mostly red and blue light. Also, add snails. They area lot slower than a razor blade scraper but they work long hours without pay.", 4147, "DVdX6I4kaa", 2],
	26448 : ["I hope I can help with this. You and your boyfriend seem more than equipped to make tough decisions for your relationship. He made a choice, but it would be helpful if you channel your guilty feelings into empathy for your boyfriend. He is having a hard time because he gave up a beloved pet. You need to be there for him now. If it hurts you to see him this way, you may want to revisit whether bringing the bunny back is a sacrifice you are willing to make for him. Only you and he know if this was the right decision. If it was (and it seems like it was), guilty feelings need to be checked at the door and you need to help him mourn. Also, and I truly hope this helps, rabbits aren't rodents! They are lagomorphs. Maybe that will help you change your mind.", 4157, "JoldnYQOaa", 0],
	26449 : ["Yes you should feel guilty. You weren't considering his feelings and only were thinking about yourself. If you care as much as you say you do about your boyfriend then you would've been more sensitive to his feelings. Don't post a question like this if you can't handle the truth what people think. You gave him an ultimatum that it was you or his rabbit. I think you could've compromised but you have to live with your decision.", 4157, "DE1ZeK5xaa", 0],
	26450 : ["If you're going to tell people not to comment if they disagree with you, you don't want to know the truth about your decision. You just want to be reassured that you shouldn't feel guilty. You asked if it was wrong of you, and in my opinion and others (which you did ask for)...it kinda was? If you truly are uncomfortable around rodents (rabbits are not rodents by the way), its understandable. I don't think you're a bad person for feeling this way. What I see wrong with this instance is that you don't seem to take accountability for his choice (\"he made his choice, he didn't HAVE to give it away\") even though you should be thankful and empathetic that he loves you so much he gave away his beloved pet for you. I think you should try to be more understanding about his feelings right now, as it seems like you're taking them as a personal attack. Yes, he didn't HAVE to give it away, but he did for you. He chose being upset over losing his pet just to be with you. Let him be sad and treat him kindly right now. Basically, don't necessarily feel guilty for his choice if his rabbit really WAS a deal breaker for you, but also be understanding of his feelings and supportive of him right now.", 4157, "raYV95hmaa", 2],

BTW Rats do make really nice pets.  Mice are okay but their urine smells really strong.  Guinea pigs are skittish, and you have to be sure they don't fall.  They are fragile that way.  The same is even more true of hamsters.   I advise that, whatever pet you get, insist on handling it before you buy it. Otherwise you might get a pet with a bad temperament.   Are you open to getting a snake? ", 4168, "54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa", 3],

She plucked up the courage to touch one of my rats one time and was surprised at how soft she was, but that didn't make her a rat-lover. She just wanted to make her kids happy. So stop it.
