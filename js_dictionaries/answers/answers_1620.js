My fiance and I have been dating since high school and I knew he was the one after three months of dating.  We hoped to be married years ago, but decided to wait.  We are now 24 years old, and though we still believe we are meant for one another I am so glad that we waited!  At 24 I am working at my career, am living on my own independently (also never lived together) and it is great to know that although I want to depend on my husband I do not need to (and vice versa).  It is NOT easy!  But I strongly believe that we will have a stronger marriage because we have become stronger people.  If something happens and a pregnancy happens accidently (which is not uncommon) we are in a position to take care of children.  I am not doubting your maturity, I just cannot stress how ready I am now, compared to the feeling I had when I was 19 and felt ready.  Congratulations either way, it sounds like you are a wonderful girl.", 9236, "None", 4],

Personally, I think there's no such thing as \"unconditional love\" unless it's in regards to your children. Think about what that's saying. You would still love him and want to be with him no matter what? I'm sure he could make some life choices and hurt you in ways that would change that. I'm not saying he will, I'm just pointing out that it's a bit silly to say you love him unconditionally.

	86704 : ["As others have already pointed out, your present contract holds good during the agreed period, what you are looking at is wether or not you want to accept a new contract on new terms which is being offered to you. You don't actually say it but is the landlord the prison service itself. If so I can see that as threats to security, real or imagined, continue they are trying to reduce the number of unaccountable people acessing the area.  Would I be right in assuming you have  a 'club premises certificate' , granted by your local licensing authority on the basis of you being a 'bona fide' club, min 25 members, rules etc. and alcohol supplied only to members. If so, when you go on to say ' private functions' what I suspect you really mean is that you hire out your clubs facilities to non members, ie the public, albeit you will select those people carefully. Once you hire out in that way you should be holding a 'premises licence' as well as your club premises certificate.  This would all make sense then of the security concerns of your landlord.  What I suggest you do is check your licensing status with your local council. If I am on the right tracks try approaching your landlord and see if they would agree to some sort of condition in your tenancy agreement where you still hire out to non members but have a built in vetting period of such users, perhaps require a guest list to be available, require them to have temporary membership of your club, install CCTV monitoring that effectively records all people entering etc. Sorry this is a bit long, I'll watch to see if you add more info. I would also need to check anything especially relevant to the prison service regs which I haven't done and don't have access to in answering this for you. Added later following your further details: Yes I can understand what you say about the Prison Service & Govnrs. 'pushing you out', a similar thing had been happening at Police Clubs on Police Authority premises but I come back to a very basic issue, your 'contract' relating to the use of the building.  If you really do have a contract then a contract is legally binding and you need to look at all the terms and conditions of it. If, as you say you are independant and truly financially independant of the Prison Service then your destiny is your own until the contract comes up for renewal.  There is not normally any obligation upon a landlord to renew a lease and that is the position you'll be in when your contract/ lease runs out. As for saying your contract ends when there is a new committee baffles me.  The fact that you say in your initial question that the landlord changed the contract also baffles me, any change to an exisiting contract can only be done by mutual consent and the fact that you say the landlord has changed it, suggests, on the facts given that you are actually being offered a new one with the new terms, and, as you are, or if you are,  financially independant the only logical reason is one dressed up as security concerns. Added later: I've looked at your latest information added, and your previously posted question about your club problem. I have noted that you didn't and indeed don't ever select an answer yourself, but leave it to a vote.  That's a bit disapointing as it would be nice to see what comfort you yourself take from the answers you get. The general consensus emerging both from what you yourself say, in this and the previous question and those who responded and voted for you seems to be that your club is on prison office property  and therefore you have to accept that the Govenor has the final say in how, when and in what circumstances you operate. That may disappoint you, indeed I'm sure it will. I don't think any of us can help you 'long distance on yahoo' anymore much as we might try. Maybe, as someone said last time, if your members want the facility and more advice they need to demonstrate that by contributing financially to a 'rescue' fund and taking the paper work to a local person for on the spot advice.
