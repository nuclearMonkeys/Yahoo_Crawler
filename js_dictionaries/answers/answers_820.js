Medications like that can't be removed by anything other than distillation. And note, humans can't drink distilled water until it has been enriched with minerals again or else it will strip minerals from your body.  So the fact is, even the most fancy bottled water or organic, sustainable vegetable is loaded with Prozac and Zolft from Uncle Joe's piss anyway, rendering worrying about meat or anything else fairly moot.
