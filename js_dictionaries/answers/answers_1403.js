	75798 : ["The Bible books written by Matthew, John, James, and Peter, were written by men who were/are part of the original 12 disciples. Mark (John Mark) probably saw Jesus and may have spoken with Him. Luke was a physician and may have experienced Jesus first hand. Paul may have seen Jesus, but probably did not speak with Jesus until his experience on the Damascus road, but he did know Jesus first hand after that, as it is written that he know everything that the original 12 knew when he compared notes with Peter in Acts. Jude is also a brother of James, who both experienced Jesus more than the other 12 Apostles, as James and Jude were sons of Jesus mother, Mary and therefore step brothers of Jesus.  All of the New Testament was written by men who's lived were directly impacted by Jesus.

	75802 : ["Online shopping is convenient and can save you money, but it's not quite the same as shopping in the high street. At its best, you can purchase items from trusted, well-established retailers - although, of course, you can't actually inspect the goods. But at its worst, shopping on the web can be more like using your credit card at a car boot sale to buy goods in unmarked sealed cardboard boxes. Anyone can create a web page, so there's no immediate way for a shopper to tell whether an online shop is genuine at first sight. So there's more to being safe than just ensuring your card transaction is encrypted. Firstly, ask yourself whether the offer is realistic. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Quite a lot of stolen and sub-standard goods get offered at seemingly huge discounts by small traders on auction and free advertisement sites. Online 'sales' of non-existent event tickets are notorious. But even mainstream dealers frequently limit your ability to check what you're buying - photos of goods with captions like \"the item supplied may not be identical to that illustrated\" are all too common. It's a sad fact that many perfectly honest online business owners simply don't understand their legal obligations. But that makes it difficult to distinguish between them and less legitimate traders.
