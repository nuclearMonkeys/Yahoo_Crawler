Everyone in the NFL is a system player. This isn't basketball where 1 guy can run the floor and dunk the ball.

	33725 : ["I think its beyond them now and Liverpool's home form is very poor. I just can't understand how they just collapsed to that defeat after that terrific win v Arsenal last weekend.

Doing whatever you can to make sure your team is the winner at the end. Brady I hear sacrificed bigger paydays to ensure this. For me of all the QBs in the NFL during Brady's era.
