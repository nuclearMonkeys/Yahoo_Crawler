	48390 : ["I love pixie cuts. If you look at any celeb with a pixie (compared to older pics when they had longer hair) - they always look better with the pixie. Pixie cuts look modern and cool and are very easy to maintain. If you are not in the mood to fuss with it, just slick it back. Pixies can look sophisticated and very youthful and girl-next-door.  I vote YES. You can always buy a cheap pixie cut wig and see how it looks before the big chop.", 6838, "Xlr2xG9daa", -1],

	48397 : ["Good chance, yes, but no guarantees.  (I'd love to get my hands on such a hoard - it's fun just going through it all!)  As Dragon says below, do not clean the coins; it degrades them. Coin value depends mostly on two things: condition and rarity.  Also they automatically have some intrinsic value if they're made with silver or gold.  Any dime, quarter, or half dollar minted before 1965 is 90% silver.  Half dollars from 1965-70 are 40% silver.  Any nickel with a big letter over the dome of Monticello is 35% (these were made during WWII).  All other modern coins are base metal, usually cupro-nickel. Rarity generally means how many of that date (and mint mark - mint marks are important) were made.  In general, those with a mint mark - usually D (Denver) or S (San Francisco) - are rarer than those without a mint mark (Philadelphia), but that's just on average.  Condition is something you should start to get a feel for; there are guides online that should give you some idea what the various grades are like.  The more worn, pitted, gouged, etc. (especially if they have a hole drilled through them) the worse the condition. To value your coins you can consult with sites online that can give you a ballpark figure for how much they're worth, but again it will help to tutor yourself on condition first.  If you were in the Sacramento area I'd volunteer to have a crack at these myself.", 6840, "P8dIznazaa", 0],
	48398 : ["You didn't land into a Goldmine, sorry. My Brother collects and he does it, cause it means something to him. Banks take them for face value and maybe a penny is worth 10 cents. Look it up though cause if he had silver, or certain mints are worth a bunch to collectors. You could have some crazy ****, who knows, YOU OBVIOUSLY DONT, hahaha. Here is the question, if his collection was worth a thousand bucks, would you sell it knowing that it wouldnt probably pay for an eighth of what you want to do? ", 6840, "AKZYBFTxaa", 0],

It may be, yeah, rather sure it's just a \"Completist\" mentality, plus, damn, Hotwheels are awesome. When I worked at Walmart, third shift, used to talk to a regular who would pop in most mornings on his way to work. Coolest guy ever, would ask me if any new cases were opened. I fell out of collecting a few years ago though. I still see my collection from time to time and think about keeping up, but I don't feel the need to run to the toy department when I'm buying food, hahaha. 27? You got a few more years, hope he sticks with it longer though, hahaha. Get into it, Hotwheels are NOT Matchbox. I've had Girlfriends who would buy me Hotwheels, Even if I had them (I forget what I have) I wouldn't say anything. I NEVER paid more than $20 for a toy car though, but some are worth twice that much. Scalpers will buy dollar toys and resell them for $5-$10, people suck. It's something he can leave to the future. Those \"Redlines\" are worth a bit, can't retire on the profit, but that's why it's not about resale, it's just about how fricken cool Hotwhells are, hahaha. If you Love him, buy him a Hotwheel this  . HAHAHAHA. Mattel actually releases   Special vehicles. Normally in like 7 styles. You see one of them and he hasn't already ran into the Toy Department yet, buy it for him. P.S. No Hot Wheel is worth more that much, and anything now will not be worth crap, so mass produced. but look at this. Kids opened all of their cars back then, so to find a Perfect, is worth a **** ton, yeah, but I would actually open the blister pack, hahahah, just out of spite, :) Like pissing on a Monet.

There are short styles that are not the hard masculine looking pixie. even as few as two or three inches longer than a pixie can look feminine and soft. Look up hair style websites to get a better understanding of what's out there in hair styles. Make a consultation appointment with a stylist and bring along some pictures. Talk to the stylist about your hair needs, how much work you are willing to do, and be honest about your worries and concerns.
