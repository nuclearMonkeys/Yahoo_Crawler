	33962 : ["Spurs are freakin terrible, you wouldn't have guessed Spurs needed a win badly today, I think Cavani has really improved United's attack they've now got a great mix of experience and youth in the team.", 5155, "cq22NZX5aa", 0],
	33963 : ["Why do Man United fans always complain about this shite. Remember when Pogba tripped himself? Remember when Maguire dragged Azpilicueta down? Get over it As for the win, great win in the race for the second place trophy. All a good finish to the season does is keeps Ole there for longer. It's easier for this United team to play well when there's nothing to play for. I don't know why United fans continue to celebrate this stuff and praise the team when Ole and his players are weak. This win would mean a lot more if United were close behind City. So what you secure top 4 and get knocked out of the champions league early again next season? Is that all Man United fans want these days? ", 5155, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],
	33964 : ["False, Sam Darnold will be entering his 4th NFL season. If he was going to be anything great, he would have shown it by now. Darnold is always going to be a below average quarterback, regardless of whether the Jets trade him or not.", 5127, "THzsKAEhaa", 0],
	33965 : ["There should be a priority of factors when choosing clubs.  Mine is Feel, Price, then Looks.  Swing the clubs and find out which ones feel best.  The ones that feel best generally translates into better rounds.  Either way, at some point, your feel will change with the clubs and you may start looking for another set.", 5162, "xDINUPBuaa", 0],
	33966 : ["I think Bayern ARE better than PSG. It's still worrying, losing at home to Bayern ; who were without two of their top strikers, including Lewandowski for both games. Bayern had just done 7 straight European qualifications against French teams I don't think PSG will get to the final : facing Barcelona and Bayern will've been too much. It's true they've got through despite injuries etc. ; but I think Man City will knock them out", 5156, "2ifr1sIRaa", 1],

	33969 : ["not weird, but it certainly conveys your intentions.  but as a guy who loves golf, it would be rude to turn the gift away, but unless the golf ball is the one I play with, I wouldn't use it, which would hurt your feelings.  But, I would store it somewhere or put it on display at work just to remember the gesture.

	33971 : ["Then quit.  I made peace with the fact that I'll always be a single-digit handicapper (got as low as a 2.3 index, right now I'm at a 6.4) a while back and I'm actually enjoying it more. If you can't just enjoy the game for what it is, maybe it's not for you.  You could always find a mini-tour that will take you (and your four-figure entry fee every week where you have to top-10 to make your money back) and see how that goes.To even think about being a professional your index should be in the +5 to +7 range (if you went out on the Korn Ferry or even the McKenzie Tour with a 0 handicap, you're getting slaughtered), and even then, playing tournament golf has zero relationship with playing casual rounds.  I've watched enough tournament rounds inside the ropes from being a volunteer marshal; they're playing a completely different game than mortals are.  ", 5158, "Pc0QjrQ4aa", 0],

	33976 : ["Sure its possible, but most golf courses aren't going to allow you to just parade people across the greens - especially not women in heels. They spend lots of time and money trying to keep the greens nicely manicured and they aren't likely to allow any extra foot traffic on them. Even if you found a course to allow it women's heels would sink into the soft soil. You'd be better off just having the event in a clubhouse - plenty of courses have ballroom/conference hall areas that can be rented out for these types of events but the actual fashion parade will probably need to be on a cart path with the course in the background, not actually ON the course.", 5161, "Jvx658HFaa", 0],

	33983 : ["Could be but it doesn't make sense. They can be pissed at him as much as they want but these allegations, really lower his trade value.

	33991 : ["He was a unanimous all-American and won the John Mackey award. I don't recall much media hype. Good player who isn't talked about much =/= overrated.  Kiper is evaluating prospects and projecting them to the next level.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 5173, "None", 0],
