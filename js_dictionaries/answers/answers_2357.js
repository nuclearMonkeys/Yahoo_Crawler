	123676 : ["I didn't realize that the idea that we, as a free nation should hold to our constitution was racist. People sat by and watched as the Obama administration demonized those \"speculators\" and such.....when the real fact is these speculators are nothing more than investors and companies who invested in Chrysler as part of a mutual fund or 401K. These bond holders weren't given a seat at Obama's table or a say while the government maneuvered to take over the company and / or hand it to the government friendly people...like the unions. And that's racist ? Maybe people need to go back and read up on Reagan. He didn't \"reach across the isle\", he didn't cozzy up to the political enemy to win, he had a deeper recession than we have now and the democrats owned the house and the senate. He simply took it to the people, told them what he wanted to do and why and he was popular or doing so. Small government and conservative values have worked every time for this country. Seems the Obama administration is purposely ignoring what has worked and trying to force the socialistic agenda to....which historically would be a first in America. how about reviewing Janeane Garofalo's jaded and often dumb positions in the past as part of her \"resume\" of political stupidity ?", 10754, "Mhm3J5g0aa", 3],

It's not about the amount of spending...it's how the money is being spent.  Obama seems hell-bent on giving money to people as hand-outs for failing in life while punishing those who have worked their way to the top (or at least some level of financial stability).

Though he had good ideals and great public speaking talent, he had his own prejudices. He was a mastermind of the Congress. He did not like sharing power. Hence he sidelined Bose, Ambedkar, Jinnah and many other leaders of that time. He supported casteism against equality of all Indians.  He said casteism is a pillar of Indian culture. In one of his non cooperation movement, the sex workers approached him to participate in it. But he did not allow them to participate. He also sidelined many Muslim members of Congress, which made them leave Congress and create Muslim League. Many also debate about his unclear secularism, and his shoddy work during communal riots. He was also against industrialism. Another truth less known is that the British raj did not grant independence because of Gandhi's struggle.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: Steve Marquis Telephone Number: 425-698-7084 Email Address: peoplesvoice@peoplespassions.org Web site address:  Lawsuits Starting Across the Nation Proceeding to Avert Potential Constitutional Crisis, Possible Civil Unrest, and Confidence in Elections; Lawsuits are being filed in Eight States Seeking to Require Barack Obama to Provide Certification of Birth in U.S. or Be Removed as Presidential Candidate on State Ballots. Seattle WA. 10/22/2008 — Lawsuits in eight states as of this writing– Hawaii, Washington, California, Florida, Georgia. Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut, are seeking judicial authority to force the certifying or decertifying of Senator Barack Obama's qualification to run as a candidate for President as a natural born U.S. citizen. Previously, two lawsuits have failed to force the certifying documents from Obama.  Philip Berg's months-long lawsuit in Federal Court in Philadelphia reached a dramatic plateau yesterday as Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) failed to respond to the court that Mr. Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen and therefore not qualified to run for office of President of the U.S. They admitted to Obama's non-qualification by their failure to respond to a 30-day court ordered discovery in which Obama and the DNC were ordered to answer a petition by Berg. Berg is a lifelong Democrat in the Pennsylvania Democratic Party who has sought to ratchet up the legal pressure as Obama and the DNC has continually delayed providing certifying documentation of Obama's birth, which he claims to have been in Hawaii.  A lawsuit in Honolulu in the First District Court is seeking a court-order to open Obama's secret birth records. Obama has thus far neglected a Freedom of Information request for the records at two hospitals in Hawaii. Lawsuits in Washington and Georgia are seeking state Superior Courts to force the states' Secretary of State, as the chief state elections officer, to perform their state constitutional duties to require original certifying birth records from Mr. Obama that would verify his birth in Hawaii.   Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution reads: “\"No Person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.\" There are numerous allegations to Obama's claim of natural birth in the U.S. on the web and in the media, all raising suspicion and doubt as to Obama's actual place of birth and qualification to run for president. Some of the assertions to which Obama “admitted” on Berg's suit are: he was born in Mombassa, Kenya in 1961 while his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was married to Barack Obama Sr., a Kenyan; when his mother, divorced from Obama Sr, moved to Indonesia and married Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian, Obama was adopted by Soetoro and became an Indonesian citizen; while in Indonesia, Obama had his name changed to Barry Soetoro; Obama traveled to Pakistan in 1981 under an Indonesian passport when Pakistan was a no travel zone for Americans; Obama had “admitted” to receiving illegal contributions in his campaign for president. Additionally, there is an allegation that Obama's Kenyan grandmother claims that Obama was born in Kenya; Muammar Gadhafi, leader of Libya, has publicly claimed that Obama was born in Kenya and studied in Muslim schools in Indonesia. Obama has also “admitted” to hold citizenship in another country (the U.S. Constitution forbids dual citizenship).    Non-partisan and independent reviews and examinations of Obama's birth certificate as shown on his official website has evidence of tampering and in any case does not list any of the points of information commonly found which would make it traceable and verifiable such as hospital, doctor, size weight, foot prints etc.  Interestingly, all these state lawsuits would be dropped if Mr. Obama would simply provide the requested documents supporting his claim of being born in Hawaii.  Lawsuits in additional states are being added each day.
