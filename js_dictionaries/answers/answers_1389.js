They just see an American Muslim spreading the truth of Islam so they try to break down his image. He had nothing to do with 9/11 and as for the fort hood shooter, supposedly they exchanged a few emails. Of course they are going to blow it out of proportion and make it seem like he was behind it. They Fort Hood shooter was just asking him question, spiritual advice. Not terrorism. The actions of the Fort Hood shooter was an individual choice. So he did lectures on Jihad? That's not terrorism. Jihad does not equal terrorism. Our prophet (pbuh) lectured on Jihad, would you consider him a terrorist? Every group of people has their self defense, for Muslims it is Jihad. In Jihad no innocents shall be killed. Only those in combat. When Muslims are attacked, we fight back and that is Jihad. Wake up, there is a war with Muslims. People are invading our lands one after another, but when Muslims fight back that's terrorism? I don't think so, see cause Awlaki is speaking up against the people invading our countries and killing innocent Muslims, so that's why they are trying to brainwash people to believe he is a \"terrorist.\" \"Surely the learned imams aren't for terrorism? I though Islam was a religion of peace\" Yes Islam is a religion of peace, you can not judge a faith based on the actions of followers. You judge by the teachings. Even if an Imam is a terrorist supporter, that does not reflect Islam. :)", 8787, "1cgRjCnJaa", 2],

	75057 : ["Have you ever heard of a \"sin tax?\"  Government for decades has been taxing some products because they are considered \"bad\" for society.  The \"economics\" of it, is that if a product is more costly, fewer people will use it. Tobacco, alcohol and gambling are all such products/services that have been taxes at a higher rate to both discourage use, and raise more funding to pay for the \"costs to society\" of those products. Skin cancer is a terrible disease, and it's well known that people who get more sun, and tans, have higher rates of skin cancer.  You do not put on \"skin block\" sun-tan lotion when paying for a tan from a tanning studio, that makes the strength and possible cancer rates higher, than being in the sun, using sun-block cream. People who pay $20 now for a treatment, may now be charged $22.00, this will break the small businessman how?  Some will absorb part of the tax, and may only raise costs $1.00 to cover higher taxation.  Again, this will hurt them how? The benefits to society will improve some, with lower national debt and perhaps 2-3 percent of the regular \"sun-tanners\" reducing their use of the service.  Two-Three percent fewer cases of skin cancer over 20 yrs will save the health care industry billions of dollars (more of which is being paid by government now through payments to Medicare and Medicaid).

The politicians of both parties have been looting our economy for decades, to benefit their cronies, special interests, and give away billions to foreign governments (who hate us).

Two examples: Iraq & Afghanistan - the coalition (Australia, Canada) assaults on these two countries brought nothing but sheer terror & misery to countless millions.  Creating millions who will seek and exact out revenge against the US & UK interests including their respective citizens. Palestine & Israelis The continuation of Israel`s policies against Palestinian & Lebanese Peoples is a very serious factor.  Dropping Molten Lead & White Phosphorous on to defenceless civilians including young children is a terrorist act.   Creating Palestinian ghettoes in Gaza & Gaza City & West Bank and preventing sustenance & medical supplies and commodities necessary for life from reaching those who need them is terrorism.  All done at the conivance of UK/US governments. The bombing of Colonel Gaddaffi`s HQ in Libya by American aircraft that was terrorism.

Perhaps he is looking for Obama's birth certificate or, has something more pressing like a golf game as after all, that is one of the president's priorities.   Presidents set the tone of the address and Obama set the bar too low. The Supremes should not be expected to sit there and be subjected to berating and attack - particularly as they are not allowed to respond in like kind.

Their motivation was revenge too- revenge for months and in one case YEARS of mistreatment and bullying by their peers. They killed 4 of their classmates and a teacher, and wounded 10 other people.
