With insurance your out of pocket will vary.  My husband had to pay around 900 after the insurance was applied and a discount for turning in his old pump.  New pumps turn up regularly such as the omnipod.   Also there are supplies you must purchase regularly such as the infusion sets etc.  Depending on the model and what your insurance will cover the cost will vary.  Without insurance a 3 month setup will run around 400-500.  With insurance your out of pocket can be around 100 or less (our new insurance covered the whole expense miraculously).  Also, my husband doesn't change things out as often as recommended so his 3 month supply usually lasted longer.   My husband loves having a pump and would never willingly go without one again.  He has a lot more freedom as to what he can eat and also improved his ability to maintain his sugar levels.  Yes, he still must check his blood a lot and monitor things as he always did (you cannot just go on autopilot even if you have a sensor), but it just makes the management so much better.", 9413, "644561bc5c6b0a61400f820f69acc4b0aa", 1],

	91810 : ["At the same time I practiced the fun rituals having to do with   Claus, I also learned about what it was to be this guy who gave something to everybody. As I grew up, one of my favorite shows was the Rankin-Bass production, \"  Claus is Coming to Town.\" My other favorite was \"Scrooge,\" the perennial retelling of Charles Dickens' \"A   Carol.\" From both of these I learned that   was about compassion, love, charity, and happy festivity. They all go hand-in-hand. So I learned about   Claus, Sinterklaas, Father  , and the Three Wise Men who bore gifts to the Christ Child, and learned why all these gifts were given. They were given out of love. It was a changeover that my parents started very young, and, yes, they, in their explanations to me about   Claus, brought up the historic persons off whom   Claus was modeled--very loving and giving people. But I still believed. At one time, though, I was over at my grandparents' house with my family, and I was looking in the closet in which they usually kept the games that we kids would play when we'd come over to visit. I looked and saw that the first game wasn't familiar, and then the next, then the next--I didn't recognize any of them (Uh-oh). So I brought Dad secretly over to the closet, showed him the evidence, and asked, \"Are you and Mom   Claus?\" Dad answered, \"What do you think?\" That he didn't give me a straight answer baffled me more, but I worked it out that the one who brought presents in the night for me and my sisters to open on X-mas were Mom and Dad. When it was obvious all my sisters knew, we didn't pretend it anymore, but we did still decorate and celebrate the trimmings and all. For that I am grateful, because compassion, charity, happiness, and love are completely linked with each other, and it really would be a tragedy to let all the celebration of that disappear just because of a single legend. And another bit of proof was my suspicion that when I opened the electronics games, Mom knew exactly how to play them. (\"Oh, Honey,   Claus showed me last night how to work this so I could show you!\") And also, it seemed   spent a whole lot of time at my house on   Eve night, what with all the toys and teaching Mom how to work the games and all. o.O", 9411, "Htd1Wuw1aa", 0],
