It's not always malicious, some people were just brought up this way.  If they keep doing it on purpose after being asked not to, and you do have to tell them because people aren't psychic, then it can be construed as bullying.  I would make an exception for someone with a speech impediment and let them find their best version of my name.", 4701, "SHiRD91Oaa", 1],

On the other hand, my American friends have all just done it straight off the bat, and it's come across as a sign of affection, so yeah, I'm okay with that, even though it was strange the first time someone did it, probably because I was in my mid 20's the first time it happened (a guy I was seeing at the time). Up until then, not even my own family had been shortening it, albeit they do use a completely different nickname for me.

I do feel for you as it would have been a huge let down too. I would also be concerned that your boy friend of six years hasn't proposed to you long ago as some thing is wrong that your relationship is still in the dating process and hasn't moved on to marriage. Why not confront your boy friend with this as you haven't got forever to enter into the  permanent relation of marriage and see what he has to say? If he is really serious about you he has to make a decision about the future for you both and if he is hesitant about doing so, better you make it plain to him that you have waited long enough and you now need him to be open. If he isn't prepared to make the commitment and propose marriage, it's then your turn to simply tell him that you are not prepared to wait any longer and this will bring every thing to the surface. He will then get the message that as you are wanting a permanent relationship with the security of marriage, you could possible move on to some one who IS prepared to offer the security that you require. The dating process should have NEVER gone on for 6 years without a marriage proposal and you really DON'T have forever because you might wish to have a family and your body clock also won't keep ticking forever either.

If you feel that you get on with this guy then I would consider giving him a chance and getting to know him. Ultimately, guys rely on getting little hints to guide them as to how you are feeling so that they know whether or not to continue talking to you or to back off. Therefore, when you see him, try making conversation with him by asking him questions that will get him to reveal his personality. You can also do things like compliment him and asking him to lunch. Both of those are great ways of letting a guy know that you enjoy his company. Finally, no one can force you into doing anything that you do not feel comfortable with.
