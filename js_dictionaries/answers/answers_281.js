	14061 : ["Yes. I have insurance through my employer and pay for additional coverage. We have private insurance on my husband. And I insure my children with a minimal amount for literally pennies a month through my employer. While we would never expect anything to happen to them, the insurance would cover the costs of burial so I wouldn't have to deal with that stress during a truly horrific time.", 2346, "KESlvKqQaa", 2],

	14071 : ["Many contractors will accept checks or money orders. It actually saves them the fees on the credit card transactions. They generally want a downpayment and then progress payments.  Have you followed up with the contractors? There is a huge run on home renovations right now. They're busy and some building materials are hard to come by which may mean that they don't want to quote until closer to the time they're available to do the job.", 2337, "p0guNQhiaa", 5],

	14079 : ["You are attempting to time the market, something that is notoriously difficult and fails often enough that most investors believe it is unwise. I never feel investing is stocks is totally safe and I am always prepared for market downturns.  There are ways to hedge investments, but they generally cost money.

It looks to me like you are willing to learn a bit more about Financial and Life advise in general.  A good place to start is simply YouTube.  There is a guy in YouTube called Professor Choy.  He has two playlists, one is called Simple Steps for a Better Financial Future and the other is called Investing for Beginners.  His videos are short and full of useful information.  Good luck!", 2356, "lUlMq5QWaa", 1],

Depending on the cost of coverage and the treatment you are getting, it may be less expensive for you to pay out of pocket for those visits than pay for cobra.  Before paying for cobra, you should find out the cash price.

	14091 : ["Never seen a Homeowners policy with a deductible on liability coverage or one that raises the premium due to claims.  If yours does either it is time to change companies. Answers that so state are based on experience with auto insurance contracts.

Most have requirements to get notified right away. If you are confident in your friend only wanting a small payment then best of luck. Also, just because they were injured on your property does not always mean it is your fault. If you were playing ball and they missed it and took it to the face, that is not your fault. If they tripped down normal stairs, also not your fault.  It comes down to whether or not you failed in your duty of care. Was something dangerous that you did not repair or failed to tell them about, then you would be liable. If it was just something that happened and they were a willing participant then you are likely not liable.  Talk to your insurance agent to figure this out.

	14098 : ["By that standard, real estate is a sin as well. Like a stock, its price depends entirely on the willingness of the buyer to pay, while its actual value depends on its (or the company's) condition and can go poof at any time. You could receive an insane amount of money for selling it, and the buyer is left with nothing if the house catches on fire the following week.", 2359, "None", 0],
	14099 : ["Owning a stock is owning a business. Would he say owning a business isn't legit?  It's also a simplistic understanding of the stock market.  He's not taking into consideration things like growth and dividends.  Stocks grow and markets grow and economies grow. The market as a whole is worth vastly more than it was 100 years ago even if you account for inflation. If you buy a stock at $1 and sell it for $2 and the stock never goes below $2 again, then who lost money?  Also, dividends. Say there's a stock that sells for $1. You buy it and hold it long enough to earn $1 in dividends. You then sell it for 50 cents. Did you lose money? Even though the stock price dropped by half you still gained 50 cents. ", 2359, "None", 0],

	14107 : ["Firstly, in the UK, more men are 'super fat' than men. And, in the USA there isn't much difference between the sexes. So your question should be - why are 90% of people super fat. And the answer to that is bad diet, too much fast food, too little exercise. On top of that, it's deemed to be 'acceptable' at any weight. People aren't called fat any more, they are plus size or curvy.... There is a US TV reality show where the main stars are two grossly obese sisters and so on.....", 2365, "lIO4uiJmaa", 3],
