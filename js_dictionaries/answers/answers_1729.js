Sorry to hear that yours were as well. If I may get this off my chest...................... 2006 ended with my boyfriend of 4 years drunk as a skunk at my home, vodka & beer bottles everywhere. While in a drunken state, when I was attending 3 seminars out of town, he let 2 of my dogs out. The lil pooches got picked up by the pound and when I got back after 5 days...it cost me $250 to rescue my animals from the pound.  My boyfriend and I broke up repeatedly, and got back together repeatedly. My sex life was nill......(5 times in 4 months) with the boyfriend that everyone we know swears is bi or gay.  Moved my business accross town and had to fire an employee for theft. The fired employee last week, then opened up a business (in the same field as I) and took occupancy of my old building. She stole my client list and is passing herself off to my clients....as me. Had a nervous breakdown and thought of suicide but instead, checked myself into a Behavior Medical Clinic for 3 days to take a time out from all the stress. Work 6 days a week usually 50 to 70 hours per week. Have two children (1 teenager- 1 under 10) an exhusband, boyfriend, and a few close friends. A home with two mortgages, 6 dogs (one pregnant), 5 birds, and no help. I can't wait for the stress of the holidays to resolve itself inevitably to an ending. Can only do my best to make it a happy ending as can all of you. Happy New Year! :)~", 9432, "8905e8b07ee4d5c82f6a8e2441951ef8aa", 0],

	92165 : ["I saw where the bride has a 1950 kind of shower, they dressed up and wore hats and heels. One of the gifts was a frilly organdy apron, a joke on the very liberated bride.  Mostly the shower theme is done for the type of gift recommended. Lingerie shower, kitchen shower, hour of the clock shower[every guest is given a time of day, and buy the bride something useful at that hour. 6am might be an alarm clock, or a coffee maker],household shower, bon voyage shower.  One shower was called a stock up practical shower. One of the guests took a silver aluminum garbage can, and painted it in bright flowers, and loaded it with cleaning products as well as garbage can bags. Another stuck a bow on a kitchen garbage can, and filled it with kitchen brushes and cleaning products.  I have seen showers where the guests were asked to bring something, like a recipe, or a small kitchen gadget. Rivers has been known to tie a kitchen gadget onto a package as part of the bow.  Match the cake to the theme. One cake had airport luggage destination stickers all over it, Paris, Rome, each with a tiny picture of the corresponding tourist icon of that city. So cute and detailed.  One bride had favorite flowers and colors. She got two cakes, one  cake had pansies on it, the other violets.  Have a polka dot shower. Black and white dots everywhere. Try to find black and white shower favors, guest gifts, candy. Theme the invitations, the cake, the decorations. Gee, ask the  the guests to wear black and/or  white, only if they really want to. . .", 9428, "AA10927032", 0],

	92170 : ["In the day and age that we live in, I think a unique name is a wonderful thing, it sets the child apart. The child has the oppurtunity to be an individual and will probably have a deeper sense of self pride. Part of being a kid is making fun, and teasing, so every child has to go thru that at some point. I don't know what was worse; being called Coffee all thru school, and sometimes still to this day by old classmates or the fact that everywhere I go there are at least 3 people with the same first name I have. With there being so many different cultures in the world, alot of the names are unique to the different cultures. Being black American is a culture all it's own, and in much the same way we may see a foreign name, like one above, and think it's weird and difficult to pronouce, our names are viewed the same way. Back in the days it was customary for a child's name to have meaning, not be made up. Even common names can be slaughtered and I think sometimes the black community catches a bad rap because of names that we give our children that are based on material things, (Porsche, Mercedes, Alize, Remy, etc,); but if the name is something unique without any ties to a product or brand name, I don't see anything wrong with it. My child has a unique name because I have a common name and his dad is a Jr, we wanted him to have his own identity, and grow up to be his own man. His name was a collaboration between his dad and I; I didn't agree on the name he chose, and he didn't agree on mine, so after a little brainstorming we came up with our child's name. I've heard about 3 pronuncations of my baby's name, but he knows his name, and will correct them if they say it wrong. So maybe it is not the name, it's the connection the brain has with the mouth that might be a little off. Mostly though I find that it is non- blacks who pronounced the names wrong. God created us all to be different, it would be a boring world if we were all Sarah's or Melissa. Find a unique name, but keep in mind one day the baby is going to have to learn to spell it.

Here is the story (and it is 100% true) : My aunt subbed at an elementary once for a second grade class.  There were twin boys in the class.  The first one's name is pronounced or-AN-ja-lo.

Now you're kind of thinking that it is really wierd that these names rhyme...But the last part is the kicker: They wrote their names down on paper for their worksheet or something and they were spelled Orangejello and Lemonjello. I swear to god, if I ever meet that woman/man/both I will lead them into a dark alley and beat them up!!!

Most people who have these names are poor souls who have to deal with people mispronouncing and misspelling their names... and that'll be the case for their entire life!   Yes, people in biblical times named their children from their respective languages... but the actually had meaning.  Those who try to be clever changing the spelling for the anemic desire to make it unique or special are not making it unique or special in the true sense of things.
