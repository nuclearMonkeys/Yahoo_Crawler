	88566 : ["Morality being the eveidence of a god is unrealistic. morality is something man has created.  all you have to do is look at the tribes where no white man has brought his ways into their lives and see that they have been living a lot more peacibly than sophysticated societies", 9298, "ttCkz39aaa", 0],
	88567 : ["I personally wouldn't have done that. You should have thawed it the day before Thanksgiving in cool water.

	88570 : ["Nail polish will last for a very long time if you store it in the fridge, so I always store mine in there. It won't really make a thicker polish thinner, so that might be wishful thinking on your part. If you have a color you really like, however, you can thin it with some nail polish thinner (OPI makes some, and there are also other brands available at beauty supply stores), or, you can add just a drop or two of non-acetone nail polish remover. The nail polish remover is more of a quick fix, but it will help thin it out a bit if it's going on too thick. Next time you buy new polish, just start storing it in the fridge from the beginning, and you will find it lasts a lot longer.", 9301, "AA10246871", 0],

	88575 : ["there is no 'objective morality' morals change from civilisation to civilisation, some are common to all societys like not killing ect. these are present because they have to be for a comunity to survive. almost all the things god suposedly did and order others to do in the bible are imoral.", 9298, "None", 4],

You could do the cold water on Sunday, then unwrap and take the gravy package out etc.  If it is still very frozen in the inside, put it in the water some more.

And one day she will be QUEEN!! Her parents have been able to afford a pretty good life for the gal, but none the less, she's done them proud, and played a very clever game over the years. Considering that she's kept him up until now, ('royal' men are notorious for their philandering) in the 8 years since the age of 20ish she's somehow managed to prove to him that she's well deserving of the status of (his) Queen.  I think she's an inspiration because she's living proof that anything is achievable if you really want it, She's undoubtedly fashioned her general demeanour on that of 'The Queen Mum', a most regal and dignified woman; a most wonderful advertisement for 'the royal family', she was. Unfaultering achievement orientation, tenacity, self belief, a clear mind - are qualities rarely found in the average young 20 year old. She had (still has) them all - plus a good measure of love, et voila!.....the British crown! And damned good luck to her too! They make a lovely couple, and I wish them a very happy life together. She'll hang in there (unlike Diana) because she knows what she's in for and she knows what she's doing. She's got her head screwed on right, she's done her homework.", 9303, "None", -1],
