Not all great portraits are sharp anyway. The 50mm on the D60 would be a short tele, around 75-80mm in 35mm film terms. It would be a very comfortable portrait lens considering it is f/1.4.

	94707 : ["Your main concern is lighting... I've successfully used large tupperware bowls (the milky ones) with the bottoms removed to give a nice even surrounding light to jewelry.  That's a budget solution.  Your lens doesn't have a macro setting and 18mm is going to throw out the perspective on your jewelry (still, an interesting shot however).   If I may suggest, at least get yourself an extension tube (short so you don't loose more than one stop of light).  They are not expensive but will give you macro capability. The distance you will want between your camera and jewelry will be determined by the minimum acceptable focal length of your lens combination (with the extension tube, it might be as little as a few inches to as much as a foot (depending on your zoom setting). As for your settings:  Depth of field is important for a successful photograph but there is software available to you at a reasonable cost that can provide you with infinite depth of field... it's called Helicon Focus (   ) <--- an article that explains the concept. You have a great Camera... enjoy it.", 9520, "VkKS8nQuaa", 0],

	94720 : ["You've gotten several good answers, especially those from Mr. KnowsEnough, Boo, and Gen. Jelly Bean ESQ. As a long-time Buddhist practitioner, I can add the following, based on my own experience. 1. Meditation doesn't exactly teach us anything. But it does help us to see the actual truth of our life very clearly. In particular, we get to see how we create suffering for ourselves, and for others. As you might imagine, this isn't necessarily enjoyable or easy. But few things could be more important than uprooting the causes of suffering in our own life. 2. Meditation can help ease the suffering that comes with trauma. However, as Boo pointed out, you would benefit greatly from the guidance of a seasoned meditation teacher -- not only at the beginning but through the ongoing years of practice. All meditators go through difficult passages while they practice. This experience not only seasons them as human beings, but enables them to serve as skilled guides to others. 3. Without a doubt, Buddhist practice cultivates loving-kindness towards oneself and also towards others.  There are many Buddhist traditions, each with its own flavor and style. Also, different teachers within any one tradition will have their own approach. So I encourage you to visit as many teachers and centers as you can. The first link below will help you find a center near you. Reading certain books can help you stay motivated and directed in your efforts. As Boo mentioned, the Pema Chodron books are very good. You might also benefit from \"The Mindful Way through Depression\" by Jon Kabat-Zinn and others (second link). Finally, for a wise and warm-hearted overview of Buddhism, I recommend \"It's Easier Than You Think: The Buddhist Way to Happiness\" by Sylvia Boorstein.  Best wishes on your path!", 9518, "czXaUPIlaa", -1],

	94728 : ["There is a little green dot in the lower left of your viewfinder that lights up with the focus sensor in the camera \"thinks\" you're in focus. Also you can turn on the rangefinder function in your menu. This gives you additional aid when manual focusing. I should mention though that there are two current incarnations of the 50mm 1.4. The older D-series AF version, and newer G-series AF-S  version. The latter has an autofocus motor built in (that's what the \"-S\" refers to), which means it will autofocus with your D60! Of course the new model is also costs a fair bit more. Anyways, 50mm on a crop body like the D60 gives you the same effective field of view as a 75mm lens on film. This is within the range that is typically considered ideal for portraits. And many people use it for that. On the other hand others find it too short still. A lot of it's to do with preference. What I would suggest you do, assuming that you have a zoom lens in this range, is experiment. Set it to 50mm and see if you're comfortable shooting portraits at this focal length.", 9520, "tWoN22rRaa", 4],

	94730 : ["Hi, You've come to an excellent point in yourself to begin a meditative lifestyle, because it is only through reaching a state of absolute futility that that the inner pathways become totally accessible to you. Meditation can definitely help you, there are a number of ways and a number of different paths all of them leading to the same goal but from a different angle, so it is really important that you have a look to make sure you start on the path that is going to be most beneficial to you. During the course of my meditative life I have been supported by my meditation Master through some very personal issues and using the practise of meditation long term, I find I am now able to look at these issues with ease, as if it were someone else that they had happened to.  I think that must be self-acceptance. It is good for the mind and soul to be unstill because that will give you something very real that you can work with and used positively it is fuel to propel you inwards to a completely new and undiscovered area of your self. Practising meditation from whatever background, whether it be Buddhist, Taoist, or other will bring about a total transformation in your self, the process itself can become quite difficult - I was also told this before I embarked, but I figured that I was going through loads of negative stuff anyway, and that it might as well have a purpose, so I took it up.  I have never regretted it. My practise/meditation Master runs a group in Yahoo groups, he has been working with me for thirteen years now and I can only speak highly of him for the level of support and understanding that he has shown to me and the methods which he uses all work.  If you are serious about this you may like to get in touch with him and talk directly with someone who has a truly vast level of experience in working with people in a meditative capacity.   If you are interested check out taofojiaoyujiagong groups in yahoo groups and speak directly to Yu Jin Li, don't pay too much notice to the title page, just speak to him and see how you feel.   I really hope that either this, or someone else here has been able to help you.  All the best in your search, and remember...today is the first day of the rest of your life.", 9518, "eQQegpayaa", 0],

Yeah, technology does improve things a little bit and you can tell which camera is better under low light but otherwise if you are starting out i would be 100% happy with the d40. This link compares the d40, d40x and d60 and as you can see there is only a small step up. Just make sure that if you get these cameras, that the lens has an auto focus motor in it. These cameras can't use all of Nikon's lenses. Its really important that the camera feels comfortable to hold cause if you get into photography you will take thousands of pictures. So yeah d40 for sure!", 9520, "v721s9KKaa", 0],
	94743 : ["I'm glad you have done the sensible thing by handling the camera bodies first before purchasing, that is the most important thing. As for the two you have picked.. Well I have to be honest and say that the D40 is just an awful camera. I have no idea why Nikon have kept this going, there is no internal auto focus motor, no bracketing, no dedicated ISO button. It is very poorly built and although megapixels are not important, 6 is a little low. The D60 is not much better, it is lacking all those features as well!. Why Nikon refuse to include those simple features in their lower end models is beyond me, every other manufacturer does. You may say that they are not important, but you will find yourself restriced with auto focus lenses, HDR images will be practically impossible to do, and menu diving to change even the simplest settings like ISO will get frustrating. My advice to you (if you decide to go with Nikon) is to look for a second hand D70 or save up a little more and get a new or second hand D80 (worth it just for the superior build quality alone!). I guarantee that if you go with the D40 or D60 you will want to upgrade almost straight away. You buy cheap, you buy twice.", 9520, "KgJYDkGHaa", 0],
