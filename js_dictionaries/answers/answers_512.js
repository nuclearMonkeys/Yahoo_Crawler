	28599 : ["The most common and relatively reliable shotguns are the Remington 870 and Mossberg 520 series. They are reasonably priced although there are other no name brands that are cheaper. With that being said, both the 870 and 520 have had their shares of problems not because of any inherent design flaws, but manufacturing defects. No matter how good a reputation a firearm maker has, it does NOT mean their quality control is 100% perfect. This means you do NOT just buy a gun and put it in the closet because you never know until you actually take it to the range and fire it - and fire it several times. Also, low maintenance does not mean no maintenance.  And maintenance must be done properly. If this shotgun is to be your last line of defense, then it must work 100% flawlessly the first time if you ever have to use it for that purpose.   Keep in mind that owning a firearm does not automatically give you the skills to use it effectively. Don't be one of those people fooled by movies and tv shows that depicts a shotgun spraying shots in a wide cone of destruction.

The 870 has a safety just above the trigger where you can press it with your trigger finger just before firing. The Mossberg has a safety on the back of the frame where you can disengage it with the thumb of your shooting hand. That's really the biggest difference. If you have a preference on the location of the safety then use that as the guide for which one to buy. If you don't care where the safety is located just get whichever one is in stock at a fair price at a store near you.", 4446, "Jvx658HFaa", 2],

	28606 : ["I take nothing away from Tiz the Law, who won the shortened Belmont last Saturday. He's a fine colt, one of the best of this year's crop of 3 year olds, and he deserved to win. But unfortunately, his win there proved absolutely NOTHING. We already KNEW he could run a 9 furlong race- he did that when he won the Florida Derby in March. So he's never really been tested at a longer distance, and he won't be until he runs in the Travers at Saratoga in early August. At that race, he will finally get his chance to show the world if he's able to go 10 furlongs and win or not. They won't shorten the Travers the way they did the Belmont, because it's not part of the Triple Crown. And personally, I think the way the Triple Crown has been handled this year is pretty dammed stupid. If the NYRA and the Jockey Club (neither of which are known for their ability to use common sense) had been smart, they would have kept the five week format intact and scheduled the Preakness for September 19 and the Belmont for October 10. That would have meant we'd have had an autumn Triple Crown instead of a spring one, which would have been just fine. They should have left the Belmont's distance ALONE, too, and not shortened it. Instead, however, they turned the Belmont into a Kentucky Derby PREP RACE. The race last Saturday didn't even have 2 TURNS in it, and all of these horses will have to face that later in the season. That was hardly fair to them. Now, even IF by some chance Tiz the Law does win the other two races, he will have to have a big fat asterisk by his name in the record books, because he won't have run a true Triple Crown series. That's unfortunate as well, because it will have a negative impact on the colt's future breeding career, even if he is successful at winning other races like the Dubai World Cup later on. No, the TC could have been handled and executed far better than it was, even with the pandemic and economic crisis.", 4453, "None", -3],

I, also, feel they should limited the field to 14 in the Kentucky Derby too. I guess we shall see what becomes of that as we proceed. I have a feeling things aren't going to be as we once knew, but we'll just have to adapt to these life changes.", 4453, "2b196e6df5e286ff004ef04190db1bc3aa", 3],

	28618 : ["Yes, there is! The 146th running of the Kentucky Derby is on Saturday, Sept. 5, 2020. The Derby will be run on a dirt track with post time is set for approximately 7:01 p.m. ET.   at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, where it has been held since its inaugural running in 1875.  NBC is home to the 146th Kentucky Derby, providing comprehensive race coverage and analysis live on TV, NBCSports.com and the NBC Sports app before, during and after. NBC will also broadcast the 2020 Kentucky Oaks, the 2020 Preakness Stakes and the 2020 Breeders' Cup. New York-based Tiz the Law leads the Road to the Kentucky Derby standings with a hulking 372 points, thanks mostly to his Belmont Stakes, Travers Stakes and Florida Derby wins.  Other Horses to Watch lifted by NBCSports.com: After dazzling and dominant trips in New York's most high profile races, the Belmont Stakes and the Travers Stakes, Barclay Tagg's Tiz the Law looks to continue his dominant 3-year-old season in the Kentucky Derby. He shares the same trainer (Tagg) and owners (Sackatoga Stable) as 2003 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Funny Cide. Tiz the Law is expected to be the heavy favorite, but his one and only career loss was at Churchill Downs last November. Tom Drury's hometown horse Art Collector could be Tiz the Law's biggest challenger on the first Saturday in September. Trainer Drury and owner Bruce Lunsford are both from Louisville, and Drury could become the first ever Louisville native to train a Derby winner. The son of 2006 Preakness winner Bernardini, Art Collector's collection of recent wins include the Ellis Park Derby (Aug. 9) and the Blue Grass (July 11).  Anita Derby winner Honor A.P. could make Mike Smith, 55, the oldest jockey to win the Kentucky Derby. Though he was second in his last start (the Aug. 1 Shared Belief) behind fellow Derby contender Thousand Words, Smith said he thought the distance, 3/16th of a mile shorter than the Derby, was too short for him. He notes the horse's intelligence, while trainer John Shirreffs is impressed by his stride and lightness, and Smith opted for Honor A.P. over another Derby probable, Authentic. Shirreffs and Smith were the winning combo in the 2005 Kentucky Derby with 50-1 longshot Giacomo. Haskell winner Authentic is the first of Hall of Famer Bob Baffert's two expected entries in the Derby. In five starts, the Into Mischief colt has four wins and one second, so he's yet to finish out of the money. His one second place came on June 6 in the   Anita Derby, 2 3/4 lengths behind fellow Kentucky Derby contender Honor A.P. This will be Authentic's first race with Hall of Fame jockey John Velzquez. King Guillermo has the record and breeding of a tough competitor, but he faces an uphill battle after not racing since May 2, 126 days before the Derby. He was second in the second division of the Arkansas Derby in his most recent race. Before that, the horse, who is owned by former MLB All-Star Victor Martinez, won the Tampa Bay Derby on March 7. He ran on the turf in two of his early races. This is the first Kentucky Derby start for his trainer Juan Carlos Avila and jockey Samy Camacho. King Guillermo's trainer, jockey and owner all hail from Venezuela. Bob Baffert's late bloomer Thousand Words enters the Derby field with an Aug. 1 win in the Shared Belief Stakes, beating Honor A.P. He's had a bumpy ride, opening his racing career with three-straight wins before losing three in a row and then finally impressing in the Shared Belief. If the Kentucky Derby had been run in May, the $1 million son of Pioneerof the Nile (sire to Triple Crown winner American Pharoah) likely wouldn't have been in the Derby picture, but the later race date gave him time to mature. As if being a gelding with a price tag of $3,000 didn't set Finnick the Fierce apart from the rest of the field, he also has one eye. His right eye was surgically removed when he was young due to a congenital cataract. His owner Arnaldo Monge, a vet at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute based in central Kentucky, was called to examine the horse just hours after he was born and later purchased him from the breeder for an almost unheard of sum of $3,000. He may not be one of the front runners, but at the Kentucky Derby, anything could happen. Enjoy!", 4457, "552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa", 5],
