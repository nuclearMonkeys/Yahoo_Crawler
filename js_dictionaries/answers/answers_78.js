If it's fine, I suggest adding a smart charger, 1-5 amps should be adequate, if not, you have to ask why? Does the system have a wifi remote that consumes power? etc.  Might even want to discuss with the manufacturer before other measures besides checking the battery. If you had provided model# etc, we could be of greater help.", 636, "AA10954511", 2],
	3922 : ["You probably have a bad battery. It should last months, depending on the rest of the system. It could also be a bad component in the rest of the system, draining the battery. Yes, there should be a trickle charger built into the system, but that depends on the company and how good their designers are. Possibly there is one, but the discharge rate (due to a problem) is higher than it can handle. You can add a battery maintainer easily. The one you mention is a 12 amp charger, that is way overkill, you need a 1 amp maintainer. But if there is a problem with the battery or the system, that would not help. first step: take the battery to an auto shop and get it checked. How old is it? second step: measure the current when everything is off. It should be < 10 mA at a guess, but check with the manufacturer.", 636, "8Y7LQ6TGaa", 1],
	3923 : ["Don't underestimate hard work.  It will get you through a lot in life.  You don't say what year you're in, but I'll assume either 1st or 2nd.  Keep in mind that the first 2 years, in my opinion, were the hardest.  You're taking all your general courses like 4 semesters of physics & calculus, 2 of chemistry, statics, dynamics, etc. (at least that was the curriculum 30 years ago when I went).  I didn't do well my first two years, either, and thought about a major change a number of times.  But, once you get into your area of concentration, it seems easier, not because the courses are easier but because the classes are more in the areas you enjoy best. I'm a civil engineer.  I ended up on academic probation twice in my first 2 years.  When I got into the civil courses, I did much better.  I went on to get my Master degree and got 11 A's out of 12 courses (I was annoyed by the one B grade).  Now, all these years later, I have a job I love and look forward to going to every day.

You may also have capabilities that are not yet being measured, like mechanical ability, people skills, etc. that will help you as an engineer.  At the end of your school, if you can clutch that degree in your hands, you will have made it by virtue of your hard work.  The comparisons to your peers and even your grades will fade quickly in importance as you gain experience as an engineer.   Hang in there, you CAN be an engineer.  Even getting into the program says that someone believes you can do it.", 643, "wJTsifugaa", 0],
	3925 : ["Some engineering schools are harder than others.  Although a high-ranked school will make it easier to get a good job, you can also do quite well if you achieve an excellent GPA at a lower-ranked school, and you might find it more pleasant that way. You can also think about taking a year off to go to work (at \"anything\") and spend your free time reviewing your calculus and letting it sink in.  I quit college in the middle but by the time I returned I had a much firmer grip on the math that I had studied before I quit. And I ended up with a PhD from a top-ten engineering school, and had contracts from NASA et cetera.  So good luck, and do spend a lot of time reviewing what you already know!", 643, "Kf4PiubQaa", 0],

	3929 : ["On Earth, we have a rather dramatic transition from gas (our atmosphere) to solid (the Earth's crust). That sharp transition creates a medium in which we can easily move through the air but receive enough resistance from the solid that it can support us - we can stand on it. On Jupiter there is no such transition. Instead as we work our way down through Jupiter's atmosphere it just keeps getting denser and denser. Eventually the gaseous hydrogen becomes liquid hydrogen. We keep descending and it becomes denser and denser until that liquid hydrogen becomes a super hot liquid metal. If we kept descending, we likely would eventually come to a solid core. But the interior pressure on Jupiter is millions of times greater than on the Earth. The heat and pressure would have destroyed us and our spacecraft long before we got to that core. The extreme density of the liquid would have made it impossible for us to even propel ourselves towards the core.", 652, "None", 0],

	3939 : ["You may, if you have a big enough order, but you have to keep a few things in mind. First you have to understand that the fabrication shops buy raw steel all the time, thousands of tons at a time.  Over time they have established relationships with the steel producers who are interested in keeping their steady customers.  If you come in to the mill with a one-off order, you may not get as good of a price the fabricators pay.  Second, what is your definition of \"large quantities\"?  The steel mills are not rolling all the steel palate thicknesses they have in their catalogues all the time.  Because it takes a long time to set the rolling mill to produce a particular shape the mills typically wait until they have enough orders for a run of at least several weeks.  You may have to wait for months for the mill to roll the plate you need until several fabricators order a few tens of thousand tons of the same grade and thickness as you for a few large projects.   On the project I am currently working on, for example, we needed almost 3,000 linear feet of pipe piles.  To preserve the schedule we had to go to the next highest wall thickness because it was more readily available.  Otherwise we would have had to wait months to get the piles.  On the other hand, the fabricators usually carry stock of different sizes of steel plate, and if they don't have it on hand, they can call other fabricators to locate it.     Third, do you have the equipment, facilities and personnel to cut your custom steel plates from the raw steel? It's not just waving an Oxy-Acetylene torch around.  You will need hoists to handle raw materials and finished product; you'll need machine tools to cut the steel, especially if you have a relatively large production run.  Those plasma cutters are expensive.   ", 656, "VO8Xjz0waa", 0],

	3944 : ["I'm a retired aerospace mechanical engineer and I worked on aircraft (F22 canopy actuator) cruise missiles (tail fin deployment), satellites, and satellite ground support equipment.  Also contracted for a while at Disney Imagineering.  The mechanical design engineering is fun, challenging and always interesting regardless of how you feel about the end product.  At Northrop Aircraft (now Northrop Grumman) about 10% of the engineers were private pilots and I eventually took flying lessons and bought my own airplane, but most had no interest in piloting aircraft.  At Disney, some were nuts about roller coasters but I don't go on them.  I designed satellite parts but I consider space travel too dangerous, besides, who wants to go to the moon or a dead planet when the Earth is so wonderful and everywhere else is desolate and inhospitable?  But I still find the technology interesting.  Satellites are absolutely incredible feats of engineering, and it's great working with really smart people. ", 659, "iTqj9QCkaa", 0],

	3946 : ["The output of the transformer isn't regulated. You have losses in the transformer which will cause a change in output voltage if the load changes.
