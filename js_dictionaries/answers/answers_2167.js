	114131 : ["I don't know what you mean by being a \"good idea.\"  It doesn't do anything practical to avoid pregnancy or STDs (in fact, douching after intercourse can force semen further up into the vagina, slightly increasing the chance of pregnancy), and it doesn't sanitize you any more than washing with soap and water would.  But if it makes you feel \"fresher\" and that's important for you, go for it.", 10380, "uRmYvOx0aa", 0],
	114132 : ["Nope. Your vagina is a self-cleaning mechanism. Leave it alone. Throwing off the chemical balance can leave you open to bacterial, fungal and yeast infections. Don't do it!  If your vagina doesn't smell right, see a doctor for treatment and otherwise just wash the exterior with warm soapy water and use the toilet after intercourse. Hope this helps!", 10380, "d4f18a9e043bec96fbf8a5e33e9628eeaa", 3],
	114133 : ["Ew! No! Douching of any kind is very bad for you, it pushes bacteria up into your body. Just make sure you pee at least 15 minutes after sex. Urine is sterile, and will knock out any bacteria in your urethra.  Just keep your 'gina clean, and try not to let him ejaculate inside you - that messes up the PH balance. Clean with a baby wipe, that always does good combined with some baby powder.", 10380, "None", 0],
	114134 : ["1. Try and get a job and move out? 2. If you haven't done so already, maybe college is an option? 3. You are 23 years old.. Time to move on with your life and become independent.  4.

I mean, I'm in my thirties now, and I don't really talk to my family much because they aren't very supportive of me emotionally and mentally.  You should only be around people who are helpful for you, not people that bring you down.  You are an adult, and you can make your own decisions.", 10379, "jej0Vnudaa", 0],

	114137 : ["#1 I think you should really stay out of this, your not her mom, you have no rights to her, or rights to tell her what she can/can't do. Your husband needs to be the one to set up rules/routines for her, the most you can do is support him on the decisions he makes (even if you dont agree with them) 2. Yelling at her isnt going to solve anything, try being her friend, not her authority figure. 3. Maybe her dad needs to get her into counselling.", 10378, "cZsUg6mqaa", -2],
	114138 : ["Kids appreciate being treated with respect and being made to feel more adult. Involve her in the process. Sit her down and ask her about why she's doing what she does. Establish a schedule for chores and maybe reward her initially.  I disagree with those that are saying that you do not have the right to tell her what to do. If you are her step mother then she needs to respect you. You and her father are a team now. It could very well be that she's resentful, but she needs to get over it. But it won't happen over night and you need to understand where she is coming from and acknowledge her feelings.", 10378, "Mm83t7feaa", -1],

	114143 : ["ok, so you my friend wrote waaaaaaaay to much and I didn't read it all but here's the thing... Any one can vote for the candidate they feel would fulfill the position the best. You should take into consideration the history of the party but not necessarily base a decision on a cadidate from the history. It's kind of like saying your great great great grandma was a bad person and commited a crimes and since you are a decendant of her you must be a bad person too. You may be one of the kindest people in town but since your great great great grandma was a criminal people judge you from that. - The same goes with the political parties; no one should base a decision on the fact that someone in the party did something that was unacceptable so everyone in that party must be just like that. Generalizing things like that is not always the best. People should vote for who is the best candidate and not for the history of the party.

Although he definitely had some issues with paranoia and following the letter of the law, he was a brilliant man and leader.

Eisenhower had Stevenson, both times Nixon had Humphrey , then McGovern. Hardly worth opponents. Plus we were not blessed with your gift of hindsight. Nixon prolonged the war until his reelection.

	114169 : ["Wow, I'm amazed at two things here: 1-There must be some really awful recruiters out here for people's opinions of temp agencies to be so low. 2-Not a lot of people really understand what a staffing company really does. I own a staffing, recruiting and consulting firm, so let me try and clear up some of the misconceptions on this subject, from the perspective of the agency.   Agencies get paid by how many candidates they have in their database-At times I  wish this were true, but this is completely false.  We get paid based on how many hours a hired candidate works for a temp position, and a negotiated fee for permanent hires.   The reasons why you are not getting assignments could be anything, but more often than not, the reason you did not land the assignment is because it closed that fast.  In temporary staffing especially, most proficient agencies can react to a candidate need within 24-48 hours, and by react I mean submit a candidate, have them interview, and be ready to start the project.  With jobs being filled that quickly, the reason recruiters want to meet with you, even if they may not have a position immediately available for you right this minute, is because when they do, they need to be able to move swiftly on your behalf, and if they've met you already, this is something they will not have to do later.  I could talk about this subject all day-feel free to send me a follow up message if you'd like to discuss this further.", 10377, "IyHpsDChaa", 0],

And by the way the agency do not get money for the number of people on their books - they make their money by taking a cut (percentage) of people's wages.
