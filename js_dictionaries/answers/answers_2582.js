	134948 : ["Yes, cod liver is better. Most dog foods provide Omega-6 fats from veggie oils, but not Omega-3. Cod liver oils is one of the best things you can give to help with that. Better than Salmon and Sardines in my opinion, because they can cause skin problems and other problem in your dog. Just seems safer. Veterinarians recommend a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 of 5:1 to 10:1 in dogs. Cod liver oil contains the essential fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. These nutritious fats provide the framework for growing a healthy skin and coat, flexible joints, strong heart, sharp eyesight and youthful energy. Giving omega 3's to dogs may address many nutritional imbalances and can improve your dog's overall health. It also provides naturally occurring levels of Vitamin A and D.

	134956 : ["Wow... So many names come to mind. WWE misuses about 95% of the guys they hire, so to pic a select few even would take me all day... If I HAD to choose just one, I would say DDP. He was a Mega star in WCW... Scoring wins over Ric Flair, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, Sting, Kevin Nash, Booker T and even \"Hollywood\" Hogan.  DDP was a true main eventer in WCW, and WWE treated him like absolute crap just because he was a WCW star. As if to say, \"Your top guys cant cut it here\". Vince hated pushing WCW talent over WWE guys back in 2001-2002. Even though WCW was dead at that point, I think Vince's insecurity really shined through as WCW guys (even Booker) never scored a \"clean\" win over Vince's WWE guys. DDP would lose to guys like D'Lo Brown and Bob Holly, who where jobbers in WWE at the time. It was a spit in the face to hardcore WCW fans such as myself, and crap like that is why it was so easy for traditional WCW fans to jump ship to TNA when it got big. Watching WWE after WCW died, still felt like \"selling out\" to alot of WCW fans. Why do you think TNA trys so hard to be WCW? They know that the WCW fans never truly WANTED to watch WWE. It was simply all we had after WCW died off. In some ways, what Vince did to DDP during his time with WWE, might be partially to blame for WCW fans still disliking WWE to this day. If Vince had just accepted his victory over WCW and controled his ego long enough to let WCW guys get a fair shot in WWE, I believe WCW fans might have warmed up to WWE eventually. However Vince's ego made sure that WCW fans would alway treat Vince like crap... (Example) DDP got a European Title shot... EUROPEAN TITLE?!?!    DDP was a 3x WCW World Heavyweight Champion! F**k your European Title, Vince!   (DDP lost BTW... Suprise suprise).", 11257, "I35oB7rPaa", 1],

	134971 : ["William Regal. Seriously the guy is a complete BEAST in the ring- I look at his matches in awe because he is among the only ones who can deliver a great match no matter who he is facing. The guys is a great mat wrestler- he can make submission moves look like padlocks and he's just a great guy as a technical wrestler too. I've heard that Regal really* hits his opponents in a match- he does not censor anything. If he is going to strike, he will strike hard- his intensity is noted when he delivers his moves on his opponents.  He also has great Mic Skills as well. He's got that tough- low English accent which makes him sound more threatening. He speaks clearly and it just evokes fear on his opponents. He's a charismatic wrestler too- though I have only seen him as a Heel, I am pretty sure he can do alright as a face if he was popular enough. But despite his legendary wrestling skills, Vinnie Mac degrades him in a way. I am aware that he was European Champion, and other championships he had- but most of those occurred during the WWF era- once it became Nu WWE, his career went somewhat downhill. He did become Intercontinental Champion, but I don't think he lasted long with the title. (2 months) He became King of the Ring but I just don't see it as a career builder- in fact it ruined some wrestler's careers (in a way) [Booker T, Sheamus, and Regal]. I don't know much about wrestlers beyond the WWE 2007-ish era (im still fairly new to wrestling), so I know there will be other under-used guys out there.", 11257, "QJwaagGWaa", -1],
	134972 : ["Shelton Benjamin. The WWE never took full advantage of his athletic ability and the many angles they placed him in. When they first drafted him to Raw following his wins over Triple H, he was having such a good run as Intercontinental Champion, having good unforgettable matches, and was over with the crowd. They took all those pluses and turned it into a negative by adding a losing streak into the mix. Why? I still ask myself that today. Nothing was broke and they tried to \"fix\" it. After ruining his reaction from the fans, they gave him the momma Benjamin angle which was kinda embarrassing but could have led to more than it did. Then they had him as the Gold Standard. It started off so-well, with my only issue towards it is it should have started on Smackdown, and what did they do with it: Only give him a midcard title reign. Yes it was a good run but why did it end there? To the user that said Shelton didn't want to be World Champ, I can provide you with a post WWE interview in which he says different. Some have said he didn't have the mic skills to be in the main event but that's total bs. Jeff Hardy and Bobby Lashley made it pretty far without them and so could have Shelton Benjamin. His mic skills weren't even as bad as some say.", 11257, "4A971YfOaa", 0],
