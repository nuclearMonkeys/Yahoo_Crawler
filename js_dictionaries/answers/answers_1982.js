	104845 : ["The following are all my opinion or judgements made from research and personal use. 1. Creatine seems to help you work out a bit harder and a bit longer...which will result in more gains in strength and mass. 2. Creatine will increase kidney function and make you urinate much more often, thus taxing kidneys maybe more than you should. 3. Certain foods have sufficient amount of creatine-most meats, and your body can only absorb so much, so any excess will be excreted-again taxing liver and kidneys. 4. There are no long term research results as to what will happen to your body in 25-50 years as a result from excessive intake. 5. Suggestion: Only purchase pharmacutical grade creatine-spend the extra few dollars!! Trust a well known name brand. Why waste money on fillers that you dont know what you are consuming. 6. Suggestion: Try it. Use it wisely. Do NOT over consume. Cycle product...maybe 3 weeks on, one week off, or every other week. Allow your body to naturally absorb and excrete needed quantities.", 9903, "KgL6lnldaa", 0],

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not regulate nutritional supplements. This means that the creatine products available in stores may vary in amount and quality, and there is no guarantee of safety or purity. According to a study by the Mayo Clinic, many young athletes who take creatine supplements rely on the advice of friends, not doctors. Some creatine users do not know how much creatine to take and may take more than they should.  People who take creatine supplements may gain weight because of water retention in the body's muscles. Other side effects of long-term use of creatine supplements include muscle cramps, dehydration, diarrhea, nausea, and seizures. It may be dangerous to take creatine supplements while undergoing dehydration (for example, for wrestling competition) or when trying to lose weight. Doctors do not know the effects of creatine supplements on important organ systems, such as the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and reproductive organs, or the effects of combining creatine supplements with over-the-counter medications, prescription drugs, and vitamins.

The American middle class must be careful not to fall for the conservative LIE that the rich pay more than the middle class. Ronald Reagan the patron saint of conservatism placed the burden for financing social security firmly on the shoulders of the middle class when he dramatically increased social security taxes on people earning less than $37,800.00 per year while giving the wealthy a decrease. This measure represented the largest tax increase in the history of this country on a singled out group of taxpayers.Reagan (at Alan Greenspan's urging) allowed the government to borrow this money to hide the deficit created by his tax cuts to the wealthy, which had FAILED to increase the economy as planned because the wealthy instead of building factories chose fast returns on their money through importing goods or investing in stocks. Job creation and increased tax revenue to the government was NOT accomplished.What HAS happened is that the government is broke,a situation that right wing extremists applaud because that fact makes it easier for conservatives to say that programs are not available.

In some countries, the government determines how much a doctor can chaqrge you for an xray, an office visit, a prescription, and so on.
