In fact, there are countries where the lifestyle is more even, and there isn't such a big gap between rich and poor- countries like Japan, Canada, the Scandanavian countries, Germany, France, etc. Now, as to exports, two of the biggest are military equipment and entertainment. The US has put a lot of money into military research and innovation, and the products are in big demand around the world. But many people are not aware that we export almost as much (dollar value) in entertainment= music, movies, tv shows. I've flown thousands of miles only to get off the plane and hear Britney Spears or Taylor Swift. Everyone knows US movies, and somewhere in the world, Friends is playing on the TV at any given moment.

So, the theory is that if you increase the money supply, you contribute to an excess supply of money chasing the same amount of goods.  But in order for inflation to really occur, you need to have demand and spending increase as well, without a corresponding increase in supply of goods. That, in my opinion is why we haven't seen a rise in inflation despite the significant increase in monetary stimulus over the last few years. ", 991, "WvFJh2GAaa", 0],
	6074 : ["Because money is artificial.  What is ACTUALLY going on is that we use money to represent relative values of different things that cannot easily be compared.  How do you compare the value of a lump of gold with the value of a shipment of bananas?  The answer, of course, is that someone assigns monetary values to each of those items and then we can compare numbers. But like everything else involving supply and demand, if you have too much of a thing, nobody wants it unless you give them extra incentive.  In the case of money, if you have too much of it, nobody wants it that badly.  If you print too much money, banks are full of money already.  So to get them to work with you, you have to give them an incentive in the form of a higher interest rate on a loan.  This higher interest rate sort of \"snowballs\" because other prices need extra incentive.  Inflation represents the extra amount of that incentive.  It represents the fact that there are so many dollars out already that nobody really needs more, so you have to make it worthwhile to use cash money any more.", 991, "aj5IBTuXaa", -1],
