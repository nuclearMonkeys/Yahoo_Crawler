What Republicans don't realize is big corporations who rely on cheap labor from illegal immigrants are the ones usually supporting Republicans, who block any efforts to give immigrants legal status, so they can keep them cheap.

	103305 : ["Kevin is exactly right. The potion didn't cause a 'change of heart', nor did it help Ron to see 'that he really loves Hermione'; he already knew that. He just got sick of Lavender's antics, something that had been building up for ages. Lavender didn't give Ron a love potion, IMO. He used her as a way to ... get over Hermione? There is a small scene where Ron says something mildly funny, and then we hear Lavender's high pitched giggle. Ron 'looked quite pleased with himself'. Ron has never really dated a girl before, nor have many girls shown interest in him, so he was right to be pleased with himself. He doesn't, never has, and never will love Lavender. He loves Hermione. Lavender was a sort of cover up for his love for Hermione. He chose to express it by snogging another girl. He admits to Harry in the hospital wing that their relationship is just snogging, and implies that he doesn't even like her. I don't think the love potion has anything to do with this.", 9848, "None", 0],

I'm sure Ron never did it purposeley, but his touch and go with death probably alerted him to the fact that Lav. was never fun and that he needed to make a move with Hermione soon.

	103319 : ["As far as the original post goes I can't find fault with that anywhere.   As for your own version of it, there are a few things that I could take exception with. #3.- if someone has been to the resturant befor, and have had an item cooked special for them befor, they expect it the next time they are there, so you should find fault with the server who went the extra mile to make their customer happy.  If you wanted to make their dining expierence as good as you could you would atleast attempt to get it made the way they request.  (Simply say something like, \"I can ask the cook if he can do it that way, but I can't guarantee he'll say yes\" this gets you points and gets you off the hook if he says no way) #4.- If you don't want to split the check for them after the meal, ask when you take the order if this is all on one check or will it be seperate.  That takes care of your problem and theirs after the meal.  If you don't do this, and they ask for the check to be split, you should expect to do so or expect as little as possible in the tip department. #5.-They probably don't realize that they still have your pen, and you obviously don't either, for if you did you would have asked for it back.  Besides most resturants provide pens to the servers, not make you supply your own, so it is actually not the biggest problem in the world, it just takes a minute for you to get another pen. #7-Sometimes, a booth is nice for a bit of extra privacy.   A table is so open, that most people really prefer booths.  It isn't about what they sit in at home, it is about them being the customer, and the employees job to make them as happy as possible, that is also part of their job, not just seating them, or serving them.   #8  - i am embarassed for the people at the table and the servers for the \"Happy Birthday\" thing, I think it is stupid and annoying to the other patrons. #9- If you have a regular customer, and you hate to see them-there is something wrong with you.  These people whether they are pains in the butt or not, are the people who pay your salary, put food on your table, gas in your tank.  And yet you seem to think that you are doing them a favor waiting on them. Everyone of the ones not actually pointed out- You seem to hate your job, you seem to hate the general public, and seem to think that you are above the duties of serving and what that entails.  Maybe you should get a job where you do not deal with people.  If you are not taking home a good amount in tips, I think that if you would take a deep breath and clear your head and then read what you wrote about the people you serve, and the attitude that must come accross when you serve them, you might have a good idea why those tips are sadly lacking. Now befor you tell me to shut up, I will tell you that I have worked with the general public in a few different jobs and I know that there is that percentage of the public that think it is their job to make your job even harder, but to take your bad attitude at them out on everyone makes you as bad as them.  I have been a server in a busy resturant, I have been a front desk clerkmanager  at a hotel, (and with this job you get the joy of dealing with the pains in the butt all night or longer, not just how long it takes them to eat) so I know of what I speak.   Just calm down and don't let them get to you-you are making your job harder then it has to be.", 9844, "AA11253145", 11],

	103328 : ["I was a server for several years, so yes, I do know what you go through, but, serving is fun.  I had the time of my life and now I sit under fluorescent lighting staring at a computer monitor for 10 hours a day.  I loved the flexible schedule serving allowed for starters. You will appreciate the good times someday. I miss those days with all of my heart.  I learned alot about cuisine and wine.  I met alot of celebrities.  I had wonderful regulars who became lifelong friends as well as the regulars who would give us twenty dollar handshakes.  My last day I bawled.  My regulars all came in to see me off, each grossly overtipping for those years of contributing to the atmosphere and ambience of my restaurant. Yes, you have the high maintenance ones, the crappy tippers, the screaming children, but there are so many good things too.  Don't forget that.  Also, think about this:  your attitude is conveyed to your guests whether you realize it or not.  If you start going in with a better attitude, your tips would start to increase.", 9844, "9bd637764c471e57c9ec118107e8b9edaa", 9],
	103329 : ["I always thought that a tip was a special extra something for doing a good job. So my way of doing it is when my server has me smiling at the end of my meal I'll pay them. But if my server ignores me most of the time, doesn't have a smile on his/her face, doesn't ask if everything is ok or to refill my drink, have a bad attitude..and just plain lousy, then why the heck would I \"treat\" them a tip? For what? If my server was just \"ok\" I'd give them a little something. But I remember awesome experiences where my servers were just wonderful! Always happy, laughing with me, chats, very helpful, happy to serve, tops off my drinks...That's when I pull out bigger bills. Its what they deserve.  So excuse me if I don't pay you $20 bucks for your lousy service even with the less-than-minimum wage salary you're making. This is a job, and you must do it well to \"earn\" your gift.   Also we like the booths cuz we don't have them in our homes! We got hard cold tables. Booths are more comfy and more private. If your restaurant has them, we want them. Besides , I always ask if I could have a booth.  And pictures on a menu does help entice the buds when deciding what to pick. Its good to SEE what we'll be getting.  Ok I'm done.
