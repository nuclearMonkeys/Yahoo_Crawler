I live in a rural area, so I have to rely on what I can control myself. If you prefer to believe the unsubstantiated rumors, don't get the vaccine.

	55031 : ["Five answers - one from a medical professional - and not one of them references objective facts.  Hmmm. There is plenty of scientific evidence one can find on the internet, both as reported in mainstream sources and from scientific publications, to suggest that the vaccine may indeed be a serious threat to human health.  In all instances of pathogenic disease, one must carefully weigh the benefits against the possible costs of any prescriptive measure.  One cannot factually state that any vaccine developed to combat COVID-19 has cleared this modest and basic standard. Why?  The answers are several.  The most obvious one is the lack of adequate testing.  Vaccines must be tested carefully for years, by independent researchers (meaning not by the parties who stand to profit from their manufacture and can play with the results) and be cleared by the FDA along rigid, established guidelines.  None of this applies to the current set of vaccines which have been put on the market.   As a consequence of this, when polled, it was reported that well over 50% of front-line health care workers, doctors and nurses, rejected the vaccine.  In their estimation, based upon their knowledge of medicine and science, these vaccines presented a potentially grave health hazard and they didn't want to use them, preferring to take their chances with PPE. The ingredients of the vaccines are trade secrets, so there is no transparency whatever, not just to the public, but to the entirety of the medical community.  That is ominous.  Add to that, the fact that all the manufacturers have sought and been promised 100% immunity from law suits in the event of injury and that all adds up to the feeling on the part of much of the public that a vaccine isn't going to be a safe or meaningful route to the resolution of this pandemic - which is a quarter of one percent fatal to some 97% of the population, who will either not experience any symptom or be sickened only slightly.  In the past, and historically, given the parameters of this pandemic, the medically sound approach would have been to sequester only the vulnerable and allow the healthy to work and go about their lives, in order to catch it and neutralize it via natural herd immunity, which is most likely to the surest route to permanent immunity.  We already know that the vaccines won't be able to confer this benefit, necessitating repeated, frequent jabs. Meanwhile, the pharmaceutical industry stands to gain hundreds of billions of dollars in profit every year, going forward, from these untested medications.  The vaccine has not been tested on the very groups it was meant to help - the very old and those with severe chronic health conditions.  Those who were tested - the most robust people the pharmaceutical industry could find - reported frequent severe reactions.  And those reactions, including death, encephalitis and myelitis, keep on coming in, making this look a lot like Russian Roulette, only with better odds.  And nobody knows what the long-term deleterious effects of the vaccines will be.  We do know that claims by manufacturers that these vaccines delivery mechanisms - the rDNA they utilize - cannot pierce the blood-brain barrier, is a fabrication.  Small but measurable traces of the particles have been found dispersed throughout the human body after injection and no one knows what the implications of this is. Since the manufacturers have now admitted that the vaccines won't prevent the disease, won't make you less contagious if and when you do get it, won't slow the spread, may cause serious harm (they admit they are effectively testing against the general population at this time!), won't hasten the end of shelter in place restrictions and permit the makers of the vaccine to be immune from law suits, I think it is clear they are not a valuable tool. One last point:  the mainstream media has been effectively 100% captured by the pharmaceutical industry. This is important to consider.  This means that medical news is more likely to be based upon fraudulent and uncritically examined \"tobacco science\" promulgated by the industry, rather than objectively research facts.  We all know that in the recent past the press uncritically published studies proving how safe opioids are.  And how slow the press is to report on findings and lawsuits against the industry.  That is due to the amount of money they get from this sector and who owns the presses.  Today, boards of directors for the press are the same people who make up the boards of directors of MERCK, Pfizer and others.  Those same individuals control the scientific studies pushed out of the universities, which they head up and to which they contribute vast sums.  By this same token, the CDC, despite being tasked with our protection, is in fact in bed with the industry and profit greatly from this association.  There is a revolving door and that adds up to massive corruption.  This same industry has also compromised the WHO, the CDC and other bodies we are told again and again should be trusted and have our best interests in mind.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Follow the money.  Please don't take my word for any of this. In conclusion:  despite what you may have been told by the NIH (another incredibly corrupt institution) there are thousands of peer reviewed studies in epidemiology, clinical science, and every scientific sub-specialty \"annals of\" proving the efficacy of the quinine/zinc/vit. D/Ivermectin/magnesium protocol in both prevention and the reduction and/or clearing of infection.  This protocol was studied at length during the SARS-Co-V-1 pandemic, as well, and is well-known clinically.  It is cheap, readily-available and amazingly effective, yet everything possible was done to suppress this scientific and medical knowledge and label it \"misinformation.\"  Why?  Obviously, to protect their income stream.  The pharmaceutical industry and their cronies in the CDC, NIH and the WHO is nothing more than a giant protection racket.  Iatrogenic illness and death stemming from surgical and pharmaceutical interventions and diagnostic tests harm more people every year than they help and conventional medicine is the third leading cause of death.  And conventional medicine absolutely can help people.  I am in no way opposed to the ethical application of allopathic approaches.  I am against fraud and protection rackets.  I am against intentionally harming people in order to preserve your profits.   Some Examples: despite the fact that mammograms give women cancer at seven times the rate at which they prevent it, gynecologists and general physicians are still advised to tell women that they should get this screening yearly.  Contrast dyes used in radiographic imaging has poisoned tens of thousands of people with mercury, yet there has been no attempt to warn the public of the danger.  Routine biopsies for prostate cancer are responsible for millions of highly invasive surgeries to remove the prostate every year, despite the fact that oncologists are well aware that surgical interventions are unnecessary in well over 90% of the cases, due to the slow-growing nature of prostate cancer.  75% of caesarian sections are medically unnecessary, but are pushed by hospital obstetrical wards because they generate so much more money for the hospital than natural births.  Hysterectomies are over-prescribed by some 80% of cases.  In each of these instances, utilizing the recommended interventions takes years off of patients' lives and dramatically reduces their prospects for health long-term, requiring many more expensive medical interventions down the road for these patients.  I could go on and on, medical abuses abound and go mainly unreported.  You have to do a little of your own research to uncover them. Bottom line is this:  if you don't do your own research and rely uncritically solely upon the MMS and the \"medical experts\" trotted out by the press and academics, you are certain to be led down the garden path, where vested interests plan on making big bucks, all at your expense.  CAVEAT EMPTOR.  Much of the \"science\" trotted out which \"prove\" vaccines are safe is the some of the shoddiest science I have ever read.  It's scandalous.  If they generate even a small proportion of the long-term chronic illness that is attributed to them by detractors, they are making billions by intentionally sickening the general population - which would seem to fit an already well-established pattern for this industry. Use your own mind and do your own research using unimpeachable sources, such as data sets compiled by truly independent agencies not influenced by profit-driven  industries and learn to read and interpret scientific studies.  ", 7673, "MffYBguXaa", 0],

	55036 : ["T-Rex is NOT the ancestor of chickens, nor of any other bird, and no scientist ever said it is. It is creationists who make up that false statement in their attempts to refute evolution. T-Rex was a theropod dinosaur, which comprises a very large group of dinosaurs, from quite large to small types. The fossil evidence indicates that birds evolved from  a small, feathered theropod dinosaur. It is now clear from their bone structure from the fossil evidence that at least some branches of the dinosaurs were warm blooded and much more active than their reptilian ancestors. Numerous examples from the fossil record also show that many of these dinosaurs had evolved feathers, which would have originally been used for insulation. From that initial use other uses would have arisen, such as for camouflage or elongated for sexual display. Some of the smaller tree-climbing feathered theropod dinosaurs began using their elongated feathers on their arms for gliding. Eventually, they evolved into powered flyers. The earliest example of such feathered, winged dinosaurs was that of Archaeopteryx, which was first found in the 1800s. See the image below for one of those fossils. It also shows its skeleton in relation to modern-type birds. It is clear that the skeleton is still more like that of a theropod dinosaur than like that of a modern bird, including having teeth, a long bony tail, and separate forelimb digits with claws instead of the fused digits of modern type birds. Fossils of numerous other small, feathered, dinosaurs, including winged, have been found in the past thirty years, enough to make it clear that birds descended from a feathered theropod dinosaur. See the video below for a couple of other examples of that type of dinosaur. These early ancestors of birds first arose over 150 million years ago and gradually evolved into modern-type birds before the end of the Cretaceous (which marks the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs) but present-day species do not appear in the fossil record until in strata laid down much later during the Cretaceous. You can ignore @CRR's link. It is typical creationist misrepresentation of facts. Incidentally, the \"ducks\" in that link are not pf present-day species of ducks. Fossils of what could be the early ancestors of ducks have been found in late Cretaceous strata, though they could also be not related to ducks bur rather an example of convergent evolution via adaptation to a similar ecological niche..", 7674, "sdS6tLTPaa", 1],
	55037 : ["[edit] Dr Werner: “Museums do not show you these modern bird fossils nor do they put modern birds fleshed out with feathers in their dinosaur dioramas. This is wrong. Essentially, every time you see a T. rex or a Triceratops in a museum display, you should also see ducks, loons, flamingos or some of these other modern birds that have been found in the same rock layers as these dinosaurs, but this is not the case. I have never seen a duck with a dinosaur at a natural history museum, have you? An owl?

	55038 : ["Science can deal only with the natural, so it is not a question of science ruling out god (which god, by the way, since people have made up thousands of gods?). The idea of some god causing such and such was used thousands of years ago when people lacked the knowledge to determine what naturally caused such and such. Over the centuries, as human scientific knowledge accumulated, the aspects of nature that were previously attributed to some god became fewer and fewer as their natural causes became more and more understood. But there have always been holdouts on the god side who refused to accept the findings of science until the evidence otherwise came too great. The geocentric view of the cosmos with its non-moving earth because of certain passages in the Bible is a case in point (and it was the Protestant theologians as well as Catholic who ascribed to geocentrism). Even today, there are those who refuse to accept certain findings of science because those findings are in conflict with their god view. That includes geocentrism, which still has some holdouts. See here for an example. And, of course, the promoters of creationism refuse to acknowledge the massive amount of evidence for evolution and for the ancient age of the universe and the earth because those findings of science are in conflict with biblical myth.", 7675, "sdS6tLTPaa", 2],

The human body, like any animal's body can be reasoned away as a Biological Machine/Computer. We have power centers all over our body called chakras. These may effect some of our traits and abilities. Some of these power centers can can stay in perfect balance within our lifetime, while others will need to be worked on. If you look at the acupuncture system of a human it slightly resembles a circuit board. Most westerners do not believe in these channels of energy primarily due to negligence in the medical and scientific field for rejecting anything slightly relating to spiritual aspects. It is our souls that offer us consciousness, free will and thought process in the brain. The heart begins to function as it is being formed in the mother's womb and this maintains throughout our lives, pumping blood, delivering oxygen across the body. This will work in concert with other areas of the body, maintaining its function. Lungs will carry the air while the digestive system takes nutrients from our food and uses this as a stable source of energy. So I guess the heart, is kinda like the battery. There's also this area in our brain that constantly reminds our heart to keep beating. It's like G-code in a machine, it's constant.The Brain is like the hard drive as it maintains all the command functions of the others areas of the body.As the brain generates its own magnetic field it thus controls the electrical impulses it's sending our muscles to move.However there's something deeper in our brain that makes us us. As the body is machine and the brain the computer guiding it, the commands must come from somewhere. There's a limited number of space up there, in our brain, but we seem to have an infinite amount of memory and thought. We can think about thought, and we can remember remembering. And there's really nowhere in the brain for these memories and thoughts to come from and go.Although most people take consciousness for granted because it's so common, but really think about it. Most animals are instinctually based and have a code of behavior ingrained in them. We still have instinct to eat when we're hungry and pee when we have to, but we can override contemporary biological urges and think complex and creative thoughts.How can one attribute awareness to a bag of chemicals? If that's all we are, then how do chemicals make creative and logical decisions? There's an energetic signature that links our spirits to our bodies that is broken upon death.

The visiting priest held up a flower and spoke for an hour about how, despite all of its accomplishments, science has never been able to explain the simple fact of how a blossom comes to exist. He then fast-forwards a few decades to a scientific conference he was attending. He was in the back of a lecture hall working on some notes and not paying attention to the speaker when it finally sunk in what he was listening to. The lecturer was explaining in great technical detail exactly how a flower blossoms on a molecular and cellular level. Miller's point is that if you choose to see science and religion as fundamentally different, so that any given fact can be explained by science OR by God exclusively, then EVERY SINGLE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCE is claiming ground away from God. Science has been on a nonstop march through God's territory, with every paper, every observation, every experiment taking another chunk of existence away from God's camp and putting it into the realm of science.
