	140794 : ["It sounds like this company isn't the greatest at following up on phone calls and there was some miscommunication.  It's a pet peeve of mine as well when you hire someone and they are not very forthcoming.  They should have at least let you know the people you chose were no longer available.  On the flip side, it also sounds like they expect people to make calls and ask questions.  At least you've learned you have to do more of that. It never hurts to ask a company for some compensation when something like this happens.  Sometimes they can do something, sometimes not.  From what you said here, it seems like they've done all they can without losing money themselves.   When she said you had the \"option of allowing you to find happiness elsewhere\" she meant talk of terminating your contract and going with someone else.  You could always do some research to find other options before you decide.  That, of course, would be up to you. If you're happy with the photographers and got a good deal, then I would stay with them.  You have the name and number of the representative you dealt with, so hold on to that.

Also, youll just have to bring everything needed (vases, candy, scoops, bags) to the hall prob 10 days prior to your event.  i thin if you do 5 or 6 vases with different types of candy (depending ont he size of the vase) you should be ok. this is just for them to take a little bit not fill bags up so i think ull end up having lots to take home!  you should go to that m&m site and have black white and pink m&m's personalized with your names and wedding date on them.  good luck", 11485, "Y40HqHpGaa", 2],

	140814 : ["That's a really unfortunate situation and I feel your frustration, but you can look at it this way: 1. You did not hire a specific photographer, you hired a company. Really if you wanted to ensure that you were getting the photographer and the quality that you wanted then it would have been better to hire an independent photographer. Of course that would be more expensive, which leads me to: 2. You get what you pay for. You said yourself that you \"got a great\" deal. The fact that the company would be more likely to let you find someone else than work to keep you tells me that your business isn't worth much extra cost or work.  3. What \"extas\" your asking for are actually rather expensive. Extra prints and an extra hour of the photojournalists time is quite a bit of money.  That all said, maybe start looking around and see how your package compares to others out there. It will either enforce the fact that you're getting a good deal and it might be worth it or it will let you know that you need to hire someone else. ", 11484, "8wuQSULlaa", 2],
	140815 : ["\"do they have the right to do that?\" Yes. And, truthfully, you don't even want those 500. Because here's how professional photography works: For every twenty shots you try to get, one is good. You run the high speed, and you shoot like mad. Half of them will have bad focus or lighting. In one, the kid in the front row has a finger up his nose. In one, three people have their eyes shut ... You get the idea. A few are even of the walls and floor, because in the digital age it makes sense to just keep shooting while you move. You take those 500, and (if you're lucky) you spend three days tweaking and cropping to get 100 good shots. Then you show *those* to the client, and s/he picks the desired prints. \"what's the legal stand on this issue?\" The legal stand is that the photographer owns the copyright. Your money buys the service, and the physical manifestations of that service (prints, albums, disc, whatever), not the art. This very common practice. Exactly how it works. And I'm sure you'll be very pleased with the results if you're able to just relax and let the photographer finish his or her job. :)", 11484, "LCVOjJDIaa", 0],
	140816 : ["I think you should just let it go.  Timothy Whaley is a great photographer studio and does phenomenal work around the Chicago area.  If you got a great deal then just move past it. It stinks that they didn't communicate the way you would've hoped, but with studios, you don't always get the personal attention you are hoping for. And, as a sidenote, if those photographers were not the ones specifically mentioned in your contract, then you have no ground to stand on.

Cover with prepared stuffing mix. Leave the stuffing mix dry the way it comes in the container. Bake at 375 for about 20-25minutes - until chicken is done and juices are clear.

It is certainly a helluva lot better than any other brand of puppy food, so maybe you just feed the adult version and add a little fish oil to it.  I think mainly puppy food has more fat content.  All baby mammals require extra fat for optimum brain development.  Cheap canned salmon is an excellent source, too.  I give it to my dogs regularly.   I feed raw, and I would never go back to kibble.  You might like to do some research on that.  Leerburg.com would be a good place to start, they have a ton of free articles and videos there.  But I hear this blue buffalo is pretty good.   Even the adult formula is probably tons better than any other brand of puppy food, so if you cant find it, i am sure you will be ok.

	140828 : ["You can do a lot of the prep work in advance. Once you've selected the vases/containers for the candy, you can bag up enough candy to fill it, so all that needs to happen day-of is pour it in.  Keep in mind that not all of your guests will want to take candy, so have enough for everyone to fill a small bag, but not an excess (or you'll be sick of candy after your wedding!).  Also, if you have any kind of event staff (servers, catering staff, etc) it might help to have someone keep an eye on the table. If there are children at the reception, they may go a little crazy near the candy, so be prepared for spills and things like that. It's a super cute idea, and I think if it's planned out well, it'll look great!", 11485, "s5moIiACaa", 1],
	140829 : ["I'm biased because I'm a candy freak, but I love that idea. My fiance and I both love candy, so it was an obvious choice for us. It's also doubling as our favors (we're getting cute little personalized boxes for guests to take the candy home in).  Just made sure you buy wide enough vases or containers. My mom expressed that concern to me when I was considering using tall, slender vases for the modern look but she pointed out that once the candy was below the half-way point, guests wouldn't be able to get it out unless you had a ladle or something. Bowls will probably work best.  It's pretty inexpensive to do and I don't think it requires a lot of set-up. You're basically just putting candies in containers and making sure they're nicely displayed with little signs saying what each thing is. However, I would rethink the chocolate fountain if you want a candy bar. That's a lot of desserts and overall, it's not necessary. I know that we had had a lot of \"self-editing\" to do when it came to making choices (we originally wanted to pass out more favors to everyone, but nixed it because it was too much). Think about it: a sweets table, the cake, dessert, the candy bar AND a fountain? That's overwhelming! But it's also your choice, if that's what you want :) Happy planning.

	140831 : ["I think if you are happy with the photographer then let it go. Companies are big, things get lost in the mess. You need to stay on top of the companies you are working with...as stressful as it is. The other photographers already being booked, or leaving, isn't anything they could control. And if you already got such a great deal, I think asking for more is a bit much. Don't stress about something you can't control.
