And the men at the funeral were all WW2 vets.  His son and I chose red and white carnations to cover the casket. He helped open the Concentration camps in Germany, he never talked about it, but after he died I was sent his records. I thought the service was beautiful.  And you can be angry at George Bush, he wanted to go to war with Iraq, long before 9/11. Iraq did not send planes here to New York, that was Afghanistan. And I worry that Bush wants to go to Iran now, and our poor boys are so tired, some of them have been to Iraq for three tours of duty.

Yesterday, British forces killed a senior Taliban leader, and several others surrendered.
