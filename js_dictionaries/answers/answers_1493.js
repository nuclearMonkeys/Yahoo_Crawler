I don't like Tristan, Morgan or Ivan. I've known several female Morgans, including a cousin, so I'm afraid it's become very feminine to me. I don't know why, but Tristan sounds androgynous to me, too. Maybe because it sounds like Kristin? And Ivan will always be followed by \"the Terrible\" in my mind. What about...

	80306 : ["Correct decision to send Fletcher off? (be honest...don't say yes because you hate united) No definitely the wrong decision but i don't blame the ref he just made a mistake, the ridiculous thing is there is no way to appeal so his mistake cannot be rectified! Man of the match? Park, also Carrick played very well extremely disciplined performance didn't venture beyond the halfway line much, just sat in front of the defence and stopped Arsenal playing there passing game! Best performance in an Arsenal shirt tonight? Nasri, worked his socks off! Also Van Persie always looked dangerous and again Almunia made a couple of very good saves! Who do you want to join Manchester United in the final? I would rather play Barca so we can play a European team in the final and it would be a very open attacking game, but at the same time i really want Chelsea to hammer them tomorrow because of the way the Barca fans and players reacted to the result last week!", 9022, "El7C2JsMaa", -2],

I do alot of cooking and at present thinking about buying a new cooker to fit different styles of cooking, ie I like stir-frys so a wok burner would be an advantage, plus it will have to have a double oven as i cook many dishes at one time to put into portions and freeze. It must also have a cover over the hob so when plating up it doubles up as work surface.

The Lite one is free to download - had it for years now. The version you have to pay for allows you to have more than one checking account. (I do not tie this to my checking account - I input the check register manually). It's a pretty cool package but not as good as Quicken Personal. It has the check register, and it shows you pie graphs and charts of where your money is going. It also has a budgetting tool - which I do not use - since I'm a saver - not a budgeter.

I can say they have really made me angry over stunts they pulled, but I use them because of the business pro software is what we need.  They decided to make everyone upgrade (I did not need to as the version we use does everything we need. It was over $500 to update). This was no big deal to stay with our version, but they stopped our program from being able to bill invoices by email (which was why I had updated to the version we use), I called headquarters and could not get anything changed. I think they need to have a class action suit for this type of trickery to make you update. We found a way around it, but that is no way to treat customers. I have had them since the the early 90's.

	80322 : ["Tristan is my favourite on this list - my boyfriend and I are considering it if we have a son. we both love it. Bram reminds me of Bram Stoker, author of 'Dracula'. It's the only other time I've ever heard that name, and truthfully, it's not my style, but to each their own. Seeley reminds me of Seeley Booth, straight away, first though. Naturally, if you're not a 'Bones' fan you wouldn't make this connection. That said, the name sounds rather old fashioned, as does Abel, Malcolm and Ivan, IMO. Cormac. I'm not sure. I don't like the sound of it, but that's just my opinion. Willem - not a fan of the spelling. Depends on how you intended on pronouncing this, because knowing someone with that name who spends their life correcting others on the pronouncation, I hope your child wouldn't do the same. Vaughn sounds much more like a surname to me. I don't favour it as a first name, Ross sounds a little old fashioned, but perhaps paired with a more modern middle name, it would not sound too bad.  Murray - reminds me of the Murray River, and growing up in a town on the Murray River I have a soft spot for the name, and have considered it as a middle name for my son. Morgan reminds me of the character from Bananas in Pajamas, although actually, I don't mind it. I prefer it for a girl, but it's not too bad really.", 9018, "rtiyUiaZaa", 0],

The ref can only see whats in front of him mate,and his view was obscured,if he had trial by error,with a replay of the incident flashing in the stadium,then he could recind the card,but i'm glad refs make mistakes and have to live with it,or there would be no talking points to debate about.

	80350 : ["You know when you go to the beach and you see the foam building up along certain places. Well this \"foam\" is excess protein that builds up, which is what happens in the home aquarium. The excess protein is very damaging to the fish and invertebrates. To solve this solution, you will need a protein skimmer. A protein skimmer simply removes the protein on the top of the water and puts it into a collection cup where you eventually clean it out. A good typical protein skimmer can cost you around $150. In my personal experience, I have went cheap and kept thinking that it will work, but the saying \"You get what you pay for\" is never used better when buying a protein skimmer. So buying one that is rated for about 2.5x the aquarium size is the best. So for quality and long time usage, you will end up buying one for around $200. Here are three protein skimmers that work well in the saltwater aquarium. 1)  2)  3)  Now an aquarium can survive without a protein skimmer if you purchase an aquaripure. This unique type of filter uses a bacteria to convert the nitrate atoms into nitrogen gas and releases it into the air. Here is the website for the aquaripure nitrate removing filter: If you choose to not purchase a protein skimmer, then doing double water changes and having a power head break the surface tension, then you will most likely be fine. Your current filters are just fine and using a carbon cartridge will do the aquarium justice. So now that filtration is out of the way, then lets move onto maintenance. As far as maintenance goes, you will just need to change the filter and clean the protein skimmer cup every month. Or two weeks if the tank is looking pretty gross. Water changes are virtually impossible to skip if you want a healthy system. But due to the greatness of an aquaripure filter, then you will not need them if you own and maintain one. (Maintaining an aquaripure filter is easy and you can read the instruction booklet if you purchase one.) But if you don't 25% weekly water changes are required. Along with the fact that you need to pre-cycle the water before hand. So having an extra barrel of garbage can full of saltwater, with a powerhead for circulation, then you will just have to drain the tank and then re-fill it. Oh and when the water level drops and you need to add some more water. Just add fresh water, because the salt doesn't evaporate and the salinity of the water will rise, so adding the fresh water will neutralize this. But obviously during a water change out then you need to replace it with salt water with the same salinity and temperature. (Salinity is salt content [about 1.022-1.026 is a good salt range]) When purchasing salt, try and buy one starter pack. This will give you a hydrometer (salinity and specific gravity reader) and some test kits. Then if you need more, just simply buy extra salt to finish the job. The best brand of salt is probably Instant Ocean, but they usually don't sell starter kits so buy the Red Sea starter kit for best success. So on to the fun stuff. A good basic starter fish is either a damsel or chromis ($4-5 each) And once your aquarium is up and running for 2 months, you can try these fish. And if they are a success then you can move onto more kinds of fish such as clownfish ($13-16 each) and so on. After about 4 months of continuous success then you can move on to some more vibrant and beautiful fish. Dwarf Angelfish ($20-50 each) Dartfish ($13-20) Gobies ($15-30) Tangs ($25-55) Eels ($25-50) Pseudochromis ($10-20) Basslets ($20-40) Anthias ($20-50) Blennies ($12-30) Butterfly Fish ($20-65) Cardinals ($8-25) Dottybacks ($5-15) Hawkfish ($15-45) Dragonets ($15-30) Pufferfish ($30-60) Wrasse ($15-35) Triggerfish ($15-90)", 9023, "None", 0],
