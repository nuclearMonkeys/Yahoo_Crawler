Are. In. China!\" as if he hadn't already figured that out. The last time I happy-freaked out over something minor with the same sort of intensity as someone who just won a fabulous prize was earlier tonight when I was watching today's episode of Jeopardy that I Tivo'd. I'm a total nerd addicted to that show, and I'm always boisterous watching it, but tonight when Alex read this clue: \"Shelley said of this, \"Hail to thee, blithe spirit! Bird thou never wert!\"; Wordsworth said they \"soar but never roam,\" I literally screamed out \"WHAT IS A SKYLARK!\" I was so happy. I then berated the contestants for not answering correctly.
