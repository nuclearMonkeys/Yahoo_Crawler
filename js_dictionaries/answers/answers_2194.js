	115495 : ["The explanation you found is correct. In those days women were little more than chattel, bought and sold for their sexual services. The law here is basically saying that if you're caught stealing you pay for the merchandise and you own it. Marriage in those days required the groom or groom's family to pay a bride price to the father of the bride. Thus marriage was little more than sexual slavery with a figleaf of social respectability. It's not really true that a non-virgin woman would have to become a prostitute, more likely she would become a concubine (which is also a sex slave, but more explicitly so than a wife, and without the social respectability.)  But a concubine brings a much lower price than a wife, so a girl who loses her virginity has cost her father a lot of money. Hence the social requirement that girls remain virgins until marriage. If you really want to open your eyes, continue reading Deut 22:30-38, where we read the law for when the buyer (husband) wishes to return the female merchandise to the seller (her father). There is only one legitimate reason that can stand in the law: if she turns out not to be a virgin. So -- what's to prevent an unscrupulous jerk from marrying a girl then claiming she's not a virgin after their wedding night? The law here is clear: her father is required to bring proof of her virginity to the town gate, said proof being a cloth. Clearly this cloth is the sheet on which she lost her virginity, a sheet stained with a distinctive mixture of semen and blood. If the father cannot provide the cloth, the girl is stoned to death. Now ask yourself: how did Daddy get that cloth? When you realize that even today a father \"gives away\" his daughter at a wedding, you'll have your answer.", 10425, "0073200fccd48c9bdcef873067339950aa", 3],

It was a huge rape case and everyone knew about it, them being white played a role but not the only part of it. it was the fact that it was a huge school that made major head lines and ruined their lives. and because it got such huge publicity as a rape case, and a lot of people thought \"those white kids are probably going to get away with raping that girl just because they are rich and have the money to get out of it\"  now it turns out that they really didn't do it and are stuck with the stigma of being accused of rape and being on national news for such a long time. the fact that they are white rich kids actually made it worse for them, because of that, they  were on the news everyday and people believe their money might have played a role in the girl saying it never happened. so even though it never happened, people will always wonder how their money might have influenced the entire thing. if they were poor and somehow got this much attention, people would never question if money had anything to do with their influences. its not that this kind of situation never happens, its that it don't make it on CNN every day. and making it on national news makes it so much worse for them, they cant just move out of state and pretend it never happened, its everywhere.", 10420, "AA12192295", 0],
