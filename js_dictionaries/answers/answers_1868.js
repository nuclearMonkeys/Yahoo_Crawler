	99141 : ["initially yes, but the man is in very poor health and he did leave signs Back on April 29, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI did something rather striking, but which went largely unnoticed. He stopped off in Aquila, Italy, and visited the tomb of an obscure medieval Pope named St. Celestine V (1215-1296). After a brief prayer, he left his pallium, the symbol of his own episcopal authority as Bishop of Rome, on top of Celestine's tomb! Fifteen months later, on July 4, 2010, Benedict went out of his way again, this time to visit and pray in the cathedral of Sulmona, near Rome, before the relics of this same saint, Celestine V. Few people, however, noticed at the time. Only now, we may be gaining a better understanding of what it meant. These actions were probably more than pious acts. More likely, they were profound and symbolic gestures of a very personal nature, which conveyed a message that a Pope can hardly deliver any other way. In the year 1294, this man (Fr. Pietro Angelerio), known by all as a devout and holy priest, was elected Pope, somewhat against his will, shortly before his 80th birthday (Ratzinger was 78 when he was elected Pope in 2005). Just five months later, after issuing a formal decree allowing popes to resign (or abdicate, like other rulers), Pope Celestine V exercised that right.

	99148 : ["Here are the two sides of the point you want to find out. One is that you want to see proof of God. The other is you want proof of no God. The first one is by far the more easy one to establish. All one has to do i s show proof and the que4stion is answered. To show no proof one would have to survey and document everything known and then have nothing showing a supernatural influence result from that search. I much harder standard of challenge. Most atheist and non-believers, like myself, find that any evidence would be a welcome diversion from the textual based or interpretive based examples of proof of existence of God. An analogy goes something like this. I need an exterminator because I have bugs in my home. You say Oh I don't believe you I have been to your home many times and never seen any bugs. I say, come over Tonight and I will show you. And I do and when I get there you show my a cabinet and there are several bugs scurrying about and I say, Oh I guess you do have bugs.  Then You say, you must have bugs to since you live next door. I say I don't think so But I will check. You look here and there and find no bugs. no evidence of there being bugs or anything out of order.  You, my friend ask if I called the exterminator and I say, I have no bugs. and I don't but for the lack of belief on your parts you try to convince me I do and I better do something about them of my home will be overran with them. I try to assure you that there are no bugs and if there were I would immediately take action to get rid of them.  So my neighbor comes over and looks high and low too and says, I know you have some your just not looking in the right place.  The point of this is if the adherents have tangible evidence for God then they have the burden to produce it. And if it is a reality as they insist, then it can be shown. But normally what you get from adherents is anger, insults and logical fallacies to try to support their view.  All an atheist or non-believer wants is some sort of proof. We do not need to see the whole swarm of bug, one would do just fine. Adherents assert with unchallenged certainty that they are correct and know the answers to the questions of the supernatural without a single device that supports the claim. The Muslims are the worse about that. They are so arrogant that not only do they not show claim of a supernatural but they say the very writing of the words in the Qur'an are a miracle.  I would certainly agree if they were written in English, as that language as we know it was not around at the time. I would have to conceded that would be a bit of a miracle. Plus the idea that the illiterate goat header couldn't come up with this story compiled from the known stories throughout the land and be able to make up the store is nothing short of what Joseph Smith claims.  If I was to compare the two tomes, I would have to give Mohammad the credit of an intelligent illiterate man. Many people mistake being illiterate with ignorant or stupid. Not so the case. Everyone of us are illiterate in many things. Many subjects allude our study and understanding. This doesn't have a measure on our intellectual ability to form stories and to compile fantasies of compelling stories.

One of my high school teachers a number of years back presented a hypothesis of how \"time\" proves God and the more that I thought about it, the more I can't deny it. The hypothesis goes something like this: hypothetically, if one could go back in time forever (logically, it is impossible), then we never would have come to this point in history today. That being said, time required a starting point to exist (as does everything else). The logical explanation for the beginning of time is the work of a supreme being (i.e. God).

In the natural world all organisms must have a purpose, so it makes no sense that evolution would allow such thoughts to arise. So, they come from God.

	99161 : ["Your question, though seemingly difficult, is actually quite simple.  Its complexity arises not from the conditions which you will \"prove\" your answer, but rather from your understanding of  who/what God is.  Let me explain: What we do know is that our universe is expanding...growing.  If you put that theory in REVERSE..that means at one time it was smaller.  If you can just reverse this process ALL THE WAY, we go back to what many call the \"Big Bang\" or the Origin. All matter/energy comes from something right? This is not a new theory.  But the very creative \"force\" that caused the Origin, can be called \"God\".  New problems arise when defining God, however.  Many have \"assumed\" that God is a benevolent, omnisicient, omnipotent, omnipresent force...THAT is harder to prove.  As a matter of fact, these attributes seem to contradict one another.  For example, Benevolent cannot be paired with the allowance of \"evil\" (unless the evil has also been created as part of some \"plan\" of nature)...whereby \"God\" is then defined by the natural course of things....and becomes a \"bystander\".....a watcher of His creation.   And if all matter/energy comes from something...where does GOD come from?  I submit to you that the Nature of Creation...one of its fundamental rules is that all matter/energy comes from something else...but is there something outside of creation...yes (hence the origin) that may not be subject to Creation's laws?  Perhaps. I do believe in a creative force...God.  But His nature is unknown to many Men.  And to them that do know,  they cannot convey this meaning though all of them yearn to do so.  There is no prove POSITIVE of what you seek, but observing and looking at things you KNOW to be true, it could be quite simple to arrive at a good conclusion in favor of something which started Creation, although its nature is unknown to you.  I see proof positive all around me....but that also is according to understanding who GOD is.

	99173 : ["This will get quite long but you did ask for people to be conclusive.  It should be clearly stated (and others have already noted) that it is impossible to prove that God exists or does not exist in a deductive sense. No one can prove or disprove God in the same way as we can prove or disprove 2+2=4. So that leaves us with inductive reasoning. Is it more or less likely that God exists?  Now there are generally three different ways people have claimed to know God. The mystical (direct personal experience), through reason, and through revelation (the Bible, the Koran).  You have (and I think correctly given the format here) rejected the use of personal experience.  This leaves us with reason and revelation. So do reason and revelation give us give us reason to think that the existence of God is possible? Or to put it differently, given what reason and revelation can provide is the possibility of God's existence 51% or greater? I am convinced that they do and I'll explain.  Reason: There are several logical or rational \"proofs\" for God's existence and usually people discount them because they do not prove God in a deductive sense. But this represents a misunderstanding of the agreements and proof as these agreements are intended to be taken inductively. None of them alone proves God exist but taken collectively they push the probability of his existence higher. The argument from design says that the world and universe are far too complicated to have arisen from any source other than an intelligent mind. This argument is often confused with a rejection of Macro Evolutionary theory, but there is nothing in the intelligent design argument that conflicts with Evolutionary theory, despite what some people in Kansas might say. Given things like the laws of physics, atomic structure, the position of the Earth in relation to the sun, and the high complexity of life it is statistically quite unlikely that the universe could exist as it does without a higher Mind or Creator behind it.   There is also the often-misunderstood cosmological argument, God is the greatest conceivable thing, not because I define him that way, but because anything greater than God would become . . . well God. It's similar to numbers going on forever because you can always add one more. If the greatest conceivable thing (GCT) exists in one possible world, it exist in all possible worlds. This occurs because if the GCT did not exist in all possible worlds it would no longer be the GCT as we can conceive of something that exists in all possible worlds. So this means that if it is possible that a GCT exists, it does in every possible world and as such the real one. To summarize; 1. It is a possible that a GCT (God) exists. 2. If 1 is true than a GCT exists in some possible world. 3. If 2 is true than a GCT exists in every possible world. 4. If 3 is true than a GCT exists in the real world as the real world is a possible world. 5. So a GCT exists in the real world. 6. So a GCT exists. 7. So because God is the only GCT, God exists. I am defining possible worlds as any world that might have conceivably existed, but may or may not actually exist. There are conceivable worlds where cyclops and dragons exist, but they don't in the real world. I don't see that there are conceivable worlds where numbers and matter do not exist (If anyone can logically conceive of such a world please explain it to me).  With that understanding of possible worlds I think this argument becomes quite well grounded. Most philosophers will not dispute 2-7(but it's always possible there are some) and argue against 1. I have found that most people who dislike this argument perceive it as a trick or a gotcha game and do not argue against the substance of it. I welcome disputes of substance but we shouldn't disregard things just because they make us uncomfortable. I have heard some people try to bash this argument by inserting The Flying Spaghetti Monster (TFSM) for GCT and saying “See we can prove TFSM exists.” All this does is name God TFSM instead of God. The concept and identity of the entity is the same whither you call it God or TFSM. If you want to call God TFSM go ahead, I don't mind. God or TFSM might, but I don't. There is also the argument from cause and effect. Another answerer already pointed this one out so I will be brief here. The Universe has a beginning. This is almost universally accepted by science and good philosophy. The Big Bang did happen and an infinite universe leads to logical problems and becomes incoherent because you cannot cross infinity. So something or someone had to cause the Universe to start to exist. Whatever that something is it must exist separately and outside of the Universe or it would not have existed to cause the Universe. This same thing cannot be a naturally occurring rule or phenomena or we would see other universe starting to exist as the rule worked again. The only thing that can act independently of natural laws are minds. So whatever caused the Universe must be a mind that is separate from and independent of the Universe. This fits the standard definition of God.   While Yahoo says my answer is too long so I had to cut the stuff on revelation.  That bites.  Ask the question again later and I'll put it there or send it to you if you like.  So I think it is quite reasonable to believe in God and even the Christian God.

Please go head over heals trying to convince me now.\" Not being rude i am just saying there will never be absolute proof. you have to choose for yourself. or if you will... go out and look for the truth on your own. no one can decide this for you so stop pretending like you are taking deep consideration of everyone elses claims because in the end you will be an agnostic again. Until YOU truly feel that you have found your belief and that belief is right, you will always be. Also there are more religions than \"God or no God\". There are religions like Buddhism and many more. So you will most certainly find one you agree with.", 9684, "None", -3],

Science does not deal with the supernatural, aka God. 3) The general stance of an atheist is a lack of belief. You can't provide any more evidence for a lack of belief in God that a lack of belief in Unicorns.  4) Providing evidence for the non-existence of something is extremely difficult if not impossible. (Which is why I don't take that position) 5) You're not going to find the answer you're looking for on this forum. I'm about 99.99% certain on this.", 9684, "u9Vcd0Qiaa", 5],
