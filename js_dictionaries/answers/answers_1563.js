I would suggest that to be \"single minded\" is the same as being \"narrow minded\". With one proviso - it's not good to be minded only about ourselves.

So 10 reporters working in parallel can finish the fact checking faster. Why do they dig for silver in Nevada and not in my back yard?  Why do they drill for oil in Saudi Arabia and not in the park across the street?  Because smart people search where the goods are likely to be found! Let's pick a recent example.  On Oprah, regarding her response to McCain's offer she said \"This time, there wasn't a family vote. Other steps in my political life, I've polled the kids, and I have abided by some of the results of the polls that the kids have partaken in. This time, no.\" video clip at:  But last year, to Sean Hannity she said \"It was a time of asking the girls to vote on it, anyway. And they voted unanimously, yes. Didn't bother asking my son because, you know, he's going to be off doing his thing anyway, so he wouldn't be so impacted by, at least, the campaign period here. So ask the girls what they thought and they're like, absolutely. Let's do this, mom.\" Clip at:  She said two different things on TV.  They can't both be true. Then there's the famous \"bridge to nowhere\" lie.  Even the Wall Street Journal called her on that one:  Most politicians weasel around and mislead with partial truths.  Bush and Clinton were masters at this.  But Palin is special.  She just flat out lies about things that are easily checkable.  There's a nice collection of Palin lies from the campaign at:  Here are a few highlights (see the link above for details) Palin lied when she denied that Wasilla's police chief and librarian had been fired; in fact, both were given letters of termination the previous day. Palin lied when she wrote in the NYT that a comprehensive review by Alaska wildlife officials showed that polar bears were not endangered; in fact, email correspondence between those scientists showed the opposite. Palin lied when she claimed in her convention speech that a gas pipeline \"began\" under her guidance; in fact, the pipeline was years from breaking ground, if at all. Palin lied when she claimed to have taken a voluntary pay cut as mayor; in fact, as councilmember she had voted against a raise for the mayor, but subsequent raises had taken effect by the time she was mayor. Palin lied when she insisted that Wooten's divorce proceedings had caused his confidential records to become public; in fact, court officials confirmed they released no such records. Palin lied when she suggested to Katie Couric that she was involved in trade missions with Russia; in fact, she has never even met with Russian officials. Palin lied when she told Shimon Peres that the only flag in her office was the Israeli flag; in fact, she has several flags. Now about the Obama part of your question.  People did fact-check Obama's book.  But Obama employed fact-checkers *before* he published.  He was smart and minimized the amount of 'gotcha' that could happen.  Not so Mrs Palin.  She didn't bother to fact check and that's how all these howlers got into print.

He was born to a Muslim father, but Obama clearly has accepted the christian faith because he has gone to the same church (although controversial church) for the past twenty years.  Furthermore, he was baptized at that church; therefore, he is a christian.  I was born to a muslim family, but I recently converted to Christianity.  What people say about obama being a muslim is:  Born a muslim always a muslim.  This is not true.  Those people make some argument that according to muslim law if you are born a muslim you stay a muslim.  That is absolutely not true.  I converted from islam to christianity and there was no problem at all.  By the way, when people refer to Islamic Law, there is no such thing.

The free state being one where the people have the rights that are granted in the Bill of Rights.  We did not get freedom with the Declaration of Independence nor from the Revolutionary War.  Those gave us Independence for the British.  We did not get freedom in the Constitution.  Freedom comes from the Bill of Rights only. Recently the Democrats passed mandatory health insurance.  They claimed they were concerned about the rising cost of health care to the taxpayer yet the don't seem to be concerned about the solvency of Medicare or Social Security.  They have no intention of addressing those.  Health care and coverage for it have skyrocketed since its passage. The president dictatorially mandated all employers provide contraceptives for employees.  Sounds like a free country right?  We now have a hate speech law.  Sounds like freedom of speech right?
