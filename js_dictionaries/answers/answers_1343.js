	72740 : ["Certainly possible.  I lost weight through reduced diet and exercise at a rate of about 12lb per month, starting at 230lb.  I'm now 185 and stable.  That rate certainly is fine, but it will taper off as you lose.  The idea that you will gain it all back is totally false...as long as you continue a healthy diet.  Obviously you cannot go back to your old ways and expect to stay lighter!  And the idea that it takes longer to lose weight is also nuts.  It took me 25 years to gain that 50lb and only 6 months to lose it. I would give yourself 8 months though, and use a table to chart your progression.  And don't give up if you don't lose it fast enough.  Just keep going.  I would walk at least 2 miles a day.

Depending on your pace and weight, you're probably burning about 300-400 calories every day just by running, which equals a pound of fat every 10 days. Also, your metabolism is boosted, and you're gaining muscle, so you're also losing fat this way. Giving yourself a day off a week is a good idea. On this day try doing some weights if possible, or try doing a bit of yoga to relax yourself while also staying somewhat active. Best of luck on your weight loss journey!", 8686, "4mcFd5Juaa", 1],

Techno music and Heavy Metal are great! I sometimes jump around to hip hop or rap. I also live in an apartment, so I can't do it too early or too late. I know It may seem retarded, but if you really want a good cardiac work out, and you don't want to go outside or use equipment, its a BIG stress reliever and you can just let go.

I play center for my high school and it is one of the hardest positions to get used to b/c you have to snap, step and and get ur hands up to block in one motion.

As for the raiders and myself being a life long raider fan ...the raiders are somewhat puzzeling to say the least. Al Davis being a coach in the past always has to have his hand in running the team somehow so its hard to really get coaches to want to coach here with out letting somewhat of the control go to Mr Davis. What is known in the NFL is that any team can change things around every year from the Patriots in the late 80s and year 90s from he Tampa Bay Bucs from numerous decades.... to the san diego chargers where the unanimous 1# overall pick (manning) refused to play for the team due to it being a bad team and yet the next year the team turned around and became a great team.

BTW, I hate them both and their teams with a passion. Go 49ers! Go A's! Go Giants! Al Davis and Raiders always find a way to loose games. The reason is poor coaching and motivation as a team. The last time they were any good was under Gruden and that was because he ran the team with little interference from AL at the time.

George Steinbrenner of the Yankees spend a lot of money, but at least the team gets to play baseball in October.  Albeit that they have fallen short during this decade. One can say that Steinbrenner somewhat gets his money's worth. That can't be said of the Oakland Raiders.  The Raiders is a complete mess of a team.  The team doesn't scout and develop well.  The team doesn't draft well and they don't spend their resources well either.  The team doesn't invest any time in looking for character people.  Teams that invest in character wins.  Teams that doesn't lose.  Take the Raiders, Bengals, and the Cowboys as shining examples of this.

You must walk as much as you can. Walk everywhere you can. Use of elevators and escalators must be reduced and instead of these you must climb stairs more often.

And don't go by what the scale says, go by how your clothes fit and how you feel, if you weigh yourself every day you will make yourself crazy because the body weight fluctuates from day to day, so limit your weigh-ins to once a week.  God luck. P.S.- There might be times when your clothes fit looser but the scale says you gained a pound or two.

Yet a 27% incline definitely seems to overcompensate for those 2 miles per hour slower. Add to this the 4-6 more minutes...... But in reality, it all comes down to you and how trained are you. If you do incline speed walking or jogging every day, then a 27% incline might not be that much of a challenge to you anymore, thus, you wouldn't have your body scrambling for resources as much as if you were new to it.

However, the Raiders seem to go after the \"B\" list free agents and the troubled boys. Now, Jerry Jones tried the same thing and for many reasons the Cowboys had another early playoff exit. I think their biggest problem is the owner - Al Davis. He is guilty of not being able to change with the times. Like the former owner of my favorite hockey team, and now the managing partner, Ed Snider, the inability to think outside their own box makes their teams produce the same result year after year after year after year. That is, very simply, the inability to produce a championship winning season. For the Flyers it has been 34 years, the Raiders have gone 25 years since their last one. Oh sure, there will be those that'll say how close the teams have come. They'll boast about those seasons that essentially are failures because management of the teams will ballyhoo the near-misses in order to keep sales of merchandise and tickets up to grade.
