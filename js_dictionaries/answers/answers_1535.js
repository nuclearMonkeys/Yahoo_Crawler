	82407 : ["The hypothesis will only be proven when it comes true.  That's the nature of the scientific method.  The proof will be that global temperatures rise by 2-5 degees C in this century. What we have now is a broad consensus (or not) among climate scientists that this hypothesis will come true and drastic action is needed now to avert the impending disaster. Current empirical evidence, however, is not supporting the hypothesis.  Ocean temperature as measured by the Argo buoy system shows no increase, but a slight decrease.   This is quite significant because the oceans hold 80%-90% of terrestrial heat.  Atmospheric temperatures are rising, but the rate of increase is nothing to be alarmed about- if you look at UAH data here: Other temperature sources paint a more alarming picture.  And sea levels seem to be increasing as well, but again the RATE of increase is falling off, contrary to what you would expect if the AGW hypothesis was correct. Note to Kool-aid drinkers:  This paper was published in a peer reviewed publication, not a right wing blog.  And yes, there is a link to the paper itself in the above link. I know there is some current empirical data supporting the hypothsis.  I also know there is research contradicting the sea level findings.  My point is, all it takes is one piece of contradictory data to falsify a hypothesis.  Furthermore, if there is such disagreement over the magnitude of the current warming trend or sea level rise, how can we possibly make predictions about the future?", 9102, "27MZpZrBaa", -1],

After all, you're calling them \"conservatives\" yourself, so you're doing the same thing - using a title for an entire group, based on hearing their opinion on one or two issues The truth is, Liberals these days don't like to be called liberals, so they use other titles, like \"moderate\" or \"progressive\" or whatever, which is silly.  I've rarely met anyone using these titles, that is really \"middle of the road\" politically, and I have friends that are literally so left-wing that they're essentially communists (wanting the government to nationalize all business, etc.), yet they insist they're not liberals. Typically, self-titled \"moderates\" fit neatly into the mold of liberals (therefore deserve the title), because of the issues they believe in: Pro-abortion. Pro-tax increases. Absolute near-obsessive hatred for Bush, Cheney, etc. Against the Iraq war. See little or nothing wrong with having Illegal aliens here. Against school vouchers. Want government paid health care. Heavy regulation of businesss. Support  environmental regulation at any cost. I'm not arguing the merits for, or against any of these issues above, I'm just saying they are in fact liberal issues. If you are a \"YES\" in at least 75% of what I just listed, then you're not a moderate, you're a liberal.

As a result they get bored, and have to pick non-issues to get passionate and argue about. Global Warming is one of thousands. Since their motivation is to continue to fuel their passion through indignation, instead of to come to a rational conclusion where all parties can agree, they tend to avoid logical arguments and instead use tactics to prolong the battle. For example liberals in academia intimidate colleagues who don't support global warming theories into silence, liberals in the media under report the level of reliability of models predicting the 2 degree rise and its consequences and the vast evidence against global warming, and liberals in Yahoo Answers calls conservatives cons and snobbishly insult the questioner for supposedly watching Fox news. Conservatives follow similar behaviors. They assume since some data is exaggerated that they can ignore all of it, they question the patriotism or manhood of liberals to boost their opinion of their own party, and they use their perceived moral high ground to slew inappropriate insults and to justify corruption. So to answer your question, no they don't feel silly. They never expected to win the argument. It's probably been a long time since they even cared whether or not they were right.

(e.g.The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is a glowing example). The assault from the executive branch on the Constitution and the citizens of this country under the current POTUS and the last is criminal. The \"old english\" of the Constitution was perfect then in its simplicity & even more so today, although because of the previously referenced unlawful legislative & executive actions (and judicial as well), we haven't lived under the benefits of several of those Constitutional Provisions for almost 200 years. As many advocate Amending or Repealing certain provisions of the Constitution, this is not solving their or my issues per say. Getting rid of the unlawfullness is almost an absolute solution. For once, let's not complicate that which doesn't need to be complicated. Do not be drawn into the disceptive arguments of the status quo & the perceived popular opinion advocates of believing that this is a too simplistic approach.

With a prostitute, the money she receives serves as incentive to make more money and thus fornicate more. If she could not make money, then perhaps she would give up prostitution. As an aside to the question, I think the best option would be polygamy. It would be better to take on a second wife than to have a mistress or to go to a prostitute. With a second wife, the children are legitimate and the relationship is moral. Furthermore, both wives would be entitled to equal time and treatment.

Whether it is immoral to have a mistress or pay for a prostitute's service depends on the circumstances.

It seems obvious to me why a faith based moral code would have one rule... the forbidden no matter what rule.... because it saves church leaders from having to solve individual morality questions based on the circumstances of each individual case.
