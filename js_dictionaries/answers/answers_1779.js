	94656 : ["Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that focuses on personal spiritual development and the attainment of a deep insight into the true nature of life. A Different Way of Faith  This makes Buddhism different from many other faiths for it is not centred on the relationship between humanity and God.  Buddhism doesn't fit the pattern of other faiths and needs to be seen in its own terms to be understood properly. Buddhists do not believe in a personal creator God. It does not have the concept of a Saviour, nor of Heaven and Hell in the popular sense.  Buddhism doesn't demand blind faith or belief, and says that people should test its teachings against personal experience. The Bare Essentials of Buddhism  2,500 years old  350 million Buddhists worldwide  Founded by Siddhartha Gautama in India The path to Enlightenment or Buddhahood is through the practice and development of morality, meditation, and wisdom. Buddhists do not believe in a creator God nor a personal God, but Buddhists are tolerant of those whose beliefs are different from theirs. Buddhists believe that nothing is fixed or permanent — change is always possible. Buddhism teaches that all life is interconnected, so compassion is natural and important. Beliefs         Tibetan monks use prayer wheel       Summary of the Teachings of Buddha Admission to the monastic sangha involves two rites of passage:  Karma: Actions have consequences; so our lives are conditioned by our past actions Rebirth: Consciousness continues after death, and finds expression in a future life Liberation from karma: By following the Buddha's path one escapes the cycle of craving and suffering The Four Noble Truths: The essentials of Buddhism Enlightenment:The highest goal of life is to reach Enlightenment; a state of being that goes beyond suffering Dharma: The teachings and hence the way to nirvana The Core of Buddhist teaching At the heart of the Buddha's teaching lie The Four Noble Truths and The Eightfold Path which lead the Buddhist towards the path of Enlightenment. Facing the Truth The Buddha taught that the human tendency is to avoid the difficult truths of life and this in turn leads to suffering.  By enabling the mind to be at peace through meditation a human being can confront reality and overcome hatred and craving.  for more information visit :", 9518, "AA10126684", 1],

(1) i've had  people ask me whether stepping on a bug is considered killing. The answer i was taught is that it depends on what your intention is/was. ie. was it an accident or not?

The greatest worth is self-mastery.  The greatest quality is seeking to serve others.  The greatest precept is continual awareness.  The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything.  The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways.  The greatest magic is transmuting the passions.  The greatest generosity is non-attachment.  The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind.  The greatest patience is humility.  The greatest effort is not concerned with results.  The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.  The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.\" Atisha.   \"If you live the sacred and despise the ordinary, you are still bobbing in the ocean of delusion.\" Lin-Chi.   \"Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I vow to cultivate compassion and learn ways to protect lives of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to condone any killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life.” Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh.   \"When the mind begins to become still, we then begin to truly see it. When you first try to stabilize and pacify the mind, initially it will become very busy because it's not accustomed to being still. In fact, it doesn't even necessarily want to become still, but it is essential to get a hold of the mind to recognize its nature. This practice is extremely important. ... Eventually you will find yourself in a state where your mind is clear and open all the time. It is just like when the clouds are removed from the sky and the sun can clearly be seen, shining all the time. This is coming close to the state of liberation, liberation from all traces of suffering. ... The truth of this practice is universal. It isn't necessary to call it a religion to practice it. Whether one is a Hindu or a Moslem or a Christian or a Buddhist simply doesn't matter. Anyone can practice this because this is the nature of the mind, the nature of everyone's mind. If you can get a handle on your mind, and pacify it in this way, you will definitely experience these results, and you will see them in your daily life situation. There is no need to put this into any kind of category, any kind of \"ism.\" Venerable Gyatrul Rinpoche ", 9518, "ZFllYTlpaa", 1],

	94687 : ["The word \"Zen\" actually means \"meditation.\" There is of course a centuries-long cultural tradition connected with Zen practice, but it is first and always a PRACTICE. The focus is not, in other words, on beliefs and concepts. (Actually the focus on beliefs and concepts is, speaking in general terms, more a Western religious approach.) One can believe and think what one wishes and still benefit from the sort of honest intimacy with life that is the healthy heart and foundation of Zen. ~~~~ EDIT: After offering the above I received the following from OP Jack:  \"Buddhism as a whole is a religion with doctrines, beliefs, and philosophies, and I wouldn't say that it's a Western religious approach; all religions have beliefs and concepts, including all Eastern Religions, including Buddhism. Don't try to turn Buddhism into something it's not.\" I'm a Buddhist minister, with graduate degrees in both Western Theology and Buddhist studies. It's a somewhat subtle but important point: there are LOTS of ways human beings are \"religious.\" The key to my mind is to look at the practical experiences underlying and giving rise to beliefs and rituals and the like. Some Buddhists are heavy into \"faith\" (namely, the Pure Land sect), but speaking broadly, \"belief\" is more emphasized by Western theistic currents (giving rise to \"creeds\"). Many Hindus, Taoists, Confucians, and, especially, Buddhists -- although they might embrace \"trust\" in their teachers and in the tradition of teachings -- the emphasis tends more to be on what you do and what you experience, rather than what you profess to believe.  A good example is the Kalama Sutra in Buddhism, where the Buddha calls on his listeners not to believe him, or anything simply because it's been said many times, but to accept instead only what they have found in their own experience to be healthy and wholesome and true. And Zen Buddhist takes that to a practical limit -- inviting its practitioners effectively to question everything they can conceptualize, to let go of concepts altogether, and connect with something much more original and simple and fundamental than any mere idea.", 9518, "EXgoY42saa", 2],
