I have however been on Yahoo Answers for whatever purposes like doing my homework and just seeing questions that seems interesting. When I was younger( 2 years ago), I wanted to know something about Wrestlemania 24 iIbelieve and when I used Google to find out, it brought me here to Yahoo Answers. I read the answers and it seemed like it was a social site and I love using Social Sites since I used to be on MySpace 24/7. I always enjoyed earning points in any game and it seemed like Yahoo Answers fit perfectly. When I signed up for Yahoo Answers, I knew in a second I would fit perfectly in the Sports section because I love basketball, football and wrestling. I didn't really know what my name should have been, so I decided to just use my name, Jordan, but it seemed too simple, so I looked around and I had my Air Jordan shoes laying around with 23 on it, so that began Jordan23 and that has been my name for what will be 2 years in a few days. I usually went back and forth answering from the basketball and wrestling section. After getting tired of answering \"Who is the best Center\" or \"Kobe or Lebron\", I left the basketball section and came to the wrestling section as my permanent section although I did go back, but much less.  WQ: Charisma BQ: I have no idea when to retire, I have taken a break for a few months from November 2008 to about February 2009. I don't plan on retiring until college at least. I love being on Yahoo Answers and made a bunch of new friends and I enjoy answering questions and helping people out.  BQ2: I'm not sure exactly who since I didn't really know anybody when I was still a noob, but I think the user called Chessy with the smiley Walmart like icon was a pretty. Another user I haven't seen is MAG, I have although heard a lot about Hannah Hardy, but that time, I was taking the break, so I never got the chance to even see her answer", 11417, "pnsp765saa", 1],

RE: car over heating ): Mitsubishi galant 2002? i have a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant V6 I am a 21 year old girl and i just replaced it with a new radiator but now the car makes a clicking sound and i notice the fan on the left of the radiator (there are 2) isnt spinning. the coolant container bubbles and eventually as the car gets to normal...", 11415, "mYuxrUOOaa", 0],
	139150 : ["why would being a 21 year old girl be germane?  Road runner is right, thermos first, power to fans next (multi meter check) coolant of the right quality and levels next, radiator assumed not clogged with leaves, reindeer etc. Meanwhile we've checked the drive belts including steering power and water pump, the pump isn't weeping from the wee hole under the drive boss, and the rest of the motor is in sound condition (some monkey hasn't retarded the ignition beyond the realms of fantasy). The car is 9 years old - is the mileage over 100000, does it need a serious service of all the bits, are the plugs good, is battery good, injectors clean nd mixture delivery right? Did this problem arise suddenly or did it creep up over months?  What was the most recent change - ok the new radiator.  So has the fan got a sound connection and earth, is it on a particular fuse that has blown or is the relay old and cruddy (the clicking noise) I'd suggest you get to a really trusted mecchie and tell him/her all, work logically through the story. An aside; a few vehicles need an elaborate routine of bleeding and topping up after a cooling system drain (Volks Transporter for one) involving ramping the car at an angle and various bleed screws released and re-tightened before all the air is out of the circulation; just possibly, yours is one of those, consult Works manual (download from Mitsubishis site i'd guess) Best of luck dear Lady", 11415, "mgQYrDBHaa", -1],

I was in a hurry and when putting the kids in the car I set them on the roof of my car... well then I couldn't find them so I ran back in the house and grabbed my spare set and drove off. It took a couple of days to realize what had done. You may want to try taking a walk and checking on the side of the road. Good luck. That totally sucks! **EDIT** One time I was in a hurry to get to my volley ball game and I ran in to the gym bathroom really quick to use the potty. I stood up quick and Must have moved just right because my keys fell out of the pocket of my fleece and went down the toilet as it was flushing. Totally sucked.", 11414, "7rCeCVl2aa", 2],

	139154 : ["Agree they had a great match when the Raw superstars were stranded in Europe. It was about to happen earlier this summer over the World Heavyweight Championship but Taker got injured during a match with Mysterio, Taker and Swagger were expected to have a feud over the World title at Summerslam but due the orbital bone injury, plans got canceled.", 11418, "oQIvuOQfaa", 2],
	139155 : ["I love swagger he's one of my fav wrestlers. And he's hot :) But anyways, right now wwe is portraying him as a joke. I doubt he will feud with taker. If he does it will be a joke kinda feud where he jobs to taker every time. Even if they make it a serious feud the audience won't take it serious right now. Taker won't go from having a feud with his evil brother to jack swagger who I haven't seen in a good fight since I don't know when...(although he kicked mvps *** in the take down challenge). I like him. I think he's a good wrestler. I take him seriously. However, many might not due to how wwe is portraying him and right now if he's gunna be in a feud with taker it won't do him good to be jobbing out. At this point in his career if he's feuding with taker it should be something that makes him escalate his career...not something to take up airtime. Undertaker doesn't need his career escalated its already far beyond that. If a feud is done it should be to make the other guy look good and give him a chance.  I think him and swagger should have a feud they had good chemistry and worked well in the ring together. Also swagger at the time before he became all serious was happy and smiley it was funny you see taker who doesn't smile at anything feuding with a guy like swagger. I would like to see it again lol! Hopefully they build up his character again as a wrestler to be respected for a few months and let him take back his old happy persona (the serious one is boring) then let him get into a feud with taker.", 11418, "EzLy01klaa", 0],
	139156 : ["Alot of people say this,but it's true for me too.I was searching for a specific answer to a question I had on a wrestling topic and I found yahoo answers.It looked decent enough and I thought I should just make an account at my convenience,so that was that.Although I'll admit that the wrestling section is more then just a question and answer forum in my eyes.I have become obsessed with getting respect around here..and some people might not wanna admit it but I will.And I know it comes from within my answers,so I'm going to work hard on that.Lol,does anybody find me weird? I hope not.It's not THAT big of a deal,but I still want it.Nowadays I ain't gonna lie,the WS seems a bit dead.When I joined a few months back,it was booming business.But I don't care,I'm still going to be here.Also,what I like is that I've met (and still am) some cool buddies on here.I've never met anybody in real life but they are friendly and I would if we all weren't so far away from eachother,haha! WQ- Christian is a talented wrestler,who IMO is very underrated by WWE and hasn't been given his rightful opportunity for a world title.If Vince got his head out of his @ss,maybe he would see that.Hopefully,Christian will win Money In The Bank this year,if he doesn't then I guess we know where WWE stands with him.I hope he does go on to win a world title in the future. EDIT:My bad,I'm so tired I didn't even pay attention.One word to describe him for me is talented. BQ-In 2020..totally jk.I really don't know,maybe when this section becomes extremely boring and I feel like there's nothing left to achieve.I plan on staying for the next year definitely,and maybe even longer.

I think this Mania will probably be the end and, while I like Swagger, he isn't going to have the honor of getting a feud in Taker's final stretch.

I have to agree with The Dragon; there really aren't a lot of original gimmicks to go around these days so I'll go out on a limb here. I've been thinking of a 1920s-30s gangster sort of gimmick. His moveset could consist mainly of \"old-school\" moves and his deal would be his disdain for the majority of the wrestlers these days.
