	96582 : ["Hi ?, Your friend is correct to suspect this.  It is physically impossible for 2 blue-eyed parents to produce a child with brown eyes!  Blue eyes are the recessive gene & brown eyes are the dominant one.  If there were one parent of each color, then brown would have been possible in a child 25% of the time.  There is zero possibility of those 2 parents having a child with brown eyes, even if they have other relatives in the family who do have brown eyes.  That's just how genetics works.  Blood type is another way to test that can exclude some possible parents but it cannot definitively point to who is the parent.  DNA is your best best.  It never lies. Here are some possible scenarios to consider: 1)  He could be adopted, foster, or a step, or the son of a relative. 2)  He could have been conceived using a stranger's or friend's (male, female, or both) donor genetic material 3)  He could have been born to a surrogate 4)  He could have been switched with another baby, purposely or mistakenly 5)  He could have been kidnapped or purchased on the black market 6)  He could have been conceived from an affair or other sexual encounter 7)  One or both of his parents have been wearing fake blue contact lenses all their life to cover up their real brown eyes There's no way around it - One or both of those people are not his natural parents. IMPORTANT NOTE - If your friend is adopted, obtaining his birth certificate is not necessarily going to give him the answers he is looking for.  The reason is because in all legal adoptions in the U.S., adoptees' original birth certificates with their factual information on it, are confiscated by the government and permanently sealed from them.  In its place, the govt issues an amended one, which is legal fiction.  Sometimes it works for legal purposes, sometimes not.  All of the real data is replaced with adoptive information.  Even his name is likely changed. Depending on state law, this is what I would suggest for your friend - Usually at the age of 18, sometimes earlier, any adult can contact the state dept of vital statistics to obtain a copy of their own birth certificate for a nominal fee.  Amended ones look similar to real ones except they must be filed 6-12 months AFTER the date of birth.  Sometimes it's years later after the birth depending on how long it took to process all the legalities associated with adoption.  Look for the stamp near the bottom that says \"filing date.\"  If it's within a few days of his birth, an adoption did not occur, but that still does not explain the genetics impossibility of eye color.  In a limited number of states, adult adoptees can obtain their original birth certificate, but they have to specifically ask for that one, or else they will receive the fake one that is the legal one on file for them.  He might want to register with International Soundex Reunion Registry to find his family in case there is someone looking for him.  It's free.  See my link under sources for that.  Another option is to petition the court where the adoption was filed.  That has not traditionally been successful though. The fact that they refused to show him his birth certificate is a bad sign.  There may be some older relatives or family friends who know the truth.  As previously mentioned, the only way to absolutely know for sure is to do DNA testing.  This can be done with or without their knowledge.  He could also test with siblings or other alleged relatives.  Everyone deserves honest answers about who they are & where they came from.  I hope your friend gets to the bottom of this soon.  You might want to suggest an adoptee support group for him if it turns out he is an adoptee.  If so, he would be what's known as an LDA, or late discovery adoptee.  He will need assistance processing the shock of the new identity, new medical info, new ethnicity, etc.  Plus he will need to address the aspect of having been lied to his entire life about something very important!  Look under my sources for a good online adoptee support forum.  He will find other understanding adoptees there.  Please share this post with him.  Best of luck to your friend.  Thanks for caring about him, julie j reunited adult adoptee", 9586, "a2fd10af166e5b8b7d88fb2f32f097faaa", 3],

Trees do have a thick bark which helps from some outside elements, but fire quickly can penetrate that. Maybe they're still in the process of becoming fireproof. But you have to remember, evolution is slow, and not perfect. Also, forest fires are actually a good thing. It removes all the dead underbrush, and makes the land more fertile for tree seedlings to grow. And most firewood and paper that you use come from forest farms where they actually plant MORE trees than they cut down.
