Joints typically don't have filters. Not like a cigarette does. You can put a filter from a cigarette on a joint, but this is unpopular because the resin in marijuana will quickly create a film over the end of the filter that the weed is in contact with. It's explained saying it clogs the filter. It blocks optimal inhalation. Cigarettes have tar in them, and joints have resin. Both are sticky brown/black substances. Neither is good for optimal lung health. Marijuana smoke is often considered to be more pure and less toxic than cigarette smoke. Marijuana users typically hate to hear anyone say *anything* bad about marijuana. The truth is pot isn't perfect. The negative side effects of smoking is one reason that pot edibles have a market, and are popular. Smoke free way to get similar effects / achieve desired benefit. Lungs are not made for smoking.

Other proteins undergo a conformational change when they are chemically modified by the attachment or removal of a phosphate group or other covalent modification.  So, for example, hemoglobin undergoes a significant conformational change when it binds oxygen and goes from deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin. The two conformations of hemoglobin are referred to as \"relaxed\" and \"tense\".
