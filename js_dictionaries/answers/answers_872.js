	48286 : ["Try washing it every other day and if the length and ends of your hair get dry just put milk day on your hair its a leave in conditioner and it helps a lot if you have that problem where your hair is greasy at the top but dry at the bottom. Also please dont fall into that trap of never trim your hair i would say braid it just a normal three strand braid before bed, buy a satin pillowcase, massage your scalp every night, brush your hair from the ends and work your way up when people brush it from the top and just rip through it that's VERY rough on the hair and can cause a lot of dead ends and if you want longer hair dead ends are your worst enemy. But trim it only when you need it this is where not using heat, not using hair dye or bleach, and just take really good care of it and taking multivitamins will help because there's no gaps in your diet from lack of nutrition because you're getting everything you need. Drink lots of water and just be patient and my last tip is to take a before picture and take another one six months from now you'll be shocked and pleasantly surprised at how long it will be. Sometimes we don't see how far we've come and we need a reminder and a picture is a great reminder. I hope this helps and good luck.", 6820, "9QrlDP78aa", -1],

Funny thing though...since COVID prevented people from going to the hair salon during shutdowns, people are saving LOTS of money and embracing their natural hair...even as restrictions are lifted. Take a look at the store bought hair dyes... now they have several products as gray hair enhancers and dyes. My 42 year old niece has been dying her hair for 15 years and has now stopped dying her hair and she looks great. A 72 year old friend just began to loose his hair color to gray. So it reallyis not an age issue, it's genetics. Gray hair is being less and less associated with age as more and more people are not using chemical dyes!", 6835, "9MJS6I6Laa", 0],
