By reading up on facts you will discover many gems such as the fact that space is indeed a vacuum, but most planets have an atmosphere, just like Earth does. That is why the copter was able to fly a few feet above the surface of Mars. If it had gone up several miles it would have been in a vacuum in which case it would not have flown. Don't rely on the misleading nonsense you see in most tv \"documentaries\" which tell you they are about astronomy, when they usually aren't. Don't rely on astronomy and space websites because far too many of them are rubbish. If you are new to astronomy you will not be able to tell whether they are telling you the truth or trying to bulllshitt you. Old textbooks will always give you the honest low down.
