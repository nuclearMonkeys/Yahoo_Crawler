This is because deaths are now rare. The virus has mutated to a WEAKER strain as ALL viruses have done for thousands of years. This latest strain is more \"infectious\" but MUCH less deadly so the media only quotes the number of \"infections\" to induce panic for their agenda. The common cold is the most \"infectious\" disease on the planet yet NOBODY dies from it.

	1030 : ["Diabetes mellitus is a lifestyle disease; it is a condition that prevents your body from properly using the energy from the food you eat. And because we all eat several times a day, all diabetic patients are stressed about taking appropriate insulin shots or diabetes pills. This in itself increases stress levels for some. Some will tell you that diabetes is like a best friend who will be with you till your grave. But research has shown that diabetes is reversible. Dr. Neal D Barnard's groundbreaking clinical studies show that diabetes can be reversed or dramatically reduce the reliance on medication by helping repair how the body uses insulin.  This program is based on three pillars; diet, exercise & meditation. In this program, we not only explain the deeper causes of diabetes but go deeper into the root causes. Diabetes reversal is possible if you irradiate diabetic causes from the root. This program is based on research over several decades performed over people of different ethnic backgrounds around the world by various doctors. A similar program like this has already cured thousands of people across the globe. You could be next to reverse your diabetes. Dr. Barnard's program has proved a new dietary approach to preventing, controlling, and even reversing diabetes does work. Dr. Joel Fuhrman has also shown that preventing, improving, or even reversing type 2 diabetes is entirely possible. Dr. Gabriel Cousins has used spiritual healing in his holistic medical practice. These researchers, doctors, and many others, together have proven over and over again that diet, exercise and meditation can reverse diabetes. Dr. Pramod Tripathi has taken these learnings and helped thousands of diabetic patients in India as well. He has helped 1000+ patients get off of insulin, and 5000+ patients get off of tablets. Diabetes is a lifestyle disease. To tackle any disease, you have to attack the root because of it, and with diabetes being a lifestyle disease it is imperative that we attack it with basic tenants of life - proper diet, appropriate exercise, and mindful meditation. Diabetes Free Life is a non-profit organization formed with the sole purpose of promoting awareness on how to reverse diabetes. We aim to provide easy-to-follow and practical guidance to as many diabetic patients as possible. The three-stage program is based on a series of research by Dr. Barnard, Dr. Fuhrman, Dr. Cousens, and advice from Dr. Tripathi. Participants of this program may see significant improvement with their blood sugar management as well as improved general health by losing weight and also lower blood pressure and cholesterol.", 181, "Pwqi7n4uaa", -1],

But that can be a pain having to remember to carry reading glasses around and many opt for bifocals to wear all of the time if they need stronger reading glasses. Even if people have a very mild prescription for distance it isn't going to hurt to wear them all of the time, even if your eyes are still good enough to drive without glasses! Many people refuse to wear glasses and will try to avoid them or go straight to contacts. But even if you get contacts it is strongly recommended to get glasses to wear when your contacts are not in and alternate. If you never wore glasses before and need them it is not the end of the world! Get them and wear them with pride as almost everyone will need them during their life! Even if its a mild prescription you should always wear them to your eyes don't strain and give you headaches and that your vision don't get worse! By wearing glasses you will see things that you may have never noticed before, so do yourself a favor and if you need glasses get them and wear them all the time!", 183, "None", 1],
