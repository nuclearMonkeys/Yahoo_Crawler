He came to earth as promised= Isaiah 9:6 \"Unto us a child is born, a son is given and he will be the mighty God, the wonderful counselor, the prince of peace.\" Isaiah 52:13-53:12 \"He will be exaulted but first marred more than any man. He will lay down his life to make atonement for our sins.\" Revelation 1:1 chapter 1 verse 1 & 3:19&20 Jesus speaking from heaven says \"I love you and ask you to repent quickly from sin (even one lie) and turn to me. Behold, I stand at your heart door and knock if you open the door, I will come in and forgive sin, to help you and be your friend, to have fellowship with you and you with me.\" so I prayed; \"Jesus thank you that you love me and died for my sins. I am sorry for them, come into my heart and help me, be my friend, amen. (bring it to happen)\" and my new life began, in fact the fear of hell is what kept me as born a Jew who had everything money could buy, yet decided for all the hurt of life I was going to commit suicide, yet that week instead an elder lady came and shared the love of Jesus with me. \"God showed His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Jesus died for us.\" Romans 5:8 \"For the payment for sin is separation from God and hell forever, but the free gift of God is everlasting life through Jesus our Lord.\" Romans 6:23 Matthew 24:51 in hell there is weeping and gnashing of teeth forever. I as a bar mitzvahd Jew was taught to reject our Messiah as promised too Isaiah 53 \"He will be despised and rejected, yet he will lay down his life to make atonement for our sins.\" have a wonderfullest day in the Messiah for all people, and give life a chance more abundantly from the Jewish one named Yeshua, called from Greek \"God is with us\" =Jesus in John chapters 3&10,  best wishes, David the sweet pea", 9350, "None", -2],

	90169 : ["Most breeders will be willing to leave a dogs' tail intact if you ask them. The problem with this is that tails are docked before the dog is 4 days old. So you need to find a breeder before the puppies are even born and ask them to leave ones tail intact. They do it so young because puppies under 4 days old don't have a developed nervous system and therefore don't feel it.", 9355, "RNqHUNgEaa", 0],
	90170 : ["There are only a few reasons I can think of why a breeder wouldn't dock all the pups' tails automatically. First of all, if their pups are not going to show or hunting/working homes, and they just don't care.  Personally, though, I would think such puppies would probably not be very quality dogs if the breeder cared that little for them. Second, if the breeder for some reason was not able to have the tails docked in time (within that 2-5 day window) and was going to leave it up to the prospective owners as to whether to dock or not.  Accidents do happen or life circumstances can get in the way, so I could see this happening.  It'd just be a stroke of luck for you though. You might be able to find a breeder that was willing to not dock a puppy for you, but the difficult thing is that they'd have to pick your puppy right from birth (or at least within the 2-5 days that they would have the rest of the litter docked).  I can't see this happening if the litter might possibly produce dogs for show or hunting/working ability.  As the prospective owner, I would not like this option because that would automatically limit my ability to choose what puppy I wanted for a pet.  If you care nothing for the personality of your future dog, then maybe this is the option for you.   In all honesty, tail docking is not a big deal.  Puppies' nervous systems are not even fully formed when it is done, and they get more upset just from being picked up than they do from having their tails snipped.

I've come across some less then reputable breeders that tails were not docked- Doberman, rotties, rat terriers,etc. * Less then reputable=backyard breeders* I suppose some people didn't understand that. Tail docking actually serves a purpose, even today. How many dog's tails have you accidentally stepped on or the door shut on? I've guilty of accidentally stepping on some dog's tails. Didn't have the problem when I had dogs that had docked tails. Tail injuries are actually quite common in both cats and dogs.  It's done really early in their life- some times the pups sleep through it. I know backyard breeders sometimes don't bother docking tails on dobbies, rotties,etc and sometimes later in life that dog has a tail painful injury- I've seen this happen in real life, my mom's best friend had a rottie with a natural tail.

	90172 : ["A number of translations use the word “kill” at Exodus 20:13; among these are the Douay Version, the Catholic Confraternity, the American Standard Version and the Revised Standard Version. However, the New World Translation uses the word “murder” instead of “kill” at Exodus 20:13 because the Hebrew word here is ratsach, which means, according to Young's Exhaustive Concordance, “to murder, pierce.” Regarding this same Hebrew word Strong's lexicon of Hebrew words states: “ratsach, a prim. root, prop. to dash to pieces, i.e. kill (a human being), especially to murder.” To murder means: “to kill (a human being) unlawfully and with premeditated malice or willfully, deliberately, and unlawfully.”—Webster's Third New International Dictionary. It is evident, in the light of the rest of God's Word, that Exodus 20:13 did not prohibit all killing; for the Israelites were allowed to put to death, in fact, were commanded by God to put to death murderers, idol worshipers, breakers of the sabbath, and so forth. Thus execution of a murderer would not be unlawful in God's eyes and could not be considered “murder”; it would not be in violation of Exodus 20:13.", 9346, "AA12275506", 0],

	90178 : ["If the dog is being bought as a pet (and don't lie and request a show one if you have no intentions of showing), then the dog is required to be spayed/neutered by a certain time (usually by 6-9 months old). If you don't want to agree to this, then do not waste a breeder's time or money.  Be honest, don't be lying about spay/neuter and then not do it. Added - you can talk to them about later neutering, but if they don't agree - then do it in the time period.  I would say no more then 1 yr to have it done (that is reasonable), unless this is a very large or giant breed we are talking about.  Waiting for 2 yrs is a bit pushy and I can't see any breeder agreeing to that much time.

But you only have to be concerned about that if you may owe more than $1000 next April (above any withholding or estimated tax payments).  In that case you should file form 1040-ES with estimated payment by mid-January when last quarterly payment is due. But \"small\" is a relative term that has different meaning for different people.  If it is less than $3000-4000, it might not be necessary unless you normally owe taxes.  But if more than that, you should take a much closer look at it. For example if you are in 15% tax bracket, that and the 10% penalty add up to 25% or $1000 (of $4000).  If you normally get any refund at all, the only thing you need to be concerned with is coming up with that money in April. If you are in 25% tax bracket, 35% of $4000 is $1400.  If you normally get a refund of $500 or more that still may not be much to be concerned about.

	90204 : ["Why are you telling them about the dog your parents gave away when you were a kid? Though I have some serious issues with that story, that was not your dog and it's not relevant when you are trying to adopt a dog as an adult. You need to understand that rescues are usually the ones who have to deal with the dogs that get dumped when people move or they decide the dog is \"too old\" or that it's not getting along with their kids because they never bothered to train it or teach their children how to treat animals. Therefore it makes sense that rescues would try to do everything in their power to ensure that the dogs they place go into permanent homes and don't end up cycling back into the shelter system. When you tell them that you 1) may be moving a lot, 2) have young children, and 3) see no problems with giving away a senior dog to someone who plans to use him for breeding, those are 3 strikes against the likelihood of your being able to give a dog a \"forever home\" in the eyes of the rescue. And yes, you may very well be the exception to the rule, but unfortunately that well has been poisoned already and most rescues aren't willing to take the chance.  Of course, that is no excuse for the woman being rude to you, and I agree that the \"holier-than-thou\" attitude is frustrating. If you know that you are ready to commit to a dog then I would advise you go to your local county shelter rather than private rescue organizations. Typically at those places all you need to do is show proof of home ownership/landlord approval and pay a fee and you are set. And so you know, reputable breeders are usually even more selective about where their puppies go than any rescue. EDIT: Again - your parents owned that dog, you didn't, so not mentioning it wouldn't be lying.
