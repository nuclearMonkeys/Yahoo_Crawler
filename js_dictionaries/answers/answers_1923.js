	101900 : ["1.  So Gerhart pays 3.95, 1.45, and 1.10, for a total of 6.50.  To find the percentage that the tip is, you divide the tip by the cost of the food.  1.30/6.50 =.2, or 20%. 2. If the tip is 18% of the bill, that means that 6.48/X(the total bill) = .18  If you cross multiply, you get that 6.48/.18 = X, so X, the total bill, is 36 dollars. 3.  5.95 + 2.45 = 8.40 for the food.  20 % of the food is 1.68, so now the total is 10.08 for the food and the tip.  The sales tax = 8.4 times .05, which equals .42.  Therefore, the total that she pays is 10.08+.42=10.50. Hope this helps!", 9790, "9dba8fd793d11e5dc0acb7b038cbfd7baa", 0],

	101903 : ["Creativity is seeing what everyone sees and thinking what no one else has thought before. Invention is transforming these new thoughts into tangible ideas. Innovation is introducing these ideas to the end-user. Innovation is channeling creativity (managing its application i.e. invention) so as to produce ideas/products that people can and wish to use (i.e. marketable).  For an invention, the focus is on novelty and this is a key criterion for patenting. In other words, it must be new to its field all over the world. Innovation on the other hand does not have to be new except in a specific situation. Thus, as long as a firm (for instance) is having something for the first time, it is innovative in their context irrespective of whether it is new to their industry, country or the world.  Characteristically, an invention is anything that is novel and potentially practically applicable; an innovation is essentially novel, practically applicable and introduced to the market. Thus innovation may be seen as equal to invention plus exploitation i.e. invention plus commercialization and/or application of new knowledge in production in a particular environment.
