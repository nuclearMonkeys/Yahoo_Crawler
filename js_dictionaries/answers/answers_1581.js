IF you find someone who really understands you, you tend to want to be with them more and share more of your life with that person. I don't like that drama either. I don't invite all the other people to be with me because they are harping about the world or some other thing when I am not able to get out much and I want to have a good time or I want to go to the library when they want to go shopping . I like quiet and they like a lot of drama going on in their lives. We are different people It isn't that I don't like them, we are just different people.IF you attempt to tell them, they will only become butt hurt, and so, I just try to make time for them when I can and make it special and let them know that they are special to me for all the things they do and are in my life, and then I go back to being me. That is the best way I can tell you to do things. But do make a special time for them, an hour that you devote to only them, each of them. It is a pain in the patooty sometimes, but it is worth it in the long run. It allows them to feel special and it lets you off the hook. Make a special day just for the other friends.

	84718 : ["great, intelligent question! Agreed, this subject is emotional, and to give an objective answer may be futile, but just pointing out some facts may help. One fact is, mccain is obviously tied to closely to the bush ideology regarding iraq and our continued presence there. This is, of course, the sound bite often used against mccain (and rightly so). But another argument seldom proffered is mccain will continue the republican philosophy regarding the economy and the environment--two subjects mccain is weak on, and will no doubt continue to be uneducated on, and will no doubt employ many of the same people bush has appointed--and our country's policies will remain the same. Finally (and i think most important) : a mccain victory will allow him to appoint more conservative fundamentalists to the supreme court, and this will endanger roe v. wade and a woman's right to choose. I know there are many women backing hillary, and these women are probably firm in their belief that a woman has an inherent right to determine what she does or does not do with her own body (and i agree). But what if roe v. wade is overturned? then the government now will be telling these women that the government will now determine what these women can and cannot do (legally). What gauls me is the hypocracy of the right wing--they say they want less government yet they want to change control of a woman's body from her to the government!  Unfortunately, there are so many sound bites out there that it is difficult to have intelligent dialogue--emotions run deep--but lets hope the hillary-to-mccain voters (whether men or women) understand that they should vote democrat no matter what. And i think hillary will eventually stump for obama (should he be the nominee) and explain to her backers the need for party unity. If she doesn't, and mccain does win, many will blame hillary (rightly or wrongly) for the party's defeat and she will never get elected. Great question, have a star!", 9170, "V44ARW4maa", -2],

Am I a better and more committed conservative that he was because I have never in my life voted Democrat? Trump always supported Reagan. He still does. Trump hates Bush. Always has. Like Perot before him and McCain in 2000 - they have a thing about all things Bush.  I have reasons I like Bush(s) and I have reasons I dislike Bush(s) too -- both of them. On this 30th anniversary of the attempt on Reagan's life, I'll admit that on this day 30 years ago I thought \"Bush I\" might have had something to do with it. I knew his history and I didn't trust him. I like \"W\" to the degree I did and do because he wasn't/isn't like his dad. What I can say about Trump: He opposes abortion and gay marriage -- not all Bushes do. He believes in having the military patroling the Mexican border -- Bush never did. Neither does McCain. Trump wants to stick it to China and re-assert American sovereignty and monetary soundness. In some ways Trump out Reagan's Reagan. Reagan legalized abortion in CA when he was a (R) governor. He regretted it, because it gave cover for what became Roe v. Wade. So what if Trump finds Bush less inspiring than either Kerry or Hillary. OK so what. He was wrong back then. So was Reagan at one point. People change. Trump appears to have as well. Reagan sounded different in 1956 than he sounded in 1960. I'll give Trump a chance at this point because I like what I see and hear. It's usually like that with politicians one chooses to vote for.
