If you wanted something stich-bound with a hardcover on quality paper, vanity printing houses can deliver that.  Search on Google and you'll see many.  They have these machines like giant copiers that can take your pdf file and print and output such a book in low volumes with no manual intervention.  I suggest you be absolutely sure you have 1000 people who will want it, or will buy it, though.  Consider that many authors do virtual books on Amazon for like 99 cents, and still don't move that kind of volume.", 1190, "AA11562326", 4],

Covid is very much a \"I take care of myself disease and then I don't need to worry about others\".... so if you guys are too stupid to wear effective masks (3+ ply masks or multiple masks / face shield) or stay 3feet away from each other = getting covid is on you.  Your company doesn't get to determine who gets unemployment and who doesn't.  There are state and federal laws about that.  Your manager was offered a job.  If she doesn't take the job that was offered to her than YES, SHE QUIT and needs to pay back the signing bonus. If your new position meets the requirements to be an independent contractor position, then it's perfectly legal to pay you whatever is agreed upon.  If you don't like it, don't take the position.  - Your unemployment will be initially approved because you were laid off. - When you complete your unemployment paperwork, you are required to specify that you were offered work and declined it, as well as provide the reason.  If the position is really an independent contractor position and pays a reasonable amount, you likely will not be able to keep UI since you were offered a position and declined. ", 1202, "cK28Kl0Uaa", 0],

Unemployment does not like employers lying.  And they work very hard to get back up.  If they call him to verify and he refuses the call, you get unemployment benefits.  If they call him to verify and he says something that disputes what you put on your form, they will call you back, listen to what you have to say...and then they will call him back.  I'm guessing he will refuse the second call if he is still in the USA...if he refuses the second call...you get unemployment. If he cannot verify what he says...you get unemployment. You see, he has ALREADY paid in unemployment benefits as part of payroll the entire time you were working.  There is no reason except sheer vindictiveness to not allow you to have it.  The government WILL NOT refund his payments...not one penny. At the very least, you will be 'disallowed' benefits for 3-4 weeks and then start to receive them. oh...report this guy to the labor and relations board in your state.", 1202, "wMIOGYTbaa", -2],
