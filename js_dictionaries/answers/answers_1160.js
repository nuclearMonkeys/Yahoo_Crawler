	63497 : ["Bishop And The *** (Three letter word that means Donkey)       A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse racing, decided to purchase a horse and enter it in the races. However, at the local auction, the going price for horses was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third!  The next day the local paper carried this headline: PREACHER'S *** (Donkey) SHOWS. The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read: PREACHER'S *** (Donkey) OUT IN FRONT. The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headline read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S *** (Donkey). This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST *** IN TOWN. The Bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for $10.00.  The next day the headline read: NUN SELLS *** FOR $10.00. This was too much for the Bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey, lead it to the plains, and let it go. Next day, the headline in the paper read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER *** IS WILD AND FREE. The Bishop was buried the next day.", 8206, "AA10032498", 0],

However, a person who truly believes in Jesus and is filled with the Holy Spirit has the gifts and fruits of the spirit: love, peace, patience, kindness, etc. It becomes harder and harder for such Christians to demonstrate hate, even if they are wrongfully persecuted. For those of my Christian friends who still suggest revenge or retaliation, remember that the Bible states that if you give your enemy even a glass of water to drink when he hates you, it will be like putting hot coals on his head. So go ahead and forgive, as God has forgiven us, and love every person God has created, as God loved us even though we were once lost. Let the judgment be from God, for who can match His wrath when the time comes, and let us humbly pray lest we find ourselves at the receiving end too. Peace, Andrew", 8204, "jmgh4rcIaa", 1],
