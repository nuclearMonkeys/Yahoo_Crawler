	68985 : ["I use to WORK at a dirt track in Oklahoma. I LOVED it, that's some of the best racing in the world! If anyone has never had a chance to go, they need to find a local track and GO! If the track employees will let you go out on the track after the races, just to walk on it, you'll understand why it's so hard to drive on....it's slicker than snot but still pretty tacky if it's taken care of properly, it's just FUN!!! And every January I go to the Chili Bowl to watch my friends race. It's nice to also get to watch Tony, J.J. & Kasey run. (Even better that my friends pit is normally across from J.J.'s and Kasey's, even though it does give J.J. a chance to give me a hard time...trust me, he's a HOOT in person!)", 8484, "ktVuV2cPaa", 1],
	68986 : ["Gran Turismo 5 has NASCAR in it but only for PS3. And I have PS2 which sucks. Anyway, thats for 2010. I'm not sure about 2011. If EA hadn't made such crappy games lately then none of this would have happened. \"There are no new features we can really add\", they say. Don't add new features then. Make the graphics more realistic, make the cars handle more realisticly. Improve the physics, if the car spins around make air get under it if it's fast enough. Papyrus should go back to making them.

	68990 : ["They talked about this on Raceday a few months or years ago, I dont remember. Anyhow they said that they get a certain amount of money for each lap that they race and everything and they dont want to take any chances with wrecking their cars because they need to get enough money to pay for the equipment and crew members and etc etc. Also they may use that same car to try and qualify at some other track... I think that its kind of wrong as if you arent going to try and race why not just give up your spot to someone who wants to try and actually race on the track...", 8483, "246a7bb9b480d54babb8c05feac42a50aa", 0],

	68994 : ["So far there is no official word on a new Nascar game. EA Sports and Nascar have a contract that requires EA Sports to release one Nascar game a year and due to poor sales with Nascar 09, they decided to release Nascar Kart Racing for the Wii only. Nascar and EA Sports are currently working on a new contract to let EA Sports continue the Nascar video game franchise but if a contract can't be reached, Nascar could let other game developers make the next game. One rumor has Codemasters making the next Nascar game. If you own a PS3 you can play a Nascar game but it will not be just Nascar by itself. The upcoming PS3 game Gran Turismo 5 will include Nascar in the game. Not much is known about Gran Turismo 5 other than most people expect it to release in 2010.", 8481, "None", 1],
	68995 : ["Sadly,the answer to your question is nobody.EA has been a great partner to the sport but they have decided to move on and end their contract as the official supplier of Nascar games.The good news is Sony will feature Nascar in Gran Turismo 5,so you can look forward to that.If you want the newest Nascar game from EA buy Nascar Kart Racing for Wii.It is very fun and gives the player a whole new driving experience.", 8481, "i2HuXo6qaa", 1],
	68996 : ["Yes, but it depends, you must have the FAT model and it has to be the 20GB or the 80GB with 4 usb ports, the 40GB is semi backwards (not all the ps2 games can be played) but the other 2 they are full backwards, the 80GB 2 USB is not compatible with ps2 games, also i heard about a software emulator that you can download from PSN that allows you to play some games YOU MUST CHECK IF YOUR PS3 IS NTSC/PAL AND THE GAMES OF PS2&PS1 MUST BE THE SAME REGION!", 8482, "xH4Ed3Xwaa", -1],
	68997 : ["It depends on what PlayStation 3 you have. If you have a Slim or the new SuperSlim, then no, PlayStation 2 games cannot be played on it. If you have the original PlayStation 3 (Phat), then yes, you can. Though, it depends on WHICH Phat you have. Not all models of the Phat are backwards compatible. This also goes for PlayStation 1 games. Though, you should be able to buy/download those from the PlayStation Store. Unfortunately, I am not sure if they have any PlayStation 2 games in the Store yet.", 8482, "ZLcsKT2Daa", -1],
	68998 : ["You would only be able to play ps2 games on your ps3 if it's backwards compatible. The newer ps3's aren't backwards compatible. I purchased one for $300 when it came out thinking I'd be able to play ps2 games, unfortunately I had to learn the hard way. The ones that are out now (120 gb and 180 gb) are not backwards compatible.

If that's the case, you have two options if you want to have a PS3 and still play PS2 games, 1. You can buy a used 60g PS3, or you can buy a new PS3 slim for $299 and a new($99) or used PS2. I'd prefer the latter, though the former may me more affordable.", 8478, "XUVEDZzyaa", -1],
	69001 : ["I prefer the local dirt track over Daytona. I am not saying that I do not like NASCAR, I am just not a fan of the restrictor plate races. I went to the \"NASCAR duel on the dirt\", a week ago this past Tuesday, at Sharon Speedway. That was some of the best racing I have seen this year. The Daytona 500 was not exciting until the last lap. I would have been fine if I had not seen that race and would have caught only the last lap. Just a note. Kevin Harvick won both races that I mentioned. Sharon marked his first ever, dirt track win.", 8484, "9qhaTVNTaa", 0],
	69002 : ["Yep sure have..use to go to Sycamore Speedway in Illinois. Dirt track races are much more fun. I lived in Rockford that had a 1/4 mile regular track..we'd drive 30 minutes to go to Sycamore instead. They have 1/4 & 1/2 mile track. I love the crashes, rollovers, car fires, and the fact they don't get yellow flag happy and just let the race go after something happens provided a driver isn't in danger.
