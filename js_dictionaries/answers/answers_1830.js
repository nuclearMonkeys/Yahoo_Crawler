Make up does however clog pores, so do make sure you do take it all off before bed. It can make your skin continue to break out as your skin is not getting enough air to breath when you're covering it up - but then you can cover the blemishes with the make-up as you are doing. I would note that the best way to avoid wrinkles is to put on an spf moisturizer everyday under your make-up, try make it spf 20 or above. Make-up won't protect you from UV rays and even normal daylight it UV rays on your skin, so by simply using an SPF moisturizer everyday you'll greatly reduce your risk of wrinkles.", 9617, "None", 0],

And my skin would look jacked up to you by comparison when I take my makeup off because makeup is designed to make you look better and hide imperfections.  That's why skin care is important, people (guys and gals)!!  Also, when we do makeup, it should not be too much packed on.  Using less is better than more because it looks more natural.  Makeup should enhance your beauty, not hide your face. Back to the subject, if a woman uses makeup that is good for the skin (i.e. makeup with sunscreen, and anti-aging ingredients) then it would even be more beneficial to the skin.", 9617, "nEztPB2xaa", 2],

My teachers still really liked me, I wouldn't have graduated otherwise, I was doing so poorly. But then college and your completely on a blank page. Go to community college and then transfer to a University after you get your AA and have a plan of what you want to do. It's cheaper than doing an undergrad at a University, and it's really low key. There are a lot of Adults going back to school so it's not a distracting atmosphere. You're not stuck and you're not useless. You're just sitting down is all. So get up, and find an adult that you can be accountable to. Someone who will listen to you and keep you from falling back into that same rut of not going.

I'm a converted Mormon. I went to Assembly of God and saw the spirit at work but still didn't feel whole, I went to the Lutheran church for years and just felt preached at although the truth was in the sermon. I tried several denominations before investigating. The only people who knocked on my door were Jehovah witnesses and they were difficult to get rid of nicely. One old woman cursed me when I said no thank you. Maybe she was having a bad day or Christian experience? I think alot of people are upset because if they opened the door and then actually opened their minds long enough to listen they would have to face the ugliness they show the world.

Another priesthood elder is necessary when they visit single women in their homes. Many of those scheduled appointments have conveniently forgotten and are busy doing something else, or they are not at home. When leaving the doors of hostile and aggressive homeowners, even under intimidation, I have never witnessed the missionaries shake the dust from their shoes. Furthermore, in all my travels with them, I've never witnessed rudeness or vicious replies on the part of the missionaries. To the contrary, we simply leave without another word. For those saying they don't want to be bothered and are quick to condemn the visiting missionaries as they try to spread the Gospel I have this to say: You will one day have to answer to the Lord at the judgment bar regarding all the threats, intimidations, and hostile reactions displayed against those young men and women. Every idle word and every damning thought you entertained in mortality will be addressed. The foul accusations spread against the missionaries by hostile contacts are representative of their own attitudes. Shift workers sleeping during the day can remedy much of this hostility by posting a small sign on their door that says, “Shift Worker–Do Not Disturb.”", 9614, "ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa", 3],

I suffered from panic attacks from years - the first few times I had them I didn't know what they were and I went in for all sorts of tests and MRI's before I began explaining to my mother more in detail what I was feeling and she said it's panic attacks (it's hereditary - my mother and brother suffer from it).  My worst ever happened when I was driving over a bridge and I feared bridges for years.  I suffered from about 24-27 - I'm 28 now and virtually panic free but it took alot of work to get here. Alot of what you are doing is inducing panic attacks with association.  You say going to the grocery store gives you a panic attack meaning you are expecting to have one and the fear of having one will actually induce one.  Believe it or not, panic attacks can be controlled to an extent.  I read this book that really helped me get on the road to recovery but I'll be honest... it was not easy.  I would get panic attacks at work and my boss would send me home because I was an absolute mess (thank God he was so understanding... his mother is a sufferer as well).  Below is a link to a book I read when trying to get over this and honestly it really made sense and and helped and you can get through this.  I know it seems hopeless now but I promise you that you will not suffer the rest of your life.   Before you can completely self heal which is not easy, would you consider medication??  I aIso suffered some severe clinical borderline suicidal depression and was prescribed Wellbutrin which changed my life and made me look back and think.... how could I have ever felt that way?  My doctor also prescribed Xanax to take when I had an attack and within 5-10 minute it alleviates all of the symptoms and you are relaxed (may cause some drowsiness but I'd rather be a little sleepy than alot jumpy).  While taking these medications and reading this book I was able to take control and reduce the amount of attacks I had.  I went from having several a day to now having a few a year and because I read all this information I was able to not make the attack worse by panicking because I'm having a panic attack.  I carry a Xanax with me wherever I go just incase but I have learned to make them subside without the medication.  I really wish you luck and will say a prayer for you to get better because I know what it's like to suffer but it feels even better once you are free.  If you have anymore question, please contact me at jzny@aol.com.  Also just check out the link on the book - it really did help.  ", 9611, "972d65029253d63a51ccb7f443f135c7aa", 2],

On the flip side of the coin when I see elderly women wear makeup, where the foundation falls into the cracks of their skin, I wish they would just 'go natural'. A little anecdote here:  When my mother was dating my father,  even up to the point of their engagement,  my father never saw her without the makeup.  On the eve of their wedding, she took off her makeup and stood before him.  'This is what I really look like'  She said she felt more naked than if she were standing completely nude in front of him.  He married her anyway, and who knows, maybe he preferred her 'au nature'l...  I never asked him.
