	81169 : ["This is just my opinion. I am currently a level 2 student in Krav Maga and I can tell you it really is a good workout, fun and informative if you have a certified teacher, plus any defense system or Martial Art is going to help you protect yourself in the line of duty. At my school there are two instructors, one of them is a Lieutenant in our biggest police department. He requires anyone under him to attend CKM classes once a week. Others on the same precinct are starting to attend and they really like the classes. I say either is fine; find out what is in your area. Boxing, Muay Thai, BJJ, Judo, anything would help with both areas. Best of luck.", 9048, "ydoIYwGTaa", -1],

Here's a link to a website that can offer some info. on Krav Maga and also has a \"Find a Training Center\" near-you-application for finding a place to workout in this method.   Personally, I think each has some good stuff they can offer, but ultimately, you have to find your own method that does what you need it to do.

I have to side a little with Lucifer in that you need to learn restraint techniques BUT that's your prerogative.  I feel JKD may be best suited for you.

	81193 : ["you could draw comparisons, but each bit in computer works by either sending a voltage down a conductor or not. It is either on or off. Each bit sends its pulses to a register where the queue up for the processor. A 64 bit processor can process 64 bit every two or 4 clock cycles (depending on how the register works). So a 1 GHz computer can process 64 bits half a million times a second. Each neuron in the brain has many conductors coming out of it. So it can send pulses down one, two, three or many conductors to other neurons, which in turn do the same. Pretend one neuron has 8 pathways coming out, that gives 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 switching combinations for one cell, Thats about 40 000 combinations from one cell. Some neurons have more than this some have less. Either way it is a big difference to on or off. Factor all this by the number of nuerons in a brain and you have one complex system. Eg 2 cells gives 40000 x 40000 combinations. 3 cells give 40000x40000x40000 combinations 40 000 to the power of a few million give a massive number of switching combinations. The other difference is that the neurons wire themselves up based on your experiences.  One similiarity is levels of memory. Fine motor control is kept in permanent up front memory. people names are kept somewhere to be triggered by facial recognition and take a while to drag out of memory. A computer keeps the commonly used stuff in L1 and L2 cache, then main memory, then hard drive.", 9057, "AA11268873", 0],
	81194 : ["OK first of all I want to make one thing clear. Computers store information in the form of 0's and 1's but we humans save information in the form of electrical pulses inside the brain. A computer is always fragmented unless you defragment it but our brains are already defragmented because we store information as we grow up and every part of the brain has a function and a storage. So obviously it's already defragmented.", 9057, "None", 0],
	81195 : ["The human brain stores information chemically by making new pathways in a very complex system of nerve cells, as far as is known. 'Defragmentation' is only necessary if data is stored in a physical location and can be erased. I don't think the brain works like that at all - maybe one could say that it is constantly indexing and re-ordering information and that nothing is lost: it simply becomes less readily accessible (unless part of the brain dies). Even in the case of a catastrophe such as a stroke, the brain seems to be able to repair itself to a certain extent and memory and abilities can return, so I guess there is a redundancy in the way things are stored. It's certainly a quite amazing organ!", 9057, "AA11332224", 0],
	81196 : ["yes i think you r right because computers process and store like we do and i hope one day we will built a computer brain better than the hueman. i think our defragment is sleep. thats when we re arrange and save the data for long term use. computers get viruses and we get mental disorders due do confusing informations and problem in hardware. the machine is a slave we r not which makes us more natural thats all. and the machines have to go a long way to beat us in all.", 9057, "AA10777060", 0],
