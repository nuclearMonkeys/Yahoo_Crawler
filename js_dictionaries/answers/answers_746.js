And as someone else pointed out, if 911 was called that dog would've been confiscated. The pit bull debate makes me sad because they get a bad reputation as a result of bad owners and breeders.  My niece just held her pit as he died after it got hit by a car a couple days ago.  He was one of the sweetest, dumbest dogs I've known, wonderful with little kids and all he wanted to do was play.  He was hit by a woman who was lost and speeding through the industrial complex where my niece worked while she was putting him in the car. Trolls like you only perpetuate the pit bull stigma.  I will agree there are lots of bad ones out there but most of the dog bites I've dealt with personally were small dogs like poodles and Chihuahuas.", 6054, "bxtMNxSOaa", 1],

If you have claimed you are the main driver for cheaper insurance they will likely refuse to pay out as you lied to them about the age of the regular driver.  If he drives drunk, speeds or drives stupidly and crashes they definitely will not pay out and all your money will be lost and you will be responsible to pay out the loan on a vehicle that is no longer driveable.   If I was you and was going to buy him a car I would try and find a cheaper car that still has some miles on it and some reliability and just get insurance to cover the cars he may run into.  Don't let him dictate that he needs a large powerful car so he can show off as all he needs for now is some transport.  If you are paying for it then you should have some control and if his grades at school are bad or he is driving stupidly etc. I would make it clear you have the right to take the keys as punishment or even the right to sell the car if he becomes totally irresponsible.   There are good cars out there with some reliable life left in them if you look around.  Have the car checked over by a mechanic before buying it.  I would try and keep the amount I borrowed low as possible as there is a good chance a 16y/o will wreck it within a couple years through inexperience or stupidity.  You may think your son is trustworthy and sensible but the fact is most teenage boys tend to behave stupidly when with friends and do drag races,  burnouts, and speed from time to time showing off.   One of the main things is do not set yourself up with massive amounts of debt buying a car for a teenager, and do not allow them to go out and kill themselves as I have seen parents buy powerful cars for their teenage son to have him go out and show off to his friends and kill themselves with their stupidity.
