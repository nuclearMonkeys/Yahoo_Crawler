First time, I was in Germany and some old dr. shot my earlobes with what I think was some kind of relaxant or anesthetic. At any rate, it took a few hours before I was able to turn my head in either direction. Years later, it happened again. (Both times when I was getting out of bed.) My Dad came over to visit and he went out to his truck and came back with a can of WD-40 spray lubricant. (You know, the kind you can get at a hardware store.) He massaged that stuff into my neck and BAM!, twenty minutes later, I was right as rain.

	107865 : ["Cancers are very attracted to socially dominant women. If you are around your cancer boy in a group of people, take charge and be the obvious leader and force of the crowd and he will definitely notice you. We cannot resist ego stroking. Make sure you focus on how great he is in sneaky ways that aren't too blunt. Cancers are very sensitive people, and another similar method would be to stick up for him in some way, even if it is just minor like backing up his opinion when no one else will. If he thinks you two think alike he will fall for your trap all the easier. It's important to understand this balance, if you really want a Cancer you are going to have to be the type he can worship. We live a life of service, and can become very obsessive and incredibly clingy. Don't lay the flirting on too hard or too soft and be creative with it. Let him know you want him but don't let him think he can have you whenever he wants. That is most important, do NOT let him think you are below him in the who needs who more arena. Once you have him, expect to be treated like a queen by him, and don't feel bad about it, he will love serving you. One thing to really watch out for is passive agressive behavior. We can't stand it, and you have to be pretty much an open book if you're going to be with a cancer. Personally, I can't stand most Virgoes, and couldn't imagine dating one. The only thing worse than a Virgo as a lover would be a Scorpio. But both make good friends. If you want your Cancer boy, first study your own Zodialogical negative habits and try to curve them as much as you can around him, cause virgoes are really bitchy and can grate on our nerves with ease. You have this habit of being very critical of everyone and can really hurt a Cancer's feelings, which are wounded by the slightest things (and often things that are only perceived). Be incredibly cautious in all manner of language, verbal and body, and try to curb the negativity you people thrive on.

I just want to comment on the fact that most of the answers on this question talk about people developing mental illnesses such as paranoia or schizophrenia as a result of smoking cannabis. I just want to know where they found this \"research,\" it sounds like something straight from Harry Anslinger's propagation binder. However I have read studies into cannabis helping with things such as cancer, easing the pain and nausea associated with not just the cancer but with chemotherapy. There have also been studies in which THC has not just stopped the growth, but reduced the size of tumors in the lung by almost 50%. It also helps with multiple sclerosis, a terrible neurodegenitive disorder in which the nervous system starts to deteriorate causing more pain that you can imagine. It has more uses than ANY man made pill you can buy at the store. AND it is safer, non-toxic, you cannot overdose, it is cheaper, and if it was legal, you could grow it in your backyard. Thus reducing the production of pharmaceuticals, causing many rich peole to be not so rich. The idea of it causing mental illnesses is ridiculous, maybe if you never smoked and than smoked alot of high grade in a large dose, and even then you would only be paranoid of getting caught.
