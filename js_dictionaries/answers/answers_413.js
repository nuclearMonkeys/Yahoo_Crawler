	22642 : ["The point I'd make is that we have dealt with viral outbreaks numerous times - Zika in South America, measles across the world, various tropical viruses, Ebola in Africa and so on. We know pretty much exactly how to deal with these - introduce a lockdown to stop the spread, and quickly isolate the cases that do appear with contact tracing and mobile teams of public health doctors and nurses who work to suppress local clusters. Countries that did that quickly, like New Zealand, managed to get Covid under control. Countries that were slow to respond didn't. Compare, for example, the shape of the cases graphs on google for New Zealand and the US. Of course, these are very different nations but these graph shapes show the difference between doing what we've known for decades works, and not doing that. So to answer your question ... if nations had done things properly we would have had short term pain for longer term gains and kept the economy ticking over. But because nations botched it, most are now constantly teetering between controlling the spread or not. This has dragged on the closures, kept people in on again off again lockdowns, opened and closed and opened and closed business which can't plan or prepare for these cycles, and created more economic pain than just doing it properly in the first place.", 3659, "BZbvSrwUaa", 1],

I brush snow off of them, and trim the trees south of the array every few years. Other than that they don't need anything. If you suspect you have a bad panel, and you want to check the Voc (volts open circuit) or IMAX (max forward current) on individual panels, simply turn off the array either at the charge controller or array combiner box, and open the junction box on the back of each panel, one at a time. Then with the proper meter you can check each panel to see if your voltages and current are close to the ratings on the panel data plate. If you're not sure what meter you need, call tech support for the manufacturers and ask them for advice on testing your particular panels. You can keep the array all wired together, no need to disconnect individual panels, with the array shut off and one junction box open the maximum voltage you'll be subjected to is the one panel you're measuring, usually less than 38 volts. If you find a bad one, there's generally nothing you can do to repair it, short of checking the connections or replacing the entire panel, there isn't any other work to be done in the field. If your working on the array mounts or other external hardware, don't worry about the wiring, it's no more dangerous than a 100 foot extension cord in the yard.
