You can't put a camera inside a space that someone else has rented to be private and in their sole possession (tenants on one lease sharing a home together).   But putting a camera in a common space that different tenants have access to but no expectation of privacy in...yes.", 2842, "None", 3],

	16550 : ["Landlords gets wages garnished because tenants refuse to do the responsible thing and pay the debt they legally owe. Since a landlord cannot garnish wages on their own, this means a judge also agreed with the landlord that the tenant defaulted on their legal contract and refuses to pay, so garnishment is the way for the landlord to recover their losses. The financial struggles of the tenant are not the landlords problem or issue, and the tenant is responsible for doing whatever they need to in order to resolve that.  If you didn't pay your credit card bill because you were struggling financially, would you expect your credit card company to just forgive your debt? Nope, you understand that they would turn you over to collections, sue you, do major damage to your credit, no potentially garnish your wages to recover what they owe. If you owed money to the IRS, would you expect them to forgive that debt just because you are struggling? No, you understand that you can face all kinds of consequences to owing money to the government. Why would your landlord be any different?", 2846, "KESlvKqQaa", 4],

	16552 : ["Landlords want retribution but it has been my experience that they rarely get it. If someone has a low credit score already they are unlikely to care much about eviction or a court order for garnishment. I came from such a household. The landlady wanted to garnish my mother for unpaid rent and a light bill (electricity was never taken out of landlady's name) but my mother moved out suddenly and lost her job within months so what was there to garnish? She got other jobs later on in another state but never had any more garnishments brought up. I predict that in the aftermath of Covid-19 many more landlords will discover how easy it is to be stiffed and never get paid but after 15 months of moratoriums they will be dealt a much heavier blow. There's always a way to get out of one's obligations but most landlords don't accept the riskiness of their chosen trade. ", 2846, "efbRj9Yvaa", 0],

In which case you would have been aware and signed documents relating to the purchase. Or, has she bought the house, put in in your name without your permission, in attempt to off load cash, possibly to avoid tax or qualify for benefits? Which is fraud.

If your mother is playing games with you, you can also call your tax collector's office and find out whose name the house is in. Also, tell her straight out that you do not intend to live with her so to please stop the guilt trip she's doing on you by always telling you she 'wishes her children would live with her.'  I have 3 adult children myself and, although any or all of them are always welcome to come live with me if they want to, I don't keep telling them I wish they'd live with me or expect them to do so.   They have their own lives to live.", 2838, "xtpti4pxaa", -2],

You have some narrow boards capping the walls part-way around.  If you did the same at the foot of the walls (all the way around), the sand would find it more difficult to spill the full width of the bottom board.  The weight of the sand on the footboards would help to anchor the structure, and any sand which crept under the inner edge would get trapped there and form a sort of seal which prevented further migration.   If you felt it necessary, you could pipe a bathroom sealant around the inner edges of the footboards to form a positive seal (leave some gaps for water drainage).  It would peel away easily if you had occasion to move the pit at a later date.", 2853, "EbxMItf8aa", 0],

They may also ask your landlord if you're allowed to have pets. When I adopted a cat many years ago, the shelter had to call my landlord to confirm that pets were allowed. I guess they were sick of animals being returned to the shelter or abandoned because of people who think they can hide a pet. They aren't interested in your furniture.
