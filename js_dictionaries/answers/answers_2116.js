	111621 : ["Let's break this down into steps: a) you have ADSL. So the first thing you need to know is what form of signalling is going in with your dsl provider.  For example, some dsl providers use authentication (yours probably does) which is information they need to furnish to you. In particular, they may be using something like pppoe (ppp over ethernet) and using CHAP ((Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol). So the first step in setting up your router (after connecting it to the DSL line) is to connect to the router from the PC.  You say you have done all this, but in my experience people who are novices don't have all the details, and this stuff is often not plug and play, which is why the dsl provider sends a tech or a kit out to configure it all.  If your dsl provider is using CHAP, then this needs to be configure IN YOUR ROUTER, as the router is the device that is actually going to connect and authenticate with your dsl provider, and will be the device that actually has the IP address.  Your computer will recieve a private NAT address from the router and will route packets to the internet on your behalf for any of the computers you might connect to it via ethernet or your wifi. b) You have a router Once you have everything setup, there are ways in the router admin to make sure that you are actually connecting to the dsl provider and routing packets.  Tools like ping and traceroute are built into the router, as well as a diagnostic page that shows you that you have connected, and that you actually have an IP address, DNS servers and default gateway.  If this isn't working, your computer will never be able to access the internet. c) your computer Your router should (and probably is) providing DHCP services, which basically assigns the 3 things your computer needs:   -an IP address and subnet -A default gateway -DNS server(s) Most routers assign something in the 192.168.0 network, and the router/default gateway will show on your computer as 192.168.0.1.   What's also important to verify is that you have DNS servers assigned.  Again if the router isn't configured with these (you get them from your ISP) then it will not pass these to your computer and nothing will work, because the names you type in (www.yahoo.com) will never get translated to IP addresses that the computer actually uses to access them.   You can do things again like ping in a cmd window. Hopefully this will help you checklist that you have everything you need.  I personally would be able to fix your problem in about 5 minutes by going through these items, but I understand the concepts involved.  Ultimately, all i hope to do for you is outline the basic things involved (routing, IP, DNS, NAT, etc.) all of which may require some research on your part if you want to DIY.   With that said, having a NAT router is definately the way to go these days, as it provides most of the security you'll need to protect you from virus infection, so long as you don't do stupid things while browsing.
