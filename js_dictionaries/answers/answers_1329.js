Beyond that, the coupon program was a big motivator toward getting the transition completed on time (everyone likes to save big money with coupons).  Even so, Congress delayed the cutover 4 months to allow more people to get the coupons, hook up their converters, and get used to the new digital channels before the analog channels were turned off.

First of all, the worst case scenario is that coastal communities will have to relocate inland to higher ground.  It is highly doubtful that any of this would take place in our children's lifetimes or or children's grandchildren's grandchildren's lifetime for that matter.  There is plenty of time to worry about that later if indeed it ever becomes a problem which is highly doubtful in my opinion.  Glaciers in Antarctica and the Artic and the Ice Cap over the North Pole are generated by having more accumulation of freezing ocean and snow fall over time than what ends up thawing.  For it to completely melt would indicate either that it was very dry (and presumably warmer) or simply much warmer.  If it were warm enough that far north, that would indicate much more inhabitable land much further north.  We might lose land on the coast but would gain it toward the north.  Places like Greenland and North Dakota would once again be habitable.  It is true that Florida would be pretty much inundated along with much of the coast.  It is certainly possible that \"global warming\" will result in greater precipitation and more glacial accumulation.  Climate, glaciers, sea level and ecosystems are change over time.  All change is not bad.  Most of the claims of glaciers melting are overblown and exaggerated.  Glaciers melt, it is part of the process.

	72075 : [">and i was wondering if that was true even with a basic TV. ANd by basic i mean one of those RCA tvs that have a built in TV Guide. Yes. >our local channels. Do you know if they use both analog and digital. Also do you know if they will keep the same channels or will they be having to change channels to be able to work in digital. Most stations are now transmitting both analog and digital signals. If you enter your location at the first link below, you can find out where they are located.  When a station adds a digital signal, they use the same channel number with an added sub channel #, for example, analog channel 7 becomes digital channels 7.1 and 7.2  Yahoo's TV section can give you local TV listings for both analog and digital broadcasts. Unlike analog channels, digital channels do not correspond to the actual radio frequencies that the broadcasts are on. The \"real\" column in the tvfool page is the actual frequency, which you need to know if you are buying a new antenna.  In a few weeks the government will start sending out $40 off coupons for a households first two converters. Using the coupon the two converters run about $10 each.  >Do SDTV/HDTV have built in Digital antennas/recievers. In otherwords will i have to buy a digital antennae if they exist in order to receieve digital signals through my SDTV. SDTVs & HDTVs have digital tuners built into them; you just connect them to your antenna. \"HD ready\" TVs do not have digital tuners. Analog and digital broadcasts in the US use the same antennas. If you get good analog reception now, you probably don't need a new antenna.  If you need a better antenna, post another question with your zip code and distance from your local stations. TV antenna marketing is mostly BS. See last link for details.  >on Analog antennaes you have to adjust the knobs and the antenna ears to be able to get a better signal. Will i have to do that with the converter box like i have to do with analog  Probably, spend ~$10 on a converter and find out. Then decide if you want to ask a question about better antennas. Added questions ------------------------------------------------------ >once the TVs go digital,  It's not the TVs that are going digital, it's the over the air broadcasts that are changing to digital. >want i have to buy an HDTV antenna for our SDTV. The idea of a \"HDTV antenna\" is just marketing hype. Analog and digital TV broadcasts use the same antennas. See the last link. If your TV already has a ATSC digital tuner, all you have to do is attach an antenna and have the DTV scan for digital channels. If your TV dosn't have a ATSC tuner, you need a converter box between your antenna and your analog TV. If you can't tell if your TV has one, let me know what the model number is. >Does HDTV antenna mean that it receive digital signals. All TV antennas can receive digital broadcasts. It's not the antennas that are different, it's the tuners in the TVs/converter boxes that are different.  >also on the converter boxes, are the just a digital antenna and converter in one. In other words, it receives digital signals and converts it so that i can watch channels on an analog TV. In the future, some companies may market \"smart antennas\" with converter boxes. Smart antennas are like self adjusting rabbit ear antennas. The \"smart\" part remembers what setting are best for a particular channel. Some converters have a connector that can connect to a \"smart antenna\", but smart antennas themselves are rare. I don't know of any stores that carry them (yet). More added stuff ----------------------------- > i just found out what an HDTV antenna is.  An \"HDTV antenna\" is a plain antenna with the letters \"HDTV\" added. >But if my SDTV wasn't built with a built-in digital tuner. will i have to buy a special digital receiving antenna or will i have to by a converter box for that as well. Most TVs that were marketed as SDTVs have digital tuners. \"Special digital receiving antenna\"s don't exist except as marketing hype.  >by the way, i think it s####s that we only get 2 coupons for convertor boxes, because we have 3 analog TV and 1 SDTV.  Unless you have relatives or friends that don't need their coupons. Otherwise one company  has anounced a price of $39.99. ", 8666, "AFzb8sXCaa", -1],
	72076 : ["Go here, enter your zip and it will tell you what digital channels should be in range Regarding the antenna - there is really no difference between an \"analog\" antenna and a \"digital\" antenna.  The antenna part just gathers a radiowave signal.  It knows nothing about the signal encoding which is what makes it digital or analog.   You will not need a special antenna for digital broadcasts.
