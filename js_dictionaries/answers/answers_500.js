Of course there are exceptions, which is why you need to make decisions that are best for you and if all you are worried about is how much money you make then now may not be the right time for college for you (if ever) and that's ok, because only ~1/3 of working Americans have a 4-year degree. I'm not sure what else everyone wants when they ask this question. They always point out someone they know who doesn't make a lot of money right out of college. I would also suggest you look at people that have high paying jobs that are in their 40s and you will find a large majority have college degrees. Here's another thing to think about. I had a guy in an engineering class that was successful with his own company (he was right around 40), but he wanted more knowledge to grow his business and he decided college was the place. If you spend your life trying to justify things based on anecdotal information it will make decision making very difficult.", 4333, "f3d506f1430fab32d23ae661f4553e41aa", 0],
