	122916 : ["Obama does.  When Obama talked about change, McCain laughed about the very idea that anything could change. He thought it was all just an unrealistic dream. McCain doesn't think anything should change, anyway, even if it could. Now he has evidently decided that it is the word that Obama is using, that is making him popular, and that if he says the same magic word, he will be as popular as Obama, as if Obama were saying abracadabra and making everyone support him. McCain has now said the word, change, a number of times, and nothing magical has happened. He hasn't become popular, still doesn't draw large crowds, and certainly hasn't turned into a prince. Even though he flip flops on issues, trying to find a magic word that works, maybe reform, mostly he just attacks Obama and tries to make him less popular, so the difference between them won't be so obvious. He even says that this election is about personalities, not issues. I believe that McCain is disconnected from our lives and hasn't got a clue what Obama is talking about.  Here is what McCain said in his memoirs:   \"I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president. . . . In truth, I'd had the ambition for a long time.\" McCain has been a senator for years and has voted with Bush 90% of the time.  That is not change.  Obama wants to make taxes fair, provide health care for everyone, invest in science again and find renewable alternative energy to end our dependence on oil and reduce global warming, responsibly end the war in Iraq and give the troops in Afghanistan the resources they need, provide our troops with what they need while in the service and when they return home, encourage hiring at home instead of outsourcing jobs, reduce the national debt and begin to export  instead of importing, and more.", 10732, "o3sYIdOzaa", 2],

	122925 : ["Yahoo! Answers is definitely a great place to spend your time on. When I first started answering question (which was about 1 year and 4 months ago), I never thought that this would become so addicting, so much that I log in to Y!A daily. I see Y!A as a site where I can ask for opinions or help with anything. I agree that this (Y!A) is a unique knowledge-sharing forum. Most of my contacts are very experienced in their respective fields, which is why I chose to connect to them (geniuses). I agree with Dr D that one of the plus points about Y!A is the wonderful network that we build here. My contacts, I believe, do not care about points and there is no way they would ever leave Y!A if the point system was scrapped. All that matters is that as long as they can keep their brains active, and at the same time, help others with any problems, eg, Mathematical problems, they would be contented. Of course there are those who are points-crazy. I have come across one TC who would always leave insulting comments if his answers were not chosen as the best. There are also a few who create multiple accounts so as to gain high percentage of BA. I have witnessed one TC who would ask questions from his other accounts so that he could be the first answerer to the question (using his main account). How did I notice this? Of course, isn't it impossible to type out lengthy solutions in such a short time (of approximately 2 minutes) after the question was posted? Sadly, I reported this to YAT, however no action was taken. Another unique reward is the joy that you get when you answer questions posted by someone else. Of course, being a student, I do not claim that I am a genius and that my answers are all correct or helpful, but I always try my best to help others with the problems or questions they have and share with everyone what I know when it comes to answering questions (mostly Math). I apologize if sometimes there were errors in my answers. Well, we human err. If we can eliminate the problems we face with contributors who create multiple accounts to self-vote for their answers, or trolls who simply give thumbs down and report good answers and questions, then, rest assured, Y!A would even be more entertaining.", 10733, "YKNtKG1gaa", 2],
