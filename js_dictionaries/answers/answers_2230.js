I would normally say before the first heat, but since you bothered to ask... your probably more responsible than most of the idiots on here.  I prefer to wait on my dogs, because I feel that hormones during at least one heat cycle actually benefit the dog, I spayed my girl after her first heat cycle, but I think on smaller dogs it's better to wait until just before her 2nd.  Of course, if you can't keep her confined and out of trouble, or you have intact males around her, spay her before her first heat cycle....    It generally costs between $150-$300 for a large dog, not sure how much it costs for smaller dogs, but I would guess it's less.  Shop around. Also there are lots of spay/neuter clinics that will do it cheaper if you have one near you.  I'm not a big fan of early spay/neuter, unless it is a shelter puppy (even then I would wait until 4months), or a byb puppy.  With males I wait until a year.  I think this reduces a lot of health problems and doesn't put them at quite as much risk for others.... As long as the owner is responsible and willing to be careful and confine the dog.  I don't mind if people wait.  It sucks that so many people aren't responsible enough to be able to wait, but if you can, I would... I want to commend you for thinking ahead BEFORE you even have the puppy, and kudos to you for being responsible and wanting to spay/neuter. Spay/neuter police shoot me.", 10492, "ev9CTcm3aa", -1],

State or Local Governments are restricted only by State Constitutions and there are 50 different State Constitutions.  The question is about the Federal Government.  The Federal Government is controlled by the United States Constitution.  The Constitution is very specific and clear as to what are the duties and obligations of the Federal Government are and, more importantly, what they are not.  You see, the Constitution was written specifically to limit the role of the Federal Government.   No where does it allow the Federal Government to control Schools, Health Care, Industry, Financial Institutions, Energy production, environmental policy, pension funds, the Insurance Industry etc. etc. etc. The Conservative Republican ideal is to follow the Constitution.  If the Constitution does not meet our current needs, you do not simply ignore it, you go through the process to Amend it.  When the Constitution was written, there were only 10 amendments.  Now there are 27.  It can be changed only that way. So this nonsense about privatizing roads, schools or police is what is commonly referred to as a \"Straw Man Argument\".  It is without substance.  Those things are within the duties and obligations of State and Local Governments.

'The' Ukraine is a Russian Empire/Soviet Union leftover which was used to indicate an area or region within. It's use similar to 'The Midwest' or 'The West Coast', etc, in the US.
