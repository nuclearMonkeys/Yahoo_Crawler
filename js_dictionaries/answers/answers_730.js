You may be able to find good information.  Best of luck.  ", 5957, "IPACjrR9aa", 0],

Latest is worldwide disinformation about the Sputnik V COVID vaccine to REDUCE RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE.  Then you look at how a coup in Ukraine by fascists, became a non-coup because USA does not deal with coup'ed countries... another attempt on Russia's border to REDUCE RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE.  Then you be sure the Nordstream pipeline stays on course. The West would love to end it to REDUCE RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE.  After that, work to bring Russia's food security initiative to fruition. It is to produce domestically all essential good. We grow tomatoes and cucumbers in hothouse year round. In the middle of ice covered fields... gigantic greenhouses.  But we need 85 to 100% or higher grain, meat, and vegetable production. We are there on many commodities, milk, eggs, cheese, etc (may not be exact on these EXAMPLES), but I believe we are lacking on BEEF production. We do have great fields of alfalfa for hay.

The same with Ray Croc, who created McDonald's- cheap, fast hamburgers that satisfied a hunger, no table service or elegant surroundings. Another example would be Ikea- cheap furniture with no service- you put it together yourself unless you pay extra. Vast warehouse stores where you lug the big boxes yourself. Although I have to say that I have Ikea furniture and the quality is a lot better than McDonalds. ", 5964, "cbMTODDZaa", 0],
