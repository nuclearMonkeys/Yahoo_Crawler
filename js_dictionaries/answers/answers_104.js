I was speeding at nearly 100 mph. If you crash into a semi truck over 30 mph, you are dead. Every driver NEEDS to keep their eyes on the road.", 872, "euO1RSFVaa", 1],
	5203 : ["My cars don't have touch screens and I like them fine. I rented a car with a touch screen  once and it was so distracting while driving, I couldn't operate it- the damned seat heater was on and it was a hot day. I parked and corrected it. I don't know if they malfunction, but they do work through the car's computer (OEM touch screens), so there's another layer of control to work with. They can be as durable as the rest of the car, depending on who engineered it. I would not swap out the stereo i have for a touch screen. I go home when I want to watch a damned screen.", 872, "EMC7JwVBaa", -3],

	5205 : ["Your question doesn't make sense because Wife of Bath is one of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer includes 24 stories, of which The Wife of Bath's Tale is one. So there's no comparing since one is the other. That'd be like asking, \"How are the Hebrews in Exodus and in The Holy Bible similar?\"", 858, "None", 5],
	5206 : ["I envy you over 50s in the UK. It's for over 75s in Canada, unless you can find a pharmacy that jabs over 60s. Do you know how many workers over 50 there are?  I have heard more stories about deaths from the disease and very few about deaths from the vaccine.", 859, "AA11768465", 3],

	5208 : ["If you are so offended, request that you are not given a £50 note.  Canada has a black woman on our $10 bill, and I am sure that racists and misogynists carry those $10s in their wallets.  Actually Mr  Turing is being honored for his work in developing the computer, not for his sexuality (although there may be a posthumous apology from the government for making him take drugs.)  Considering that his work eventually led to what I am typing upon, I think the honour is justified. May I suggest Mary Jane Seacole for the next bill change, if Jamaica hasn't yet honored her? ", 860, "AA11768465", 9],

Bet a nice used BMW or AUDI or even a FORD FUSION or FOCUS! They are WORLD CLASSS cars! If a YARIS gets HIT by a truck or an SUV< you can consult a MORGUE! IF you like SMALLER cars get a SAFER VW GTI or a GREAT used AUDI TT coupe or convertible! AND SAVE your LIFE! USING CARS.COM see the GREAT used BENZ CLK 240 models from about 2000 or so!

EDIT: Most  larger UPS' use 48 volts, total, in the battery complement. Usually means, Four 12-volt gel-cells. You'd need  Four standard 12 bolt car batteries. (some pickups are 24-volt), and, unless  sealed, can be hazardous inside a dwelling, yes.

	5226 : ["Maybe. A battery has a general lifespan though, like 3 to 6 years, depending on its quality. And it gets weaker as the temperature gets colder. That's often when they fail. I just changed mine 2 weeks ago. Mid-January in cold winter temperature. It was 7 years old.", 874, "None", 1],
	5227 : ["I would have pulled the fuse before I left the car...because it was still running.(which is a drain on the battery)  I never would have left it chewing around...doing mysterious things.   Still, a 2 year old battery should be able to handle that all night...unless the battery has issues.(even new they can have issues)", 874, "None", 0],
	5228 : ["Charge the battery.  Start car and check charging system (alternator).  If charging system checks good, car has a battery parasitic drain.  Pull the CD player and disconnect electrical connection to CD player.  Leave car overnight and check if battery is dead.  Car battery is dead, CD player is not the problem.  Good luck.", 874, "None", 1],

	5235 : ["a] Not if the amp isn't stable at 1 ohm . b] Not if your car's alternator can't handle that much power . c] Two of those subs is overkill. Adding a second sub and the power to run it won't double the loudness. At best it would be 20 percent louder at full output.
