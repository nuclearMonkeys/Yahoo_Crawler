You rarely see pretty girls at the club after a certain age (depends on where you live when it is acceptable to settle down), but hot girls I'm using that term loosely, tend to not settle down as often. I think all too often and unfairly the phrases are used to describe a girls possible level of promiscuity, which in my experience is a very innaccurate indicator of the hopeful outcome of the posible encounter. When I compliment my wife I use usually tell her she looks beautiful, gorgeous, or pretty, but when I you know, I tell her she looks hot. My wife is a reformed \"hot girl\" which is the kind I like best. A woman can be both, but I generally think a pretty woman/girl will take the best of both worlds and become \"gorgeous\" as someone above stated. If you want to get someones attention for more than an evening I would suggest concentrating on being pretty. Not that it is a bad thing to be hot. Understand that if you wanna be labeled hot it is fine, but being labeled pretty will be a step towards getting a better job, better quality mate, the best paid cleaning product commercials etc.  Hot will generally just get you attention from men that only want one thing (which I admit most men this is all we think about when seeing a \"hot\" girl.)", 10443, "None", 17],

	115876 : ["Hello Flowers Congratulations on your new friend. To determine the sex of a parakeet is quit simple. The answer given by Lisac is correct,providing the bird you purchase is mature enough to show it's true color. What I am trying to tell you is the bird breeders are so anxious to get rid of their birds ,that they sell the young birds as soon as they are able of feeding them selves,the reason being the seed bill,it costs money to keep them,so the sooner they go ,the least the bird cost them to produce.It is all a matter of profit. All of the young parakeets will show the ceres (located just above their beak) a light bluish color.But in time as the bird sexually matures the blue color will change to tan or brown color,if this bird is a female. If you intend of breeding these birds,wait until they are mature enough,to do that,at least 9 months of age to a year. Give them a good variety of food stuffs,besides hard seed,they love broccoli stalks,and carrots also.It is a good idea to give them a cutlebone for added Calcium,which the female needs when egg laying. Hang a nest box,on the outside of it's cage,so you can look and see the development of the new born chicks,but try not to interfere too much with the inexperienced mother,because she might abandon the chicks and let them die. Best wishes to you and hope you become successful with your new project. Regards   The Canaryman", 10439, "AF592YHGaa", 1],
	115877 : ["I think the physical check they were talking about was surgical sexing- you would need to see an avian vetrenarian to physically check what sex a white cockateil. There is no way to tell for certain unless it is surgically or DNA sexed. DNA sexing is a little easier and less stress for your bird. You will need to find a company who can DNA test birds, they will send you a kit so you can take a DNA sample (usually a smear of blood or a feather) and you just send off the test and they give you the results within a couple of days. With the grey cockatiel you can sometimes tell by how bright the cheek spot is- it is usually pale in hens and darker in cocks- hope this helps.", 10439, "None", 0],
