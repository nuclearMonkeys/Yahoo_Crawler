His win over Wilder against AJ's loss to Ruiz has probably made him the better bet, both by the \"head to head\" and the well-rounded \"styles make fights\" criteria, especially after their respective performances against Klitschko (despite the fact that AJ has otherwise been a little more diligent about fighting top 10 contenders). AJ's confirmed-vulnerable chin makes him the division's big question mark, right now. He deserves his shot at Fury, but he hasn't really even demonstrated that he holds up to adversity better than Deontay Wilder (whose single loss is certainly less embarrassing). Wilder is out of the running, of course, unless he delivers on his promise to \"rise like a pheonix,\" and some of the rest in the picture could still demonstrate that they deserve to be seriously considered, but it would be the first time.", 5457, "xmP6udDwaa", 1],

There's also no point of a 3rd fight at this point in 2021 but if Golovkin wants a third Canelo fight he should earn it by fighting Charlo or Andrade and the winner can face Canelo.
