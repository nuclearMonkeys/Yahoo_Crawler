A pen and paper, a typewriter if you like, a computer, an audio recording that you transcribe, all work.  If you're comfortable with the means, then it works for you. Usually fiction has two primary elements--characters and action; together, they form a plot or story line.  A third component may be a moral or a point of view, e.g. the anti-war perspective in \"Slaughterhouse-Five.\" A series of 3  x 5 character cards helps, as does a plot outline.  The how-to book \"Save the Cat! Writes a Novel\" may be helpful. Writing fiction ought be liberating, as your inner, mostly subconscious, homeostatic monologue is bringing up energy that is resolved, perhaps by intuitive creativity...much as a dream narrative is generated by the same process of resolution. So, enjoy, keep a regular time of work, e.g. if necessary by going to bed an hour earlier, and rising an hour earlier, to write.  Keep your efforts as a means to raise your self-awareness--so-called \"bad work\" may be helpful for this. Share your finished product with some compassionate family and friends--your self-expression is of interest to those who care for you.  If they like it, or even if they don't,  send a copy to one and another publishers of those authors you like to read.  Also consider publishing online, where your copyrights are respected.", 2434, "380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa", 3],

Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion).
