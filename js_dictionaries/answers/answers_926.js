It's not a matter of what gender, that shouldn't even factor into the equation. I have 4 nieces and nephews (2 nieces, 2 nephews):  - My oldest niece (turning 8)- Is well behaved, low maitenance. She is considerate of others, she never really had any tantrums or did anything outrageous when she was a toddler either - My youngest niece: She's hell on wheels lol! She won't listen to anyone (shes 3), if you take your eyes off her, she's the type that will bolt for the door and make a run for it, also she will climb on anything she sees that can give her a height boost etc. - My oldest nephew: He's generally calm, he'll whine occasionally but nothing like tantrums or being disobident etc. He's generally book smart, and will listen to the rules set in place - My youngest nephew: He's hell on wheels lol, he's a lot like my youngest niece in terms of personality.", 7232, "NaSgrh7Haa", 0],

It can be really damaging when a transgender child comes out to not be taken seriously or have support. If you truly love your child it shouldn't matter how they identify. I understand it can take some getting used to but you need to accept the fact you have a beautiful daughter rather than a son now.

So to question who is the good guys and who is the bad guys isn't relevant it is something both sides did and now it's history. To try and judge peoples actions at this time both does a disservice to history and makes one sound like a whinny child who ate sour grapes. We can not use today's morays on the past.
