The Western countries divvied up the Middle East according to what they wanted the countries to be, installed leaders, etc.  The dictator Saddam Hussein replaced was put there by the West.  We stuck areas together that were tribal in nature and expected them to just except their citizenship and worse, their partnership, with former enemies.  We have kept them under out thumbs for years so we could get at their oil.   Then, we invaded Iraq, deposed the head of one of those countries, and expected them to stick together under a Shiite we installed.  We have also ignored what all the dictators have been doing, which is why the Arab Spring was so important.  And when it got to Syria, again we did nothing as he slaughtered more and more of his people.   ISIS arose out of this situation, Sunnis who had been oppressed in Iraq and Syria were gathered up by Al Qaeda and are now being supported by them, by oil sales, and by the lack of willingness of any of the Sunni countries to do anything about them because they are on their side.", 11184, "AFqZEOlRaa", 2],

For some reason people like to demonize the Crusades, but the bulk of the Crusades was simply a defensory reaction to the aggressive military of the Muslim nations, and to take back lands the today's extremist, then mainstream Muslims had taken. The primary difference is back then Muslims fought honorably, took land, and established it as their lands, as peaceful as they can be under Sharia law anyway.  They didn't just go around terrorizing and indiscriminately murdering for the sake of murder, so that they could pretend to Allah that they were fighting Holy War. Back then, they took the lands first, then they were forcing people to accept their faith or die.

Maybe they the 'culprits' have too much free time on their hands thats why they're coming up with all this crap instead of working towards a more better harmonious environment where all races could live together happily. But they rather argue about PETTY issues which i say the Non-muslim citizens and people from other nations are laughing about. After so many racial rifts and issues lately in the last couple of vears, the government obviously have not learnt their lessons or maybe they are just not too bothered as long as its not involving the muslims! Now if it was involving the muslims, the government would certainly call for a swift crackdown on all forms of violence against the muslims or the government and arrests would surely have been made by now and the culprits would have been caught by now and thrown into prisons without trial and charged with the Internal Securities Act with no chance of release in the new future. But then sadly thats not the case here because non-muslims were on the receiving end of things and again sadly nothing will be done in the name of justice because (certain)muslims are above the law.

The theory of a language be it English, Chinese, Malay or any other European language is only but man made and not god given. If a particular group uses a specific word often, it does not give them the right to call that word their own. Catholics have existed many centuries and used the word \"God\" so does that give them the right to forbid other religions to use the word \"God\"? Most definitely not. It is in equality and fairness that we should live and strive for and it is a general belief that all religions teach its followers to be a better person.  The Malaysian Government cannot sit back on this matter as if they (the Malaysian Government) reject the use of the word \"Allah\" by the Non-Muslim community; they are indirectly taking the side of the unreasonable thugs by supporting the racial thuggish behavior and showing that one can get their way if you display public violence.  I also do believe that if the Government supports the use of the word \"Allah\", this would displease the current \"devoted\" Muslims (who are strongly against Non-Muslims from using the sacred word) and the violence would continue or escalate further. The Malaysian Government should seek the root of the problem and work to resolve it. If the root of the problem is extremist and violence then it should pass harsher laws to punish the errant citizens and trouble makers. Look at Thailand for example: Disrespect to the picture of the King or monarchy is punishable by prison time. And how about drug trafficking in Singapore: punishable by death. Harsh laws act as more than a deterrence to offenders. Maybe the Malaysian Government should look to these examples for inspiration and reflection on their situation.

The intifadas included the bombing of buses, shooting on random cars on the roads of Israel, rock throwing from the al aqsa mosque down on the people praying at the western wall and a general route of death and violence.  If you are calling for a Third one, it is apparent that you want a similar action/result to the first and second ones - otherwise it wont be called the third intifada, but a mass protest.  Therefore I conclude that a third intifada will be a disaster for everyone. As a former soldier, I still do not understand how come it is so deeply embedded in Arabic culture that there will never be a protest which will not follow an aggressive pattern.

Initially i thought why the catholics and christians must use the word Allah(by the way there is a slight difference between the two)  in their Malay magazine or bibles, but it is indeed a simple one - the word Allah is arabic for the One God. This happens many centuries ago from time immemorial in Borneo, Sabah, Indonesia, etc, mainly malay speaking countries who has belief in other religion other than Islam. All their religious documents and scriptures use Allah to represent their God.  So to them it is not the same \"Allah\" used in the Koran. So I was prooved wrong in my mind to think the use of \"Allah\" only shold be for the muslims.
