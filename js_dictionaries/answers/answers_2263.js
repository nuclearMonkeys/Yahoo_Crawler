When Elliot ran to Olivia instead of the boy, he was mad at Olivia and himself because the boy was killed. At the end of the episode, the guy had a gun to Elliots head and Elliot kept telling Olivia to shoot him so she could kill the guy. She refused. WHile at the hospital, Elliot said he knew Olivia would pull the trigger and she told him she wouldn't and became mad at him that he thought she would actually kill him. Elliot said that if they were going to let their feelings get in the way of the job, they couldn't be partners. Sooo, Olivia asked for a knew partner. Olivia was then transferred to computer crimes.
