	122162 : ["Just depends on how the prom dress looks... if its really elaborate and over the top dont wear it.. You dont wanna out do the bride-to-be... But if its a simple prom dress with not a lot of detail it would be alright... or you could just go get a cute summer dress.. you can find some pretty cheap online.. If you order it soon it will be in on time... Good luck in finding an outfit. Hope I helped.", 10686, "AyWO3yClaa", 1],
	122163 : ["Well, typically you aren't supposed to wear a very bright red at a wedding because its distracting from the bride.  I'd say as long as the prom dress is a relaxed fit, not very revealing, isn't poofy (cinderella type dress), and is a neutral color, you should be fine. You can wear white to a wedding, silly. It just depends on the color of the bridesmaids. I wore a soft white prom dress to my sister-in-laws wedding, and she was absolutely fine with it. Her bridesmaids were wearing shades of yellow, though.  I'd ask your uncles wife-to-be if she approves, that way you can put your worries to rest right away.", 10686, "95dd4543a7692bee8e7b45167a768910aa", 3],
	122164 : ["Ohhh I hope you're not planning on buying it from that site.  You're not going to get that dress for the price they are asking. You just aren't. It's too elaborate to cost that little. They would literally be paying someone pennies to make it at that price. Any dress that shows up will be the wrong size and look nothing like the picture.  Like, if that's the dress you want, fine. I think it's a little bit over the top but that's just MY OWN personal tastes. It's not a dress that I PERSONALLY would pick.  But whatever you do, don't buy a dress like that from that site. That site is notorious for letting anyone sell anything even if they stole the pictures and can't possibly produce the same dress for the quoted price. EDIT: I know all of this because A) I know about making clothes, B) It's not difficult to look up the website's history of selling cheap knockoffs, and C) There are literally entire websites devoted to people showing the cheap knockoff crap they received from ordering from websites like this.", 10700, "None", 2],

	122171 : ["I really like your eyebrows. By making them a little darker it helps define your face. You are a really pretty girl and it doesnt look like you need any makeup. but if u want I think you should wear dark brown eye shadow to bring out your pretty blue eyes and black mascara. Some brown or black eyeline will also help bring out the shape in your eyes.", 10687, "5Ro8PVyaaa", 0],

	122173 : ["Some fears are Godly because they keep us away from danger. Like if you are on the side of high building and could easily fall, your fear is like wisdom telling you there is danger and you need to get out of that situation. Many spiders are poisonous.  Even pain isn't comfortable, but it sends signals to your brain telling it that something is wrong, and your body is in need of repair. Sometimes are biological responses can alert us to something going on inside of us. And while some fears are irrational, some are very rational.  -Follower of Yehoshua", 10688, "9JBAw8Fmaa", 0],
	122174 : ["Well....it seems to me that the idea in Islam is that you should FEAR Allah far more than anything else, including spiders.  You can \"fear\" spiders, but Islam would say that your FEAR of Allah should be incomparably greater: \"But as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them; boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads.   Whereby that which is in their bellies, and their skins too, will be melted.\" (Qur'an 22:19-21). Spiders just bite you.

My school recommended conservative attire, which for women is a skirt suit in black, gray, or navy blue-- no pants. They also said the shoes should not be really high-heeled (around 2in) and without excessive adornments like buckles or straps, and definitely closed-toe. I have curly hair and they said if I can't tone it down, I need to either flat-iron it or pull it back, which I ignored because I think that's ridiculous.
