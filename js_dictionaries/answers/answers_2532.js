The chewing made the skin raw, which irritated his paws further and I assume made them itch more.  Also, as anyone who has had a scrape knows, the healing process can be itchy too! Anyways, I know the vet can be expensive, especially when we rush there every time our pet does something \"weird\".   Here are some steps you could try before taking him to the vet:   Wash his feet, especially between his toes (yucky, I know) with soap and water.  Make sure your rinse off all the soap becuase any left over residue could irritate his skin further.   Try to use the gentlest soap you have on hand; if you have a baby, use the baby shampoo. Then, get regular benadryl or generic benadryl.   The only active ingredient should be \"Diphenhydramine hydrochloride\".  This is safe to give to dogs.   The dosage is 1 mg per pound of body weight.  So if you have a 25 pound dog you could give them a 25 mg pill of benadryl.  I buy the tablet form so I can break it in half easily for my smallest dog.  If this makes your dog sleepy you could try half a mg per pound of body weight. This stops the dog from feeling the itching sensation so he can stop eating his feet long enough for them to heal.  He will probably heal fairly quickly depending of course on how badly he has chewed his feet.  Maybe 2 or 3 days?     This is what my vet recommended.  And it worked perfectly! Of course if the problem persists, go and see your vet.", 11138, "ysfP4cs8aa", 0],

Halle Berry (black woman) always sleep with white men in her movies. 5. On the comedy show \"Like Family\" where the black family takes in a poor white woman and her son...the son and the black girl begin dating. 6. In Hancock, Will Smith is a black superhero opposite a white female co-star. 7. On Smallville, Pete (who has left the show) had a crush on Clarke Kent's best friend Chloe. 8. On the show \"Angel,\" Gunn (black guy) dated a white girl named Fred. 9. In the movie \"Jungle Fever,\" Wesley Snipes had sex with a white woman...hence the movie's title. 10. Will Smith (black guy) had a white female co-star (Heather Graham) in the movie \"I Robot.\" And it's not racist to show people surrounded by members of their own community.

	132458 : ["Big Boss,      You have just asked the supreme loaded question. It is much like the question \"which is better, cars or trucks\" Car owners will tell you cars and truck owners, well ...trucks. I am going to remain as unbiased as possible (been in the Marines 24 years, but have served with 6 Joint special operations commands). The first question is what type of person are you? The reason this is important is it will help match you up against either the Army or the Marines. I am going to give you a very brief synopsis of each and you match yourself to the one you like best. Most important is almost everyone I have talked to about the military wants to be \"A special operator\" whether recon, ranger, seal, or whatever the tag, I never hear anyone say they are looking forward to being a combat camera person, or bulk fuel specialist. However more people are in those jobs than special ops. Army First.  The army is an occupation force. There are almost a million people in the army. There are several types of special operations which you can read about on-line. They have more boats than the navy and if you want to fly as a warrant officer this is the only branch with pilots other than college grads. The army has the largest budget of all the branches and has the newest equipment. As has been said in another post, the pay is the same in all the branches based on rank (lookup military pay chart to get an idea) and the army is the quickest promoting of the two branches (depending on which job 'mos' you get into) so your chances for higher pay could be better. Marines The Marine Corps is a force in readiness. The smallest of all the armed services the Marine mission is to quell distubances and put a prepositioned force on the ground and hold terrain for up to 30 days. The mission of the Marines make the entire force a \"special operations unit.\" The Marines have the smallest budget (but according to congress offer the biggest bang for the buck of any service) and promotions (depending on your MOS) can be slow. If money is your thing definately join the Army, if leadership and responsibility is what you are after both services have it in large quantities, just the Marines will develop you as a small unit leader at an earlier stage. For an example I was an E4 in charge of the same size team that an Army E7 was managing. Well that is my short, almost unbiased opinion. Either branch you join will do wonders for you. Rotc will definately help as does any exposure to the changes you will experience when you join. The benefits are dependant on the first question I asked you. \"What type of person are you?\" Both branches have their success stories and their failures. You can be either. You will get out of the military the effort you put in to it. Maturity, education, travel, pay, leadership and job experience are some of the biggest benefits that people choose the military for. Me...I just wanted to get away from my KMart job at   24 years ago. Now I am a MGySgt with a Bachelors degree and a family. Who knows what it will do for you?
