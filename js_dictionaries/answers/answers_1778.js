You could then justify any situation in which you cheated by labeling it \"stupid\" or finding a reason that supposedly justified it. That vitiates the whole idea of cheating or honesty for that matter. In a very small number of cases it may be permissible to lie. The Gestapo knocks at the door of a family hiding a Jewish refugee and you deny anyone else is home. I'm not that even then it is justified, but I can see an argument. For what you say--no.
