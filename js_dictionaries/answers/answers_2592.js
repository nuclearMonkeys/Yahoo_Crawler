Sorry, but I looked at the pics - and didn't see anything creepy. I did notice that toward the bottom of the first page that some artwork is listed as \"Freemasonry\" but has nothing to do with it. The second page makes this point obviousl. Heck, if I colored a picture of a unicorn and titled it, \"Freemasonry.jpg\" it would come up as \"Freemason artwork\". Just a thought.  Try doing a little research so you know about the symbolism and much more of it will make sense... especially the coloration. Brian Raini", 11287, "fNtIUN32aa", 2],
