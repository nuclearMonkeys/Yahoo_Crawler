	134174 : ["Please pay close attention to the words used by Yeshua, here. He kept His Parable simple, so anybody - even me - could understand, but He gave the reason for the imbalance of things, AFTER Man was created. [Matthew 13:24] He set another parable before them, saying, \"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field, [Matthew 13:25] but while people slept, HIS ENEMY came and sowed DARNEL ALSO among the wheat, and went away. [Matthew 13:26] But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel appeared also. [Matthew 13:27] The servants of the householder came and said to him, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?' [Matthew 13:28] \"He said to them, 'AN ENEMY HAS DONE THIS.' \"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?' All life in the Garden was self sustained and in PERFECT harmony; there was no death in it for Man. Animals may have lived until a point they just died. Like a time clock; we do not know. Most probably there was no suffering in the Garden. Death was INTRODUCED by His enemy, when he sow DARNEL, a kind of weed, bad weed. Darnel - is my opinion - is what I understand as viruses, bacteria that kills Man, putrefaction (caused by a bacteria), and anything that causes age and death. Later on Yeshua said \"we all do as we HEAR AND SEE. The animals might have 'learnt' the process of killing Man (seeing Man doing it to survive), and continue doing it for THEIR survival. It is only logical, at least for me.  As an Engineer, I can asses that a machine that has waste residue is inefficient; in the Original Design, Man should have had NO RESIDUAL LEFTOVERS, because he must have utilized ALL energy in the matter he collected. The Energy contained in 100 grams of matter can propel 380.000 Diesel Locomotives for a year (check Le Bon's Evolution of Matter, a very old book in which he already stated what Einstein proved).

	134197 : ["12) The evidence shows that Jesus is just a mythical character and never existed. For Jesus-believers, here's the long answer (with evidence), which is needed to cover all bases: All reliable evidence points to Jesus Christ being just a myth. There is no reliable evidence that Jesus even existed, and significant evidence that he didn't. The evidence is in the Bible, the other religions of the time, the lack of writings about Jesus by historians of the 1st century, and the lack of writings about Jesus by anyone until a decade or more after his supposed life. The story of Jesus can be shown to be just a myth created to fulfill prophesy, cobbled together out of stories from the Old Testament and previous gods and myths -- created in the 40's and 50's by Paul of Tarsus (who exhibited symptoms of epilepsy and had delusions of Christ talking to him), the other apostles, the unknown authors of the gospels in the 70's or later, and many other people. The reliable evidence for this is overwhelming. Paul and the other epistle writers don't know any biographical details of Jesus' life, or even the time of his earthly existence. They don't refer to Bethlehem, Nazareth, Galilee, Calvary or Golgotha — or any pilgrimages to what should have been holy sites of Jesus' life. They also don't mention any miracles that Jesus was supposed to have worked, his virgin birth, his trial, the empty tomb, or his moral teachings. To them Jesus was largely a sky-god, who existed in the spiritual past. If Jesus had actually existed, Paul would have written about his life, disciples, teachings and miracles. Paul did not write about any of this. Paul even wrote (1 Cor. 1:22-23) that Jesus did no miracles. Also, Paul thought that Peter and James were other (competing) epistle writers. Paul referred (Galatians 1.19) to James as the Lord's brother, not Jesus' brother. Note that \"brother\" is used about 130 times in the Pauline epistles - with no use meaning blood brother. Paul wrote (in Romans 16:25-26, Galatians 1:11,12) that he knew Jesus through revelation, which is another term for fantasy and delusions. We can also tell that people were accusing Paul of lying, because he attempted to defend himself in Romans 3:5-8. If Jesus had actually existed, the gospels would have been written in first person format. Instead, they were written in third person fiction format, often with the supposed thoughts of Jesus. The gospels should also have been original. Instead, Matthew and Luke extensively plagiarized from Mark. The gospels don't even claim to be eyewitness accounts. In fact, there are no claimed eyewitness or contemporary accounts of Jesus - anywhere. All we have are hearsay accounts. If the Jesus story were true, his trial would have been legal. Instead, the purported trial was illegitimate under both Roman and Jewish law. The story of the trial is just a re-telling of the Jewish ritual of scapegoating, where one goat is set free (i.e. Barabbas, which means \"son of the father\") and one goat is sacrificed (i.e. Jesus). In addition, many scholars have pointed out that the entire crucifixion scene is created out of material extracted from the Psalms. If Jesus had actually existed, at least one of the approximately 30 local historians of the first century would have written about him. No historian of the first century (including Josephus and Philo of Alexandria) wrote about him or his disciples. Therefore Jesus didn't exist. The Jesus story also shows extensive similarities to other myths of the time (especially Horus, Mithra, Osiris, and Dionysus). For instance, baptism into the death and resurrection of Osiris washed away sins so the soul could obtain the best place in heaven. Some early Christians attributed these similarities to Satan who went back in time and created the religions that \"copied\" Christianity. Jesus is worshiped on Sunday because he is a sun god, like over a dozen others whose birthdays were also on the old winter solstice of December 25, when the sun is “reborn.” There were also over a dozen other deities and saviors who were resurrected (often after violent deaths). Christianity just told the story the best, and managed to get control of the government under Constantine. For much more evidence, see the links. There are also several good books on this, including: \"Nailed: Ten Christian Myths that Show Jesus Never Existed At All\"  by David Fitzgerald \"The Jesus Puzzle\" by Earl Doherty \"Not the Impossible Faith\" by Richard Carrier -", 11204, "qVG5GJdPaa", 1],

	134200 : ["Is there a convent or a monastery near Youngstown, Ohio? The residents of those are SUPPOSED to be pure. Whether they include a German Shepherd Dog, I don't know. You might have to travel to the Monks of new Skete in Cambridge, New York state.... THEY have GSDs. But first you need to do some learning. and some deciding. \"Pure-bred\" is close to meaningless. It USED to mean \"Both its parents are in the Breed Register, but its breeder doesn't want this one shown or bred from so refuses to register it\" - NOT an attractive proposition once you start working out the reasons that would cause a breeder to refuse to register a pooch. But greedy BYBers and puppy-millers, plus overenthusiastic volunteers at  rescue groups and SPCA shelters, have degraded it to mean no more than \"I think it looks a bit like a ThatBreed\".... If breed purity is important to you, then you MUST choose a pet that has REGISTRATION with your nation's one official KC. For Yanks, that is the AKC, although there are plenty of unofficial (meaning that no club in the world will accept THEIR \"papers\") that claim to be KCs and/or registries. And if purity is REALLY important, you must then pay to have the AKC DNA test whether the alleged parents of your pet are, in fact, its parents. (Of course, that still allows there to have been fakery with one of the grandparents or greatgrandparents.... You might be horrified at the amount of fake pedigrees discovered by the few organisations that decided to conduct automatic paternity testing a few years ago. Few dog breeders are \"honourable gentlemen\"!) Now decide \"WHY is breed purity important to me?\" There aren't many such reasons! (1) I want to be sure that the breed's characteristics are strongly present in my pet. (2) I want to compete in conformation shows. (3) I want to pass a Breed Survey. (4) I want to breed from my pet. Yet you stated that \"I dont need any special needs for the dog\". If ANY of those 4 numbered reasons applies, then you most definitely DO have \"special needs\" -  needs that are not met unless the GSD you choose is capable of gaining, and its parents have gained, Breed Survey Classification. See Links => Defining_a_GSD in the second hot-link below. The requirements are considerably easier if all you want is an AlsatiOn or a German Croucher or a NAmerican Ski-Slope Dog or a Prick-Eared Basset or a Titanic Tail-Tucker (see   for some examples plus some genuine  GSDs) but you must still insist on AKC registration plus a printed & signed Guarantee - breeders can't support a decent Guarantee unless they KNOW (& have studied) the lineage and have done the necessary tests. If you want just-a-pet, or want to try competing in Agility, CGC, Companion-Utility Trials, Flyball, Obedience Tests or Rally-O, seriously consider a rescue/shelter dog. It is rare for the operators to know the genetic background of what they are caring for, so can offer no guarantees - therefore you MUST maintain comprehensive veterinary insurance in case any expensive treatment is needed. But they sometimes supply a vaccinated & neutered pet for less than your vet would charge for just the shots & op - which makes insurance affordable. ► But NEVER pay an ignorant BYBer, a pet-store or its puppy-mill suppliers, for a pup. Giving any of THEM money just encourages the sods to keep on pumping out their poor-quality \"product\" and ruining the reputations of the breeds they claim to be supplying. • Add   to your browser's Bookmarks or Favorites so that you can easily look up such as feeding, vaccinations, worming, clubs, weights, teething, neutering, disorders, genetics in the public section.

	134202 : ["It would be good to know a little bit about the Garden of Eden and why it was called that.  Also what was the purpose of it.  This was a Paradise Garden.  What would be the purpose to have a plant acting like that in a paradise garden.  If you had a beautiful home would you go find some roaches and mice and rats and fleas to live with you in your beautiful home?  If not neither would God. The most celebrated garden of history is the garden of Eden. It seems to have been an enclosed area, bounded, no doubt, by natural barriers. The garden, located “in Eden, toward the east,” had an entrance on its eastern side. It was here that cherubs were stationed with the flaming blade of a sword, after Adam's sin, to block man's access to the tree of life in the middle of the garden. (Ge 2:8; 3:24) The garden was well watered by a river flowing from it and parting to become the headwaters of four large rivers. This park like “paradise of pleasure” (Ge 2:8, Dy) contained every tree desirable to one's sight and good for food, as well as other vegetation, and was the habitat of animals and birds. Adam was to cultivate it and to keep it and eventually to expand it earth wide as he carried out God's command to “subdue” the earth. It was a sanctuary, a place where God Representative walked and communicated with Adam and Eve; it was a perfect home for them.—Ge 2:9, 10, 15-18, 21, 22; 1:28; 3:8-19    God set before Adam and Eve no fear of a food shortage as the human family ‘became many.' As a loving Father he made ample provision for the earth full of his human sons and daughters. And there was to be no need for killing in the Paradise.     Here was only a general statement as to what mankind was to eat, a statement that both Adam and Eve heard from God. So it spoke of “every tree on which there is the fruit of a tree bearing seed.” It was not here the time to go into particulars, for, in an earlier statement to Adam alone, God had placed a prohibition on eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. (Genesis 2:16, 17) At least for the time being the fruit of this forbidden tree was not to serve as food for Adam and Eve. At any rate, there was plenty of food to eat for sustaining life, without their having to eat also of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad. What was the food of the animals? The inspired record states: “To every wild beast of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving upon the earth in which there is life as a soul I have given all green vegetation for food.” Or, as Today's English Version of the Bible puts it: “For all the wild animals and for all the birds I have provided grass and leafy plants for food.”—Genesis 1:30. So when God designed humans, he put them in a peaceful paradise called Eden. He made them to be at peace with the animals, with no violence or killing for food among animals or man. And humans were to keep it that way by caring for themselves, the animals and the garden paradise that they and their offspring would spread to encompass eventually the entire earth.—Genesis 1:27, 28. Mankind's problems began when our first parents misused their free moral agency. They were seduced by a rebellious spirit creature to believe that they could determine right and wrong without God's help. They chose independence from God. But that was not the Designer's fault. “Perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he,” the Bible says. The responsibility for the consequences of rebellion lies with the rebels: “They have acted ruinously on their own part; they are not his children, the defect is their own.”—Deuteronomy 32:4, 5; Genesis 2:15–3:24. Since humans wanted independence, God gave it to them. However, no longer would he sustain them in perfection. So imperfection and death came into being. (Romans 5:12) And God permitted this—for a period of time—so that all could see what the course of independence would cost mankind, the animals and the earth. For these thousands of years God has allowed this so that once and for all time the sad consequences of rebellion would be manifest. Thus, independence from God and his laws is what turned man into the way of imperfection, violence and death. Also, as man turned toward lawlessness, the earthly creation, too, became chaotic. Man lost his loving dominion over the animals. Since humans could not control themselves peacefully, it is no surprise that the animals are in the same condition. The animals—who had a vegetarian diet in Eden, as did humans—began to live off one another, some even eating humans when possible. (Genesis 1:30) And, as a concession for his survival, man was authorized to eat animal flesh for food after the Flood.—Genesis 9:2-4. .", 11211, "3mSDyjlnaa", 1],

I do not believe they are a designer dog in the sense that these people dont appear to be randomly cross breeding dogs to produce cute puppies with a high sale price. It looks like there is a bit of thought going into how these dogs are bred, as should happen with all dog breeds, and that they are mixing a variety of different breeds to produce the standard that they want to work with, rather than just creating cross-bred dogs and calling them a ridiculous name made from combining the names of the breeds the dog is mixed with.", 11210, "VdeV0jUqaa", 0],

So I am glad to know I am not the only one who was confused. It certainly isn't an AKC recognized breed.  And yes, I know the AKC is not the determination of a breed or not...but I had ever even heard of them.  I suppose I will have to go look now :) ETA: Okay actually looked.  I am in agreement.  Just from looking at pictures and reading a few websites, I say GSD mixed breed.  Looks like a great Pyrenees mixed in there.  Bigger and fluffier than a real GSD.", 11210, "IExtmyEPaa", 4],

In this case, it's just as much her fault as yours - She didn't spay her dog, which attracted your dog to get to her - I say the 2 of you call a truce and agree to each pay to get your own dog's fixed.", 11206, "zZZnQuQJaa", 1],

	134221 : [".Yes it is very wrong that this poor excuse of a man should be able to even look at another dog let alone have one in the same house as him. If he was my next door neighbor i would kick and punch him every time i saw him. I just can't imagine how any-one could be so cruel to pets. It breaks my heart every time i hear of anything like this i mean all pets do is give their love and to me they are like children. In my eyes some people don't deserve to be called humans they should be called animals. It just is not fair no animals come into our lives to be mistreated. If i lived next door to him i wouldn't take my eye off him for one second and the first time i see him be cruel to any pet i would kick the crap out of him and have the police and SPCA on his back like a tonne of bricks. He should be banned for life from ever being able to keep any pet.Dog Abuser, i'd give him plenty of abuse if i could get near him. He wants locking up to protect all animals the piece of rubbish.I hope one day a dog attacks him big style and do proper damage to him, he is no better than a bit of scum.", 11206, "ezEZCgxUaa", 0],

Nevertheless, come to consider of it right now, i don't care ample to draw any conclusions. Jesus will also be both or. If he's fictional, then probably the most fashioned rationale is to use him as an emblem of righteousness, as do many religions create deities for the precise identical rationale. If he is actual, well, he'll just be a individual with some wise words and when he died, a group of people deified him, simply as Guan Yu from the Three Kingdoms period grew to be a god in a while within the chinese language dynasties for folks Buddhism.", 11204, "ebb96Jr9aa", 0],
