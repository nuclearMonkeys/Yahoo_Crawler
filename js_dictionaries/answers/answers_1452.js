	78287 : ["It's not rude or honest either, you're not telling the person your exact feelings (that's why it's not honest). It's considered rude because you're not doing the rational thing-which is to respond when someone portrays acts of concern or affection on you (which in this case, was someone telling you that they missed you). In our culture in general there are many things that we instantly say to certain phrases. I mean how many times a day do you hear someone ask \"how are you\", and the other person reply's, \"good, how are you?\" and then that person reply's \"good.\" That's not always the case, but the point of it is that a lot of the conversations that people express are either by past life experiences or talk of people's actual feelings-like, \"I miss you\". To me personally if you didn't respond I would ask if you were alright. It would be better for me if you said something, and if I said \"I missed you\" then I would hope that you would say \"I missed you too\"-just out of selfish recognition and the way that people usually respond when I say that. I have been known to say \"why would you miss someone like me\" and at first I think it's because I want an underlying truth among the persons answer-or for them to explain what they really missed about me. As humans we are selfish and derive for attention, so a statement like that screams \"I want more attention from you\". Once again, that's not always the case...you could actually be really curious as to why the other person missed you. The other two statements that you said that you usually say are phrases that lead me to think that you're full of yourself and a little too cocky. Point being, it really depends on the person as to how you respond to things, sadly. Our society has made it to where you have to put a mask with almost everyone you talk to, because not everyone thinks like you and they aren't able to understand your intentions 100%.", 8937, "None", 0],

But, then again if the person has sensitive feelings I take that into consideration and try to avoid that trait or say it in a way that they don't get the wrong impression. I find it being completely honest. I am a brutally honest person, so if I were to ask someone this question I would want them to reply in an honest way, and respect my answer as well, even if that meant they said they liked blonds when I am a brunette.
