And Macs are great for visual (movies etc.) and music. I was shocked when I got my MacBook and found it could play high definition videos from itunes- with a very noticeable difference from regular definition. My Macbook is only 250 gig, but I'm fairly certain that they sell versions with larger memory. The differences between Mac and PC? Let the debates begin... They're formatted differently. Mac is a bit more flashy. There are currently more viruses going around for PC. And, if you really miss Windows videogames, you can get the program parallels for Mac. It can run a Windows computer (mine runs Windows XP) and can successfully play its video games. As to whether it's worth the price... you can get year long warrantees, I don't know about longer. I have a desktop apple that's six years old and counting. It has no problems, and can run the new versions of Microsoft Office perfectly fine. Good luck making a decision!", 10567, "ETmNSXMSaa", 0],
	119056 : ["If you want a computer that lasts 4+ years, your best bet is to buy the best hardware you can afford right now. I wouldn't recommend an Apple unless you REALLY like the Apple OS, since they charge much more for their hardware than other computer manufacturers. You'll be able to buy better hardware for a Windows PC. You can also buy better hardware for less money if you go with a desktop PC, which are also easier to upgrade along the way. The other side to making a computer last that long is proper maintenance. You need to understand how to keep it free of viruses, spyware, resource-heavy programs, etc. For computers that last 4+ years, you will probably need to reinstall the OS a couple of times and you need a reliable mechanism to back up your data. If you don't think you can afford a good computer now or keep it running smoothly, then you might be better off buying a cheaper computer now and plan on replacing it after 2-3 years.", 10567, "7A6u4BYuaa", 1],
