	65294 : ["Nobody is proposing health care be paid for with gas taxes. Taxes will go up, but healthcare costs that corporations and individuals pay will go down, so it is not as expensive as it seems. In fact, any improvements in preventive care instead of emergency care will save money in the long run.

	65312 : ["First of all, very good question.  As a man I can tell you being a man isn't as easy as society and our western media makes it to be. As very little boys we grow up with probably just as much feelings as girls do. However, girls are recognized and respected in these feelings, boys aren't. Boys are generally disrespected when they show feelings. If it's not at school, it will be in media and public areas. Boys learn at a very young age that showing emotions is \"weak\".  Because of this, boys will overlook many of their own feelings and eventually learn \"to deal with it\". As a boy you sometimes feel alone in the world. You feel like noone will respect you  or understand you for your true nature, your feelings.  When boys become men, smaller emotions will slowly fade into a numb feeling. Basically because as a boy you've learned to \"deal with it\". Because you've dealt with painful situations on your own before, as a grown man you kind of don't need to talk about it anymore when you have smaller problems. You've always done it on your own, and that's how you got the most recognition and approval. A grown man can logically realize his own emotions. He understands it's just emotions and eventually he'll learn to deal with the situation, no matter how long it takes. This is true for the smaller emotions. Bigger emotions will be taken seriously, just like women treat their emotions but I think with more logic and realization.  What it comes down to is that most women do not realize how most boys grow up. It's entirely different as how most girls grow up. We don't get recognized for our feelings in many situations when growing up. And the older a boy gets, the worse this will be. Boys need to \"deal with it\". And that's what they do. That's what they're forced to do to get approval from their environment.  When growing up. everyone in their environment cared less about what THEY felt as a boy compared to the girls. So does it surprise you many men don't focus on feelings when they're older? Men DO feel feelings. But they're taught to either not tell them or ignore them. Oh no wait, how can I forget, that's all because men \"lack empathy\", RIGHT?", 8288, "None", 1],

	65315 : ["You've got it right to blame partisan politics. Other than that the fault lies with all of us who continue to buy into this 2 party system junk. Until we realize that Dems and Repubs are not the only viable options and start voting in our own self interests and not buying into all the empty campaign promises of bloviating politicians we will continue to suffer and eventually the roof will fall on our house and it will come down.  Americans are not invincible and we're in way over our heads with this deficit stuff. We need to stop putting it on the back burner and address it for real. The Repubs pander to the rich to offset the pandering to the welfare class by the Dems. Maybe we can meet in the middle and stop all the pandering?

Simply realize that this nation has already had taxes like these in the past, for 50 years at a time when our nation because a huge military and economic superpower with a thriving middle class.
