Also, the starting current of a typical single phase induction motor of that size is 2 to 3 times the running current.  So make sure you use a 20 amp switch and a 20 amp branch circuit.  I would use no more than a ¾ horsepower motor on a standard 120 volt, 15 amp branch circuit; especially for an air compressor.", 716, "None", 1],

Otherwise you would need to put the circuitry down at the fuse box and run special cable rated at 40 amps from there to the outlet. \"running a circuit in mixed parallel/series with multiple lines of different voltages but constant current.\"  if you have multiple lines, then the total current is not constant. unclear. AC constant current is not simple. I can think of methods but they involve complicated circuitry requiring heat sinks. probably not available off the shelf and would have to be designed and built and debugged.
