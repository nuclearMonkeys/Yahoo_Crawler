	132038 : ["Just a question to consider - how long did you rent the property before the landlord moved in with you, was he using the garage at all when you first took over? because I think if the landlord lives in the house with the tenants, then different rules apply, you are just a lodger in his home. He would have to prove he has not always lived at the house. You could do a check with the planners to make sure he has applied to change the use of the garage to a room, although you do mention than someone has come round to check out if the house should now be an HMO. You also mention locks on doors - by this do you mean your own rooms? you do not have to have locks on each room if you are a group of friends sharing, as you should know and trust each other, but if the place is let out as individual bedsits where the landlord lived, then you would have a lock, as you would not be part of a group living together. The other question is, do you just pay rent for just your own room, or do you have to cover the loss of rent if one of you leaves and the room is empty. This would also make a difference to what your status is in the house and to the agreement you should have. OK - have read the additional details you have given: You are not protected like people renting a house by themselves. I think 'The Masked Landlord' has a site where you could ask more questions for your situation.  try asking on here as you may get quicker answers. But as you have no agreements and nothing written down, although you have been paying your rent monthly you should give a months notice - BUT if you can find somewhere to move in quicker I would be on my way out of this house. You could ask the landlord to meet, and ask him what he proposes to do about the damage deposit so you know, he should be able to give you an idea. As you are only renting the one room I cannot see how he can charge you for any damage to any other part of the house because how could he prove you did it and not one of the other lodgers. Unless he has like pictures of your room before you moved in, and you have done something awful, what can he deduct? Tell him you want to use the deposit as the last months rent and see what he says. In future You take pictures and get them dated of places you move into - take pictures of everything, from every angle - then there can be no dispute.", 11123, "h3s02b3Jaa", 0],

I know that legally under a tenancy agreement you would have to but you have to play this guy by his own game.You will not have your deposit back,this guy is scum and has no intention of giving anyone their deposits back. Can you get out now,why wait?Just leave. Also will the other tenants back you up about how you have all been treated. Your landlord has no rights to enter your room and take anything,this is theft. He can threaten to take you to court to reclaim the unpaid rent but he would have to provide the courts with written proof,rent books,or bank statements where you would pay by standing order. In court it would be his word and your word.It just wouldn't stand.Also do not give this guy a forwarding address,he will probably have some dirty tricks up his sleeve. If I were you I'd look for a new room tomorrow and leave don't tell him.

Meanwhile, you may want to do a few things to keep your brain and body chemistry balanced now that you don't have THC to calm you. Clean your house and your surroundings, and surround yourself with nice, cheerful smells and colors.  Yellow, baby blue, orange...cheerful stuff.  See if you can get some throw pillows to keep around your room and the house too. Breathe deeply.  Getting plenty of fresh air helps to heal your lungs and this is very energizing and uplifting. You might want to choose a designated venting receiver.  This is someone who's just supposed to listen to you vent your frustrations without trying to fix everything...just listen to you and basically remind you that you can handle it. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables.  This is extremely important when trying to wean yourself off of any chemical.  It helps your metabolism to stay on a good schedule.  Also drink plenty of water by the way.  Being hydrated and getting enough vitamins and food definitely improves the mood. In fact, you might have periods of too much energy.

His lack of experience His lack of plans (who is he going to copy off of now) His choice of friends/associates  (domestic  terrorists, racist clergy, etc.) His Marxist philosophies (and on and on) ***EDIT***   I apologize for this edit being long, but when you are called out, you need to stand up. Sageandscholar, Marxism is in fact a theoretical framework based on the analysis of \"the conflicts between the powerful and the subjugated\".  It \"plays into policy\" through the ideas of either socialism, communism, and/or the basic thoughts of taking from the rich and powerful and giving to the poor and downtrodden. I am certainly not the first person to call Obama a Marxist. (And I'm not even including Rush and Hannity.)  But let's play, shall we?   some Marxist philosophies from wikipedia and how Obama relates to them: *a belief that capitalism is based on the exploitation of workers by the owners of capital  (Obama's church believes that black people have been exploited by white people and the government.  They believe that the government gives them AIDS and works to put them in prison.  Yes, if you go there and listen to it for 20 years, you are complicit.) *a belief that people's consciousness of the conditions of their lives reflects the dominant ideology which is in turn shaped by material conditions and relations of production  (Obama said that people in PA have such bitterness so they cling to religion and guns.) *an understanding of class in terms of differing relations of production, and as a particular position within such relations (  although this is more about the social relations than the socio-economic ones) From Dreams of my Father: \"The emotion between the races could never be pure..... the THE OTHER RACE (WHITE) WOULD ALWAYS REMAIN JUST THAT: MENACING, ALIEN AND APART\"   *a view of history according to which class struggle, the evolving conflict between classes with opposing interests, structures each historical period and drives historical change and a belief that this dialectical historical process will ultimately result in a replacement of the current class structure of society with a system that manages society for the good of all, resulting in the dissolution of the class structure and its support (more often than not including the nation state)  From obama speeches: \"This election is about the past vs. the future. It's about whether we settle for the same divisions and distractions and drama that passes for politics today or whether we reach for a politics of common sense and innovation, a politics of shared sacrifice and shared prosperity.\" From michelle Obama “The truth is, in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system, then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more.” (Sure, it was Michelle who said it, but Barack believes in: +  reversing the \"Bush tax cuts\",  +  taxing companies so he can reduce taxes on individuals earning low incomes +  giving more money to the Community Development Block Grant for low income areas,  +  giving $845 billion to the U.N. to give to other countries to feed their poor I know what Marxism is, buddy.
