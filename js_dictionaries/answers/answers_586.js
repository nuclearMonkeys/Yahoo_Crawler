	33113 : ["time will tell whether hes the man for long term success. Lampard by virtue and services to club alone deserved a chance to manage Chelsea and perhaps the club owed it to him to keep him on till the end of this season at the bare minimum. Once the best midfielder in the English Premier League with an astonishing goals/apps ratio for a central attacking midfielder, was easily in the top five best midfielders in europe during between 2005 to 2010, and played a significant role in Chelsea's rise to dominance in the 2000's as well as helping them accumulate all that silverware,  its remarkable the owner of a football club can be so ruthless and harsh to somebody who has served their club to that level. Still though, in time I believe he'll come back again to manage the club once Tuchel's batteries deplete.  Tuchel has proven nothing might I add, absolutely nothing.  He's intherited Lampards squad and any success he gets initally from this counts for nothing as 'he didnt built it'. We'll show you classless pr1cks how a BIG CLUB treats their LEGENDS, when we finally bid farewell to Jurgen Klopp and announce the arrival of the EPL Legend and Liverpool Goliath,  Mr Steven Gerrard ^_^ # Steve Gerrard Gerrard hes big and hes fecking hard he passes the ball 40 yards Ste Gerrard Gerrard # YNWA 6 TIMES CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE", 5053, "None", 0],

If Liverpool aren't up for revenge after that disaster game with Ramos injuring Salah and the alleged Karius concussion then they're all just a bunch of weak players  It's a shame fans aren't allowed in to watch though. One of the best European games I've seen was Man United vs Real Madrid at Old Trafford. Ronaldo's first game back in Manchester scored the winner and looked apologetic, Welbeck started and had a great game, Ramos own goal, Nani controversial red, atmosphere was amazing, Sir Alex was at his best. Some great players on the pitch on both sides it was a great game. Liverpool vs Real Madrid needs this energy but there will be no fans. Imagine full stadium, Klopp animated, tackles flying, end to end football. We might still get most of it but it won't be as good without the fans I think everyone can agree ", 5040, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],

	33131 : ["Out of those it's definitely Spurs why is this even a question? Btw Man United are second to Spurs in the bottlejobs award. Couldn't handle the pressure of a title race, lost yet another semi final this season, knocked out of the FA cup today to Leicester, knocked out of the champions league after beating both Leipzig and PSG in their first two games.  All they have left now for a trophy is the Europa League. So whoever ends up with a trophy (Spurs have EFL Cup final, United have Europa League quarter finals but should be the best team left) doesn't deserve the title as bottler of the season.  If they both win trophies then who is the bottler of the year? Might depend on the final league table, my thinking would be Newcastle if they end up getting relegated.  Another bottlejob Adam can add to the list of Newcastle bottlejobs haha", 5041, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],

You've also been beaten pretty hard by Man City, Leicester and lost to Chelsea as well in the last 2 months or so.

	33140 : ["I knew Chelsea would be back once they got a competent manager and some actual coaching. Defenders don't go from leaking 2-3 goals a game to keeping clean sheets on the reg, that's a sign they're finally being coached properly. Frank sucked this season and last, they were woeful and got the lowest points tally to secure 4th in over a decade last season, and bottled a final to Arsenal, embarrassing. Poor old Frank only had like 60 international players to choose from, Chelsea loan out a ton of really talented youth, like Mount is as at Derby for example. He couldn't win anything with this group of players, I bet Tuchel will win something this season or next even if they didn't sign a single player. Arsenal had a way worse team than Chelsea last season and still beat them.  I'm really impressed with Jorginho and Mount under Tuchel, Werner is greatly improved too and I think goals will start to come soon. Lampard will end up in the Championship eventually after probably getting and failing in one premier league job. ", 5053, "cq22NZX5aa", 0],
