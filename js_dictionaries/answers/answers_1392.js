I tried to argue this but hey I'll just paste it here. \"He helped the poor without one government program. He healed the sick without a government health care system. He feed the hungry without food stamps. And everywhere He went, it turned into a rally, attracting large crowds, and giving them hope, encouragement and inspiration. \"For three years He was unemployed, and never collected an unemployment check. Nevertheless, he completed all the work He needed to get done. He didn't travel by private jet. He walked and sailed, and sometimes traveled on a donkey. \"But they made Him walk when He was arrested and taken to jail, and no, He was not read any Miranda Rights. He was arrested for just being who He was and doing nothing wrong. And when they tried Him in court, He never said a mumbling word. \"He didn't have a lawyer, nor did He care about who judged Him. His judge was a higher power. \"The liberal court found Him guilty of false offences and sentenced Him to death, all because He changed the hearts and minds of men with an army of 12. His death reset the clock of time. Never before and not since has there ever been such a perfect conservative.\"", 8790, "jz07R1C7aa", 0],
	75219 : ["i'd use the note 'mistrust' quite than 'dislike', and the clarification for it really is the incredibly stupendous volume of circumstances Romney has contradicted his personal message... the following is a quote from FOX information chief Brit Hume: “i imagine it really is his unmarried greatest project, truly, with the exception of the particular undeniable reality that as a results of flips, or as a results of positions he's flipping from or positions to the left of the position the midsection of the Republican party is, human beings don't believe him as a conservative. and that i'd say, you know, human beings regularly like it in case you modify positions and are available in route of their position, yet you're purely allowed a particular kind of flips earlier human beings commence to doubt your personality.”", 8790, "S7oU4PqOaa", 0],

He did a fine job last year, thanks to a lot of luck and of course his teammates.  But he is very immature and I think, not ready for \"prime time\".  He isn't as bad as Ryan Leaf (What a nightmare) but he has the potential to be.  If he gets like that the Shawn's may have to adjust his helmet a bit...or his O-line let him get his a$$ beat a time or two.

	75256 : ["Tutankhamen was not unmasked recently, the golden mask was removed many eyars before due to the significance and value of the gold and lapis death mask. Archaeologist removed some of the wrappings to try to get a clearer picture of how Tutankhamen died and lived. They removed the body to help preserve it against pollution from enviroment and from human beings. The carbon dioxide that you emit while leaning over to look at tut's mummy is actually destroying it. Egyptian Pharos wanted their bodies preserved so they could live on in the afterlife, this is just another way for him to live on. Plenty of pharos and queens have been moved in ancient and modern times to protect them from natural disasters, political upheaval, and from building projects. What the modern day Egyptian board of antiquities is doing is really not that different than what these pharos wanted. Zahwi is also using this as a way to increase tourism, but really who can blame him? Egypt is a country in need of the money from their tourism.
