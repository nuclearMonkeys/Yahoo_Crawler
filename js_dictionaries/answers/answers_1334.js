	72301 : ["That sounds like a bit of adware-browser hijacker on your machine.  There are never any guarantees in malware fighting, but try this: First, boot into Safe Mode With Networking. (See below for details.) That sometimes keeps malware from protecting itself.  Then, if you have an anti-virus, make sure it has the latest virus definitions and run a full scan with it.  If you don't have one, many people here swear by Malwarebytes (it's free). I suggest you also download Ad-Aware Free and Spybot S&D (they're free), install them, update them and run full scans with them in Safe Mode With Networking.  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.   To get into Safe Mode with Networking: 1.	Log out and reboot your machine. 2.	When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly. 3.	Select Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu. 4.	Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password. 5.	The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.   6.	When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode. Another trick that may enable anti-malware and/or its installer program to sneak past the malware is to change the name of the anti-malware program itself.  The names of the files and their locations differ between anti-malware programs, but the procedure is always the same: 1.	In Windows Explorer, find the folder with the anti-malware. 2.	Change the name of the program (it always ends with a .exe) to virtually anything else, but keep the “.exe” part. 3.	Run that. Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes. Update and run full scans regularly, not just when you think you already have malware. Good luck. Note:  There ARE free versions of these reputable programs on the websites listed.  They just may not be obvious.   Ad-Aware Free (free):   Spybot S & D (free):   MalwareBytes (free)    (If the program doesn't run, changing its filename from mbam.exe to something else ending in .exe has sometimes proven effective.) AVG anti-virus (free):  Avast! (free):  Kaspersky (free trial) (Seems to dislike installing on any machine with just about any other decent anti-malware, including some firewalls.): ", 8675, "FBQZ06vraa", 0],

Unfortunately the interviewer was doing his best to put words in Cicerone's mouth and make his own points, rather than actually interviewing, so the transcript is too much Humphrys and not enough Cicerone. You think it's a great revelation that the president of the National Academy of Sciences doesn't think we have the kind of evidence that says that \"...we're going to fry\"? I don't think you would ever find a careful scientist making such a claim in the first place. It's not frying that we're worried about, it's things like persistent drought, increased extreme weather, long-term sea level rise, decrease in ocean pH, etc.  Things that will not fry us, but may very well cost us many trillions of dollars and millions of human lives. EDIT: Maxx, did you read a different transcript than the one you provided the link to, or are you just lying again? Give me a quote from the transcript where he says that we're not going to see ANY those things I mentioned.  You can't because he obviously he didn't say it--and yet you're claiming he did.

The Jo Nova article doesn't show the complete list, but the complete list is linked on the page and can be viewed here:  Here are the Ten Reasons: 1. Temperature records from around the world do not support the assumption that today's temperatures are unusual. 2. Satellite temperature data does not support the assumption that temperatures are rising rapidly. 3. Current temperatures are always compared to the temperatures of the 1980's, but for many parts of the world the 1980's was the coldest decade of the last 100+ years. 4. The world experienced a significant cooling trend between 1940 and 1980. 5. Urban heat island effect skews the temperature data of a significant number of weather stations. 6. There is a natural inverse relationship between global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels. 7. The CO2 cannot, from a scientific perspective, be the cause of significant global temperature changes. 8. There have been many periods during our recent history that a warmer climate was prevalent long before the industrial revolution. 9.

Then go on to consider why would you believe one over another? The fact that he noticed that the temperatures had dropped after 1940 for about 40 years in spite of rising CO2 was interesting. The fact that the \"corrected\" data masked that effect was also interesting. It just reinforces my view that many so-called scientists are suffering from confirmation bias. It also lets you realise why few breakthroughs in climate science are being made. When you bend the data then match your models to it you will end up with the wrong emphasis on the model parameters that you think are important. You are basically misdirecting yourself. With every climate scientist trying to show why the consensus position is right rather than using the standard scientific method and trying to show why it is wrong you can see why little progress is being made.", 8678, "BkdgZozJaa", 1],

I'm curious why you left this out ----------------------------------------- John Humphrys: Yeah, but you can't absolutely prove, can you - and you're the scientist and I'm not, obviously - but you can't absolutely prove that CO2 in the atmosphere is responsible for global warming. Ralph Cicerone: We will never have absolute proof, but to all reasonable tests - yes, we have the evidence. ------------------------------------------------ It has also been stated in here numerous times that while the cause of the warming is fairly certain the effects of that warming is less certain. Some of the things that will occur are well known, such as increased rainfall and heatwaves, while others are not, such as trends in tropical cyclones. So you continuously argue the cause of the warming, as you do with almost every post in here, yet post things that disagree with you to make a point that the future of a warming climate is less certain than the cause of the warming climate.

No scientific body of national or international standing has offered a dissenting opinion. “It's a very, very strong consensus,” says Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences and chair of the National Research Council. The level of certainty within the scientific community that burning fossil fuels warms the global atmosphere is comparable, he said, to the level of scientific certainty that vaccines prevent diseases such as measles and polio. “The whole system works on evidence, repeatability, doing the same calculations, testing rigorously to get the same result,” Cicerone says. “If you're working on a topic the public is interested in, there are more and more people watching what you're doing.

You see some key word in the question, and just dump out all the information you know which relates to that key word, hoping that somewhere in there you've got the right answer. The skeptics are just dumping out every possible alternative theory they've heard, and hope that the answer to the current warming is in there.
