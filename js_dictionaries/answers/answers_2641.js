	137879 : ["I started watching wrestling at the beginning of the Monday Night Wars. Alot of my friends watched wrestling in school & I just didnt want to get into any fads. I mentioned it to my dad one day and he told me I should go and try to watch it. I was bored sooo why not *shrugs* When I sat down, I saw Golga from the Oddities, Gangrel,  and Mick Foley as Mankind (my favorite wrstler). I was HOOKED! I saw that bit of anti-authority, attitude, and weirdness that I saw in myself at that time. I kept running in on commercials and tellng my dad about evvvverything that was going on. He finally ended up turning it on for the both of us to watch. We have been watching it ever since. We've spent over a DECADE watching wrestling together... now we're starting to slack off of it. It just doesnt hold our attention anymore. The WWE has such predictable storylines and matches. If you'll watch closely, whoever has the advantage in the beginning of the match inevitably LOSES the match in the end. The storylines, the superstars, that once vital need to watch wrestling & the feeling it left you at the end of the show where you just KNOW you wanted to see more, you HAD to catch it next week... its not there anymore. Some blame it on the \"AtTiTuDe ErA\" going away and the PG era coming, some blame it on the shift from more Business storylines instead of entertainment and long term storylines, some blame it on the excessive ppvs, some blame it on the company pushing college boy short hair'd wrestlers instead of the long haired giants of the 80s, some blame it on the aquistion of WCW and ECW, you can blame it on the lack of competition, some blame it on TNA not measuring up to WWE monopoly, some blame it on the outlawing of chairshots to the head, some blame it on Vince McMahon not heading the company as the heel boss in the show, some blame it on pushing NEW wrestlers as Champions who have not worked their way up the ladder to earn title shots, some blame it on pushing old mid-carders (example: Edge) to be champion, and some just blame it on badluck... whatever the reason, that is why I started watching wrestling, and thattt is why i have shyed away from it now.

	137890 : ["No offense, but all of your suggestions are terrible because they're little more than fanboy fantasies.  They can't sign R-Truth or Shelton Benjamin or Umaga because THEY ARE ALREADY SIGNED TO THE WWE!  Bringing new wrestlers into the company won't do anything to help because it won't change the awful booking or storylines or REVERSE BATTLE ROYAL GAUNTLET FLAMING HAMBURGERS ON A POLE MATCHES that Vince Russo has such a fetish for. The single biggest thing they have to do in my opinion is fire Vince Russo and Dutch Mantell, and think about booking/writing storylines that don't last 3-5 months before being blown off and completely forgotten about. Paul Heyman's not doing anything in wrestling lately.  I'd risk bringing him as head booker. Also: CURRY MAN IS NOT A CHILDISH CRAPPY CHARACTER.  You can blame TNA entirely for making him seem that way.  Curry Man in Japan or Ring of Honor was an excellent cartoony gimmick in the same way cartoony gimmicks like Kane (pre-unmasking) or the Undertaker or the Ultimate Warrior were.  TNA has simply done what they always do with a good idea: completely fumble it and proceed to bury it under piles of bad stuff.", 11370, "zIiCoIqpaa", 0],
	137891 : ["The only thing that TNA can do to get better is to take things back to the way they initially were before the company was financially saved by Panda Energies. (TNA's parent company)  TNA was known for being more focused on the actual wrestling skills and techniques as opposed to charisma and promo performances. Well after the buyout, TNA has become more focused on dialogue and characterization. This is ok as long as this does not overshawdow the acutal talent and performances. However, slowly but surely, this is overtaken the events (especially the main events). The \"Legend Title\" in my opinion is only useful to the organization so long as they are able to fued the elder heads (like Kevin Nash, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Sting, Kip James, Road Dog, etc).

	137895 : ["While I agree with some of your sentiment, I don't think that hiring or firing anyone would help the overall product get over in the public eye.  Firing Curry Man is a horrible idea, just let him be Christopher Daniels.  There's also no point in firing all of your big names, regardless to how little some people may enjoy them in the ring.  Right now the Main Event Mafia is the biggest thing in TNA, and they're on their way towards putting over the younger homegrown, which is what they should be doing.  In my eyes, there's nothing flawed about having these veterans stick around a little while longer.  So far, Sting has delivered in the ring at both BFG and Turning Point, and even Kevin Nash put on a decent enough brawl with Joe last PPV to get some love.  It's not like they book Nash as a single every week either.  Most of his ring work over the past year has been in 6 man tags where he gets little action, which is good.  Letting Cage go right now isn't that big of a deal either.  Christian, as sad as it is to say, hasn't been relevant in TNA for about a year now Here are the five things Candle thinks TNA needs to become successful (and none of them are Shelton Benjamin) 1- A new network.  Right now TNA iMPACT is Spike's highest rated show, and even then only a million or so people are tuning in weekly.  Why?  Is it because of the production?  Lately, nobody can make that argument, because TNA's been stepping up their production.  Is it because of storyline continuity?  Not lately.  Even now, Kevin Nash is turning on Joe for something that happened a year ago, so continuity isn't a current issue, even though it has been in the past.  Does it display too much humor in wrestling?  Once again, for the past two months we've seen no outlandish Kurt Angle vignettes, no major exposure to Rock n' Rave Infection, no Prince Justice Brotherhood (outside of about a month ago when Kurt Angle beat Curry and Sharky up backstage) and even Eric Young and Jackie Moore have toned down their comedic mannerisms.  Is it the actual wrestling?  Heck no.  If anything's kept TNA afloat for this long, it's been the in-ring talent.  Star power?  If Kurt Angle and Sting can't draw fans, then you're pointing fingers of blame in the wrong place.  TNA's biggest problem is exposure.  Taping on Spike means that they have no affiliate networks capable of broadcasting commercials for TNA, and considering it's apparent that a majority of the Spike TV mainstays already tune in to TNA, it's apparent that TNA is stuck in this little Spike TV bubble as far as getting their name out there goes.  About a year ago, they had a shot to sign a deal with FX, and while I support their decision to stick with Spike, a network that's honestly nurtured the TNA product quite a bit, the move to FX would have been a big step for TNA.  They would have had the oppurtunity to have exposure on FX affiliate station, Fox, along with the countless Fox affiliate stations, and that would make ratings grow, especially now that a lot of WWE fans are getting burned out on the product and want that alternative they had in the 90's.  Plain and simple, TNA needs a new network above all else to get more attention and promotion. 2.  More touring.I realize that it sort of messes with one of the few allures that talents fall prey to when considering signing with TNA (i.e.- not having to travel as often as you would with WWE) but TNA really needs to step up and step out.  Make no mistake, they have started doing this.  PPV's are happening more and more outside of Florida, house shows are packed wherever they go.  They need to do some more tapings outside of the impact zone.  That, more than anything else, really would draw a lot of attention.  This could really start a huge word-of-mouth campaign in TNA's favor.  iMPACT fans could coax unsavvy friends into going with them, and possibly get them hooked to the product.  I know it costs a lot to put up the sets, and advertise the venue and whatnot, but they'd make that money back if they'd go out and charge people, opposed to sitting in the Universal lot giving away a free show. 3.  Push the X Division.  I know people say this all the time, but it's what put TNA on the map, and the X Division wrestling is what initially draws in most TNA fans.  Since the X Division Title got it's new look, it's lost a lot of importance and attention.  TNA needs to strive to get that attention back, because right now it's one of the few things that TNA has that WWE doesn't, and that's cruiserweight wrestling.  TNA hasn't focused on that strength since Daniels turned into Curry Man, and Paparazzi Productions (one of the funniest things in wrestling in AGES) died. 4. Push the Woman's Division: Once again, it's one of the many things that TNA focuses on that sets them apart from up north.  Ratings have proven that people love the Knockout Division, and for awhile, TNA milked it with Kong vs Kim even main eventing a few iMPACTS", 11370, "7sa6B6Qhaa", 1],

	137908 : ["No, they don't hate \"you.\"   It is their job to prosecute.  As the defendant, you are their job.  They take the evidence and other findings of fact given to them by the investigators, grand juries, etc. then build a case against you.  That is not to say it is against \"you.\"  It is a case for the state, county or local government they work for. They try to gain a conviction, but they also make the request to the judge or jury for the amount of penalty involved.  Most crimes have a standard penalty within a range.  Fine, jail time, prison time, etc.  The level of crime and the case against the defendant, alsong with other mitigating and extinuating factors figures into what they ask the presiding body for against the defendant.  For example if the penalty was up to $5,000 fine and 1 to 5 years in prison, the prosecutor can ask for $1,000 and a year if they feel the crime comitted fell into the classification, but was not severe enough to warrant the maximum.
