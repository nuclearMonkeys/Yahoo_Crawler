Most Americans believe that life is a sacred gift from God and needs to be treated with all human dignity from the moment of conception to the point of natural death. For this reason, the destruction of living human embryos to harvest embryonic stem cells is immoral.  • The end never justifies the means • A moral good can never come from a moral evil Here are just a few of the common myths about Stem Cell Research: Myth: Stem cells can only come from embryos.  Truth: Stem cells can be taken from: • Umbilical cords • The placenta • Amniotic fluid • Adult tissues and organs including bone marrow, fat from liposuction, regions of the nose and even dead bodies up to 20 hours after death Myth: The Catholic Church is against stem cell research.  Truth: The Catholic Church approves three of the four types of stem cell research: • Against Embryonic stem cells • For Embryonic germ cells (from miscarriages) • For Umbilical cord stem cells • For Adult stem cells  Myth: Embryonic stem cell research has the greatest promise Fact: Up to now, no human being has ever been cured of a disease using embryonic stem cells. Adult stem cells, on the other hand, have already cured thousands. There is the example of the use of bone marrow cells from the hipbone to repair scar tissue on the heart after heart attacks. Research using adult cells is 20-30 years ahead of embryonic stem cells and holds greater promise.  Based on the “The Ten Great Myths in the Debate Over Stem Cell Research” by Tadeusz Pacholczyk, Ph.D.  Adult stem cells are currently used for the medical treatment of: • Anemias  • Cancers (multiple types)  • Child Leukemias  • Cornea Regeneration  • Crohn´s Disease  • Diabetes, Type I  • Heart Disease, Acute & Chronic  • Krabbe Leukodystrophy  • Liver Cirrhosis  • Lupus  • Lymphomas  • Myelomas  • Multiple Sclerosis  • Paralysis  • Osteopetrosis  • Parkinson´s Disease  • Rheumatoid Arthritis  • Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome  • Sickle Cell Anemia  • Spinal Cord Injury  • Stroke  • Systemic Vasculitis  • and more  For more information, see the National Catholic Bioethics Center's resources on stem cell research:  And: Here is \"Instruction Dignitas Personae on Certain Bioethical Questions\" that Pope Benedict XVI gave to President Obama:  With love in Christ.", 8301, "AA11440601", 1],

Also grownup stem phone is not extra amazing as it is not common in comparison to pre embryonic stem phone. We've come to the factor had been no embryos are harmed because the stem cells are taken earlier than an embryo is shaped, hence the name \"pre embryonic\". There is most likely no cause we will have to be this some distance in the back of, even earlier than the invention of pre embryonic.

And illegal supporters are using their votes as blackmail. How our gov could state these people could get legal status after 7 years if they stayed out of trouble is illegal.  They entered illegally. They were illegal when these children were born, they took the risk and lost. They should be deported along with the children. The children have the right to return when they are of age. They are not our responsibility and should not be pushed onto us to support.  That is one of the main problems I have with our government. They have taken away personal responsibility for ones decisions.  It doesn't matter what you do or why you do it they lead you to believe they will bail you out. It has created a generation of entitlement.   These children maybe considered US citizens, but that does not entitle their family members to break the law and escape the consequences.  As the article stated most are in their teens. They can legally bring in immediate family members within the next few years anyway.  What's the rush.

	65671 : ["They won't win. I think that the energy is all directed in the wrong place. It is sad that these families must be separated but the parents knew this would happen if they were caught. They left because they felt they had to, and I can understand it--I might do the same thing if I could not provide for my family and there were no opportunities in my country. But I would have to accept the consequences. It is a risk. I really think that the illegal immigrants are going to back themselves into a corner. They do not have the same rights as citizens, just as we USA citizens would not have the same rights in their countries. They get a lot more here than we would in any other country. However, you can only go so far before you step over the line. And to sue that the government should keep illegal people in the country is going too far. The energy of these students and lawyers would be better placed in getting the parents reunited with the children in their native country and getting decent jobs for the parents in their country or getting better jobs for the legal guardians of the children in the USA. The children hopefully will not be preoccupied with this lawsuit.

	65672 : ["Personally, I would never vote for anyone who wanted to put restrictions on a woman's right to choose. It's scary that there are people out there who want so much control over other people's lives. I don't tell people who are against abortion that they should have an abortion; it just needs to be there as an option for women.  And as for contraception, condoms break, but if you're using a back-up method then you don't have to worry about having a baby, abortion or adoption.  Ok, so Sara Palin doesn't want women to have abortions, but she doesn't want them to use birth control other than condoms? If someone is against abortion, you would think they would want women to use birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies. I for one am not ready to squeeze out 5 children like Sarah Palin, and would NEVER vote for someone who wants so much power and control over my reproductive choices.

	65673 : ["Yes, But that is an Ideology in of itself,everything is based on an ideology, he is just demonstrating his capacity at being a Moron, With the current debate raging about stem cell research, as Christians we would do well to education ourselves on the topic and its ramifications. To cure disease and alleviate suffering are noble pursuits, and the Bible clearly supports the battle against physical ills. A major feature of Jesus' ministry was His healing (Matthew 4:23-24), and one of the New Testament writers, Luke, was a physician (Colossians 4:14). Stem cell research has shown great promise in the fairly new field of regenerative medicine, and many groups are actively pursuing new ways of harvesting stem cells and testing the cells' plasticity—the ability to form a wide variety of mature cell types. The most important question concerning stem cell research is not “Is it legal?” or “Is it cost-efficient?” but “Is it right?” The true issue is what is God's will? Before we can answer the ethical/moral question, we must distinguish between the two types of stem cells: adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells. Research on adult stem cells has been going on for decades and has proven that there are therapeutic effects in treating cancer, autoimmune diseases, leukemia, and heart disease. Adult stem cells are obtained from living bone marrow, blood, brain tissue, skin, and body fat. Other sources rich in adult stem cells are umbilical-cord blood and the placenta. Embryonic stem cells, as their name suggests, are derived from human embryos. In order to harvest embryonic stem cells, an embryo must be destroyed. Central to the debate, then, is our view of the human embryo. The biblical teaching is that human existence begins at conception (Psalm 139:13-16; Jeremiah 1:4-5). The international consensus of embryologists agrees with Scripture in that life begins at fertilization. At the moment of conception, the embryo is 100 percent human, with all 46 human chromosomes and a fully functioning, unique genetic code. Size and location do not determine humanity. Because research on embryonic stem cells requires the destruction of a living human being, it is against God's will. No amount of promised “benefit” to society or to medical knowledge can justify the killing of a human for spare parts. The end does not justify the means. It is never ethical—in fact, it is morally reprehensible—to mark people for death in order to conduct utilitarian experiments on their body parts. In contrast, research on adult stem cells does not require the loss of life. Adult stem cells have versatility and a proven track record, and they lack the moral difficulties of embryonic stem cells. Therefore, we believe that research on adult stem cells is a legitimate field of study, well within the will of God. The Stem Cell Debate By: Ted Peters More in Facets Series", 8301, "None", 0],
