	127174 : ["\" Who is Gog of Magog mentioned in the book of Ezekiel? \" For many years, our publications have explained that the name Gog of Magog refers to Satan after he was thrown out of heaven. Why? Because the book of Revelation identifies Satan as the leader of the worldwide attack against God's people. (Revelation 12:1-17) So we understood that Gog must be another name for Satan. However, there were some problems with this explanation. Think about the following: When talking about Gog's destruction, Jehovah said that he would give Gog “as food to all kinds of birds of prey and the wild beasts of the field.” (Ezekiel 39:4) Then Jehovah added: “On that day I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel.” (Ezekiel 39:11) But how could Satan, who is an invisible spirit creature, be eaten by birds and wild beasts? How could he be buried on earth? The Bible clearly shows that Satan will be thrown into the abyss for 1,000 years. He will not be eaten or buried.—Revelation 20:1, 2. The Bible says that at the end of the 1,000 years, Satan will be released from the abyss, and “he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war.” (Revelation 20:8) But if Satan is Gog, this means that Satan would have to mislead himself. Therefore, “Gog” does not refer to Satan in either the book of Ezekiel or the book of Revelation. So who is Gog of Magog? To answer that question, we need to search the Bible to find out who attacks God's people. The Bible mentions the attack by ‘Gog of Magog,' the attack by “the king of the north,” and the attack by “the kings of the earth.” (Ezekiel 38:2, 10-13; Daniel 11:40, 44, 45; Revelation 17:14; 19:19) Are these different attacks? That is not likely. It seems that the Bible is using different names to describe the same attack. Why do we say that? Because the Bible tells us that all the nations of the earth will be part of this final attack that starts the war of Armageddon.—Revelation 16:14, 16. When we compare all these Bible references about the final attack on God's people, it is clear  that the name Gog of Magog does not refer to Satan. Instead, Gog of Magog refers to a group of nations. Will “the king of the north” lead this group? We cannot say for sure. But this explanation seems to be in harmony with what Jehovah says about Gog: “You will come from your place, from the remotest parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly, a vast army.”—Ezekiel 38:6, 15. Similarly, the prophet Daniel, who lived at the same time as Ezekiel, says about the king of the north: “Reports out of the east and out of the north will disturb him, and he will go out in a great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction. And he will plant his royal tents between the grand sea and the holy mountain of Decoration; and he will come all the way to his end, and there will be no helper for him.” (Daniel 11:44, 45) This is similar to what the book of Ezekiel says that Gog will do.—Ezekiel 38:8-12, 16. What will happen after the final attack? Daniel tells us: “During that time Michael [Jesus Christ] will stand up [at Armageddon], the great prince who is standing [since 1914] in behalf of your people. And there will occur a time of distress [the great tribulation] such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time. And during that time your people will escape, everyone who is found written down in the book.” (Daniel 12:1) We read a similar description of what Jesus will do at Revelation 19:11-21. But who is “Gog and Magog” mentioned at Revelation 20:8? This name refers to all those who rebel against Jehovah and attack his people during the final test at the end of the 1,000 years. They will have the same hateful attitude as Gog of Magog, the nations that attack God's people at the end of the great tribulation. And just like those nations that will be destroyed at Armageddon, Gog and Magog will also be destroyed. (Revelation 19:20, 21; 20:9) It seems appropriate, then, that all who rebel at the end of the 1,000 years be called “Gog and Magog.” As serious students of the Bible, we are eager to find out who will become “the king of the north” in the near future. But no matter who leads the nations against God's people, we are confident of two things: (1) Gog of Magog and his armies will be defeated and destroyed. (2) Our King, Jesus Christ, will save God's people and bring them into a new world of peace and true security.—Revelation 7:14-17.", 10933, "UJEh8mzjaa", -1],

	127187 : ["The words \"knowledge,\" \"truth,\" and \"fact,\" have all been conflated in today's age (the original Greek sense of Truth is \"unforgetting,\" and the original Germanic sense of Truth is \"betrothed\"\"). The word \"fact\" is more like an \"item,\" or a \"thing.\"  So, even though these words are all convoluted, we still have to use them, because those are the only contexts within which to communicate with others. Why should it be up to Christians to reapropriate such weighty and all-encompassing terms? I think, if we are all searching for truth, it is up to all of us to excavate the original meanings and semantics of words. But if you say that no \"facts\" can be derived from the bible, than you also have to concede that none of our knowledge of \"ancient history\" is fact either (Alexander the Great, Greek history, etc) because the source for those \"facts\" come from documents akin to the bible in terms of historicity. Do you honestly think that Plato's Republic is any more historically \"factual\" than the bible just because it was a philosophical and not a religious document? All documents of that age had major agendas, not just the bible. So you have to weigh the bible WITH everything of its time, not mindlessly AGAINST it as if it's inherently \"worse\" and \"less factual\" because its describing a spiritual agenda.", 10931, "None", 2],

	127192 : ["They aren't! “In the beginning God ...” (Genesis 1:1). The Hebrew word for God is “Elohim.” Elohim is a plural word. The “im” ending is equivalent to our English “s.” Now go to John 1:1. “In the beginning was the Word ....” Here we have a being called the Word who existed from eternity. Going on in John 1:1. “and the Word was with God ....” Now we have a second being, called God. They were “with” each other. (Can one person be “with” himself?) Going on, “... and the Word was God.” This is not meant to confuse us. There are two beings, both of which are God. One is simply known as God, the other is the Word. “And the Word became flesh ...” (John 1:14). “The Word” became the Son, Jesus Christ. “God” became God the Father. Still two separate beings. Here's more proof. Look at Hebrews 1:8. “But to the Son He says, Your throne, O God is forever and ever.” Here the Son is called God just like in John 1:1. Now Hebrews 1:9, “You [the Son] have loved uprightness and hate iniquity, therefore God, Your God, has anointed You ....” Notice that Hebrews 1:9 says that the Son (who is God) HAS A GOD! Again, two separate beings. And John 20:17, “... say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and your Father; and to My God, and your God.” The simple answer: They are not the same being. They are two separate beings who are both God and who both existed from eternity. But one is the Boss: the Father, Almighty God. In Christ's own words: “... my Father is greater than I” (John 14:28). And compare John 5:36 “... the Father hath sent Me,” with John 13:16 “... neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.” You are 100% correct when you state: Obviously the “Son of Man” is the Messiah (Jesus Christ) and “The Ancient of Days” who Jesus Christ was presented to is God Almighty.", 10926, "39ru9YoRaa", -3],

Even Dr. Edward Hiscox, author of The Baptist Manual admits that the Sabbath is still binding. “There was and is a command to keep holy the Sabbath day, but that Sabbath day was not Sunday. It will however be readily said, and with some show of triumph, that the Sabbath was transferred from the seventh to the first day of the week, with all its duties, privileges and sanctions. Earnestly desiring information on this subject, which I have studied for many years, I ask, where can the record of such a transaction be found: Not in the New Testament – absolutely not. There is no scriptural evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution from the seventh to the first day of the week.” Dr. E. T. Hiscox, author of the ‘Baptist Manual'. \"To me it seems unaccountable that Jesus, during three years' discussion with His disciples, often conversing with them upon the Sabbath question, discussing it in some of its various aspects, freeing it from its false [Jewish traditional] glosses, never alluded to any transference of the day; also, that during the forty days of His resurrection life, no such thing was intimated. Nor, so far as we know, did the Spirit, which was given to bring to their remembrance all things whatsoever that He had said unto them, deal with this question. Nor yet did the inspired apostles, in preaching the gospel, founding churches, counseling and instructing those founded, discuss or approach the subject. Of course I quite well know that Sunday did come into use in early Christian history as a religious day as we learn from the Christian Fathers and other sources.
