What does matter is that the question was posed TO Sarah Palin, and she failed to answer it. Charlie isn't running for Vice-President, Palin is. So it would hold more weight towards her because she is the one taking the big job. Inclusive in that, it again, proves acceptable that Palin has NO foreign policy experience. If you don't know about the Bush doctrine, how could you run a country on your own if McCain dies in office? You people fail to see this, and making n non-intellectual decision for voting McCain in will just justify the bad decisions that were made when they re-elected Bush for his second term.

Do you shoot him when he exits his house with the gun, when he steps in the street, when he steps on your property, when he points the gun at you or when he pulls the trigger. The Bush doctrine would say when he exits the house with the gun. Now as to Palin and the interview: We should go into Pakistan, Israel has the right to launch preemptive strikes against Nuclear Weapons in Iran, and if Georgia and Ukraine are NATO Members we should abide by our treaty nd defend them when and if they are attacked.

Depending on the length of your hair start with a small blob the size of your little finger nail and make sure you rub it into your whole hand before applying, only apply to your mid lengths and ends avoid your roots completely.    if you would also like to make the most of your curls try applying a wet look gel to combed wet hair to give a nice separated smooth curl. hope this helps", 10744, "yOIB9BvYaa", 0],

It was sealed after he went to see Grandma!  There are about 6 states suing for it.  WHY would he spend the money to fight these lawsuits if there isn't SOMETHING wrong.  As for factcheck.com - it is run by the Annenberg Foundation which Obama has close ties to.   Bergs lawsuit was dismissed because the judge said Berg did not have legal standing to bring the case- NOT because Obama was proved to be a citizen.  Berg has taken this to the supreme courts.

Your question is a good one- you are not a racist for asking it- you are an american and we have a right to know.

Only certified copies are issued to people requesting their birth certificates.  As for Indonesia, neither his mother nor Obama lost their US citizenship when they moved there. The only way Obama could lose his citizenship is to give it up himself and he could only do that when he reached adulthood. Since he was back in Hawaii by the time he was 10, he wasn't considered an adult in Indonesia. As for Philip Berg, yes he is a lawyer and possibly a Democrat.

	123360 : ["For the best answers, search on this site  For a number of reasons, we get a bunch of questions asking what it's really like in SoCal. First of all, I'll tell you what it's NOT like: It's not like anything on TV. People watch shows on TV and think that's what it's like out here. The “Real OC”, Newport Beach, The Hills, etc. Ever wonder why people in those shows never have to pay bills, do laundry, and are NEVER stuck in traffic? Because it's FAKE. And the news doesn't help either, since they know that sex and sensationalism sells. News flash: There aren't running gun battles in the street. There aren't shootouts every day. Also, you don't see celebrities just walking down the street, all glammed up, or sipping a cappuccino at Starbucks waiting to sign autographs. We don't go surfing during lunch hour. Some sections are REALLY nice, others are “ghetto”. Too many people have this vision in their head that LA and Orange County are one or the other (either Beverly Hills or Compton). They either think it is a fairy tale fantasy or an apocalyptic ghetto. In fact, most of it is working class and middle class stiffs working to pay the bills. Like me. The variety of food here is incredible. New Yorkers come here and complain that the pizza is terrible (it's not as good as NY Pizza), but the Mexican food is GREAT here. That more than makes up for it. The weather here is incredible. 340+ days of sunshine makes up for a lot of traffic. You NEED a car to live in Southern California. We don't have an effective public transportation like New York or San Francisco. One reason is that LA is larger in area than either of those, without a central hub. Hollywood is 8 miles north of downtown, and 38 miles north of Disneyland. Average commute is 20-30 miles.. The freeway traffic is probably the worst thing about living here. The 405 is the worst. Know why they call it the 405? Because you go 4 o' 5 miles per hour, and it takes 4 o' 5 hours to get where you're going. Freeway Traffic is bad from 6-10 AM and bad from 3-7 PM. I don't know why they call it rush hour. It's more than an hour, and nobody's rushing, that's for sure. The gangs are the cause of many rumors. Keep in mind that there are gangs in any large town, in every part of the country. In LA, the gangs aren't really downtown, they are in South LA, East LA, and north Long Beach. And here's the deal: Mostly, they just kill each other. Gas is expensive in California. It's about 20-30 cents above the national average. Yes, gas and real estate are very expensive in SoCal. However, this would be the best time to BUY a house because it's a buyer's market right now. There are a lot of foreclosures, and too many houses on the market. If you want to rent, figure on $1200 per month for a 1BR in a decent neighborhood. You need to make about $30,000 per year in order to do that. You can't do it on minimum wage. Yep, freeways are a drag, it's smoggy in summer, and expensive to live here. Yet, if it's so bad, why do we have thousands and thousands of people moving here? Weather, year-round activities, jobs, beaches, mountains, and deserts all within driving distance, and plenty of opportunity for those who have the skills and tenacity. However, it is not for everyone. Every time someone posts this question, you get the LA haters who post their bile and venom. A lot of them don't know what they are talking about. Some people never even visit, and hate it on principle and stereotypes. Some actually visited once, and found out it wasn't like it was on TV, and it certainly wasn't Mayberry. And some actually lived here, and couldn't deal with the expense, the traffic, or the somewhat impersonal nature of living in a large metropolis. It's just the lifestyle here: People want their own private space. It's sort of “you do your thing, I'll do mine”. To those hateful souls I would say “good luck” to you wherever you are, but please don't spew your hatred in this forum. To summarize, it's a HUGE metropolis that really defies easy description. I live in one of the nicer suburbs, but the commute is no fun, often 1-2 hours each way each day. However, 340+ days of sunshine really helps. Yeah, it's expensive. Mrs. Obviousman and I both have to work to pay the mortgage. But is it worth it? Absolutely!", 10749, "None", 0],
