What I mean to say is that wing chun and judo utilize the opponent's force and either deflect or manipulate it in some way to make it so you have the advantage. Even though they focus on different areas of combat, both revolve around the same mindset. So this combination is quite healthy in my opinion. I have never heard of this \"5 years\" rule, but it's true that people are generally discouraged to \"improve upon an art\" simply because if they have the idea they will change everything and not learn a thing about the style's tradition or cultural value. It's better to really understand the art first, then expand it so it suits you, as an individual. But yes, this cross training should be no problem at all since I can't really imagine you getting confused between techniques.

To the young man that asked the question: You're only 13, and I know all of those units seem super cool right now and they probably will when you get older, but you're really too young to worry about the details.
