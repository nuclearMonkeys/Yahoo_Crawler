	54454 : ["Jesus Christ founded one Church, said it was to remain one, and promised that one Church \"The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth\", and \"Whatsoever you bind upon Earth is bound in Heaven\", and \"He who hears you hears Me\". As a result of these divine guarantees of truth, the teaching of that one Church (which includes well over half of all Christians) never conflicts with natural truths revealed by science. Truth cannot conflict with truth. Protestantism of course is a different story. In the few hundred years it has existed, it has fragmented into more than 6,000 denominations, each claiming to follow \"the Bible alone\", yet the beliefs/teachings of each denomination contradicting the beliefs/teachings of the others. Truth cannot contradict truth, so obviously a tremendous amount of untruth is being taught in such unauthorized manmade churches. And therefore it is no surprise that some of these false teachings contradict not only the teachings of true Christianity, but also natural realities clearly demonstrated by science.

	54455 : ["Evolutionary theory involves a combination of many theories, some of which are unarguable, but others that can never be proven scientifically - they are assumptions based on the idea that evolution must be true as it strikes evolution believers as being the only viable theory available. C.S. Lewis explained this difference, and the need to \"differentiate between the popular evolution that is myth, and the real evolution of the biologists. The current evolutionary theories of scientists may yet be shown to be a less satisfactory hypothesis than was hoped 50 years ago, but that does not make it a myth. It is a genuine scientific hypothesis that arose after many observations and calculations. But this biological theorem must be sharply distinguished from popular evolutionism (Developmentalism) which is a myth based on imagination.\" If you want to explore a good Christian explanation of the need to make this difference, read the whole of his paper, \"The Funeral of a Great Myth\" in the book below. Lewis also said, ‚ÄúIf the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.‚Äù¬† Christian Reflections by C.S. Lewis, pp110-123 (Collins, December 1988 edition) As for Adam and Eve, that gives us spiritual light by which to see the significance of the life God created on our planet and with creating humanity in His image and likeness. Humans are unique. None of the animals and creatures God created were given that dignity and unity with their Maker. We did not descend from a slime pond, nor from any low-life-forms. Sure, we share many physical characteristics of mammals, for DNA only requires slight tweaking to make big changes, and God is the originator of DNA. To quote the scientist in the book below:¬† ‚ÄúThe study of genome sequencing in living species, begun in the 1980s, seemed to show lots of 'junk DNA'. This 98% of the total DNA in advanced organisms (to 80% in bacteria) was taken as clear evidence of evolution. It was said to be rubbish left over from failed evolutionary 'experiments'. When automated DNA sequencing techniques became available during the 2000s and it became possible to sequence entire genomes, including the massive, so-called junk ingredient, some curious things were noticed. First came the unwelcome surprise that humans had only 25,000 to 30,000 genes - compared with a similar number in a small plant called Arabidopsis and over 40,000 in rice and poplar trees. It's a bit humbling to think that a city full of human beings has a smaller gene pool than a paddy field. We also now know that humans share 96 per cent of their DNA with chimpanzees (it used to be claimed as 98 per cent). What this proves, of course, is not that chimps are 96 per cent human, any more than rice is 133 percent human, but that genes and sequences as such are by no means the whole story. It is becoming increasingly clear that much if not most of the story resides in the junk DNA.\"¬† So, certain forms of gradual change are evolutionarily true (but not the myth aspect that goes beyond verifiable facts) and the Bible account of Adam and Eve is true - they were directly created by God and we ignore the lesson of life to our eternal cost if we think they were merely allegorical. People who think Evolution requires a simple Yes or No answer betray their deep ignorance of the complexity of evolutionary theories. ¬†", 7585, "0aN1xIxfaa", -10],
