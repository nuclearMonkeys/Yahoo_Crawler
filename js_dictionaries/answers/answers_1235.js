	67291 : ["Victory home-school High School Southfield Michigan 100% graduation and 100% entered University. Spending - $2500 per student per year. It would seem, the less spent per pupil per year, the better the results.  Statistics show, on average,  Students in Private schools do 30 points better on standardized tests, than those in public schools Home-schooled students do 30 points better on Standardized tests than private schooled students. We took our daughter out of public school at age 9 because she could hardly read or write and decided to do it at home. This is a common story with home- schoolers. By the way, she will graduate University next year and has always been on the Dean's List. She now has a 3.7 average.  Look at it this way. Democrats control education in public schools. Democrats are the party of the poor. The more poor people they create, the more power they have. It's no accident kids don't graduate. The best way to create poor people is to under-educate children.", 8419, "261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa", 0],

It's not ALL in the timing but timing trumps the next things on the list, which are: ability to read body language; having a successful interaction style; and being in a mental space to have overcome most emotional issues that formerly prevented timing from working.

I love him telling the governors not to spend stimulus money recklessly, and today China's leaders issued the same warning to him and Congress. It is a little late they have been blowing through money at a record pace since he stepped into the White House ! I am well aware how the Chicago machine operates and like you I know there are a bunch of dirty secrets hidden away or taken to the grave ! He has used and manipulated ACORN and black Americans with his cry of hope and change ,its is amazing how many fell for it black, white and otherwise .

However in some places (e.g., Los Angeles) they don't give a sh*t so they just whine and say it's not their fault. I've seen this in my city also (N. San Diego county). One high school has the gangs and kids don't do well. They don't care.
