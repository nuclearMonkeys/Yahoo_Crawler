	72844 : ["I think Roethlisberger does have the most heart of any NFL QB right now.  The thing about Big Ben is that he has played injured when most QB's would take a few games to sit out.  Playing with injuries is a tough thing to do, and it seems like he has mastered that.  Ben has won two super bowls, and he has done so even when he wasn't at his highest playing level.  When I look back over his career there were two incidents in which his career was threatened.  The first was his motorcycle crash that could have been fatal back in 2006.  The second incident was one of his three concussions in which he suffered this past season.  It was the concussion just before the playoff game.  My point being, he has suffered a multitude of trauma in such a short career yet he has led his team to two super bowl wins.  He's a QB that is unique, tough, and he obviously has talent.  I have seen some tough QB's, but it seems that after a major injury like he sustained, when he comes back to play you would never have known he was injured.  I think he does have heart, and many QB's lack that ability to stay tough.  He's underrated in some senses, but I agree with you, he's one of the QB's that have passion and heart.", 8691, "XLXncQu9aa", 1],

I feel sorry for Shawcross but compared to how much I feel for Ramsey, my feelings for Shawcross are nothing. I do not like these tackles. I understand commitment in the game but sometimes you have to take a step back. Nothing like that is acceptable and I do not condemn any bad tackles because I know how it feels like to have that done to you.

	72860 : ["A 5'8\" 180lb DT is a little ridiculous for varsity high school football. If anything you should slide over to DE, OLB, TE, or possibly ILB. Height isn't a big problem for LB's, but if you got speed then you need to get out of the middle, and I highly doubt any coach who has a clue what he is doing would allow you to continue to play defensive tackle. Nothing against you, but the position requires a bit more height and weight to clog the middle and open lanes for the linebackers. Ask your coaches too, that is what they are there for. Usually they will assign you to where you should play, not you pick and go try it out.", 8695, "L9HkgjOkaa", 0],
	72861 : ["Ben ran a 4.seventy 5 40yd sprint and a 410lb bench press on the coumbine. he's a great quarterback out of the pocket. Many argue that Vick is the final scrambling QB interior the league perfect now, yet Vick only pulls interior the ball and runs. Vick would not shop his eyes down-field the way Roethlisberger does. Vick ran the ball a hundred circumstances this season. i've got self assurance his variety of play is what harm the Eagles in the direction of the tip of the season. He overlooks open receivers and tries to do all of it himself along with his legs.", 8691, "wxXzAv7Jaa", 0],
	72862 : ["Pfft, this is laughable. Roethlisberger has some heart yes, but not the most. Everyone supports the guy no matter what. Having heart is overcoming all types of adversity not just injuries. Let me give you some examples: Eli Manning (all the criticism of New York Fans) Chad Pennington (criticism of New York Fans again, and everyone bashing on his arm strength. That \"noodle arm\" took the Dolphins to the playoffs\" Donovan McNabb (fans booed him on draft day, he survived the Terrell Owens saga, he came back in after being benched and led the team to the playoffs) Kurt Warner (counted out for years, supposed to be washed up, outplayed Matt Leinart for the starting job and took a hapless franchise to its first ever superbowl) Finally sitting out with a sprained finger doesn't equal no heart or toughness, it severely effects how they throw the ball, a backup qb is better than a starter who can't deliver the ball correctly.

Youre saying because he plays hurt or takes alot of hits, it means he has more \"Heart\" than anyone? I don't agree with that. Kurt Warner has played hurt ALOT and won ALOT of games.... Eli Manning Played witha 1st degree seperation IN HIS THROWING SHOULDER! for like 4 games, and went 3-1 one year. Drew Breese is Amazingly Gutty and Tough.... Tom Brady was a 6th round Draft Pick i think, You dont need Heart to get to where he has gotten? Jay Cutler, like me, is Diabetic, You think Playing NFL football while you haveta worry about yer bloodsugar falling thru the floor does not take \"Heart? :...  I mean, Cmon.. it's Subjective.

He said after the AFC Conference Championship he was hurting, ok fair enough. They should have been doing X-Rays and Ben CLAIMED he knew he had broken ribs up to the game. Well then why didn't they find them? Why didn't they do an X-Ray and MRI to find out what the pain was? I mean the team was acting like they didn't know about it UNTIL he said about it. They should have at least known about it, and let him play if he wanted. So my thought is that he is getting out of hand with this.
