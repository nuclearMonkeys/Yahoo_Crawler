	86781 : ["I'm a farmer on a small permaculture farm.  My farm is the idyllic one everyone has in their mind.  Animals in green pastures, a large pond, tree, orchards, no stink, lovely flowers, so on and so forth. Running a farm as a permaculture farm is a LOT of work.  You don't have an off season.  There is always something that needs your attention or needs to be harvested (even if it's just the eggs from the free range chickens). This is not an easy lifestyle.  Yet it's the only one I would choose to live.   I have viewed our current food chain with grave suspicion for years.  Plants and animals are now raised on factory farms.  The plants AND animals are being designed to be harvested and handled almost totally by machine.   I don't want to eat a pig that has spent it's life in an eye searing (because of the amonia stench) piggery, and never been outside, or even had its feet touch the ground, or its nose root in the dirt.  I want a pig that has spent happy time strolling about a pasture, rooting for grubs, and roots, eating grass, feeling sunshine, fresh air, and taking happy dirt and mud baths.   I want eggs from hens that range about, and climb trees in my orchard, clearing them of insects, taking dust baths in a shallow spot next to the driveway, and loosing their minds when they find a fat slug to eat. I want my milk from goats so naughty, and so spoiled, they have followed me into the house when I failed to latch their pen properly. There are six major corperations in the U.S.A. which control virtually all of our food (not purchased from farmers markets).  Those companies own almost all the seed companies.  So even if you purchase garden seeds, and grow your own garden, you are supporting those companies.  Johnny's Seeds, Territorial Seeds...owned by Monsanto.  I could name almost every seed company people are familiar with, and the giant agra business company which actually owns them.  Those companies are putting pattents on seeds, so they can no longer be saved.  Seeds they didn't invent.  They are going to countries far and wide, and collecting seeds indiginous peoples have grown for thousands of years, and then scurry back to the U.S.A. and slap a pattent on them.  Most people think it's only happening to the seeds they put special genes into, but it's happening to every seed they can find. They are moving in and setting up to control the food supplies in other countries.  Because they are \"for profit\" they move production to other countries if it makes them more money.  Then that food must be shipped to the U.S.A. for us to purchase.  The more food the U.S.A. depends on coming from other countries, the less food stable we are.  The U.S. Government no longer maintains any grain reserves.  Our National grain reserves use to make us a powerful country.  A country to be respected, in the case of war.   About 20% of our food now comes from other countries, because of the actions of these mega agricultural companies.  As places like Brazil continue to ramp up and grow more food, it will remain cheaper for those companies to invest in places like Brazil for decades to come.  More and more of our food is going to come from other countries.  The agra business companies have made American farmers virtual slaves.  As a farmer you need to produce more, quicker and cheaper, with more modern equipment in order to compete.  It's driving farmers into more and more debt.  The younger generation is not stepping up and taking the reins.  The average American farmer is now 69 years old!   If people would bother to study the food chain (and it's not hard to do, plenty of information out there) most sane people would freak completely out.  Americans honestly do not realize how close they teater to real and true famine.  I mean famine with people in the U.S.A. starving to death. With the crops being bred so each plant is genetically identical to the other one...well it's just going to take one good plant disease to bring the whole house of cards crashing down.  Same with the livestock.  I just read an interview with Dr. Temple Grandin, PhD.  She states that holstein cows are now so overbred, they are burning out in just two lactations.  That means by the time a dairy cow is four years old, she's ready to butcher.  She's only produced two calves.  That also means if this trend continues there is no way for dairy cattle to even re-gernerate their numbers.  1/2 the calves born will be bull calves.  Even on a well run farm, there is a 10% death rate in newborn calves.  Another small percent of them will be Freemartins (sterile female calves) only good for butcher.  Not every female calf born will be of enough quality to become a dairy cow.   Right now it's not a problem, because there are too many dairies, and too many dairy cattle.  In 10 years however this could become a SERRIOUS problem.  The U.S.A. has really lost its way.  The agra business companies have some extremely dangerous pollitical leverage (both with Republicans and Democrats).   Most people think who-ever controls the gold controls the people.  Not even close....who-ever controls the FOOD controls the people. ~Garnet Permaculture farming/homesteading for over 20 years (and having to fight for the right as more laws are passed by the agra business companies, intended to drive small farmers like myself out of business)", 9245, "eb4c35dafb35b0cdb90317b7fc657b3faa", 3],

In dairy farming increasing profit is driven by good management. I can't vouch for my beef counterparts but you don't make money \"shooting up\" your cows. I've seen my milk being made into cheese. I know there's no additives or drugs in the final product. In fact it's illegal. As far as the whole growth hormone scare all milk has growth hormone in it. It's produced by your body a woman breast feeding is giving her child growth hormone. Corporate farms are suffering in this country just look at California an industry nightmare. Government subsidies are not nearly enough. Prices are controlled by the government for a reason. Uncle Sam rips me off in other words but gives farmers just enough as to not push them under. That's why food is so cheap if you paid the fair price for my milk it'd be $50 a gallon.

Variety of foods is better and modern shipping allows the stores/markets to offer us all types of produce. The world population explosion has caused large corporations and governments to find ways to produce more food and to keep it in edible condition for longer periods of time.  Modern agriculture has expanded the crop yields per acre helping us keep up with an expanding population. There is a lot wrong with our system.  But so far we have been able to keep up with most of the world's needs. For anybody with space to grow food around their house, I recommend a garden for fresh produce and fruit and nut trees too, if at all possible.", 9245, "IVy35SE2aa", 1],
	86797 : ["Although I completely agree that the protection of small farmers should be accounted for, there's a lot of repercussions with \"helping\" small farmers. The United States government currently uses support prices to keep farmers \"alive,\" which means that without government aid, the market equilibrium prices for farm-created products would be too low to continue their standard of living. The government created support prices to force the price of produce, meats, and other products higher than the equilibrium. This obviously creates a surplus, which our government takes the unsold produce and lets it rot in old salt-mined holes. Giving any person or any other country this surplus \"to help out\" would kill the job market for current farmers in both the US and other countries. The sad thing about support prices is that large, corporate farming companies receive all the government aid, while local farmers are continually hurt. This I completely don't agree with, and I believe our government needs to address it. It must also be noted that chicken factories house countless of chickens in one cage among thousands for their eggs and meat, which causes thousands of chickens to develop diseases, sores, and other problems that could be unhealthy to the American public (think of the flu, which all six flu illnesses humans get, birds are get and can spread). This example could be used for cows, sheep, horses, etc. It's also been proven that animals, such as cows, that are fed hormones that adverse effects on both the cows and the humans consuming the meat.

	86801 : ["If that was written by a woman, this was written by a man. Women love to shop. It is the one area of the world where they feel like they're actually in control.         Women especially love a bargain. The question of \"need\" is irrelevant, so don't bother pointing it out. Anything on sale is fair game.         Women never have anything to wear. Don't question the racks of clothes in the closet; you \"just don't understand\".         Women need to cry. And they won't do it alone unless they know you can hear them.        Women will always ask questions that have no right answer, in an effort to trap you into feeling guilty.         Women love to talk. Silence intimidates them and they feel a need to fill it, even if they have nothing to say.        Women hate bugs. Even the strong-willed ones need a man around when there's a spider or a wasp involved.         Women can't keep secrets. They eat away at them from the inside. And they don't view it as being untrustworthy, providing they only tell two or three people.         Women always go to public restrooms in groups. It gives them a chance to gossip.         If a man goes on a seven-day trip, he'll pack five days worth of clothes and will wear some things twice; if a woman goes on a seven-day trip she'll pack 21 outfits because she doesn't know what she'll feel like wearing each day.        Women brush their hair before bed.         Women are paid less than men, except for one field: Modeling.        Women are never wrong. Apologizing is the man's responsibility, \"It's there in the Bible\".         The average number of items in a typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.         Women love cats. Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.         Women love to talk on the phone. A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.         A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, or get the mail.         Women do NOT want an honest answer to the question, 'How do I look?'         Women will make three right-hand turns to avoid making one left-hand turn.         \"Oh, nothing,\" has an entirely different meaning in woman- language than it does in man- language.         Women cannot use a map without turning the map to correspond to the direction that they are heading.         If it is not Valentines day and you see a man in a flower shop, you can probably start up a conversation by asking, \"What did you do?\"         Women don't really care about a sense of humor in a guy despite claims to the contrary. You don't see women trampling over Tom Cruise to get to Gilbert Gottfried, do you?         It's okay for women to kiss each other and not be gay.         Women will spend hours dressing up to go out, and then they'll go out and spend more time checking out other women. Men can never catch women checking out other men; women will always catch men checking out other women.

In a way the lack of such \"honors\" speaks to the modern battlefield tactics we employ, and the great respect for life we have -- even in combat.  No longer do we have Americans so willing to be of that foolish kind of \"bravery\" perhaps best marked by the groups of men during Civil War who willingly walked into withering and absolutely deadly cannon volleys of grapeshot.  Nor do we have what marked the debasement and callousness of  commanders in World War I who ordered masses of men into frontal attacks on  even more deadly withering fire from heavy machine guns. In the eleven years of the Viet Nam War 47,424 Americans were killed in battle, and 153,303 wounded.  In the four years of the Korean War 33,741 Americans were killed, and 103,284 were wounded.  In the fiour years America was in WWII 291,557 of us were killed, and 671,846 of us wounded.  In WWI 53,402 Americans died in battle (and a slightly greater number of sickness off of the actual battlefield) and 204,002 were wounded.  I say \"us\" for only WWII, because that was the last war we fought as a united nation -- in the other wars there were deep divides in the nation about the war,  and the draft was avoided by many, and in today's wars there is no draft.    Since the end of WWII our wars have been fought by and supported by only a subset of Americans -- sometimes the majority, often not.   This is a mixed blessing of a way to fight a war -- clearly the \"fighting\" subset has learned to fight in a way that very much minimizes our losses -- and that also minimizes the loss of civilians in the war zone. IN WWI there were 119 Medals of Honor awarded and 33 of them were posthumous.  In WWII there were 464 Medals of Honor awarded, and 266 of them were posthumous.  In Korea there were 133 MoH awarded and 95 were posthumous -- it is hard to type this without tears.  In Viet Nam there were 246 MoH awarded and 154 were posthumous.   All extremely brave and good men, and my tears all for all who died -- in death all are made equal.   It is clear that Viet Nam was anomalous.  Far more medals.  That war wasn't any worse than the others -- having talked to many vets of all those wars, and remembering myself what it was like from Viet Nam onward -- I'd say WWI was the worst.   Perhaps the number of medals in this War of Terror should be higher, it is low by the macabre calculation of the statistics.  But it is not that low.  To match WWII by MoH awarded against killed in battle  would only mean another 2 or 3 Medals of Honor.   Such a small discrepancy is well within the command judgment.
