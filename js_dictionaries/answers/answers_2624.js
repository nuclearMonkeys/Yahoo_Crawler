No, I think that Bella made up her mind in Eclipse. Everyone would be heart broken if she changed her mind. Besides, Bella isn't stupid. Jake didn't imprint on her, therefore, she knows that it will most likely happen eventually and Jake wil have to leave her, just like Sam left Leah. Since in the first chapter of Breaking Dawn, it said that Jake was in Canada, I think he'll end up in Alaska and imrpint on Tanya. I don't know why, but I have a feeling that that will happen.

After all, someday Jacob will be 'imprinted' with someone that it's not Bella. So even if she would marry him and not Edward, then she would have to divorce when Jacob found his true better-half. LOL. About Tanya + Jacob.... I think it can be possible. But I'm not sure if Jacob will ever meet Tanya unless she comes to Forks cuz I don't think he will travel to Alaska searching for his better-half in an house full vampires. Resuming: Bella + Edward and Jacob + a vampire that could be Tanya. Your theory about the title is pretty logical but here is my theory about the cover: I think the red pawn on the background symbolizes Jacob, the werewolfes, the warm. Don't forget the pawn is the most weak at chess. Then we have the white queen. The most powerful at chess. It symbolizes Edward, the vampires, the cold. The chess board is Bella's life, Bella's choice. She obviously chose to be a vampire since the red pawn is on the background. Jacob is her past. Edward is her future. She's his queen. Check mate.

He claims he was drunk (which is backed up by witnesses in the club) and she was giving him a ride home.  He claims this was all the tabloids blowing it out of proportion for the sake of sensationalism. Then it was reported that Kate has been having an affair with her body guard for some time.  She claims to be horrified by this accusation, and it couldn't be farther from the truth. THEN, Kate's brother and sister in-law (she is the red head Aunt Jodi) went on TV to tell the world that Jon and Kate have been on the outs for quite some time.  That the marriage edited together for the sake of the show is a sham.  This from FAMILY!!  They also said that TLC has trouble getting 15 min of decent footage out of 3 hours of film because of all the fighting between them. So are they really having problems?  Well if they weren't they are now.  But I think they probably are, I mean I've watched the shows from the beginning and could see that they weren't well suited for each other.

They can grow to 18 inches long. It's possible that your fish are fascinated by the bubbles, or that there's a problem with the water quality making them need more oxygen.  Do you have a test kit for ammonia and nitrite?  What are your readings for these?  If you don't have a kit, a pet store can test a water sample for you.  Ammonia and nitrite both interfere with how much oxygen a fish can can absorb from the water into their gills.  And double check the water temperature, because warmer water holds less oxygen than cooler water.  Since your fish are tropicals, keep their water around 76 degrees. Another bit of trouble you'll have with a BioOrb is the shape.  The spherical shape doesn't allow as much surface area at the top of the water as a tank with straight sides.  The water surface is where the carbon dioxide from your fish and oxygen from the air is exchanged.  So there might be more than normal carbon dioxide building up in the water if you have too many/too large of fish for the tank. As a long term fix, apart from keeping the tank understocked or getting a rectangular tank, you might want a fake plant to use in the tube, it will still block the fish from swimming down the tube and will still let air up, but looks better than a piece of hose.  But consider the other possibilities I've mentioned too.  BioOrbs are designed for looks more than for practical fish keeping.", 11344, "YnCUyvK7aa", 2],

	137043 : ["Go here for the best photography course:    You can be like the masses of humanity and buy a camera you can afford that has auto this and that for worry free picture taking. And learn through trial and error how to use something like aperture or shutter priority auto modes or even attempt to use the thing on full manual mode.  You seem to know already there is some thinking to using a camera and to take pictures. A good place to start is by reading the owners manual that comes with a camera. Read the information and look at the illustrations with part names and look at the real camera. Handle the camera and take pictures. Let me rephrase that. Take pictures to learn how to use the camera and maybe even to keep some. Don't start with important stuff you cannot photograph over again such as birthdays, a toddlers first steps. That puts picture taking out of the learning phase and puts the pressure and emphasis to taking pictures for real and to keep.  These first pictures are for you to learn how to use your camera. And you have learned how to use your camera when you can take pictures with it and can teach others how to use it. Honest. You can also go to a college in your area and take a beginning photography course. There you will be taught the basics even a pro must learn and do in their work. Camera handling and use, taking exposures with film and/or digital cameras, and maybe even some photo assignments to get some real time learning. In this learning do not take serious pictures you must keep as that detracts from the learning aspect of the class. Do so only if you have mastered the use of your camera before class is over.  It's like growing up in a way. And I am happy you know there is a way to learn how to use a camera and take pictures. It's like learning how to drive I suppose. Someone can teach you or you can get taught at a driving school. Both will get you a drivers liscense. One though will really teach you the fundamentals you can use for the rest of your driving career.", 11340, "ON8lk0onaa", 0],
