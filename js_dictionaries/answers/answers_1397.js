If there is a gospel written by him it's either locked in the Vatican to keep people from reading the truth or when it is found it's going to be dyamite. Also, maybe it was a personal thing, people at that time didn't write if they didn't have to. Reading and writing were luxuries, those who could were fortunate to be able to. Espcially if you were going to be a rabbi you damn well were taught to read and write. It's also more likely Jesus preffered the oral tradition of debate and talking with the people.

If you study morals, then you're in the field of anthropology, philosophy, even sociology. And these fields do not care about God. You'll never find a serious scholar saying \"I found this so it proves God doesn't exist\" or \"In ancient times they sacrificed children so it show morals aren't from God\". It doesn't make sense at all. In ancient times, men were less morally evolved, had less ethics, they could perpetrate human sacrifice, death penalty for minor crimes, torture, etc. This was considered normal by most people in ancient times. Then changes appeared.  As you say, religion was (and still is?) used sometimes against moral advance, sometimes for. For instance, Zoroaster, the Persian prophet, taught people they had to abolish human and even animal sacrifices because it was cruel. So yes, the perception of what is moral or not evolved. I guess now in the 21st century the question when morals perception is really changing is the question about animal rights. A lot of things are still considered normal, but I guess this will change (like slitting cattle's throast without pre-stunning, etc). But this is a subjetc that has nothing to do with the notion of God.

	75508 : ["1. There are two separate birth accounts in regards to Horus, neither depict a virgin birth: Hathor, the motherly personification of the milky way, is said to have conceived Horus but we are told her husband, Ra, was an Egyptian sun god. Hathor, a sky goddess, was represented by the cow whose milk brought forth the milky way. By the will of her husband Ra, she gave birth to Horus: \"I, Hathor of Thebes, mistress of the goddesses, to grant to him a coming forth into the presence [of the god]... Hathor of Thebes, who was incarnate in the form of a cow and a woman.\" When we examine Isis as Horus' mother, we are told Isis was not a virgin, but the widow of Osiris. Isis practices magic to raise Osiris from the dead so she can bear a son that would avenge his death. Isis then becomes pregnant from the sperm of her deceased husband. Again, no virgin birth occurs: \"[Isis] made to rise up the helpless members [penis] of him whose heart was at rest, she drew from him his essence [sperm], and she made therefrom an heir [Horus].\" 2. Horus was not referred to as the begotten son of God. 3. Meri,' technically 'Mr-ee,' is the Egyptian word for 'beloved' and was apparently applied to Isis prior to Jesus' time, as a title, not as part of her name.  But since there were probably thousands of women between Horus' time and Jesus' with a name or title that was a variation on 'Mary,' there's no real reason to suppose that Jesus' mother was named after Isis in particular. Even if, hypothetically, the Gospel authors themselves fabricated Jesus' mother and decided to name her 'Mary,' it's far more likely that they named her after other women from around their time named 'Mary' than it is that they named her after 'Isis-Meri.' 4. First of all, there is no parallel between the Egyptian name 'Seb' and the Hebrew name 'Joseph,' other than the fact that they're common names. Also, Seb was Osiris' father, not Horus'. 5. This one's true!  But it's not really a comparison to Jesus.  When followers speak of Jesus being of 'royal descent,' they usually mean His being a descendant of King David, an earthly king.  Horus was, according to the myth, descended from heavenly royalty, as Jesus was, being the son of the main god. 6. Horus was born in a swamp, not a cave or manger. 7 & 10. I cannot find this anywhere in the story of Horus.  8. Horus' birth was not announced by a star in the east. Sirius is not a star, but a constellation, of which there are three stars in a row making up the belt of Orion. However, there is no evidence that these three stars were called the 'Three Kings' prior to Jesus' time, nor even prior to the 19th century, for that matter. 9. Horus' birth was actually celebrated during the month of Khoiak, October and November. Though some critics claim Horus was born during the winter solstice, this shows more of a relationship to other pagan religions which considered the solstices sacred. 11. I can't find this either.  12. Three solar deities? Can you show where this is in Horus' story, because I still haven't found it. There were no 'three wise men' at Horus' birth, or at Jesus' for that matter, the Bible never gives the number of wise men, and they showed up at Jesus' home, not at the manger, probably when Jesus was a year or two old. 13-14. I can't find this anywhere! By the way, I thought it was Seth, not Herut, who tried to murder Horus. 15-16. The Bar Mitzvah is a Jewish ceremony in which the young male is initiated into the religious community, according to tradition at the age of thirteen years and a day. How critics relate this to the restoration of Horus' eye is unknown. Also, the Bar Mitzvah is not reported in the four gospels and if Jesus did undergo this traditional ceremony, then he would have been thirteen, not twelve.  17. Jesus worked humbly as a carpenter.  18-21. Horus was not baptized. The only account of Horus that involves water is one story where Horus is torn to pieces, with Isis requesting the crocodile god to fish him out of the water he was placed into. Horus was never baptized. There is no 'Anup the Baptizer' in the story. 22-23. Instead of dissecting this piece by piece, I will simply give each version of events and let you observe the obvious differences. Jesus: After Jesus completes His fast in the wilderness, Satan tries to tempt Jesus by offering Him all the kingdoms of the world if Jesus agrees to worship him, but Jesus refuses.   Horus: During battle, Horus rips off one of Set's testicles while Set, sometimes called Seth, gorges out Horus' eye. Set later tries to prove his dominance by initiating intercourse with Horus. Horus catches Set's semen in his hand and throws it into a nearby river. Horus later masturbates and spreads his semen over lettuce which Set consumes. Both Set and Horus stand before the gods to proclaim their right to rule Egypt. When Set claims dominance over Horus, his semen is found in the river. When Horus' dominance is considered, his semen is found within Set so Horus is granted rule over Egypt: \"O that castrated one! O this man! O he who hurries him who hurries, among you two! These, this first corporation of the company of the justified... Was born before the eye of Horus was plucked out, before the testicles of Set were torn away.\" \"It is the day on which Horus fought with Set, who cast filth in the face of Horus, and when Horus destroyed the powers of Set.\" \"Then [Set] appeared before the divine council and claimed the throne. But the gods gave judgment that Horus was the rightful king, and he established his power in the land of Egypt, and became a wise and strong ruler like to his father Osiris.\" 24. Horus had four disciples, called ‘Heru-Shemsu.' There's another reference to sixteen followers, and a group of followers called ‘mesnui,' blacksmiths, who join Horus in battle, but are never numbered. 25-26. Horus walked on water? No, he did not. He did perform miracles, but he never exorcised demons or raised his father from the dead. 27. It's misleading to equate the Egyptian concept of afterlife with the resurrection in the Christian tradition. The Egyptians believed that to attain immortality, the body had to be mummified, nourishment had to be provided, and magical spells had to be used. The Egyptian concept didn't entail rising from the dead; instead, separate entities of the individual's personality, called the Ba and the Ka, hover around his body.  This is not a resurrection in the same sense that Jesus was resurrected. Osiris was brought to life but he's the king of the underworld. Whether this can be rightly called a resurrection is questionable, especially since, according to Plutarch, it was the pious desire of devotees to be buried in the same ground where, according to local tradition, the body of Osiris was still lying.  French scholar Roland de Vaux, who was director of the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem, said Osiris \"will never again come among the revived god is in reality a 'mummy' god.\" Wagner concurred. \"Osiris knew no resurrection, but was resuscitated to be a ruler of the Netherworld,\" he said. 28. Also, Osiris is never referred to as ‘El-Azarus' or ‘El-Osiris,' clearly an attempt to make his name more closely resemble the Bible's 'Lazarus.'  29. Horus never delivered such a sermon. 30-32. Horus was never crucified. There's an unofficial story in which he dies and is cast in pieces into the water, then later fished out by a crocodile at Isis' request. This unofficial story is the only one in which he dies at all.  33. It has been wrongly taught by some that following his death on the cross, Jesus went to hell for three days. Building on this error, some have even said that Jesus was tormented by Satan in hell in the time between his crucifixion and resurrection.   34. Horus is never said to have been crucified, nevertheless to have died. The only connection we can make to Horus being resurrected is if we consider the eventual merger of Horus and Osiris. But such a theory results in an catch 22, apparently noticed by the Egyptians as they later altered their beliefs to fix the contradictions. In the Egyptian tale, Osiris is either dismembered by Set in battle or sealed in a chest and drowned in the Nile. Isis then pieces Osiris' body back together and resurrects Osiris to conceive an heir that will avenge Osiris' death, although technically Osiris is never actually resurrected as he is forbidden to return to the world of the living.", 8803, "wB3AbJyLaa", 2],
