They were one of the reasons a lot of Wrestling Fans paid attention to Monday Night Raw and at this point, they were the only actual Faction on Raw. Retribution was never properly built up and presented and WWE has been very cavalier in creating and elevating Tag Teams on both The Women's Side and The Men's Side. I think Vince didn't like the fact that Fans were Cheering The Hurt Business as Baby Faces when WWE was presenting them as Heels.", 3891, "sqfjfR3iaa", 0],

Yeah, but people didn't connect with King and blow up twitter because the guy is the greatest wrestler in the world.Â  They did it because they liked what they heard.Â  So that means that Kingston's been able to talk me into a building and himself into a job.Â  That's something impressive that I don't think anyone else out there is capable of right now.", 3892, "7sa6B6Qhaa", 1],

	24527 : ["Well that's not surprising coming from the guy that said AEW tag team division is the best that wrestling ever seen since 80's AJPW. I believe he also said The Young Bucks vs Omega/Page is the greatest tag team match of all time. The old man either lost his mind and forgot the long history of classic tag team matches or this obssession with Omega got to a point where it's clearly getting ridiculous. If you see the rating on Cagematch(dot)com the match got mixes reviews.

The Jim Crocket Promotions user is a guy i at times disagree with, however with some of his answers I've actually watched some brilliant wrestling and will be a shame not to read his answers. Candle is another cracking user and similar to JCP after reading their answers I've found some cracking wrestling Spyro asks the sort of questions that send me down memory lane and I've re-watched some classic matches after his questions.
