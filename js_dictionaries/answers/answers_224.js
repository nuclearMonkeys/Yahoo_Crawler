Minorities simply cannot maintain the same standards as whites on average and giving them more numbers and more influence over our society will surely water down and degrade the level of civilization we have.  I think most white Liberals do not live around a lot of minority groups so they only see the highly curated version of them on TV and not the true nature of them. Whites in Mississippi and Louisiana that are in very close proximity to a lot of blacks are very Conservative and I think that's a big reason why.

	11222 : ["In the UK, real actors don't train to become a screen actor.Â  They train to become an actor - all types, including the stage.Â  To get a good agent you have to graduate from a top drama school - not some minor school or college.Â  Agents simply aren't interested unless you've graduated from RADA or Central, Guildhall, the Royal Welsh, etc.Â Â  You're being wildly optimistic, anyway.Â  It's extremely unlikely that you will ever get a good role in anything - ever.Â  That's what happens to 99.9% of actors.Â  If you're good, talented, versatile and graduate from a top drama school the best you're likely to get is about ten days' paid acting work a year and even that's in small roles in small productions.Â  You'll need to work an ordinary job alongside acting your entire life just to afford a place to live and enough to live on. The chances of you, or any other aspiring actor, becoming famous is microscopic.Â  I don't know what you mean by 'national TV shows'.Â  If you mean reality TV, quiz shows, etc, they'd be a waste of time.Â Â  But your main priority is to get the right training.Â  Many small acting schools make all sorts of boasts about their previous students, getting directors and agents to see showcases, etc, but they're almost all scams.Â  Be very careful. Good luck!", 1851, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 4],

	11227 : ["It's not. You just don't know what that word means. Cons consider any other group gaining any influence in society besides white, straight, men a threat.", 1842, "5tj60KUXaa", -3],
	11228 : ["Feminists claim it is about equality, but feminism has been a driving force for theÂ  legalization of the following sexism and double standards (reverse the genders and ask a feminist, such as those on this board, if they think it would be ok) - It's all about a mothers rights, but no fathers rights. Women being treated like princesses in prison and men being treated like animals. Female prison guards humiliate and degrade men with strip searches, shower supervision etc, but female prisoners get privacy and respect from male prison guards. Bodily choice for women, but forced genital mutilation for boys, referring to women's rights to their bodies in terms of abortion, but boys being circumcised without choice. Female reporters and staff allowed in men's locker rooms, but privacy and respect for female athletes. This is the definition of feminist equality. Is this an example of the respect that feminists claim MEN don't have for the opposite sex? Its women getting everything in a divorce, and men being torn away from their children Female sex offenders being slapped on the wrist, but male sex offenders being incarcerated the rest of their lives Its men being sentenced to more time for the same crime than women. This can be researched under the US government and shows that women don't get held accountable to the level that men do. Women having the right to use the men's room, but a man who walks in to the women's room is arrested for being disrespectful and perverted. Men use urinals, but that's still not enough for women to have basic respect for men's privacy. Its a feminized education system that cripples natural behavior of boys, makes being male a crime in school, then girls claiming they are smarter. Why is it when two people under the age of consent have sex, only the boy is charged with doing something wrong? Its women being allowed to drown five children and using the fact she is a woman to get away with it - Andrea Yates Its women being allowed to use domestic violence as an excuse to murder a sleeping husband, even though there is no evidence of domestic abuse - Mary Winkler Its the extensive abuse of restraining orders to vilify an innocent man and get leverage in a divorce. A restraining order against a man can be served even without his knowledge or an opportunity to defend himself. Its men being jailed for defending themselves against an abusive wife, but called a wimp if he takes the abuse Its women demanding respect from men, but never having to respect them in return Its women having the choice between abortion, adoption, dropping an unwanted baby off at a hospital, raising the child with a father, or raising the child without a father, but the only choice men have is to agree. Its 3 innocent Duke Lacrosse players losing their lives because we don't ever think a woman could lie about rape - let alone prosecute her for doing so. Its women labeling men as abusive when the US government has shown women cause more child abuse than men. Its female rape being horrendous, but male rape being funny and made in to comedy movies. Rape is a legally accepted part of the justice system, but only against men. Its just about every TV show being allowed to humiliate and degrade men, but women complaining and calling it sexist if they were treated the same. It's more health care spending going towards women's health than men's. Breast cancer receives 7 times the funding of prostate cancer. There are three departments of women's health in the US government, but none for men. However, men live an average of 5 years less than women when the genders used to have the same life span. Its allowing women only clubs and banning men only clubs It's doing everything we can to help girls in math and science, but letting boys fall further behind in everything else.It's defining equal pay for equal work as men playing five sets of tennis, but women only playing three. Maybe women claiming 3=5 is the reason for the above point Its cutting men's sports in college in favor of women's sports that have no interest Its female murderers being mentally ill, but male murderers just being evil Its claiming men walk out on their family when its actually women who file 80% of divorces Its men being portrayed as evil, stupid or buffoons on TV and all women being perfect or superior.Its women wanting equality for their gender, but men being called chauvinist pigs when they want equality for their gender Its fixing the education system when girls are failing, and blaming the boys when boys are failing Its women being allowed to level false accusation against an innocent man without consequence. Read Duke Lacrosse and many other examples. Feminism has installed this right to women through the courts. Its a man being a chauvinist, sexist pig when he doesn't respect women, but a women who doesn't respect men is an admirable, strong and independent woman. Women remove male role models from their sons' lives, then when their sons behave badly, the women blame \"patriarchy.\" Stereotyping girls as inferior to boys in any facet of life is \"misogyny\"; stereotyping boys as potential batterers and rapists is a public service announcement. If a man wants sex more often than his wife is willing to give, he's selfish; if a woman wants sex more often than her husband is willing to give, he's selfish. Married men who have affairs are selfish pigs; married women who have affairs are seeking the fulfillment they are not getting in their marriages. Women insist their husbands assume the responsibilities of being a full parent, but as soon as a woman files for divorce, he is just an ATM. Its feminists not being able to provide one example of legal discrimination against women in the US today.", 1842, "0598aff171be5b3a01a9295637d229edaa", 2],
