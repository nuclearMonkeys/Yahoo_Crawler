Remember: sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1, so sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x cos^2 β - sin^2 β = cos^2 β - (1 - cos^2 β) = 2 cos^2 β - 1 2. cos[pi/2 - x] = sin x and sin[pi/2 - x] = cos x You can show this easily in two ways: i) Expand by using cos(a+b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b, and sin(a+b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b ii) Imagine a right-angled triangle, where the angles are x, pi/2 and pi/2 - x. Then you can easily see that cos[pi/2 - x] = sin x and sin[pi/2 - x] = cos x. So then, cos[(pi/2)-x]/sin[(pi/2)-x] = sin x / cos x = tan x by definition. 3. sec^2[pi/2 - x] - 1 = 1/cos^2[pi/2 - x] - 1 = 1/sin^2[x] - 1 = (1 - sin^2[x]) / sin^2[x] = cos^2[x] / sin^2[x] = cot^2[x]. 4. sin x (1 - 2cos^2 x + cos^4 x) = sin x (1 - cos^2 x)(1 - cos^2 x) = sin x (sin^2 x) (sin^2 x) = sin^5 x 5. Remember that sec x = 1/cos x, and that ln(a/b) = ln a - ln b. ln(sec θ) = ln(1/cos θ) = ln 1 - ln(cos θ) = -ln(cos θ) [because ln 1 = 0]. Hope this helps :)", 11054, "Ftxnrusraa", 0],

This should be memorized: cos (x+y) = cos x * cos y - sin x * sin y This should NOT be memorized: cos (x-y) = cos x * cos y + sin x * sin y It's too easy to get it wrong.  To derive cos (x-y), simply take the first equation and replace 'y' with '-y': cos (x + -y) = cos x * cos -y - sin x * sin -y Then from your unit circle, replace cos -y with cos y, and sin -y with -sin y: cos (x + -y) = cos x cos y - sin x * - sin y Cancel out the negatives, and you get your identity: cos (x - y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y You can also quickly derive cos 2A from this, by simply setting x = y = A.  Try to limit the identites you memorize...all those +/- signs will confuse you at test time! To answer your question, just add those two identities, and cancel out the stuff, and you'll be able to get 2 cos x cos y. Another form of this equation is: cos x cos y = 1/2 * [cos (x + y)  + cos (x - y)] It converts a product of cosines into a sum of cosines.   One other tip in trig in general...remember that identities go BOTH ways!  This may seem trivial, but it's important.  It's easy to see that cos (45 + 30) = cos 45 * cos 30 - sin 45 sin 30.  But you can also put things back together.  If you ever happen to see a problem that asks you to evaluate cos 10 cos 20 - sin 10 sin 20, don't try to evaluate sin 10!  Stuff them back together to get cos (10 + 20).", 11056, "PsCCd63yaa", 1],

Giovanna can of course be shortened to Vanna if you liked that one. Vanna Marie flows very nicely although I've never been the biggest lover of Marie in general. Vanna Grace sounds lovely though, I like it a lot. Vanna Belle? That would be so so cute! I wouldn't use Vanna personally but it would definitely work if you were brave enough to try it. 6/10 - just because it isn't my personal preference. Haven - 3/10. I've never really loved virtue names, with the exception of Hope and Grace. I think it would date very quickly and wouldn't age well, but would be so lovely whilst they were still young.  Aubrey - 4/10. I've never heard this being used as a baby name, I always associate it with older people. I'm beginning to really love Audrey though (especially with the association of Audrey Hepburn!) If it were me, I'd pick Audrey over Aubery. Sofia - 9/10. I love this name! My personal preference would be it to be spelt Sophia though - to fit with the conventional spelling of Sophie. Sophia Bow would be the cutest name! Brennan - 3/10. I don't really like boys names ending in an 'an' sound. I don't know, that's just me. Easton - 7/10. I've never heard this one before, it isn't very common here in England at all. It sounds very strong and masculine though - which I love for boys names. Gavin - 2/10. I really don't like Gavin but only because it has negative connotations for me. Aiden - 3/10. I'm not to keen on Aiden as well. I don't really like the 'Brandon' 'Braiden' 'Jaidon' trend at the moment, but that's only my opinion. Sophia/Sofia with the middle name Bow is so beautiful, in my opinion, and Easton with the middle name Alexander or Fletcher would be perfect I think.
