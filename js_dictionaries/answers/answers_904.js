Experience is the culmination of practice, and the frequency of use creates and reinforces familiarity.  And regardless of how much anyone knows about any one thing, we're all human and we all keep references a click away, as it were.

However: it could be that it is programmed in such a way that a specific combination of software and/or hardware cause the problem ***that could be taken into account and remedied at the web site end of things***. For example: loading fonts can be very time-consuming for a mobile device and so if the web site uses non-standard fonts mobile devices, especially those with slow connections and/or slow processors and/or limited RAM can take a long time to load a page. The solution in that case would be to NOT USE fonts that need to load.

If you invest time in learning and practicing, money for refined educational materials and classes, and put in the hard work, then you can most likely do it. But you would need to at least honestly enjoy, if not have fun, not only programming but also learning. I've been a professional developer for over two decades now and learning is a HUGE part of the work.  So is actually enjoying it. There are two parts of the industry that don't necessarily care about any of that: 1.) corporate programming; 2.) contracting mills. The first generally requires either a college degree in computer science, or a different college degree and enough experience that suits the work. The second varies, but a lot of them go with the quantity-over-quality mode of operating.  Their developers are able to hack out a working program as a team, but it generally won't be pretty, built to grow on, readable and sometimes won't be correct at all. No, it's not too late.  There's plenty of room for new developers in all kinds of companies as long as you can develop sufficient skill to get hired.  That's pretty much how all job training works.

Chess engines, simulations, and certain types of math also require or benefit immensely from large working sets in memory. Servers can use gigabytes or even terabytes of RAM without ever displaying a GUI. On the contrary, accessing and displaying the data requires almost nothing hardware-wise, ASCII or graphical. Dumb terminals, X terminals, and thin clients can be way weaker than computers that need to process data locally.

	50291 : ["Keep in mind that programmer usually were using internet before you (or your parent) ever heard of internet. I am 48 yo. And I had internet at school, and then at every places I worked. Not with google at first. But there was NNTP. Those were really the days. Because all forums in the world were centralized using not a single server (far from that), but a single protocol. So everything that was ever told publicly by anyone on internet was accessible in a far more structured way than google is, even today. If you had a question about C, you knew that the answer was either in comp.lang.c newsgroup, or was nowhere (nowhere on internet. As other said, everything about C was in Kernighan/Richie books anyway). So you could easily search exhaustively for the answer to your question. And then, if you didn't find the answer, ask the question. Back then, people were more rigorous on the \"netiquette\". And it was, even less than today, appreciated if you asked a already solved question. You'd easily be yelled a \"RTFM\" or \"do a research\". But that was justified by the fact that there was, indeed, a FM, and very powerful and comprehensive way to do the research. Those nntp group still exist, btw. But now, they are just one of the many sources. So, you are stuck with google. And google search syntax is easier for non-computer versed people sure, but far less powerful. With DejaNews (my favorite search engine for nntp) you could type a search request so accurate (with parenthesed booleans expressions, including word proximities, variants, distance, ...)  that you always had the guarantee that the first answer was the one you were searching for, or that this answer was not yet existing. Also, the absence of google made  back then less possible to not have a manual. There was a man page for everything. Officially, that is still the case. So, for someone of 48 yo, who started programming at a normal age, answer is \"we always had google, or things even better than google\". Now, I am somehow an older programmer than a 48 yo programmer, because I started really soon (I wrote my first hello world at 7. And my first code, a \"butterfly chase game\", at 9. Which made me start programming almost at the same date as a 60+ yo programmer has). And for that \"self taught geek kid\" phase of my life, yes, indeed, there was no google nor anything equivalent. But as other have said, there were books. If you have the opportunity (maybe it is available online), you should have a look at ZX81 user manual, for example. Nobody writes manual like that nowadays. And it was supposed to be just a user manual. Which explained the principles of interpreted language, all the syntax, and the internal organization of memory for hackers, the reference of Z80 assembly language (tho you needed another book to really learn assembly. But it gave pointers to needed books. I still remember the confusion in my parents mind when I told them that I wanted \"Programming the Z80\" by Rodnay Zaks, in English - and as you have already guessed, I am not an English speaker - for my 12th birthday).
