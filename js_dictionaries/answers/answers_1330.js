The amount of people that rush out and replace their TV's just because of the change is going to be very minimal.  you state that 118,094,097 households. you can subtract the 70,000,000 households that use a cable service and have a cable box. that leaves about 50 million households. subtract another 16.5 million for Direct tv users  we are at 33.5 million now. 10 million households have satellite service  now we are at 23.5 million 1.4 million are expected to switch to a cable provider with a cable digital cable box. So lets say we are at 22 million households without some sort of conversion box that will need to do something in order to continue getting a signal. some of those household though already have TV's with built in converters, that number is hard to calculate because you don;t know if they also have cable box or not, so for the sake of this we will say they still need a box. There were also 52.5 million HDTV's sold in the US that do not need upgraded 16 million last year alone. If the trend were to continue we could say that another 16 million will buy new HDTV's this year. so lets take that 16 million from the 22 million and we only have 6 million left. With the government issuing coupons for the convertes the average price will be about $20 for a converter. that is $120,000,000 in sales but you need to subtract out the cost of mkaing the units about $40 each, which are being sold very cheap probably below cost becuase of the coupons and now we are at -$120,000,000 See I can play with numbers too! ;)", 8666, "7e89fa6f2e57944021665c19869379d7aa", 2],

Can you explain it to me? 2) Hi, my name is Ford Prefect. And yours is? Well on earth/sol/3rd rock from sol the predominate species of moderate size is humans. And humans tend to want to know all the answers, and many want to feel like they have them all. So all these \"religions\" are just trying to explain what happens when you die. Essentially we can try and figure everything else out in this physical world through testing, but death. So we make good educated guesses, some people agree, some don't , but for some reason, I'm not aware of, people get very angree about what they do not understand or can not. Most humans will try to either sell you on a belief system out of fear or out of reward. I don't really play the game though. I feel if you believe something you don't have to tell every person you meet what to believe in to prove you believe it. So take a look around and try to figure it out for yourself.  3) Hi, my name is Ford Prefect. And yours is? Well if you came here to figure religion out, you should hope back on that spaceship and check Alpha Centauri.  4) Hi, my name is Ford Prefect. And yours is? No offense, but your species has been around long enough to one, travel distances that are almost un imaginable to humans, have the ability to live forever, and can understand any language on earth. You had all that time and you were able to not kill yourselves. I would ask you, why are you here. You should be telling us what religion is. On earth we have so many religions and have always been on the brink of destroing ourselves. You have lived at least twice as long as our species and yet seem very open minded and peaceful.

	72122 : ["I really like this question. It's one I've thought about now and again.  Once when I was not doing well financially, I got charged the wrong amount at the supermarket. Should have been charged more.  I didn't say anything. I said to myself God is giving me a gift because I need it.  The other day I got charged not enough in the pharmacy, and I said something.  Then I started wondering why I said something. Maybe I could have gotten away with it.  I was kidding with the clerk about it, and she said she could have lost her job. Then I was glad I said something. I would like to have pure ethics.  My parents did, and both of them were atheists. No one in my extended family ever talked about being honest b/c of the fear of going to hell. No one believed in hell, but they did believe in honesty and that lack of honesty hurts people in general.  I think that's right. Our survival depends on society working well. The fact that our country is doing so poorly is in large part due to people's dishonesty.   Shocked when I first learned how (mainly Republican) politicians are bought by corporations. Capitalism does have many good points, but doing \"anything\" to gain more money, including lying in advertizements, I think it harmful to all of us.   The bigger a society is, the harder it is to see the harm you do when you are dishonest.   Here's my answer for how I am these days.  I will accept non-earned money once in a while. But I will not do it as a regular thing, as with never paying for my electricity. That's too much dishonesty for me to face.  But you know what? I'm also wired to not want to get caught and honestly I can't always tell the difference.   I'm a spiritual person who believes there is a power that created all of us.  I do not  believe in hell, but I have learned that there is a way we are shown, after death, what we have been doing in life that is wrong, dishonest, uncaring, disloyal, cheating, lying—any of the sins.  It's not going to be \"fun\" to have to learn more about this in the Afterlife, and HAVE to face our own \"evilness\" mild or deep. But it will not be everlasting suffering and pain. No way do I believe that any Creator would do that to his little frail, fallible creations.

	72128 : ["The most immediate effect is that melting sea ice in the Arctic increases the amount of solar radiation absorbed in the Arctic ocean, accelerating overall warming. The melting of land ice raises sea level. The mass transfer from the poles toward the equator measurably slows the earth' s rotation, this amounts to a day length milliseconds longer for a complete melt. Isostasy allows the land formerly covered by ice to rebound as the pressure is released. This has allowed certain areas in Scandinavia tor rise by a meter or more in historic times. The flooding of low-lying coastal areas is far more extensive, with a worldwide sea level rise of half a meter expected in around a century most river deltas in the world will be inundated.  An average seafloor depth near 4000 meters means relatively little effect from the added water pressure over it, changes in surface ocean currents from modification of nearshore topography will be  far more noticeable.", 8665, "0d5bc00f2df886644bbb5ea16ee41246aa", 0],

These are the current ice sheets and the water volume they are storing: Location	Volume - (km3) - Potential sea-level rise, (m) East Antarctic ice sheet - 26,039,200 - 64.80 West Antarctic ice sheet - 3,262,000 - 8.06 Antarctic Peninsula - 227,100 - .46 Greenland - 2,620,000 - 6.55 All other ice caps, ice fields, and valley glaciers - 180,000 .45 Total - 32,328,300- 80.32 Sea level would rise more if the ocean temperatures continued to rise.   To get a perspective of what parts of the globe that would permanently flood, you can use this interactive map and enter your own assumptions about sea level rise.  This version only goes to 60 meters but you can get the idea:  all of the Florida panhandle, all of NY/Long Island, Houston, Sacramento Valley, ... all permanently flooded. To put some perspective on the timing of that, sea level is currently rising at 3.1 mm per year mostly from the oceans getting warmer (thermal expansion).  But a massive melt leading to 60-80 meter sea level rise is a real possibility, not in our lifetimes but within 4 or 5 centuries.  The risk in this century is 1-2 meter rise. Polar ice also significantly affects weather patterns.  Such a massive melt would cause major changes in weather and ocean currents (would would then further change weather patterns).  Already with the large reduction of Arctic ice we are seeing changes to northern hemisphere weather patters.  The jet stream has slowed by 14% in recent years and become wavier, carrying blizzards further south more often and causing more heatwaves elsewhere.  The theory that the changes in the jet stream are directly caused by declining Arctic ice has gained wide acceptance while having been proposed as current reality only 4 years ago.", 8665, "GTkKN0KFaa", 0],

For sure we all know why we are here.....despite the fact that 'anyone' unimaginably fixated in malice and hostility can intermix with those who simply want to peacefully share and learn by laying down their cards right on this public table.  As everyone thinks his right of freedom, some go as far as 'hacking down spirits', or go havoc slashing hearts----with their crude sense of freedom....and 'fun'. (I can imagine them now grinning over the thought of winning their fictitious battle.*lols*)  On the side of things, let's pity the kind of 'cleverness' they boldly exhibit.  As ably they could hide from one mask to another, their hearts might ever be nakedly cold.  And how 'sad' could that be?  They might be 'suffering' from things we'd never come to know.....because they wish their doors and windows closed.   They might not even be realizing that they are bedding on their own vomits? They might be screaming frantic with the frightening image they see in their mirror?  Maybe,.....they just couldn't comprehend themselves, and are too alienated on how wonderful it is to-----really LOVE one another? Blessings come in different mysterious ways, dear Lorrs.  Let's not give up hoping for a bright dawn after a darkest night.  Nothing defeats good.....not a ton of gruesome letters.....Not even a million thumbs.  Let's leave them with their 'momental feast'.....till they're done......as we move on with our internal peace----over cuppas of strong faith. ((((((((((hugs my dear Friend and friends))))))))))) PEACE to ALL!", 8668, "u20splgNaa", 8],

But all have a chance to air views and ask valid questions about the views of others. We all have ideas and opinions that may get someone to actually think about their own train of thought and how it fits into the main stream of reasoning. Each of us is unique in our thoughts and ideas, you might read something that makes you think, why didn't think of that or boy, that guy is really off the wall. Another way to look at it I suppose is maybe group therapy for bored people.", 8669, "deBNMNBlaa", 0],

There's no real point in asking legitimate questions on this board. You either have cheerleaders or doomsdayers for whichever policy or idea you discuss.
