	62055 : ["Not sure about my all time favorite, but whenever I see a question about \"Who's your favorite character\" my mind usually think of Kuroro Lucifer from Hunter X Hunter... Personality : Quiet, doesn't talk much... introvert. Born to be a leader. Cares for his friend (nakama). He even cried after he read his prophecy that one of his nakama already died. Physical/appearance : Has some sorta 'cross tattoo' in his forehead. He has Black hair. Usually comb backwards, and sometimes forward to hide his 'cross tattoo'. Black eyes (he kinda wear eyeliner, not sure), black long coat... with a symbol of cross (upside down) on the back.  Interest : Book, he loves book. Ability : He can steal other person ability. He'll keep all the ability into one book called 'Bandit Secret'. Although he must go through some rules (that really hard to fulfill) before he can steal and used the ability he stole. Not quite remember what is the rules but if I'm not mistaken; 1. Must witness the ability with his own eyes. 2. Must ask the user about his/her ability and get a correct answer from them. 3. Must place the user palm on his Bandit Book. 4. All the requirements must be fulfill within one hour. The ability he stole will never be used again by the former user. Once the former user died, the ability will never be used again by Kuroro. And oh, he's a villain... one of the main villain in HxH... Bonus question: If your still in school what are your classes? No, I already finished high school. I'm on University now...  Computer Science Engineering. Major in IT. Class? Not quite remember what subject I learn for the past 3 years... Ummm... Programming (obviously, in each Semester) Software Engineering Digital Logic System Software Management Information System System Analysis And Design Mathematics and Statistics Quantitative Analysis Database and Data Communication Computer Networking Data Structure Web Application Computer Organization and Assembly Language UNIX Operating System Uhmm... there's more but as for now, that's all I can remember... :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: After finished school/High school \"School is like a lollipop,  it sucks till its gone..
