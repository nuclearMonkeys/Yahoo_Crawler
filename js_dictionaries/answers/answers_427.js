	23425 : ["That crash -- Ethiopian Airlines -- is the combination of several factors. 1- a bird hit one of the angle of attack sensor, which then started reading wrong 2- the aircraft does not have the optional \"AOA disagree\" warning--it was even suggested that the AOA disagree warning was not even functional 3- the 737-MAX has a system called MCAS that is supposed to make the plane 'feel' like the 737-800, despite having more powerful, heavier and differently placed engines. And to prevent the plane from stalling, that system relies on a single AOA sensor, which happens to be the one hit by the bird. 4- because the system was meant to be transparent, pilots were not trained and perhaps not even told about it being there. So there you have it: a poorly designed system, lacking redundancy, getting compromised data from a defective sensor without the crew having have the training, and perhaps even the knowledge of what that thing was doing.", 3746, "aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa", 4],

	23427 : ["The plane that lost both engines in New York and landed in the Hudson river was an Airbus A320, not a Boeing 737, but that's beside the point because an incident like that could have happened to any commercial airliner.  How does it happen? Well, you have to understand how a modern high-bypass turbofan engine works. It has a core in the center that uses a turbine to spin the entire engine, the center of the engine has multiple compressors that compress air as it comes in, and blows it out the back of the engine at high speeds. But most of the air that goes through the engine bypasses the center compressors and is blown through the engine by the large fan blades. (thus the reason its called a \"high bypass turbofan\" These engines are used on modern jets because they're the most fuel-efficient design available.  The fan blades are strong enough to withstand the impact of most small birds. Small sparrows and pigeons just get shredded and blown out the back without causing harm to anything except the bird. But Canadian geese can weigh 15lbs or more. If one of these is sucked into the engine at high speed it can crack the fan blades. Once the blades are cracked they are spinning so fast that centrifugal force will cause them to come completely apart. Once you have a few broken blades the center of gravity of the engine will be off-center. This imbalance will cause the engine to vibrate so hard that it could damage other components or completely destroy the engine if the bird strike didn't already render it useless.  Normally if this happens to ONE engine the pilot would declare an emergency, shut down the damaged engine and fly back to the airport using the remaining good engine.  The Hudson river miracle was the extremely rare case where the plane flew right through the middle of a flock of birds so that both engines were damaged beyond function. It also occurred at a very low altitude which gave them very little time. Had this happened at higher altitude they might have had enough time to glide back to an airport. But then again birds don't usually fly that high.", 3746, "Jvx658HFaa", -1],

	23468 : ["One major reason that they look so good is because you're watching hi-def content on a very small screen (compared to *any* regular TV display). At that size, slightly soft images look sharp simply because they're below the threshold of what you can see.  Your small screen phone is also capable of varying the brightness of almost every pixel; most TV displays cannot do that and instead rely upon a single backlight for the entire screen. If you want to recreate that then either an OLED screen TV or a far cheaper non-OLED model is capable of that if it has “local dimming”. The latter feature does not alter brightness for individual pixels but for groups of pixels instead and the effect is good enough almost all of the time.  Strictly speaking, a 40” screen when seen at normal viewing distances is too small for the vast majority of people to see the difference between regular 1080HD and 4K.  That difference is not usually noticeable until you get to around a 56” screen. But if you're a “pixel peeper” or sit closer then you may well see the benefit of a 4K screen. I'm unaware of any 8K screens at 40” but pixel peeper or not you certainly wouldn't see the benefit of that over 4K at just 40” or even at 56”. Not least because 8K isn't that much better than 4K: to double the linear detail resolution would need 16K. So just look for a 4K OLED or a 4K local dimming LED model. Note that OLED screens still have a much shorter predicted lifespan than LED screens, and on some ex-display and new-ish secondhand OLED TVs the colour gamut is already noticeably less vibrant than when they were new. But that fault is not considered to be screen failure. One of the biggest differences between cheaper TVs and decent brand name models is the quality and design of the remote control and the TV operating system. Last year I bought an LG model for my wife: the screen and sound quality are outstandingly good. But the LG OS is simply awful as is the design of the standard remote and also the expensive upgrade alternative LG “Magic Remote”. Not really a problem for us now that we've adjusted the TV settings to what we prefer as we only use that TV with an Amazon Fire 4K TV Stick. ", 3752, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],
