Someone is hit by car or bullet, then their organs are harvested and sent abroad. Holy hell mRNA vaccine by Moderna contains *Luciferin* dissolved with *66.6* ml of distilled *phosphate* buffer solution. ...mark of the beast...that's what it is... all vaccines are chipped all vaccines have cells of aborted fetuses in them Police stop you at checkpoint to check if you're chipped (aka vaccinated) Police check the car; let's say 4 people car but signal only from 3; so, police stop it to chip the notyetchipped; signal from 4 now and police let the car go. This is prophecy by saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov. Notice police chip (aka vaccinate) people at gun point in Africa; so, no more \"it's not gonna happen here\" 'cuz it will soon enough, capisce? Police do it on highways or when you leave your city... basically, you can't leave your city unless you're vaccinated; but vaccine = mark of the beast; so, escape now while your city doesn't have these rules; forgive me. Gov't sprays chemtrails so that people feel symptoms of flu 5G will kill vaccinated; just read Georgia Guidestones' commandment of 500 million max population on earth; it fits with Orthodox Christian prophecy of 7 percent of people left Russian Orthodox prophecy also says that there will be unbearable stench in winter. So, there you go. Russian winters are cold. So, they must have died from the new disease that doesn't have a name 'cuz it's caused by 5G. martial law; Constitution was suspended; New World Order read Book of Revelation; Chapters 13 and 14, please chipped people will be influenced by super computers to receive World Passport (grey plastic card with no name on it), but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays If you escape mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to permanent heaven how to escape it? by hiding within a small group (10 - 15 people according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov); no documents; no electronics Project Pogo = Alex Jones, QAnon, Adam Green, etc. videos are put out so that gov't tracks who watches them.

The rest of the people will be secretly (or even openly) chipped when they sign up for food in closed stores AI (artificial intelligence aka demons) will post on your social media as if it were you doing it while you're on vacation; it will even make phone calls on behalf of you; no one will notice that you're missing in action.", 3665, "None", -1],

The plague throughout Europe starting in the 1300's through late 1600's. That's over 300 years. It came and went and continued that cycle. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. It went on for a few years. The AIDS pandemic from 1978-present. There has never been a vaccine or cure. Move forward and there have been several diseases that would have been pandemics were it not for medical experts and Scientists. Then here we are in 2020 with the corona virus pandemic. It's still here, getting worse and we won't really know 100% how it's going to effect people 2, or 3 months from now.

It might give you 8 years of \"green\" transport, but you still need to supply the power (usually at night when solar energy is not available), so that power will be from Nuclear power or Coal - a long way away, and there are transmission losses to get that power to you.

ADDED:  2 thumbsdown???  Really??  Do you not know what a \"hybrid\" car is???  Is your brain so misconnected that you cannot extrapolate that a car with all the parts of a conventional car PLUS all the parts of an electric car has more parts to fail/maintain that a conventional car or electric car????   Aren't there any people on YAnswers who have completed more than the 3rd grade?????  Why can the idiots just keep their mouths shut about things they know nothing about ????????????????????", 3651, "None", -2],

	22724 : ["Probably never. Hydrogen fuel cells are in effect chemical batteries.  They produce electricity which is used to run an electric motor. Producing hydrogen from water takes electricity.  Because of the laws of thermodynamics, we know that it takes more electricity to produce the hydrogen than we can ever get back from the fuel cell. If you have enough electricity to produce hydrogen, you already have enough electricity to power the car. The only reason to have this kind of multi-stage system would be if the electricity comes from something like solar cells, and you're using water and a hydrogen fuel cell instead of a traditional battery to store that solar electricity.  Unless the combined weight of all the stages is less than with batteries, it would only waste energy. ------ That's not to say that you couldn't do it.  It's just that it's a losing proposition for anything commercial.", 3653, "tsgP2JfBaa", 5],

	22728 : ["If you google the etymology of these words you'll typically find that they're derived from older words with a pronounced \"ch.\"  For example, the etymology for \"fight\" is as follows: \"Old English feohtan (verb), feoht(e), gefeoht (noun), of West Germanic origin; related to Dutch vechten, gevecht and German fechten, Gefecht.\"  The reason for dropping it is presumably that the German \"ch\" sound does not exist in English. Most native English speakers will replace it with an \"h\" sound if it precedes a vowel and drop it if it follows one as in these words. More generally, spelling inconsistencies in English exist because it was originally a synthesis of older versions of French and Dutch, two languages with very different spelling systems, and it took many centuries for spelling to become standardized. This was further complicated by the many words borrowed from Greek and other languages. And the pronunciation of words changes over time as well. Your English seems pretty good to me btw.  ", 3656, "9FiDGerlaa", -1],

	22730 : ["Living off the grid is harder than it seems to those who have not done it. First things first, all the land on the entire planet belongs to someone or some entity (a corporation, a government, etc.). Squatters are not welcome, even if they have no ecological, visual, or other impact. You can't just pick a remote place and live there. Second, growing or gathering the food you need to live as a vegan is not easy. Have you ever farmed? Gardened and lived only on what you grow? Plenty of bugs and critters will fight you for every bite. In fact, for anyone contemplating this, I urge you to move to a place that's warm enough to grow crops year-round (Florida, southern New Mexico, Arizona, California, or Texas) and plant a sustenance garden. Six weeks in, don't buy food, living entirely on what you grow. Other problems you can anticipate but not easily solve are building a shelter that's impervious to whatever the weather brings using only the materials at hand, preserving food, getting clean water, and the usual pests of people living rough: rats, mice, fleas, lice, and ants. I have a relative who lived in what amounted to a floored hut in Costa Rica while she brought fresh water to a village that had one well, as the leader of a Peace Corps project. She, too, thought off-the-grid would be an eco-challenge and do-able. She was really miserable, though, usually too hot or too cold, often wet, insects in her food, rats in her home, not enough clean water for a proper bath, books molding from the humidity.
