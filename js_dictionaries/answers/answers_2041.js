	107808 : ["If the adage 'opposites attract' holds true, then the love match between a Cancer and a Capricorn has sure shot chances of success. In most of the areas, the personality traits of both the individuals do not match. Capricorn believes in having a practical approach towards life, while Cancer lets his heart and his emotions rule his life. The latter is extremely compassionate and too much affected by the situations affecting other people's life. The latter, though considerate, never goes over the board and can maintain a detached outlook. The Crab may also not be able to understand the ambitious nature of the Goat and think of him as too impersonal and distant in a relationship. In order to make these differences act as balancing each other, both of them need to spend time understanding and appreciating one another. As far as the positive aspects of this match are concerned, both the individuals are consistent and believe in loyalty and faithfulness. With time, they may start appreciating each other's viewpoints and develop a strong bond. But, they need to communicate a lot. Cancer Man and Capricorn Woman Good for short term flings, this match does not reflect too many signs of long-term compatibility. After a great initial start, the hiccups that dot the road become quite difficult to handle. A Cancer man and a Capricorn woman will always hold great attraction for each other, the tough part is to make that attraction last. She may become frustrated with his habit of retreating into a shell every now and then. Lots of understanding, communication, patience and tolerance are necessary to make this relationship a harmonious and successful one. Cancer Woman and Capricorn Man A Cancerian woman will have to coerce the Goat out of his hiding, so that he expresses his feelings openly. If she fails to do this, she will be living with a guy who loves her a lot, but is never ever able to tell her so. Even his too practical approach towards life will make her feel high and dry. On the other hand, he will not be able to understand her excessive emotions and compassion for others. Still, if both of you manage to respect each other's opinions, viewpoints and way of life, this match can turn out be a strong one.", 10020, "None", -1],
	107809 : ["The serious answer is that compatibility is based on mutual attraction, similar interests, and a willingness to proceed with a relationship openly. Astrology has no basis in reality- it is a 'pseudoscience' with absolutely no merit. So if one goes around expecting to be compatible or not based on the positions of certain heavenly bodies (really think about this- kinda silly??) , than it will be very difficult to find someone.    Here's an example. I know a guy who is HUGELY into astrology and does everything based on his 'chart', including girlfriends. I mean, he is mathematical about it, really hardcore, as \"accurate\" as anyone could think of being. So he met a girl, did their charts, and went ahead with a relationship. So according to him, they were totally compatible, and everything pointed to them being together. After a year or so, they split up. So, if the charts were correct, why did this happen? Did he not see the breakup somewhere along the line? And if so, then why did he even start seeing her?  Here's another example. Years ago, in France, a psychologist did an experiment. They put an ad in the pper, asking for people's birth info, saying that a free chart would be done. So they got a lot of responses, and the readings were sent. Almost all the people, like 98 percent, said that it was very accurate. Sounds good, right? The thig was, they sent everyone the same chart! Not only that, it was the chart of a serial killer.  Listen, I am not saying any of this to be mean or hurtful. It's just that people often believe in things simply because it is fun, or popular, or it seems to make sense and explain things. But tht does not mean that just because a lot of people believe, that there is anything to it.  There is a really good book in the library on skeptical thinking, called 'The Demon-Haunted World', by Carl Sagan. It is really interesting, and one thing it talks a lot about is astrology. If I was to base my life decisions on something like astrology, I would at least want to investigate if there is actually anything to it, wouldn't you??   Good luck with your relationship.", 10020, "None", -2],

	107836 : ["It is foremost that you be warned: Don't let this guy worm his way into your heart.  Once he's done that--you're a prime target to be used up by him.  Prison inmates thrive on the kindhearted so they can secure a steady pipeline of $$$$ and in some cases, drugs.  You can be no helpful friend to this guy by showering him with $$$$ or risking your freedom by breaking the law yourself.  The \"situation\" is far from bleak for this guy. Convicted inmates have an uncanny knack for finding God while they are locked up. You can bet he's got several \"jailhouse lawyers\" busy filing trial appeals and sentence reduction requests---most of which are paid for by your tax dollars!!!  And the chances are pretty good he will get his sentence reduced. Your tax $$$ is keeping him medically treated and medicated for his mental illnesses.  And he's being well schooled by his fellow con artists and scammers on how to work the SSI (Social Security) system in his favor when he does get released. Not to mention he has free access to educational programs--many of which allow him to master a job skill or trade that he can apply towards getting a job that will secure him a decent job. But all this offered help is only good if he WANTS to make himself a better person: that's the big secret of rehabilitation!! Your \"schizophrenic/bipolar\" friend may be a alcohol and/or drug addict (as most all prison inmates are) and those are challenges he may or likely may not be successful in controlling.

Capricorn and Cancer may work out to be a good match, since Cancer can help Cap to tap into her emotions and Cap can provide much needed stability for Cancer to take root in.  Both of you have Moons in the feeling signs, which means that both of you react to matters of the heart in a dramatic and very sensitive/emotional manner. The male Moon sextiles the female Sun which is a positive sign, as there will be easy communication between the two. A good sign is that both parties' Mars and Venus placements are in the watery signs, which indicates very strong and harmonious sexual attractions between the two. An especially good sign is the male Mars which conjuncts the female Venus in Scorpio. This is an excellent indication of long-lasting attraction between the two, although they do have to watch out for the Scorpion intensity and jealousy in love affairs.

	107846 : ["If nobody answers your question that would prove its veracity LOL. Well, in truth some research suggests that there is a relationship between brain neurotransmitters such as dopamine or serotonin and the desire to exercise. Also, there is ongoing research that suggests some people may have a genetic predisposition towards being more sedentary.  Also, some research shows that our ancestors were prewired towards impulsivity b/c they had to meet their physiological needs in a short amount of time through activities such as hunting. Many psychologists believe that procrasination is a largely the result of the possibility of long term planning. Knowing that doing something in the future will not generate immediate feedback is less motivating than something that will be instantly gratifying. For example, many people would rather play video games than study for an exam that is months ahead. The often heard quote is that necessity is the mother of invention. Well, I would say that laziness is the mother of invention. After all, the idea behind modern technology is a way of doing things that requires less work. It is in human nature to find a shortcut.  Therefore, while laziness tends to have negative connotations I would argue that it is not entirely detrimental if it inspires someone to do something great. I do not agree that human evil can be equated with laziness. This is a logical fallacy. This is like saying if some people are evil and some people are lazy than some evil people are lazy.
