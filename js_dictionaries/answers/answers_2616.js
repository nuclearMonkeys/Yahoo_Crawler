	136653 : ["I would not be surprised if Christian would win his title match. Well why? Edge has retired so that would be on of the reasons for why Christian would win the WHC title, to give fans a good impression on Christian. BUT its not only one of the reasons for why Christian will WIN WHC title, people who think Del Rio is going to win DO need to realize that it's not just a typical ring match, its a LADDER match! Christian is uncrushable in ladder matches, he is as good as Edge, I mean how many ladder matches has Christian had in his career? Lots and lots of them, he has a big advantage over Del Rio in a Ladder Match, its obvious that Christian is gonna win , When Teddy Long said there is gonna be a match Del Rio vs Edge at extreme rules, its gonna be a ladder match advantage to Edge, so is it advantage to Christian? Yes it is, and Del Rio was very upset ladder match at Extreme Rules :P  The other reason is also that WWE , wanted Christian to turn heel and take WHC title from Edge at summerslam, so its obvious that Christian would be next WHC champion anyways, that's why they made the match now, since Edge is retiring, they are going to have Chrstian as new WHC! Christian has never held world heavy weight title here in WWE, so he does need to get a push! Yes Del Rio has never held either here in WWE, but he got his big push here, he won the biggest Royal Rumble in history of WWE, he got his Wrestlemania match what else do you want? Christian hasn't gotten any push , any title match ( Extreme Rules is the first one) so give him a chance to become new WHC! Del Rio will get his chance he is only 33 years old and Christian is 38, who knows maybe he will be retiring soon.... ? Give him a chance while its not too late.. :P If John Morrison will win WWE title tomorrow that would be very very strange. I would be like WTF man, loll :P Because if you think properly, first of all the one who should of been there in a story line is R-Truth. And then the next Raw he got his chance to become new WWE champ, John Morrison came out to face him where he won the opportunity to go to Extreme Rules to face Cena and The Miz! So now that R-Truth is heel and so mad at Morrison, we will definitely will see him coming tomorrow to Screw up Morrison. But if that would really happen that Morrison would win, then I can only see it like John Morrison is climbing on the top of the cage, R-Truth comes out with the chair starts hitting the cage with the chair so Morrison wouldn't be able to come out but Morrison wouldn't give up and would just have to jump from the top of the cage to the floor and R-Truth hitting him and Morrison becomes new WWE champ :P So basically if Christian wins I would not be surprised, if John Morrison wins I would be like WTF like how did R-Truth didn't screw up Morrison lol, but Morrison does deserve a big push in WWE :]", 11327, "None", 1],
	136654 : ["I saw the card for Money in the Bank on July 17, 2011, and it says John Cena vs. the Miz for the WWE Championship belt. So, unfortunately, that means the Miz will more than likely win at Extreme Rules tomorrow night (05/01/11).  Yes, I will be definitely glad if Christian finally wins the World Heavyweight Championship belt.", 11327, "l0mS5Rqqaa", 0],
	136655 : ["I want them to win tomorrow, I think John Morrison deserves the WWE title because he has earned the right to compete in a championship match.

It was amazing) Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Jericho WM19 Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle WM21 Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit WM20 Shawn Michaels vs. John Cena WM23 Shawn Michaels vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin WM 14 HBK vs. Undertaker at WM 25 & 26 So yes, he has done plenty of significant things at WM so Idk watchu talkin 'bout willis.
