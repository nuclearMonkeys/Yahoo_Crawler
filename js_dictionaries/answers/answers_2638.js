	137729 : ["Get.a rap name. Names like Sean Combs (Diddy) or Shawn Carter (Jay-Z) just don't fly in the rap world. Think of a rap name that incorporates something from your name, lifestyle or biography to add a little mystique to your persona. Think edgy and catchy to find the right name. Step 2 Hone your battle skills. Rap battling is one of the best ways to innovate new beats and lyrics in a pressured environment. Many of the top rappers started out as master battlers, so start battling in your community to get your lyrics rolling off your tongue. Step 3 Make a demo tape. You can rent a public studio for a fairly reasonable amount of money to lay some tracks down. Get a solid mix tape and use your friends and family as a test audience. If you know some other aspiring rappers, ask for help in the production of the tape. Step 4 Publicize your material. Give your demo tape out to as many people as possible. Try attending rap events and clubs where you can drop your tape off with the MC and DJ. Also, take advantage of Internet outlets like MySpace and YouTube to get your name and style out there. Step 5 Keep going even when it seems like the odds are stacked against you. Not only did it take most successful rappers much longer to reach their goals than they initially thought, but many of their most difficult times produced their best material. Stay in it, keep innovating beats and rhythms and take heart in the process of becoming a hip hop success.", 11368, "None", 1],

But from most studies done thinner people have more trouble aging generally than people with some extra subcutanious fat. Like you said: more to work with, i guess. BMI is not an accurate scale to go off of on a personal level, it is only to measure changes in population weight and does not take many factors into consideration.

He gets his @ss kicked everytime and he still wins!!! that's not realistic. When I think about Cena I can only remember 3 moves: F-U (now called AA), STF and 5 knuckle shuffle. I don't think he has 28 moves... He said on RAW that he let the people down by letting Batista win the WWE Title. He let me down since the day he became the marine.

Neither does hip tosses and back body drops that everyone uses. His mic skills are great, when he was a heel. His mic skills now as a face are pretty bad.
