	42797 : ["That's hard to answer because I build my own desktops. 12 years ago I built a system with a Core i7 920, 6gb of DDR3 RAM, and a Radeon 4830. That system still runs but now it has a 6-core Xeon x5680, 12gb of RAM, and a Radeon RX 580. I have a newer system but I still use the old x58 system. Since I learned to build and upgrade desktops, if something isn't running the way I want it to then I'll upgrade it. For desktop computers, Things are somewhat different now because they're not Black or White compared to 15 or 20 years ago. Back then everything came with only 1 core and RAM upgrades were more limited. Nowadays you might be able to upgrade to a CPU that has more cores and some systems that are 10 years old top out at 8gb of RAM. The advent of Solid State Drives has also helped a lot. Somewhat Sadly, you can upgrade a 10 year old midrange desktop and make it run better than a Brand New Entry-Level Desktop. That goes to show how stagnate the PC hardware market was between 2011-2017.", 6203, "None", 0],

	42801 : ["If you already have a Wii U & no interest in getting a Switch, go ahead & get Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Wii U as it's a great game that breaks some of the Zelda traditions. If you're planning on getting a Switch, you might want to wait... mostly to avoid double-dipping unless you really want it on both (You do you here). Twilight Princess & Wind Waker HD are pretty good as well the other Zelda titles that are available on the Wii U through the Virtual Console service (Skyward Sword, Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask) that are not available on the Switch at this time. I will note that there's a post-game area in Twilight Princess called the \"Cave of Shadows\" that can be access with the Wolf Link amiibo.  If you can make it through all 40 floors, whatever health you have left (as you'll be able to save your status on the amiibo) will become Wolf Link's Health in Breath of the Wild when you scan that amiibo. Wolf Link in Breath of the Wild serves as a helper character (like a loyal dog, albeit from a different but parallel universe / time line / ect.).  They'll attack enemies nearby, provide some defense to Link & search for hidden treasure.  Once their health is exhausted, they'll disappear & cannot be re-summoned for the rest of the day (at the game ties amiibo scans to the current date).", 6205, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 0],

	42803 : ["Assuming that you have a desktop, not a laptop yes, increasing RAM to the degree you describe is usually fairly inexpensive. (Usually < $50 to add 4 GB of very high-quality RAM to your existing system) Although laptop RAM can be more expensive (depends on the system) it's still very much less expensive than replacing the entire system. Yes, increasing RAM from 4GB to 8GB should certainly significantly improve the performance of Windows and specifically the performance of high-performance games on the market. I would recommend upgrading to 16 GB if the price is not beyond your means. (Note: MORE than 16 GB is, according to current experts, of no value for current games.) 16 GB of very high-quality RAM typically costs < $100. You will need to know your system specs specifically: - what type of RAM it accepts (probably 288-pin DDR4, but check anyway) - what speed of RAM it accepts (it should accept a range of different speeds, and I warn that the top-speed RAM is typically very expensive) - how many RAM sockets your system has", 6206, "g9g3fOYyaa", 0],
