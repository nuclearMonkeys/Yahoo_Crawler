We all inhale different volumes of air. For example, a man 2 m tall is going to inhale far more air than a neonate. So do your research and find the mean volume of air a human inhales in a single breath. Now, you have your data all you need to do is crunch the numbers. It is straightforward arithmetic so I shall leave it to you. You simply divide the volume of the atmosphere by the mean volume of air a human inhales in a single breath. The quotient will be the approximate number of breaths available in the atmosphere. We do not inhale only.

Liechtenstein and I think Luxembourg are holdovers of the old disunited states of Germany.  They were the only parts of the old Holy Roman Empire that didn't unite into the German Empire.  Andorra I think was just a small independent country between France and Spain that (unlike Navarre and Bearn) wasn't absorbed by either one.  San Marino, like Vatican City, is a holdover from the unification of Italy; they're the only parts that didn't join the united country.", 755, "P8dIznazaa", 0],

	4496 : ["If I understand correctly, you want a light to automatically switch on when it is dark, and switch off when it is no longer dark. And you are wondering how to prevent the light to switch off as soon as it has switched on, since when the light is on, it is no longer dark anymore. Usually, 1. Either you do what is takes so that your sensor does not receive the light from your lamp. This is what is done in street lamps, whose sensor are above the light (when they are not just triggered by a clock). 2. You use a Schmitt trigger. So that when light intensity (I) is under a threshold (I₁), the light switch on. And then when intensity is over another threshold (I₂) it switch off. The whole point of Schmitt trigger, is that I₁≠I₂ (I₁<I₂). That would also work for things like street lamps, because the artificial light is far dimmer than the natural one. So even with light on, intensity is way lower than when the sun was up. So you have a margin to have I₂ bigger that I₁, bigger than intensity of your lamp (I₀), in fact bigger than I₁+intensity of lamp, but still lower than sunlight. Then, when sunlight is <I₁, lamp is switched on. Intensity is then just above I₁ + I₀ (sun was just above I₁. And you add your lamp light I₀). Which is not enough to trigger lights off, since I₁+I₀<I₂. Then the sun continues to set, until intensity is just I₀ (the one from your lamp), then the sun rises again, until Iₛ+I₀ reach I₂, and your light switch off. (And then intensity is just Iₛ, since the lamps are now off. But that is still more than I₁, so the light do not switch off again). 3. If you have variable light, you don't really use your sensor to switch on or off the light. You use it in a PID control loop to control the intensity. If intensity is bigger than the target, you slightly lower the light. If it is above your target, you slightly increase it. Using a PID. You won't get \"money in shower\" effect (a monkey in a shower would burn itself, then decrease water temp and freeze itself, then increase water temp and burn itself again, ...) because PID are meant to avoid that.", 733, "d3cd3e0f2e8feaaff79363574632bf96aa", 0],
