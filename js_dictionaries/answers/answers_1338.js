If there is a soul, it is a mistake to believe that it is given to us fully created. It is created here, throughout a whole life. And living is nothing else but that long and painful bringing forth. You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life. Above quotes all by Albert Camus Here are two poems which may bring comfort. 1) If If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream and not make dreams your master; If you can think and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: \"Hold on!\" If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And which is more you'll be a Man, my son! Rudyard Kipling 2) Two Days We Should Not Worry There are two days in every week about which we should not worry, two days which should be kept free from fear and apprehension. One of these days is Yesterday with all its mistakes and cares, its faults and blunders, its aches and pains. Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control. All the money in the world cannot bring back Yesterday. We cannot undo a single act we performed; we cannot erase a single word we said. Yesterday is gone forever. The other day we should not worry about is Tomorrow with all its possible adversities, its burdens, its large promise and its poor performance; Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control. Tomorrow's sun will rise, either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds, but it will rise. Until it does, we have no stake in Tomorrow, for it is yet to be born. This leaves only one day, Today. Any person can fight the battle of just one day. It is when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternities Yesterday and Tomorrow that we break down. It is not the experience of Today that drives a person mad, it is the remorse or bitterness of something which happened Yesterday and the dread of what Tomorrow may bring. Let us, therefore, Live but one day at a time. Author Unknown", 8683, "None", 0],

Ensure the Hard Disc Drive is not damaged or faulty. Solution - Run CheckDisk: a. Start> Computer >select C Drive>Right Click C Drive>select \"Properties\">\"Tools\" > click \"Check Now\"> Select both boxes and click \"Start\". b. This can take a long time, so let it complete (may take all night or longer. Be patient.) 1. Do a disk Clean Up a. Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup (click to open); b. Let the utility analyze and report what space can be recovered; c. Check the boxes of the items you want to remove so the space can be recovered (if you Hi-Lite each item, a description of it appears in the \"Description Box\"). 2. Get good Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware programs (AVG is good for Anti Virus, but so is Microsoft Security Essentials; MalWare Bytes is a good, free anti malware program -- see links below. Get Malware Bytes and install it. If you are going to change AV, remove the old one first). a. Download any needed anti malware programs and install so you end up with one Anti Virus and one AntiMalware program b. Run a complete (full) SpyWare scan (MalWare) and handle whatever it finds. c. Run a complete Virus Scan and handle whatever it finds. 3. Next, ensure the Registry is clean and the disk's clutter is also cleaned out. Solution: Get and run a good registry cleaner. a. Check to see if there is a registry cleaner already on the system; b. if none, get CCleaner at the site below c. Run the Registry cleaner till it finds and corrects all errors d. Run the \"Cleaner\" to analyze the disk and see what it finds to delete and then delete the files that are not needed (most of the files it finds are unneeded, but look through the categories to be safe). This cleaner is more thorough than the Disk Cleanup above) e. In CCleaner, under \"Tools\", go to \"Start Up\" and look over the programs that start up on your PC. You may see a lot of programs that simply do not need to start up when you first boot up your PC. Disable these and leave only the essential ones (if not sure, note down the program name and then try to open it up via  Start-> All Programs. If not essential, disable them). These are big \"RAM Eaters\" and many times are not needed at start up -- if you do need to use them, you can start them up as needed. 4. Run a good disk defrag. If you use the computer more than occasionally, the built-in may not cut it. Consider downloading a free trial of a third party commercial defrag tool. Third party programs are more robust and many work in the background so you can use your PC while defragging. Most third party programs offer a free, fully-functional trial (the better ones are for 30 days). Below is a recent Top 10 Reviews side-by-side comparison of the best defrag programs available. a. Select a program and install it. The better defrag programs are automatic and the top placers in the above review can defrag while using the PC. The top placer was completely transparent and it was the only defrag program that prevented fragmentation (see the review). You can get a free trial for the gold medal winner via the review or at the site listed below. b. Defragment your disk drives. The best defrag programs are very fast. You will be able to see the progress and with the gold medalist, you can use the PC while it is working with no problems. Good luck to you! Bill R TechSpec ...", 8685, "AA11307736", -1],

Edit: Ya no, people should really know what they are talking about before they give someone a thumbs down. Dogs and Apples Will Apples Poison the Family Pet? Many people like to give their dogs apples as a treat, and many dogs like the treat. Still, there's a lot of information about apples that says they will poison the dog. In general, apples are harmless to dogs. However, there are a couple of things to be cautious about: the seeds and too many apples. The Seeds Apple seeds contain amygdlin, a form of cyanide, which is very poisonous to every living thing. Cyanide prevents the blood from carrying oxygen throughout the body.  If the dog swallows a few seeds, the body will detoxify itself. Actually, the dog must ingest large quantities of apple seeds to do major damage. Also, the cyanide is within the seed covering, and if the covering isn't broken, it will pass through the dog's system intact. Sort of a no harm, no foul situation.  So, if you're going to give your dog apples, core the apples. Then, cut them into bite-size pieces and feed the dog this way. This may seem overly cautious, but why take the chance.  The Good Things Apples are a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin C as well as low in saturated fat and sodium. Some believe that vitamin C can help hip dysplasia, a common ailment in large and large, purebred dogs. Saturated fat contributes to heart problems. Apples contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which contribute to a healthy, glossy coat and help to control skin allergies.  Too Much of a Good Thing On the down side most of the calories in apples come from naturally occurring sugar, not processed sugar that might be found in other treats it's true. Still, sugar is sugar, so it can contribute to weight gain in large quantities.  Also, apples contain calcium and phosphorous, so if your dog has kidney trouble, don't give him apples. Too much calcium and phosphorous in the kidney are indicators of kidney stones and early- to end-stage kidney disease. Be careful of omega-6 fatty acids because they can cause inflammation, which wouldn't be good for an arthritic dog. They also aren't good for dogs with kidney disease. The apples themselves don't have that much omega-6, but if the dog gets it from other sources, it can be a problem. Eating too much apple can loosen a dog's bowels, and you don't want that. How much is too much depends on the dog, so show caution. Don't fear apples as a treat for your dog. Just remember to core the apple, so those pesky, poisonous seeds get thrown away. Keep the portions a reasonable size, and the dog's coat will gleam, he won't have diarrhea, and he'll be one happy camper.", 8682, "f5wRhbpuaa", -4],

I used Defraggler for a long time but it's pretty slow and I stopped using it. How often to defrag? Once per week should be enough. Other products to go with Ccleaner include: CCEnhancer:  System Ninja:  Comodo System Cleaner:  Slim Cleaner:  I use them all but with the last two on the list some cleaning features are a little too aggressive to use if you are not technically minded.", 8685, "j9HUIOL3aa", 0],
