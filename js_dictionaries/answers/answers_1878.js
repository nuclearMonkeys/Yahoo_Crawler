	99638 : ["To Catholic Crusader: Dawkins has already tackled Aquinas.  Here is my personal response: \"The first and more manifest way is the argument from motion. It is certain, and evident to our senses, that in the world some things are in motion... it is necessary to arrive at a first mover, put in motion by no other; and this everyone understands to be God.\" Sorry, but physical laws control motion, not independent beings. He's equating Physics to a god -- and it sounds like Spinoza's god.  \"The second way is from the nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes...Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God.\" Yet again replacing natural processes explainable by science with an appeal to the supernatural (and a specific god, no less). Assumptions from a man who lived in a universe his society did not understand... \"The third way is taken from possibility and necessity, and runs thus. We find in nature things that are possible to be and not to be, since they are found to be generated, and to corrupt, and consequently, they are possible to be and not to be...therefore we cannot but postulate the existence of some being having of itself its own necessity, and not receiving it from another, but rather causing in others their necessity. This all men speak of as God.\" I have no idea how this man was considered logical or how his argument in any way, shape, or form supports the idea of a god, much less his specific Christian one.   \"The fourth way is taken from the gradation to be found in things. Among beings there ...therefore there must also be something which is to all beings the cause of their being, goodness, and every other perfection; and this we call God.\" Aquinas wins my medal for best rationalization...on the slimmest of assumptions.  \"The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack intelligence, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result.\"  It's called nature. Looks like he was observing at least a bit of the natural selection found in nature.", 9708, "midmBgJJaa", 1],

Adults that propagate the   myth know that it isn't real (in my view, they are liars to their children). On the other hand, people that raise their children with religion generally aren't trying to deceive their children - in their view, they are educating them.
