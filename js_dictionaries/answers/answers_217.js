	10867 : ["So what is your credit rating?  How much cash can you put down? Because while many landlords might be OK with working with a vet who has no rental history and no job, a lot of them are going to be leery of renting to someone with such vague plans, if they can't pay up front and have poor credit.  If you have it, you might consider negotiating a rent reduction in return for money up front (all in writing of course.) One work around for such things is to enroll in school first, as then you're a student with bad credit and they're used to that.  You also might think of doing what most students do and sharing a house, subletting a room.  Look at the job market (including the effects of covid) and consider what you can afford with temp work, then make a plan for what happens when that is drastically cut. Consider your backup plan for when one of those room mates flakes out. And yes, you should talk to the military transition teams, they have a lot of resources and a lot of advice on making this go smooth for people who don't have someone to support them while they look for work and a home.  There are a lot of resources there for the asking.", 1769, "lMtLhjrcaa", 1],

Gather all the Canadian documents that you have and that expired passport and go to the Canadian Embassy, but if that is very far from where you are now, then go to the nearest Canadian Consulate.  Be frank and to the point; just ask them for help to leave Germany to return to Canada. Ask them to provide you with a new passport or a certificate certifying that you have a Canadian citizenship so you can travel back to Canada.
