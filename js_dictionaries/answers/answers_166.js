	8302 : ["I had a dream when a cousin died that I believed to be a premonition. The day before his death I had dreamed a guy who I had gone to school with had died. Everyone around me was crying and upset. As I'm sitting in a chair this guy who I assumed was the classmate that had passed away was standing in the doorway. His face was covered by a shadow but as I kept looking it looked nothing like my old classmate, this person had dark hair, different build. I wake up and the dream bothers me for a little bit but I soon forget as the day goes on. The next day I get news a cousin died in a car crash and that's when I remembered the dream, the hair and stature just like my cousins. I really believe that was who it represented. Very strange and I've never experienced anything like that since", 1331, "iebf89yYaa", 1],

	8307 : ["For most of my early years, I kept getting a certain type of nasty bully enter my life (Not the same person, but all with the same trait) . They'd say really nasty mean things to me. I'd go home so upset and even lose sleep wishing I had 'said this/said that'. As I got older, I did think of something to say back, but didn't because I didn't want to hurt their feelings (??!!)  This went on for a few more years, And then it hit me - why should I care about their feelings when they clearly didn't care about mine?!! The first time was the hardest, but it got easier the more I stood up for myself. Ever since, I notice people with this trait don't come into my life anymore. I think it's 'lifes' way of teaching us to overcome these problems by having them repeated until we do. ", 1332, "9kBqoZYmaa", 0],

	8312 : ["Curious, you absolutely have to do the research. Marli's advice is, as usual, solid. I strongly advise following it for what happens to your character physically. I'd also advise reading accounts of people who had similar experiences but lived. My understanding is incomplete, since I've never researched it, but it's supposed to be not all that bad. Only you, of course, know your character well enough to guess how he will react to both the physical aspects as well as his rapidly approaching death. Some people would be stoic, others hysterical. He might easily go through the seven stages of grief.", 1334, "dYA8AerXaa", 4],
	8313 : ["In the toilet. He'd been feasting heavily on boiled eggs and unripe bananas all day and he was very definitely all \"clogged up\" but, no matter how hard he tried - and he tried! - there was no way he was going to \"unlock that passage\" and \"ease the journey\", so to speak. But, with a firm resolve he acted and, shortly, the offending badboy was released into the pearly waters of the Mediterranean where, apparently, it became a danger to shipping.

	8325 : ["It's a total scam. Reviews can easily be faked.  And of course they seemed friendly!  They want your money! It takes many years of good quality acting school and more years of stage and film experience, as well as huge talent, for anyone to get an agent and get any real auditions.   Any company advertising like that is simply trying to get lots of money for as little effort as possible.", 1339, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 3],

Most people who don't rate Lord of the Rings read it too young the first time so all they got was a Boy's Own adventure and miss out on the nuance and that's too bad for them but no skin off my nose.   Every genre has good and bad writers.  The thing with readers is that they can put up with mediocre writers as long as they love the genre but in order to cross into less loved genres the writing has to extraordinary.  This holds true for music and all arts too.", 1336, "None", 2],
