	119694 : ["GWB told Americans that Muslims are their enemy.  Americans will need to re-learn about the world around them, and it will be a long, difficult road to do so. EDIT:  Okay, I just read through a couple of other posts. If someone you knew hated you, you would want to know why, right?  Like someone from your school or work, just hated you.  You would ask yourself why.  Why aren't you guys asking yourselves why it seems the east hates the west?  Why would they burn flags?  Why would they stage demonstrations? GWB said:  They hate our freedom.  This was the most idiotic of all his statements, IMO.  Why?  Because every time a middle eastern country has attempted to establish democracy, a western power has put an end to it, because it is more in OUR favour to keep a dictator in place.  You can buy one man.  It is much more difficult to buy a parliament. But it's not just ending democracy's chances that encourage those in the east to hate Americans.  It's the puppets they installed and armed.  It's the way the American's sold chemical weapons to a dictator they *knew* would use on his own people.  It's the way GWB used that knowledge as a justification for invading a foreign country that had done the US no harm outside refusing to sell oil in US currency. It's the steady stream of broken promises and terrible policies enacted and enforced over the last 100+ years. I hope none of you believe me but are upset enough to look into it for yourself.  Because if you do, you WILL understand. The surprising thing is just how many eastern people DON'T hate America and the rest of the west.  How many are willing to make peace after all the crap we've put them through.  How many want to forgive and forget and move forward.", 10589, "None", 4],
	119695 : ["You aren't pregnant don't worry. This happened to me and I thought I was dying because I went almost 8 months without a period. Just be prepared for it to come by keeping stuff in your bag and watch for any signs that you could have your period.", 10584, "nsixcZ4paa", 0],

	119698 : ["5. Creed - good sound but too repetitive 4. Nickelback - Awesome band but they try to have to much variety in their albums...it sounds like two or three different artists  3. Brokencyde - Have not heard of them 2. Jonas Brothers - they have some funk to their music but i feel like they are riding the Disney train too much...when they finally have to get of the train and grow up, they wont be able to maintain that same sound which has attracted so many young people 1. Justin Bieber - the boy can sing and present himself but he is stealing too many artists' styles...it is almost impossible to be original today but he looks like a combination of every young artist today **i know you said not to insult them but i am not...i am only giving my opinion on their music and imagery....i dont hate them like some people do...it jut not my cup of java MQ: i have no idea what an insulting song is so sorry", 10588, "HKouIgPOaa", 2],

It's so hard not to insult your \"favorite\" bands because in all honesty every song by them sounds the same or they're overrated, over produced, fake pop stars. Or 'crunkcore' which is a bullshit genre. ANYWAYS Circle Takes The Square are pretty good. They're more interesting then half of the other bands out there.", 10588, "6B09ykjoaa", 0],

	119706 : ["Were I live, a lot is different. People are a lot more mature.  They wear a lot of the same clothes, and the food is better because you can go wherever cause you don't have to stay on campus. I find that alot less people get picked on because everyone is starting to mature but even in my middle school people didnt get bullied, you really just talked about people behind their back.  Alot more kids are having sex, but i wouldnt worry about that. Lame middle school dating when your friends force you to hold hands is pretty much over. Relationships are more serious.  Going to high school is a big change but trust me, High School is sooooo much better than Middle School!", 10587, "None", 1],

The Hicks who think they are so Patriotic and forget who's land they are really living on. The American Indians. As for the Vocal few, this is due to the Media, SKY and BBC etc will always interview the extremest for an opinion on Islam.

	119726 : ["Well, there is a big difference between middle school and highschool. For one thing, you are considered to be \"acting more mature\".  Clothing can be checked by asking your mom/dad/guardian to take you there while class is in session to get a \"feel for the place\" you can scope out the clothing attire and it might help you figure out what to wear. As far as the social scene you will have to figure out where you fit in, the tradition titles are the preps<they dress nice>, jocks<sports lovers>, nerds<usually smart/gifted, band<like music and so on>, only you can decide where you feel comfortable. Often times kids change groups until they find the one they love the most. I recommend that. About sex, too many seem to be involved, but you just keep yourself doing better things than that, you have your whole life ahead of you. That should not be the center of your universe. College, further education, making life time career choices, etc. Do your homework, you will only be in highschool for four years, make the most of it. Better yourself, and do not try to be like others, be hardworking, and learn.", 10587, "AA12389049", 3],
	119727 : ["It all depends on a couple of different things, especially how many schools are merging into one. We had 5 pretty big schools merging into one high school just as freshman. Merging is a huge thing because the more kid there are, the more you have to try to make new friends. At my school, most people did wear the same brand clothing as they did in middle school. Some of the popular people think Aeropostale is kiddish now, but I'm in 10th grade, and I still love shopping there. I'm not a nerd at school, either. Hollister and Abercrombie definitely are popular in high school, but I hate those stores! Nobody at my school is really picked on unless they asked for it. If you annoy someone or cause trouble, of course people are going to pick on you. For the most part, though, we kind of all just do our own thing. The food is better, in my opinion, in high school. I never ate lunch in school in middle school, but the food definitely looked bad. I eat lunch in the cafeteria at my high school now, and it isn't bad. If you don't get yourself into the wrong crowd, sex isn't a big deal, at least where I go to school. Where I go, you see the occasional pregnant girl walking by, but that's it. None of my friends are into that kind of stuff. Freshman definitely date, and it's the perfect opportunity to since you are meeting tons of new people! I know a freshman who dated a senior. They didn't last, but stuff like that does/will happen.", 10587, "None", 0],
	119728 : ["It sounds like you have Anxiety Disorder. Ask you doctor first he might prescribe a mild anxiety medication.

	119729 : ["I am the same way.   There are several at home treatments you can try.   I find relaxation techniques such as yoga, breathing exercises stretching can work.  Finding a happy place, a fun memory or favorite activity you can think about.    For some people music will work, playing a favorite song can alter you mindset. If you feel as though nothing works it is always advisable to go talk to a therapist.   There may be something triggering your stress that can be resolved. Good luck.", 10591, "AA11296044", 2],
