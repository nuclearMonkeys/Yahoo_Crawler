	50836 : ["Anything made by Anheuser Busch will give me a headache within minutes of drinking it. It doesnt matter if its Budweiser, Busch, Michelob, or any of their light beers. Not so much belly trouble, just a pounding freaking headache.", 7148, "B8vnK1ptaa", -1],

	50849 : ["Not in the least.Â  All of the drama you had in high school is petty and irrelevant.Â  Depending on whether you attend a large or small university, some of your classes could include hundreds of people.Â  If you join a sorority or fraternity, there may be more drama, but even then, it's not like high school.", 7157, "UbCOY11zaa", 0],
	50850 : ["Not really. No one judges you for where you get your clothes from. They do make fun of you however, for being a virgin.

	50853 : ["What do you mean by \"college counselor?\" Â Do you mean a guidance counselor/academic advisor who work in a high school or privately to help students prepare for and select the college/universities they apply to? Do you mean a psychologist who works for a university to provide mental health services to college students? Â  Neither of your choices makes sense if you want to counsel people.

	50855 : ["College dorms are only open during the semesters when classes are offered. If a college has no summer term, then the dorms close, and the students go back to their families' homes. Nearly all college dorm leases are for four months (one semester) or ten months (two semester) only.Â  If a college has summer classes available, then dorms are available as well, for the students enrolled in summer classes. You would almost certainly have to switch dorm rooms; you aren't able to just stay in the same room as you did in the spring semester. There will be a few days between the Spring term ending and the Summer term beginning, and between the Summer term ending and the fall semester beginning, that the dorms are closed entirely for cleaning and maintenance. Â  As an alternative, in colleges in city and suburban settings, there are generally a number of students that live in off-campus housing. If someone needs to stay near campus but doesn't necessarily take classes (for example, an international student who can't afford to fly home), they will often sublet an off-campus apartment for the summer, from a renter who rents the apartment year-round (most non-academic leases are for one year minimum) but who doesn't want to remain there all summer.Â  What if an international student doesn't want to fly home, but attends a rural college that has no summer housing? Well, that's the sort of thing one has to consider when determining whether to attend, and which, university overseas. Some will put most of their stuff into storage, and spend the summers traveling or working in a place that provides housing, like a resort or summer camp. Â ", 7160, "96djwZCgaa", 4],
