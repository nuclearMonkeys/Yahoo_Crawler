	49951 : ["You can't actually change the ISO sensitivities on photographic film, my friend, but film cameras DO allow you to change ISO settings.  In effect, this means that you're either under- or over-exposing the film, so this would need to be taken into account during the development process. i.e. you need to inform whomever is carrying out your film processing what you've done or their machines will see that it's over- or under-exposed and try to 'put it right'.", 7013, "AA11434633", 3],
	49952 : ["Yes, a roll of film has one, and only one, ISO.  By this I mean once you start using a roll of film at a specific ISO/ASA, you can't change the ISO on your camera.  However, you can push or pull film.  Pushing film is when you set the ISO higher than indicated and then over develop to compensate.  Pulling is when you shoot the film at a lower ISO and then under develop the film.  As you can imagine, having to stick to one ISO/AA can be problematic, especially when you have a low ISO film in a dark area or vise versa.  To solve the problem of having the wrong ISO for the situation, one can simply rewind the film back into the canister, mark the can with the frame number and then use a different film type.  When it's time to use the partially-exposed film, simply load it, and with the lens cap on, a fast shutter speed and the smallest aperture advance the film one frame past the number where you left off.  I used to do this all the time when I shot film.  Fortunately, my camera had the ability to rewind the film and leave the leader out, otherwise I'd have to use a film leader retriever. Those who use medium format cameras like a Mamiya, Hasselblad, etc... were lucky in that these cameras used film backs that could be removed and exchanged with another back.  This allowed the user to use any ISO and/or film type at any time. Similarly, large format cameras use removable film holders that hold two sheets of film. UPDATE:  Why there are thumbs down on this answer is beyond me.  I have many decades of experience doing exactly what I've written, so I know it to be empirical fact.", 7013, "OczpbeMdaa", -2],
