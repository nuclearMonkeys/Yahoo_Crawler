I disagree, but the sentiment is War kills, therefore if you are pro life then you are against killing, and the war kills, so you're like a living, breathing oxymoron if you believe in the war and are against abortion. Personally, I am pro-Soldier, against the war before we entered it, but now that we're there we should stay there until it's finished. I'm also pro-life, with limited use of abortions for myself, however, for every other woman of child bearing years I am very much in the \"you must decide what's right for you, given your unique circumstances\" group. If that means abortion then you should have that opportunity, and it should not cause you to get infections or to die like many did before abortion was legalized. However, I think there should also be extensive counseling and education prior to any abortion (like for several weeks).", 9323, "AA10410743", 1],

I'm assuming the billboard was not refering to that definition but one entangled with abortion. It assumes that all pro-life advocates are pro ALL human life. By summing them up like that, you disreguard their stand points. Overall, it's quite low. Oh yah, it's confusing. Is the billboard for anti-war or against pro-choice. Maybe both are wrong. Maybe we shouldn't be having wars but we should be killing life. :)", 9323, "None", 3],

My first birth was 30 yrs ago- I was pretty tiny, so I don't remember much (lol) Anyway, as Jesus told Nichodemus, we must be born of water and the spirit twice- the first birth, is when you first exited the womb- there is the amniotic fluid, and your spirit enters your body and takes up residence. The second birth must include the same two ingredients- the waters of baptism and the Holy Spirit. Whether you've been baptized or not, you are a child of God. One of you other answers refered to a time when Jesus told some Jewish leaders that they were children of the devil. I think he was refering to their behavior- (My mom says that I was adopted b/c I don't like nuts... whatever.) Prayer is when a person talks to God.

Their stated mission is to provide comprehensive reproductive and complementary health care services in settings which preserve and protect the essential privacy and rights of each individual.  Abortion services are not \"pushed\" onto women.  Women seek out abortions because they don't want to be pregnant.  The reason there are so many Planned Parenthoods in the black community is because leaders in the black community in the ‘20s and ‘30s went to Margaret Sanger and asked for them.  Controlling fertility is part of the uplift out of poverty strategy, and it still works.  The number one indicator of poverty is being a woman with child(ren).

When we seek out how to be in right standing with God, the first and last of it is to accept that Jesus was able to make a sacrifice that perfectly covered even the worst of our sins.  To accept that and ask forgiveness begins a faith that God gives us while he is saving us.  From then on we get to learn how good God really is, how he has interacted with his people throughout history in the Bible, and to seek out a place to have fellowship with other believers.  The Bible's relevance to the depth of God's love is still amazing.   We all have a story about how God interacted in our life to bring us to a saving faith in him.  Sometimes it is dramatic, sometimes it is small steps.  Maybe part of some peoples' stories will be Yahoo Answers.  We are all on our own timetable for understanding who he is and that he's made a way for us to be with him eternally.
