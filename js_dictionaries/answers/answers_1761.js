Do these people really think that it's accidental that most \"Pro-Life\" candidates get into office then do nothing about abortion?>> As usual, the pro-abortion side doesn't understand the pro-life strategy. The Supreme Court is what legalized abortion in the first place. The \"easiest\" way to do away with this poor display of judgment is to have the Supreme Court overturn itself. The ONLY way this can be done is vote for pro-life candidates so that they will NOMINATE pro-life justices to the court. The Bush Administration is the perfect example of this strategy at work. Not one but two pro-life justices were nominated to the Supreme Court. One more than Roe-v-Wade can be overturned. Don't presume to think pro-life candidates are expecting instant or even immediate results. Pro-lifers KNOW that this process is going to take a great deal of time, but that's okay. We're a patient lot, us pro-lifers. <<On the other hand, is proclaiming evangelical Christianity the new abortion trick?>> The two presidential canditates agreed to be questioned by a reknown Evangelical - in front of an Evangelical crowd. McCain answered honestly and concisely, \"at conception\" is when life starts, he said. You might not agree with this, but at least you know how McCain feels. When Obama was asked that same question, he jerked around in a vain attempt to avoid giving what he knew was the honest - and unpopular answer. Obama would have demanded more personal respect if he's just came out and said, \"I'm pro-choice\"! <<Just a way for someone to get elected on a \"Christian platform\" that they will then do nothing about?>> Not \"nothing\".

They DO tell you about the listing fees, they tell you as you are making the listing.  As I tick off each option, it tells me how much it costs.  Yes, for the most part it is pointless to keep relisting unsold items unless you drastically change the description, lower the price, or include something else with it.   Yes I have had to pay these fees and yes I have gotten suckered by a louser seller on there.  But thats part of it.  You have to do your home work on the terms of service, the seller/buyer, the whole nine yards.  What you are doing on ebay is nothing short than entering a legal and binding contract with someone you have never met.  That requires more than just clicking a button in blind faith that ebay is a recognized name so you will get your product with no problem, and sell your stuff with none of the typical hidden fees (at drastically lower values, I might add) associated with any other auction - online or live.  I hope you do not take care of all of your business with this level of ineptitude. Well, im just thinking part of this is common sense.  Do you really need a sign telling you coffee is hot to know coffee is hot?  Did you really think you could relist an unsold item for free?

Its like people who say the places buying gold are scams because you get less money than you paid.  They arent scams, people just didnt take the time to understand what was happening - they were being paid for the weight in gold, not the artistry/name brand they paid for when they bought the jewelry.  Penny auction sites arent scams either, you just have to understand you are paying for each bid and that the timer is reset every time someone bids.

I am glad I am not God, to have to hand down a judgment to anyone who has ever had an abortion for any reason. 2.

When you're active, moisture-wicking athletic socks are a good choice. Whenever possible, try walking barefoot or open shoes. This helps cool the entire body, and prevents sweating from the feet. # Change your socks often - Change socks or hose once or twice a day, drying your feet thoroughly each time. Women may prefer pantyhose with cotton soles. # Application of the raw juice of brinjal on palms and soles also checks profuse sweating. Generally, OTC antiperspirants are used for profuse sweating or hyperhidrosis. The most effective are those that contain aluminium chlorohydrate. But, such preparations may themselves cause irritation. Inflammation and infection can result from the combined effect of shaving and chemicals. There are also conventional oral medications for controlling sweating, but again unpleasant side effects may occur and they should be used only for extreme cases. These work by drying bodily secretions, and tend to come with unwanted side-effects such as dry mouth, blurry vision, dizziness and cardiovascular concerns.

Homeopathic ingredients such as Lupulus, Castoreum and Argentum Nitricum help to address sweating, especially when related to nervousness, panic, anxiety, or obsessive thoughts & reduce excessive sweating and clamminess.

I believe Islam is a counterfeit religion meant to distract from the only way of salvation--Jesus Christ, Son of God. God pulled the trump card on satan and snatched mankind out of satan's hand, by sacrificing himself (in the form of Jesus) for the sins of mankind. satan knew God couldn't just ignore the sins of man, to do so would trivialize the offense, and therefore trivialize God. Now all that mankind had to do to go to heaven is to believe that Jesus paid the price for their sin.... I think satan then chose to counter God by creating the Islamic religion that denies that Jesus is the Son of God, to lead God's sheep astray. Why would the Almighty God send an angel of his to hide in a hira cave to relay his message? God and his angels have no shame and don't need to hide in a hira cave. satan himself masquerades as an angel of light, and I think satan lead Mohammad astray. I think satan chose Mohammad because he knew Mohammed was illiterate and could not read the bible and dispute what he was being brainwashed with.  This makes Mohammad a false prophet because Islam does not accept that Jesus is the Son of God. Islam teaches that Jesus was only a great prophet and not the Son of God, but no great prophet of God would also blaspheme God by declaring himself the Son of God. Jesus cannot be a great prophet and a great liar at the same time!!! We KNOW Mohammad is a false prophet because he denies Jesus is the son of God, here is the test: 1 John 4:1-3 1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.  2 Corinthians 11:13-15 13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.
