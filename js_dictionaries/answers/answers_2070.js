A function may well be defined for all x on [0, a million] jointly as being discontinuous at each factor in [0, a million]. (classic occasion: f(x) = 0 if x is rational, a million if x is irrational.) you're patently nicely suited in that if the function is non-end, it won't be able to consistently be irrational. yet that's so trivial that it is going to be obtrusive that a non-non-end function is meant - incredibly using fact the question contains no point out of continuity.
