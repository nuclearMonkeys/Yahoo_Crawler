	73270 : ["Minolta did make some great 35mm SLRs. If you go with Minolta, I would suggest a maxxum because you can use the lens(es) that you get with it on the Sony alpha DSLRs and vice versa. The Minolta Maxxum 7000 is one of the classic Minolta Maxxum SLRs.  I have a Minolta Maxxum 7000 and I got it with the 50mm f/1.7 lens (great inexpensive lens for portraits) for $84 including shipping from ebay. I also recently purchased a Minolta Maxxum HTsi with a flash, a 50mm lens, a 35-105mm lens and a 100-200mm lens for $75 through craigslist. I then sold the camera, flash and 50mm lens for $100. Ebay and craigslist are both great places to buy a used 35mm SLR. An SLR camera body is going to have all the features that you need. If you intend to go digital, then I would base my decision on which 35mm to get on which brand of digital SLR you would choose. Hit dpreview.com and check out the camera reviews. Hit the forums there to ask about brands and such. Do a little research and you will be able to make the best choice. I had a 35mm Canon Rebel and when I decided to go digital, I also switched brands. Once I decided on Sony, that is when I started to watch for Minolta Maxxum equipment. So I now have a 35mm Minolta SR-7 (older MD mount). I have the Minolta Maxxum 7000, and I have the Sony a700. I only have two Sony lenses as of yet. The other three lenses are Minolta. And I got them for a steal. Just keep your eyes open on ebay and craigslist. Check them everyday or you might miss a nice deal. As to lenses, it depends on what you want to shoot. Most photographers do at least some portraiture. So a prime lens around 35mm up to about 50mm (85mm at the most) with a 1.4 up to 1.8 maximum aperture is essential for most of us. Other than that, it really does depend on what you want to shoot. For landscapes and cityscapes you need something wide. 28mm to 35mm is wide on a 35mm camera, but not very wide on a digital. And for sports and wildlife you want a long telephoto. Often starting out you have to settle for a zoom supertelephoto, such as a 70-300, as the primes are quite expensive. Also these lenses are more convenient when they have wide maximum apertures like 2.8 so that you can get the shots even in low light. Usually a 35mm camera will come with a lens that goes from a wide angle to a telephoto range. Such as 28-80mm. Pair this with a 75-300mm lens and an inexpensive portrait lens (such as a 50mm f/1.8) and you have a great starter set-up. If you buy a system with a current mount, you can even use the lenses on a digital camera.  Good luck finding a great deal. They are out there, you just have to look for them.", 8714, "bocePfyYaa", 0],
	73271 : ["\"everything in the universe has a reason to exist or else it wouldn't\" That's what you call a straw man argument. There might be a reason WHY everything exists. But that's not the same as a reason TO exist. T-rex's came about because of evolution. But they were an evolutionary dead end and couldn't adapt so they died out. It's like buckshot.

	73272 : ["Yes everything in the Universe has a \"reason\" to exist.  For example, there's a lot of helium in our Sun.
