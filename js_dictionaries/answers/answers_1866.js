	99050 : ["One cannot be an observant Jew and an atheist but one can be an ethical Jew and an atheist. The only two religions I know of whose dogmas demonize and consider atheists as evil and deserving of eternal torture are Christianity and Islam. While Judaism affirms as the foundation of the covenant, the belief in our Creator as an Omnipotent, incorporeal ONE, without any other rival (Devil) or without demi-gods and who told all Israel that God does not become a man, the atheist born among Israel is not considered to have sinned as egregiously as one who adopts belief in a false god. Yet atheism, to deny the existence of the Creator who gave us our covenant and laws and made us a people with a specific purpose is still a sin. Not all sins merit estrangement from Yisrael in Torah's laws Jews believe are from God. Living Torah's ethical precepts may lead the atheist to God. Torah declares the apostate who adopts a foreign faith as estranged from Israel, the atheist is not considered to have left the covenant nation since they are still capable of living as a light unto others in how they honor life, promote justice, mercy, compassion and strive to righteousness. Thus, while they may still sin in not believing in God, their lack or inability to believe because they've not yet had any encounter convincing them God is real isn't something to separate them from their purpose as a part of the covenant nation. The path of Torah is such that living the ethical precepts often opens one up to the Divine encounter. Orthodox, Conservative nor Reform do not convert the atheist, because they cannot affirm faith in God. A *former* atheist who has decided they believe God exists may be a candidate. \"To become a Jew, Reform Judaism demands that the convert affirm belief in God and the unique bond between God and the Jewish people.(11) \" < from the Central Conference of American Rabbis rules. That isn't demonizing atheists as is often displayed by other religious groups. It simply means they do not qualify to become members of the Jewish people because of that criteria of membership. The Jewish Bible (Tanakh) tells from the beginning book to the end that the righteous of all nations (Jew or Gentile) have the capacity to connect directly to God, merit blessing and a place in the world to come. Every human is *equal before God* according to the Jewish religion. Judaism in Torah is not about blind faith at all and in fact, it is required to test and challenge what we are told to determine if it is real or not, if it leads us toward righteousness or away from it. Subjective experiences CAN be real, or they can be delusion, or they can be perceptions in various levels of consciousness brought about by electro hormonal impulse. Using subjectivity; you can't prove anything to someone else with it unless you really trust the sanity of the reporter and you have a reason to either want to believe it or accept it as real. Believing Jews believe that the report of ALL of the nation of Israel through Moses is valid in that the entire multitude experienced a Direct encounter with our Creator before whom they all affirmed “Hear O'Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is ONE”. Faith is involved in subjectivity. objective evidence requires no faith. It may not be long before someone will discover a method of taking the concept of Creator Deity beyond the realm of faith and into scientific inquiry once we have objective data to apply to scientific method. Not being able to accept something as real unless you have objective evidence or compelling subjective experience of your own that you do not believe is delusion is logical thinking. It doesn't imply a lack of moral or ethical capacity or function, in fact, when combined with a nature and environment supportive of compassion and ethical values; it can create a person who lives a fulfilling life that can also benefit lives around them and future generations. There is no less inherent good in the life of a self-actualized atheist than in a self-actualized theist who is not bound by narrow ideology to demonize the other. Yet, despite being demonized by so many theists of those two religions, the atheist who paints all theism with the same brush-stroke can be as narrow in thinking as the fundamentalist can be. The extreme of an immoral atheist who has no concern for another is no less a reality than the extreme of the immoral theist who has no concern for another outside their narrow belief.", 9681, "vEEeq7kYaa", 4],
	99051 : ["answer: I would rather see someone continuing the prayers and rituals while in doubt or disbelief, odds are they'll find they are reaching and believing in the Gd of Abraham and their children will be more inclined towards religion if they are raised with the prayers and traditions.

His involvement, as defensible as it may have been, with Hitler's Germany has also plagued him.

	99065 : ["THERE IS NO DEWORMER THAT YOU CAN USE ON A PREGNANT CAT!!! Your vet has the safest dewormers there are and they cannot be used on pregnant cats or dogs. Anything you get over the counter from WalMart or the pet store can cause spontaneous abortion in the cat and kill the kittens. When your son plays with the cat, wash his hands afterward. And yes, your son can contract some types of worms. Keep the cat out of the kitchen and away from food preparation areas. If you can't, wipe everything down with diluted bleach in a 1:9 dilution (that's one part bleach to nine parts water). Then rinse that off. Edit:  Sorry cow, you are wrong. Cats and dogs DO NOT get pinworms. That is a human only parasite. There are worms that may LOOK like pinworms to the untrained eye.

There is some controversy over this and you will find no Breeder of dogs or cats ever dose their pregnant females with any all wormers or flea solutions of ANY kind especial spot on which by the way is way too strong for cats.

	99071 : ["I think John Morrison is talented and he's a great superstar who'll do great things for the future of WWE. I see his talent but like most wrestlers weaknesses come out as well. First John Morrison is a solid wrestler but i say he's not exactly in ring mat wrestler. John Morrison is more of a high flier flashy type kind of wrestler. His flashiness is a big reason why people like him so much because he's entertaining and shows good maneuvers. John Morrison is not the best wrestler and he shouldn't be getting a immediate world championship. Morrison needs more buildup and time before he can become world champion. Instant pushes are never a good think in my point of view, just look at Cena he got a huge push and now he's hated. John Morrison has decent mic skills as well. It's not the best but its passable and he has had some good promos. John Morrison's mic skill is alright in my opinion. His charisma is just average or decent in my point of view. Here's the reason why on ECW as a heel he didn't really get much reaction any time. As a face though his charisma has skyrocketed to the top because he gets a lot more fan pops and popularity. As a heel John Morrison's charisma wasn't that good but as a face he has so far been successful. People have been liking him ever since he became ECW champion in 2007 and they think he should be a world champion right now when he's not ready for it yet. John Morrison won't survive too long though because with his risky style he'll have to adjust and transition his style so that he can wrestle in WWE's pace. John Morrison does a lot of high flying and that's going to get him some severe injuries that will slow him down hugely. Randy Orton on the other hand is a decent wrestler. He's slowed down a lot from his collarbone injury but i still think he's a decent mat wrestler. Randy Orton doesn't have a moveset as big as John Morrison's and he isn't flashy in the ring. In the ring i would consider John Morrison the superior wrestler. Randy Orton has solid mic skills just like John Morrison and both aren't that amazing on the mic compared to superstars like Chris Jericho, Edge, Triple H, and others in the business today. Randy Orton on the mic isn't so great all the time nowadays because he usually says the same thing about how he's better than Triple H and saying Legacy is the best. When Orton talks he doesn't get much fan reaction either. Randy Orton does beat Morrison in charisma though because he gets much larger reactions from the fans than Morrison and fans really seem to enjoy Orton. In Charisma its close but i would give the slight edge to Randy Orton. The difference is Randy Orton might not be ready to be the one to carry the company yet, but i definitely consider Randy Orton ready for the main event while John Morrison needs more time before fans take him seriously as world champion. In characters and gimmicks i prefer John Morrison's gimmick because although Randy Orton is trying to make himself boring, i don't see that as a crucial argument. Randy Orton's gimmick just doesn't interest people and its really hard to get into what he is saying. How can you kick the boss and other superstars without getting punished in any real way? Stone Cold got sent to jail in kayfabe at least but Randy Orton hasn't suffered any punishment. John Morrison's gimmick i guess is funnier, more entertaining like his argument with Edge, and he isn't as repetitive as Orton. Also John Morrison has done better as both heel and face while Randy Orton has gone good as a heel but horrible as a face after he broke up with Evolution. So in that category John Morrison comes out on top. Randy Orton also repeatedly uses Priceless to do everything and he is nowhere near of being the deadly heel he once was. We never see Orton alone and fighting because we only see Orton being a coward and see him getting his *** kicked around by superstars like Mark Henry. Randy Orton is being portrayed as a guy who can't do anything without his usual lackeys I actually like Randy Orton more than John Morrison, but this is how it looks so far in my opinion. Both have given us some great matches and both can be entertaining at times. BQ: I see a couple more title reigns for Edge before he becomes like HBK and starts putting over younger talent. WWE knows that Edge brings in money and ratings and i think they'll utilize that for a bit until Edge goes into the sidelines. Edge with his injury is going to need a limited schedule so that he doesn't aggravate his injuries. I see maybe 1-3 more title reigns for Edge. Hopefully when Edge returns we get to see Rated Y2J again and see Edge feud with new main eventers so that we can see Edge in fresh new feuds and matches.", 9677, "4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa", 4],
