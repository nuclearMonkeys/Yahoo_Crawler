If you start by being nasty with them and simply saying I changed my mind and your not getting the dog back, it makes you sound petty and dishonest.  If you call and tell them you never respected to fall in love with such a wonderful animal and would be thrilled if you could adopt it so your family they may possibly let you adopt.  It depends why the foster and f there is a family waiting for the dog already.  Was there some type of medical or family emergency that they needed you to care for the dog while the family temporarily could not?  Imagine if it was your dog and day your home burned down, there was no room at the shelter for your dog and someone took care of it for you, would you wa;t your dog back or would you say since they loved the dog you would give it up? No matter what the party that you got the dog from is the legal owner weather you want them to be,or not.  Dogs are legally property in the courts eyes and your currently the caretaker of their property, this gives you no legal rights or claims to the dog.  If you were getting paid it would make you their technical employ, but you volunteered and signed a legal contract do your stuck with your precare decision.   You need to do what's legally right, if you don't surrender the dog now, they will 2ait and may take the dog sometime when your not watching it and they can take possession of their property. As someone else posted, they can show up with the police and take the dog back into their possession.  I would rather try it by asking first instead of taking and stealing the animal.  You might be more successful that way.
