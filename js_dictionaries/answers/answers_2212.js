There are women (and men) that find a wonderful mate and live happy love filled lives, then you have people that say they can't tell the difference between a good and bad man, all men cheat, all men use women for sex, have dysfunctional relationship after dysfunction relationship etc.  If you grew up in a house where everything said about men was negative, or all you see around you are abusive men, men cheating and men treating women poorly then that's what you look for and that is what you will find.  If you grew up in a house where men where men were responsible, romantic and respectful of women, that is what you will look for and that is what you will find.  If you buy into the unrealistic images of men from romance novels and chick flicks, then you will dismiss every man that doesn't live up to that and be alone or settle and be frustrated. However, if you're one of those people that complains that good men are boring or whatever, then you forfeit you right to be taken seriously when the alternative takes advantage of you. I feel the same way about men that pass up a woman that will treat him right only to marry a btich that destroys him in a divorce just because she looked better than average. Attraction is a very complicated subject. It's not just society but your family life, the teachers you had growing up, past experiences and so on. Many people get too much advice from people that don't know what they're talking about. Women will get advice about men from people that have never been men, like their angy, bitter, jilted, single or formerly abused friends and family. How are you going to be successful at something by taking advice from someone that failed to accomplish what you're trying to succeed at? If you want a successful relationship, get advice from people that have successful relationships instead of some divorced person that thinks all men cheat or abandon their families or whatever.", 10464, "zIpbIWb3aa", 4],

Our mother is, sadly, not around to help out with these situations. Since I am 3 years her senior, I take it upon myself to help out. She's a freshman and I'm a junior. I've heard and seen several incidents where one or two upperclassmen will pick on her because she's my sister. I feel like part of that is my fault because I have a reputation at school for being smart and popular and Charter doesn't exactly fit in with me. They tell her things like \"Who dropped you on your head and made you different? Your sister hates you and the fact that you're here. How is Amanda so pretty and you're so ugly?\" I HATE hearing people talk about her like that because I don't feel that way. I've tried time and time again to have Charter stand up to them but she never would until about a month ago. I told her that if she didn't do something about it, I would. It may be different because you are her mother but I don't think any teenage girl wants their mother or older sister/brother taking care of there problems. You could try telling Virginia that if she doesn't stand up for herself, you WILL do something about it. Just a suggestion.", 10467, "s2JvJ5alaa", 0],

If they were happy in their lives, they would not even think about hurting or teasing someone else, would they?  What would the advantage be in that for them?  What would be the point?  They wouldn't even think to do it.  But, they do.  It makes them feel bigger, in control of something.  If she doesn't give them any attention for it, doesn't let them believe that they are actually gaining anything by doing so, then they will, eventually, stop.
