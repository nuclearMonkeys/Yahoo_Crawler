	103404 : ["To begin with, the Iraqi army was a conscript army.  Drafted.  It didn't have the best training.   Secondly, the majority of the officer corps were Baathists, and the reason they were officers was as much their loyalty to Saddam Hussein as to their military ability.   Next, the military men from the Iraqi army have now moved on to other things.  Can you say, insurgents?  Reconstituting the Iraqi military by bringing these people back together would make the Iraqi army worse than useless.  It would be infiltrated with insurgents from all sides.   Why can't it be done now?  Loyalty.  The Iraqi people now see themselves as Sunnis/Shiites/Kurds first, or members of their clan.  They don't place their loyalty with the Iraqi government, or the country.  (That's a generalization;there are loyal Iraqis, btu they are the minority, especially when faced with the violence the insurgents inflict on anybody who collaborates with the US.)", 9852, "b32bfa8f41834d2af2dabb50249b0caaaa", 0],
	103405 : ["Many of the answers are valid and very good... Another look at the reasons might be to remember how quickly Saddam's military was overcome and \"beaten\"...  Saddam's conscripted, hand picked Baatist army loved to prance around in fancy uniforms, goose stepping their way down the street with cute little hats, while gloves and rifles on their shoulders.  They were really good at murdering unarmed civilian men, women and children.  However, when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, they are not suited to battle against a real army.  They drop their weapons and run like hell, hiding behind their mosques, children in schools, patients in hospitals. With the strict religious sects and the difference in beliefs, you will not be able to have a standing army there. You will not get the best trained Sunni soldier to turn his gun on a Sunni, nor a Shi'ia soldier against another Shi'ia....which leaves only the Kurds to pick on. Anyone who believes otherwise is a fool.  Those in Washington obviously never considered the history of the middle east, nor bothered to find out.  They still don't want to know.  They will just keep throwing our young people against an unidentifiable guerilla  \"army\" and getting them killed.", 9852, "None", 0],
	103406 : ["Your question is thoughtful and legitimate; to start with, Iraq is majority Shiite fundamentalist; but the Iraqi Army was totally Sunni in it's composition; it was a personally-managed arm of Saddam's regime, used to massacre Kurd and Shiites alike; and in the invasion of Kuwait, it's soldiers were allowed, no, encouraged, to rape, torture, and kill the Kuwaiti population. All countries indoctrinate their soldiers; ours with love of country and a sense of moral justice, in supporting and defending our Constitution; in Iraq, the soldiers swore an oath to protect Saddam and his murderous regime... these soldiers had privilege and personal power over the average Iraqi citizen.  In our system, our soldiers are citizens equal but not above others.  The decision not to use these \"tainted\" ex-soldiers was dictated by historic concerns about using fascistic troops with blood on their hands.  The present slow-down in training of a new Iraqi army is due to the necessity to weedout infiltrating insurgent or sectarian terror elements.  The old Iraqi army used threats as motivation in training; our Army is trying to use morality and a sense of justice to train new recruits; this is a new concept for most.", 9852, "AA11230047", 1],

	103436 : ["The mainstream media is admittedly in the tank with the liberals in this nation.  The rallies supporting illegal aliens held awhile back were not only covering extensively by the media, it also showed that the liberals supporting this had no problem spending our tax money to support people knowingly violating the law by being illegal aliens. Meanwhile, the rallies to stop the continuously negligent and aggressive overspending policies were met by the media with obvious disdain and denigration for those who supported the tea parties.  Keep in mind that MSNBC is pretty much the presidential news network quite literally since Immelt (who is the CEO of GE which owns NBC and its affiliates) is working with the Obama administration and Zucker (the president of NBC) pushes his broadcasters to promote a leftist view in their news reporting.  MSNBC is literally a step or two away from becoming a state-run news agency. The manner in which the media reported on the tea parties should not surprise people since the media for the most part is still carrying on with its crush over Obama.  The clip of the CNN \"reporter\" insulting and carrying on while cutting off the man she was \"interviewing\" further exemplifies the negligence and elitist mentality that continues to show how the news agencies have lost objectivity in the reporting and believe in their self-superiority over the American public.

	103439 : ["Interesting info but with due apologies to the learned scientists, I have to say that it is unwise to embark on such prediction based on past trends, extrapolation of current consumption pattern to the expected demand for the enhanced population, present resource levels or even present growth levels of population etc. Because there are a lot of surprises that can be struck: - the economist Malthus's theory was belied by the totally unexpected trends in technology developments that made agrl production / animal products prodn / fisheries prodn (the Green / white / blue revolutions - referred as Rainbow Revoln)etc to reach new heights even in developing countries like India, who could reach self sufficiency. Qn may arise if the trend could continue in the present event of seeming to have ''reached a plateau in production'', coupled by increasing population etc - My reply is: yes, it can: - the present gap between the potential levels of productivity of major cultivars and the actual productivity realized now is so wide that a breakthrough would be highly probable (not JUST possible, quite realizable). Only thing is the govt are caught up in an infatuation with industries and service sectors that seem to earn more profit.. So govt deliberately neglect the agrl sector. When things threaten to get acute, they would be forced to put their attention to bridge the gap between the potential and actual levels which would nearly solve the crisis. (issues of land and water are also manageable but for sake of space constraint, I limit to some points only)! - the fossil energy consumption levels would be forced to be cut over time, due to compulsions of pollution and consequent health hazards (not necessarily from Warming phenomenon alone) etc due to greater exploitation of alternate sources of renewable energy sources. you may recall that when there was fuel crisis about 25 years ago, govts frantically sanctioned schemes for tapping alternate sources, but once the fuel crisis was resolved, they reverted to fossil fuels due to the powerful lobby of the oil companies and the attention on alternate sources were diluted!! Of course, the series of natural calamities, man made murders and state sponsored genocides etc do threaten to reduce population, besides new viral diseases defying treatments. But mankind would survive all these for sure.  This theory of preservation of humans species would appear to be bold, illogical surmise, but anyone who had studied the past carefully and the strange checks and balances in operation in nature would understand. When wars and epidemics like malaria, cholera, typhoid, etc used to kill people in massive scales, didn't we get the marvelous institutions and medical discoveries to out do the menace of destruction?  A shattered Japan afte war, regained with full energy in no time. An isolated China had become the great rising power. The powerful Germany and later USSR that threatened world peace were humbled.. Sorry, a US that poked its nose into every other country on some pretext is now struggling to stabilise itself. If you like, call these random events. But they are not..!! Nature that revealed the technology for greater crop yields to feed the people, that revealed the vaccines to save people from deadly diseases, that humbled great powers and helped vanquished and isolated groups to rise up, over time... the same nature would still help the world to protect the human species!!  If rationalists do not understand this phenomenon, because their labs are not equipped enough to explore the mega mystery of the complex interrelationships in play in nature, it is their own limitation. But great mystery of nature rocks !!!", 9851, "56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa", 9],
