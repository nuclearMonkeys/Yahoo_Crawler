	117031 : ["Yes. From my understanding, lighter weight oils are thinner and moving engine parts don't require as much energy to move the oil around. Therefore, you're engine consumes less gas. As to how much gas you'll save depends on the engine and any issues you have with the car. On the other hand, even though you're saving gas, the weight of the oil determines how much protection the engine has against wear and tear. This is why you should never use an oil that isn't approved for your engine. I found a link with some great info on the subject if you wish to learn more:", 10488, "vxg3UQ2Maa", 0],
	117032 : ["The guy above me has a lot of good tips The only correction is the tip that the air filter will increase MPG. This is only really applicable on a carbureted car. If you follow the source of that tip you will see it based on tests done in the 1970s and not valid anymore on a fuel injected car. If you go to the current EPA website, I think they comment on this tip and say it is only for carbureted cars. The same Oaj Ridge National Lab did new studies which are completed in 2009 and now say no loss of MPG from air filters. I do think that your K&N is not really providing much benefit and has the potential to decrease efficiency and damage your car due to the oil contaminating the MAF as well as overall letting more particulates get through. You should try a regular paper filter and see if that makes a difference.", 10488, "x1oq3URtaa", 0],
