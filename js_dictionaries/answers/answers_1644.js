	87864 : ["Just be confident in who you are stand up for yourself and be a leader. People will follow you then and you will make good friends. Just be yourself. And dont worry about that being popular is really just a figment of peoples imaginations. The \"popular kids\" are only popular because they consider themselves to be and because you guys go along with it. In 2 years its not going to matter. In highschool there are no popular kids or not popular kids its just people. And those who still consider themselves to be \"popular\" are just arrogant. So i wouldnt worry about it so much. Just be yourself and dont let anyone bring you down. You are who you are and be proud of it. That will be important throughout your life not just for the time being. If you are confident in yourself and have friends who like you for you. You will be much happier than those that try to be someone they are not. Trust me.", 9274, "D9Vos5Zoaa", 0],

Do you like what men have made of earth in their rebellion and separation from God. Wars, disease, pestilence, evil of all kinds... well then you will love total separation fom God, a place with no redeeming qualities.

Not firstborn child. Most were already adults and teens. Ex, if your uncle was a firstborn, you know what will happen to him; and, if you are a firstborn son, then you know too what will happen to you if you were in Egypt during the time of Moses. 3.Numbers 31:17 So that Midian could never raise an army for 2 generations, to protect Israel. So every boys were killed. War is war. Did you blame the American president who ordered to drop atomic bomb in Japan? 4.Deuteronomy 2:34 Another casualties of war, but there is no such thing that God ordered to kill all.  5. Deuteronomy 28:53 You make me laugh on this. Please start on Deut 28:15 so that you understand. That's about God explaining a scenario if Israel will be cursed by Him. 6. 1Samuel 15:3 If only the parents will be killed, who will breast feed those babies? You never really know what is the meaning of war. 7. 2Kings 8:12 this one really make me laugh. It was Hazael  that will dash the children and rip the pregnant women. That was a prophecy by Elisha to Hazael. 8. Isaiah 13:16 & 18 Did God kill the babies in there? or it was just a prophecy against Babylon? Start on 13:1 so that you could understand. 9. Lamentations 2:20 Great! The Lamentations of Jeremaiah. That is an eye-witness account of the writer. God did not kill the babies in there, that's why there's a question mark (?). 10. Ezekiel 9:6 Nice one hahaha! This is another vision of Ezekiel. There is no killing in here. Plain vision a prophecy that do not happen during the time of Ezekiel. 11. Hosea 9:14 Truly nice one here. Using a verse without studying the whole context. That was just a warning for the sins of Israel/ Ephraim. That do not happen. Read Hosea 11:9. As I analyze your question, you just pick it up from someone else book. Those who hated God will only pick one verse on the Bible and use it against Him. But if you read the whole context of the story, you can picture God's love to those who believe in Him.  Read the Bible well.  A†Ω™", 9276, "AjcxPl7Uaa", 5],
