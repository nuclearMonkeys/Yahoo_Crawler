I don't understand how she does it! By the way, I wouldn't put much trust in most studies.  They are more often than not done for a reason and the results are influenced by how the study is created and interpreted to support the creator's agenda.  Here's a recent example with an outrageous conclusion (at least part of it): \"The researchers attributed the weight gain to cohabiting women eating unhealthier food because of their partner, while they also have less time to exercise\" Because of their partner??????  Poooooor women!  Mean, inconsiderate men!!!!!!!!!  Are women ever responsible for their actions?  Ever?  Those lazy men have to learn to cook healthier and stop forcing all this unhealthy fast food down their women's throats against their wills.

	122729 : ["That sounds very very weird. No healers take off their clothes.. She was playing some sort of game and discrediting healing energy. Reiki is a Japaneses form of Healing energy. Called Yin Energy.   Ever seen Karate in action.   How about did you see the movie Karate Kid? That's the concept,  Students are taught the Yang energy that helps them to fight.  Energy is how they break bricks with their hand. Ive seen a Black Belt instructor take a beer bottle in good condition and place it on the floor, Then use his energy to pop it in two pieces.   Then there is the Yin energy which can be called the Healing Energy and is used just like in the Karate Kid movie, when a kid got hurt, then Master Migagi stopped and put his hands over the pain and fixed it.

Anybody who pays more attention to Hollywood films than science lessons in school will always fail to have any kind of critical thinking or analysis. EDIT: Wayne, the problem isn't with it being a placebo, the problem is with lies such as:   \" For instance, in Quantum touch, a practitioner raises theri own vibration as high as possible, and mantains that, thereby enabling the client, via resonance & entrainment, to meet that level\"  Which is just a load of rubbish.

	122759 : ["Let me address all of your points. 1) You assert the universe is infinite - there is no evidence whatsoever that the universe is infinite.  Best guess now is that the universe, as a whole, is flat but finite.  That doesn't mean it is not bigger than we can see since inflation after the big bang expanded the universe at many times the speed of light which means that much of it is outside the range of observation 2) The issue of the universe coming from nothing - people often cite vacuum fluctuations as an argument where the universe could come from nothing.  Vacuum fluctuations are a fact and have been verified by experiment.  However, the argument that the universe could come from a vacuum fluctuation doesn't really buy you anything.  The vacuum obeys the laws of the universe (uncertainty principle and the fact that all particles that pop out of the vacuum are particles allowed by the laws of the universe) so the presumption of the universe starting with a vacuum fluctuation implies that the laws of the universe existed prior to the fluctuation so it doesn't buy you crap 3) Issues on conservation of matter and energy - As stated by one of the other responders, if you sum the energy contained in rest mass and kinetic energy (which are both positive) with the negative potential energy in gravitational fields, you get a great big zero. This, of course, does not explain how the energy got differentiated in the first place, but it does allow the existence of the universe without violating conservation of matter and energy 4) The crucial issue of what came before the \"big bang\".  Vacuum fluctuations, zero energy content, blah, blah don't explain the crucial question of what came before the big bang.  The Hartle-Hawking no boundary proposal (does not rise to the level of a theory) is one attempt to address the issue.  In a nutshell, they argue that the idea of what came before the big bang is rendered a meaningless question since time did not exist in the universe until it was the size of the planck length (the dimensionality of the universe was 4 spatial dimensions instead of the 3 spatial, 1 temporal we have now).  In that view, the start of the universe did not exist as a temporal boundary, and the spatial bondary was closed.  Interesting, but by no means proven or testable. The bottom line is that our laws of physics work to a few trillionths of a second after the big bang.  What happened before that is speculation at this point waiting for a grand unification theory of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics", 10717, "KvJW5jByaa", -1],
