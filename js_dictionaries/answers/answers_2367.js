In high school we labelled kids by the associations they had (I remember) like Drama kids, Goth Table, blah blah.. mostly obvious stuff.   If you are talking about a story like The Outsiders, I can see why you want to give them a label like 'greasers' and 'Soc's.' Westsider story had similar, but it wasnt any cooler than the last book, the jets and something else... i think. You could go on and on.  Even Romeo and Juliet, although it was family name and not a gang type name.   So these guys are cool- what makes them cool.  What do they do when they hang out?  that is pretty much where I would start. Good luck with your story, it sounds like fun.  I love to write!
