	104608 : ["to be honest i don't know the first thing about Vista, but i can point out some important differences between 95/98/me and NT/2000/XP. 95/98/me: based on a hybrid 16/32 bit core that attempts to integrate backwards compatability with legacy 16 bit (DOS) applications and drivers into a 32 bit environment.  sortof notorious for being unstable and difficult to support (hybrid cores are just too complex a design to be reliable). some important differences within this core's variants: Win95a -- Microsoft's first production release of Windows 95.  disk space was limited as disk volume addressing was 16 bit only.  no USB support.  added \"plug and play\" functionality, intended to automate driver installation and hardware resource assignment.  in practice, the 1st rendition of PnP lacked a reliable means of identifying hardware (and thus had no reliable mechanism for assigning the correct driver).  also lacking was a comprehensive driver library capable of handling most popular consumer devices. Win95b (OSR2) -- MS update to Win95.  primarily known for addition of FAT32 (32 bit disk volume addressing) enabling support for much larger disk volumes.  still no USB support (although USB support was later added to this release in what MS calls \"OSR2.1\"). Win98 - USB support (\"full\" speed only -- limited to 12 Mbps -- no high speed 400 Mbps USB2.0 until WinXP).  added support for AGP graphics (faster, dedicated graphics bus -- as compared to PCI graphics in Win95).  added support for IEEE1394 (firewire).  PnP driver library significantly extended, and some of the hardware identification issues resolved as hardware manufacturers collaberated with MS on a more consistently implemented PCI device identification scheme. Win98SE - essentially viewed as a \"non-update\" by the computer industry, many computer nerds (myself included) saw nothing of significance in Win98SE.  the only purpose of this release (as near as I can tell) was marketing -- MS putting something out there while customers anxiously awaited a new, more stable PC operating system. WinME - WinME can support creation of larger FAT32 disk partitions than previous versions of Windows.  several troubleshooting tools added to the aging 95/98 core.  significant UI \"window-dressing\" added to what is mostly just a series of patches for Win98.  with the WinXP release just around the corner, WinME is viewed as insignificant by many users. NT/2000/XP: single 32 bit core not designed for backwards compatability with legacy 16 bit DOS apps and drivers (though 2000 amd XP both include a DOS virtual machine that can run the simpler DOS applications).  much more stable than the Win95/98/me core. NT - Microsoft's first production release of a 32 bit core with no backwards compatability for 16 bit DOS drivers or applications.  makes use of a hardware abstraction layer designed to isolate hardware from applications.  this prevents apps from interoperating directly with hardware, but increases OS stability.  the only Windows OS that does not include a device manager for troubleshooting hardware and peripherals.  uses NTFS, a 32 bit storage addressing scheme with significantly better security and scalability features than FAT32.  marketed primarily to businesses, and released in two flavors (workstation and server). 2000 - like its predecessor, released in workstation and server versions.  the first MS production release to implement Active Directory (management tools designed to simplify organization and control of large quantities of corporate IT resources).  extensions to NTFS added security features and increased storage volume addressing limits.  device manager added to ease hardware and driver troubleshooting.  in many ways not a good fit for home users (and at its release, WinXP is still almost 2 years away). XP - the first MS production release to effectively handle both the needs of the corporate and home user.  extensions to active directory (also incorporated into Windows 2003 server) make IT management easier still.  lots of troubleshooting tools added, making WinXP PCs easier to support than their older Win2000 cousins.  NTFS functionality extended further, again adding security features and increasing volume addressing size limits.  viewed by many as the first fully mature Microsoft OS for the PC (\"fully mature\" meaning stable, easy to support, and capable of handling high performance peripherals).  forces each application instance to run in isolated, protected memory space, successfully preventing most application hangs from causing the OS (or other applications) to stop responding.  violation of protected memory rules (by issuing read/write calls outside of an app's assigned space) causes immediate termination of the offending application. after 6 years of tweaking, XP's PnP implementation is finally working as MS intended back in 1995.  universal device hardware ID strings allow any device that follows the PnP standard to identif", 9889, "lObEjUh1aa", 0],

	104621 : ["File Allocation Table (FAT) is a patented file system developed by Microsoft for MS-DOS and is the primary file system for consumer versions of Microsoft Windows up to and including Windows Me. FAT12 ------ This initial version of FAT is now referred to as FAT12. As a filesystem for floppy disks, it had a number of limitations: no support for hierarchical directories, cluster addresses were \"only\" 12-bits long (which made the code manipulating the FAT a bit tricky) and the disk size was stored as a 16-bit count of sectors, which limited the size to 32MB. Initial FAT16 ------------ In 1984 IBM released the PC AT, which featured a 20 MB hard disk. Microsoft introduced MS-DOS 3.0 in parallel. Cluster addresses were increased to 16-bit, allowing for a greater number of clusters (up to 65,517) and consequently much greater filesystem sizes. However, the maximum possible number of sectors and the maximum (partition, rather than disk) size of 32 MB did not change. Therefore, although technically already \"FAT16\", this format was not yet what today is commonly understood under this name. A 20 MB hard disk formatted under MS-DOS 3.0, was not accessible by the older MS-DOS 2.0. Of course, MS-DOS 3.0 could still access MS-DOS 2.0 style 8 KB cluster partitions. Finally in November 1987, in Compaq DOS 3.31, came what is today called the FAT16 format, with the expansion of the 16-bit disk sector index to 32 bits. The result was initially called the DOS 3.31 Large File System. Although the on-disk changes were apparently minor, the entire DOS disk code had to be converted to use 32-bit sector numbers, a task complicated by the fact that it was written in 16-bit assembly language. FAT32 ------- In order to overcome the volume size limit of FAT16, while still allowing DOS real-mode code to handle the format without unnecessarily reducing the available conventional memory, Microsoft decided to implement a newer generation of FAT, known as FAT32, with cluster counts held in a 32-bit field, of which 28 bits are currently used. In theory, this should support a total of approximately 268,435,438 (< 228) clusters, allowing for drive sizes in the range of 2 terabytes. However, due to limitations in Microsoft's scandisk utility, the FAT is not allowed to grow beyond 4,177,920 (< 222) clusters, placing the volume limit at 124.55 gigabytes, unless \"scandisk\" is not needed [3]. FAT32 was introduced with Windows 95 OSR2, although reformatting was needed to use it, and DriveSpace 3 (the version that came with Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98) never supported it. Windows 98 introduced a utility to convert existing hard disks from FAT16 to FAT32 without loss of data. In the NT line, support for FAT32 arrived in Windows 2000. NTFS  ------ NTFS or New Technology File System is the standard file system of Windows NT and its descendants: Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Windows versions 95, 98, 98SE and ME cannot natively read NTFS filesystems, although third-party utilities do exist for this purpose. NTFS replaced Microsoft's previous FAT file system, used in MS-DOS and early versions of Windows. NTFS has several improvements over FAT such as improved support for metadata and the use of advanced data structures to improve performance, reliability and disk space utilization plus additional extensions such as security access control lists and file system journaling. Its main drawback is its very limited support by non-Microsoft operating systems, since the exact specification is a trade secret of Microsoft.", 9888, "AA10035223", 1],
	104622 : ["A file allocation table is a list on a hard drive that tells the operating system where on the disk a file is physically located. A hard disk is broken up into small individual segments called clusters. A file may be stored in pieces in many different clusters, and they are not necessarily adjacent to each other. A cluster can be anywhere from 1 to 32 kilobytes, and each cluster can contain data from only one file. The file allocation table is set up when the drive is formatted. To change the drive's FAT, you will have to reformat the drive. FAT-16 is a virtually obsolete hard disk format wherein the cluster addresses in the file allocation table are 16 bits in length, which translates to a maximum of 65,536 clusters.  Large clusters can be used to increase the disk's capacity under FAT-16, but since two files can't share one cluster the tradeoff is that a lot of space can be wasted if the drive contains a lot of small files.  Because there are a relatively small amount of clusters, the capacity of a drive formatted for FAT-16 is rather small (only about 540 megabytes based on 8-kilobyte clusters). Introduced in one of the later versions of Windows 95, FAT-32 uses 32-bit cluster addresses. This increases the maximum number of clusters from 65,536 to just under 4.3 billion, translating to a maximum theoretical capacity of 2,000 gigabytes. (This is the theoretical limit of what a 32-bit file allocation table can support, and not what the other components of a hard disk drive can support.) A virtual file allocation table (VFAT) allows FAT-16 to support long file names and file names containing spaces. This original DOS FAT (which extended into the early versions of Windows) used an 8.3 format (up to eight characters for the file name, and up to three characters for the file extension, like \"autoexec.bat\" or \"readme.txt\"). NTFS (Windows NT Filesystem) is even more powerful than FAT-32. NTFS supports large files (up to four gigabytes for a single file) and has other performance and security features as well. One drawback is that a FAT-16 or FAT-32 operating system cannot interface with NTFS. This means that an operating system running FAT-32 on one drive or partition would not be able to see, read, write, execute, or otherwise access any files saved on an NTFS drive or partition.", 9888, "None", 0],
