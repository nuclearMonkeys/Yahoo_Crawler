They don't deserve the same physical status combat conditioned men do. 2.  I do not see a theme emerging in your first paragraph.  Your transition from personal physical attributes to Pearl Harbor is strange at best.  You need to figure out what your theme is going to be and then transition from personal physical attributes to training large groups of physcially different men in order to give them the most chance at surviving in unpredictable combat situations. 3.  You need to introduce some intangibles that affects the personal performance of others when organized as part of a bigger team or organization.  For instance, the following quote: \"The American Marines have it [pride], and benefit from it. They are tough, cocky, sure of themselves and their buddies. They can fight and they know it.\"   ---General Mark Clark, U.S. Army  An immeasurable value is placed on the above \"pride\" in an organization and can actually boost the normal performance of an individual to those \"superhuman\" levels you attribute to mere athletes.  For instance, the following quote demonstrates the value of \"esprit de corps\": \"There was always talk of espirit de corps, of being gung ho, and that must have been a part of it. Better, tougher training, more marksmanship on the firing range, the instant obedience to orders seared into men in boot camp.\"   --James Brady, columnist, novelist,  press secretary to President Reagan, television personality and Marine  Continue the above themes and draw out a thread in your essay on that intangible attribute instilled in soldiers and Marines due to their common training, past history, and desire to help their buddy.  Supporting quotes could be: \"My only answer as to why the Marines get the toughest jobs is because the average Leatherneck is a much better fighter. He has far more guts, courage, and better officers... These boys out here have a pride in the Marine Corps and will fight to the end no matter what the cost.  -- 2nd Lt. Richard C. Kennard, Peleliu, World War II  Again, this pride can be demonstrated among even the most average, physical specimen at any time during combat situations. One quote to support this thread:   \"Courage is endurance for one moment moreâ€¦\"  Unknown Marine Second Lieutenant in Vietnam  Other quotes supporting the common theme: \"Why in hell can't the Army do it if the Marines can. They are the same kind of men; why can't they be like Marines.\"  Gen. John J. \"Black Jack\" Pershing, USA; 12 February 1918  Irrespective of combat experience in enhancing otherwise normal physcial abilities, consider the following quote from a common housewife: \"Everything becomes a little clearer, I realize what life is all about. It's hangin' on when your heart has had enough, It's giving more when you feel like giving up\". ~ In My Daughter's Eyes, Martina McBride  My final advice is to pick a clear, identifiable point, and then hammer it home with as many examples as you can show. Then summarize it nicely at the end. This  approach, if you can master it, will you serve you well in your future endeavors. If you use any of my advice,  I would be please to get a copy of your final essay.  Remember, many drafts may be required before you have it the way you want it.  Don't stop at the first few.
