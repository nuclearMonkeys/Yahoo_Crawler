	116332 : ["What women truly want is what they are genetically predisposed to want in a man, and all of the social engineering that has been done has only made women (and men) quite unhappy and dysfunctional. The sissification of males is predominantly a disease of white people or those that are at least somewhat affluent, while the vast majority of people are unaffected by the mad raving of lesbian supremacists to a degree. The reason that the homosexuals always target women is that they are weak, easily duped, and easily controlled, and this is why women almost never know what they truly want and need, but when they see a healthy man who refuses to bow down to the evil of homosexual supremacists they can't help but feel a strong sexual attraction. I'm an aging and balding middle-aged guy, but I still attract beautiful young women, and what they tell me is that they like my aggressiveness, strong will, and naturally-dominant attitude and this has never changed for me. I've been told by young women that I have a strong personality, but it is obvious that they are also very attracted to me because of my large muscles and certain structural features like my very broad shoulders and large barrel chest, and my deep voice.

	116351 : ["Well, I'm still an active, temple worthy \"Mormon\" but I'll tell you some of what goes on in there. We all dress in white and speak reverently, for it is a sacred place, where God can dwell.  White represents the purity we obtain through faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to his Gospel laws. The person who spoke (above) about the baptismal font was right.  I performed baptisms by proxy in the temple since I was 12.  It was always a very peaceful, spiritual experience, which didn't feel weird at all. In addition to that, we have sealings, in which we kneel around and hold hands over a cushioned sacred alter.   This page has an example of what a sealing room can look like:   My family got sealed in this way... all my brothers and sisters came to the temple to be sealed to my parents as a family for eternity.  There were mirrors on both walls, so when you and your family looks in those mirrors, its like seeing yourselves go on for eternity.  After we got sealed, all my brothers and sisters and parents hugged. Not all my brothers and sisters were active \"Mormons\" at the time.  When children are sealed to parents in this way, only the parents need to be temple worthy.... so in other words, the \"secrets\" of the temple were quite open to be seen by my brothers and sisters who were \"ex-Mormons\". As for the endowment, this is an ordinance where we promise to obey the law of chastity (ie to only have sex with our husband/wife) and to serve God and his children with everything that we have - talents, time and possessions.  During the endowment, we all sit in comfortable seats in a room and watch a video about the creation and the purpose of life.  This video includes many references to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and Saviour of the world. The video is the same, every time we do an endowment.  It could be likened to sitting in meditation, as the things we learn in the temple are primarily given to us through direct revelation from God, through the Holy Spirit.  The video is just a tool to direct our thoughts in the right directions.   A temple experience by someone not spiritually prepared wouldn't provide them with these deep spiritual insights.  It might be very boring for them. Apart from these ordinances, we also spend time in the temple meditating, praying, etc.  We can come with prayerful questions, to seek and receive guidance to problems that we have in our lives. The rituals that go on the temple of God are holy and sacred, and they are available for anyone to receive, provided they meet the prerequisites.  Heavenly Father wants all of his children to obtain temple blessings. Let me ask you a question:  Does the university allow people to start studying a subject before they have met the pre-requisites?  The university I attend (a secular one, BTW) doesn't allow children on campus.  Why?  Because the children would disrupt the learning of others, and would be unlikely to comprehend what the lecturers were trying to say. God bless.", 10455, "s37fnYJ4aa", 12],
