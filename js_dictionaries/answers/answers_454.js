	24944 : ["There were no Marxist in the global warming section, despite all the claims over the years.Â  You guys are so extreme right, that even moderate republicans are considered left wing.. Marxism is a social, political, and economic theory originated by Karl Marx, which focuses on the struggle between capitalists and the working class.Â Â  Marx wrote that the power relationships between capitalists and workers were inherently exploitative and would inevitably create class conflict.Â  He believed that this conflict would ultimately lead to a revolution in which the working class would overthrow the capitalist class and seize control of the economy. I don't think Marxism is a good thing, but if you want to play this game and continue to argue indirectly that pollution is one of the cornerstones of capitalism (it isn't) you only make yourself look ignorant and strengthen the arguments of those who do think Marxism is a good thing.Â  (Their argument is that capitalism needs to be destroyed before it destroys us)", 3945, "ZcgSovspaa", -1],

The two don't always go hand in hand but think about it. Your break-through won't do a heck of a lot of good if you can't write it up. Some of the jobs might not be obvious. I spent some time working in Packaging R&D for a large company. One of the projects was testing alternative packages in order to save a gram or two of plastic per package. It doesn't sound like all that much until you multiply it by the number of packages sold. It was a VERY large company, doing business worldwide. That work had the potential to save petroleum (for the plastic), power (it led to a new test procedure that was faster than the old one), and space in landfills taken up by spoiled product.

	24949 : ["Hence the watermelon handle. Some find it ironic that the \"solution\" to American made GLobal Warming we all gonna die......\" was formulated by K Marx long before the \"crisis\" was even \"discovered\". Hardly a coincidence that the same \"solution\" applies to ALL the \"crises\" we have been seeing over the last 100 or so years. . \"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.\" (H. L. Mencken.) \"Never let a crisis go to waste\" - Rahm EmanuelÂ  (swiped from Saul Alinsky website).", 3947, "zbdlJsqfaa", 1],
	24950 : ["The Global Warming hoax originated from an United Nations department the IPCC. This COVID 19 fiasco originated from the same source under WHO. The COVID PCR pandemic is now the weapon of mass destruction, with the scandalous use of the PCR test the smoking gun. The cycle threshold (CT) which is the duplication series used to detect a virus or virus fragments can be easily manipulated. When over 25 cycles are used any virus detected are dead bits or pieces not all infectious. The West mainly the US was using an unheard of 40 duplication cycles therefore getting false positive results and producing CASES. The PCR test also cannot tell what kind of virus has been detected. This is where the lying and misrepresentation of facts begin and distortion of Â the facts by the malicious mainstream media. At present the CT threshold is at about 30 cycles and that is the reason the cases have come down. Therefore, increase the CT threshold = increased cases = lockdowns. The RT Vaccines is another nightmare.", 3947, "VFGJWC04aa", 0],
