Again, for some people, they have always had someone to hold and be happy - they know nothing else . And then some people can be alone and happy.

	98686 : ["No, a relationship does not make your happiness. Happiness has to come from within you.  You have to be happy with yourself--with your looks, your abilities, your attitudes--that's what really is happiness.  If you are happy with who and what you are, that will reflect in your demeanor.  The way you smile, the way you walk, talk, etc.  And the only way to find that is by finding out who you are, and that is done by spending the time to find that out......in the long run you can only have a happy relationship if you are able to give happiness, and you only can do this if you are happy from within. As far as your ex is concerned, I would not judge.  There are guys out there who have to have a woman to validate themselves, no matter what.  They are insecure and insecurity leads to a controlling attitude on their part.  A guy who knows who and what he is in life, what his limitations are, and who works on his goals will not tell you what you must have.  He will respect that you know what you need and leave you alone about it.  On the other hand, one who tries to tell you what you need AFTER it is done and over with, feels that he needs to be in control---so do what you have to.  Go out, have fun, go to the gym, and date again when you are ready, not because anyone is trying to tell you that this is something you MUST do.", 9665, "AA12303050", 0],

It doesn't take penetration to achieve fertilization. Pre-ejaculate could have easily been involved, or any sort of sexual relation for that matter; if any amount of semen touched her vulva at any given time, a pregnancy was possible (granted, the chances were slim, but it's not unheard of).

	98707 : ["basically, nothing. the baby will get all it need from you. you might get tired or sick but the baby will be ok. Do breastfeeding mothers need extra calories? In general, you should simply listen to your body and eat to appetite - this is usually all you need to do to get the calories you need. When exclusively nursing a young baby, it is very common to feel hungry much of the time... listen to your body. Mothers of older babies may feel hungrier when baby temporarily increases his or her milk intake (for example, during a growth spurt)... again, listen to your body. Counting calories is rarely necessary unless you are having problems maintaining a healthy weight. If you really want (or need) to count calories... Studies have shown that most healthy breastfeeding women maintain an abundant milk supply while taking in 1800-2200 (or more) calories per day. Consuming less than 1500-1800 calories per day (most women should stay at the high end of this range) may put your milk supply at risk, as may a sudden drop in caloric intake.

Example, the next time she wants a ride, tell her that you don't like how she never pitches in for gas and won't take her anywhere anymore unless she pitches in. You pretty much have to ignore her personal relationships, unless she does something that endangers the BF, in which case you should raise some flags.

	98716 : ["In this plan, we must think of our purpose. The scriptures promise us two things, Immortality and Eternal Life. Many religions blur the difference but they are two different things. Immortality is living forever while Eternal Life is living forever with God. The plan also redirects us to Jesus.  Jesus suffering for our sins in Gethsemane and upon the Cross was essential for both parts. For us to return with God, we must be perfect. He is a perfect being and we cannot dwell with him unless we are also. We would all sin and someone must suffer the price of those sins so that can repent of our sins and be made perfect. That is why Jesus suffered and died for us. As we can all agree, our bodies are not perfect. To be able to dwell with God, we would have to have a perfect body. That is why Jesus instituted the resurrection.  We can all be resurrected so that we can have a perfect body so the that we can live with God again. From the beginning, God has commanded his followers to make sacrifices, That has been since the time of Adam and Eve that they have offered up sacrifices. They have always been to show praise and gratitude to God. They are also representative and foreshadow the sacrifice which Jesus would make upon the cross. After Jesus was crucified, he said that the Law was fulfilled and that they no longer needed to make sacrifices anymore, for Jesus was the Great and Eternal sacrifice. After such, he asked us to make a sacrifice of a broken hear and contrite spirit, or sorrow for our sins and humility enough to turn to Him and repent. As people have strayed away from the teachings of Jesus, they have sometimes warped their traditions as they were passed on. Animal sacrifices was one of those traditions that got twisted and warped. They started making sacrifices to strange and unknown Gods.  Hope that helps. Ask if you have any more questions.", 9668, "VDcVtJVpaa", 0],
