I also like St. Mark, for his Gospel.  If you read it like a story that would be heard around a campfire, it is really neat.

	59838 : ["Jews  There are various denominations within Judaism.  The Reform, Conservative and Orthodox agree that Saturday is the Sabbath, the day that G-d stopped working after creating the world in 6 days, but there are various degrees as to how people actually observe the Sabbath.  Some will go to work, or do chores around the house but the religious (Orthodox) do not do any type of work including household chores from Sundown Friday night, to about an hour after sundown Saturday night.   hope this answers your question.", 8055, "None", 1],

	59840 : ["Does MLB tv count? I'm saying it does, so B for me. I didn't get MLB tv until July so I missed a lot of games during the beginning of the season. Also if I was away from my computer or was doing other stuff, I wasn't able to watch.  BQ: I've seen the Red Sox 4 times this year, sadly none of those have been at Fenway.", 8054, "GU3dlxILaa", 2],
	59841 : ["I would say somewhere inbetween A and B. It is mostt definitely more than 65%. I'm a huge Yankee fan and I love to bet on them which means I watch almost all of their games. However, there are times when I can only catch the last few innings or maybe even the first few depending on the situation.  BQ - I've been to Yankee stadium 3 times ( all wins ) and I've been to Baltimore twice to see them. (Arod's first game off the DL where he went deep, and recently when they scored 7 in the top of 9th.) 5-0 baby!", 8054, "XtDoOPM7aa", 1],
	59842 : ["The only differance between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage", 8056, "QhGdY27yaa", 2],
	59843 : ["A martyr's intentions are very different from a suicidal person. The martyr is fighting in a battle and knows there is a (big) chance he can die.  It is not his intention to die, but rather to fight.  And it is not his intention to fight in order to die, but rather to end some sort of injustice (unless of course he's on the wrong side).  Remember, he does not become a martyr unless he dies; that's what makes him a martyr.  So that person doesn't go with the intention of dying because he doesn't know for sure that he will die.  There is the possibility that he can still survive the fight, and at no point does he try to want to kill himself. On the other hand, a suicidal person's sole intention is to end life (probably because it sucks).  There is no other motive.", 8056, "ajIe3bbEaa", -1],
	59844 : ["Yes! I'm Muslim and don't believe in double-standards. But then that's OK. Look at what the Christians have done. I believe that Islam is following the footsteps of Christianity. The two world wars...... do you think it was a 'gift' of Islam? the crusades...... do you think it to be the handiwork of Muslims? Every religion is out to seek power, political power. Therefore, Islam is no different.", 8059, "751e8eda4be2fcdef4baeb51cb78a69aaa", 0],
	59845 : ["Isn't it the ultimate goal of any religion i.e Christian Relgion? The God's religion always invites others to good and forbidd evil, so it's expected from Islam to invite others to the True Path!", 8059, "266faf01fc038aa504a132b780d9b24aaa", 0],

	59853 : ["Jesus was not an Essene. The Essenes lived totally separately from the rest of the Jewish community and followed entirely different rules. It is thought that James, brother of Jesus, may have been a member of this group, and may indeed have been the 'teacher of righteousness' referred to in the material found at Qumran. Since you are interested in this topic, I recommend the highly thought provoking and intriguing work by Hyam Maccoby, if you haven't already looked at it. He wrote several books and most can be found online. One of his theories, for which he offers considerable 'evidence', is that in fact, Jesus was a Pharisee - certainly many of his views coincided with theirs. edit Jesus never 'taught' in the Synagogues. He was not a Rabbi - there WERE NO Rabbis until later in Jewish history.  I realise that the Christian scriptures may say Jesus 'taught' in the Synagogues, but they were compiled and written decades after his death and by people who never knew him. Jesus was one of many young Jewish preachers claiming to be the maschiach. He taught BASIC Torah - 'love thy neighbour' appears first in the Torah thousands of years before it was incorporated into Christianity. www.jewishanswerstochristianquestions.com", 8058, "8I9uduIiaa", 2],

	59858 : ["I think that's Seventh Day Adventist, but all I know is that they go to church on Saturday -- I don't know if they observe the Sabbath by not working. And the obvious answer is Jewish people.", 8055, "AA10325844", 0],
	59859 : ["Just so everyone knows: You know the designated, named, days of the week are simply for logistical reasons. The word Sabbath is a general term, as are many in the Bible, open to interpenetration by the reader.

	59860 : ["C. And I actually watched more of my old favorite team this year than I have in years past. Usually I only watch some spring training ball because it's spring, and spring and baseball just mix. I also usually watch the first few weeks of the regular season. But by about mid-May at the latest, I stop watching. But this year I started watching again in August, and it helped me develop a fervent passion for baseball that I still carry. I have watched one game live this year. But it was a Triple-A minor league game early in the season. There's no major league team within 200 miles of my hometown.", 8054, "f8ergp2Kaa", 1],
	59861 : ["90-100% The only games I've missed are when I went away to Maryland but I did see the Sox play down there they beat the Orioles 18-10. I also went to Fenway this year, it was against NYY, NYY ripped us apart 20-11, I can proudly admit I stayed for the whole thing. The best game I've ever seen in my life was the Clay Buchholz no hitter in 2007 that was my very first game.", 8054, "W6ulhc89aa", 1],

	59866 : ["the Summer Land is Not the Wiccan equivalent for Heaven, really.  Pagans in general (which include Wicca) don't subscribe to the Christian concept of either heaven or hell.  The Summer Land is a place you go to live another life after death.  It is neither heaven nor hell, nor is it necessarily eternal.  Many believe the Summer Land is a place of rest and learning between earthly lives.  There is no one belief about the Afterlife among pagans.", 8061, "AA11403222", 2],
	59867 : ["The cool thing about us is that you can ask 50 different wiccans/pagans/witches what they think of something and get 50 different answers with a lot of the same threads.  I agree with what everyone else has said on here.  The Summerland is simply a place to rest between re-incarnating into another life.   I don't believe in Satan, therefore I do not believe in Hell.   I believe that humans create their own personal Hell's for themselves every day on Earth, and that there are those who chose to live in it and those who chose to get as far away from that as possible.", 8061, "AA11642128", 0],

	59869 : ["I would think this has more to do with the congregational style and if the denom. is more ritualized, than anything. Conducting a worship service is a challenge, and I can usually tell if the Pastor knows what he's doing. But, knowing what the desired end result should be, I think the only way to guage the effectiveness of the work would be to look for the fruit in the lives of the hearers, not if someone is saying Amen. I've seen zombies in every denom. I've visited. And I started off in a Catholic church. The first one to actually explain Christ's work to me happened to be a Catholic priest...that's something the Southern Baptists hated to hear me say. Just thought I'd add that.", 8060, "6f0e45a91719820a0d453b3ba6acce13aa", 4],
	59870 : ["Do ALL Christian churches practice the \"Do I get an Amen\" question when the pastor is preaching the sermons? Are pastors asking this question even hinting that the hearers have no idea what they are believing, or that the hearers have no idea what they are believing? The answer is a resounding NO! You are confused between the AFFIRMATION of a belief and the DETERMINATION of a belief. BTW, does responding to a question means that one is brainwashed? It can be easily argued that those who respond on que (without being asked to do so) are also brainwashed.", 8060, "2a8f78f0fc32ec39a9507d321bd66da1aa", 0],
	59871 : ["It's a theory that has been discussed at length since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, though now there are some who deny the very existence of the Essenes.

Figure, 5.00 for Turnpike tolls (if you're coming in from Jersey) 10.00 to get across the GW and then another 20.00 to park the car, you're already 35.00 in the hole.

BQ: Only one, it is the first time since I was a child that I haven't gone to 8 or more games. And here's the clincher-the game I went to was at the Metrodome. It is solely because of my husband's work schedule, and I really don't want to drive 3 hours to Milwaukee by myself even for the great reward of the Brewers.
