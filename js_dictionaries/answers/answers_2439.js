Modern day apes, monkeys AND humans (yes you) all evolved from the same branch of evolution. Why is it so hard for people to accept that evolution thru NATURAL SELECTION is realy? It really happened. All life on this planet shares a common chemical heritage. Even you should know this, all life is made of 4 basic ingredients, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Carbon.

	127789 : ["I think I know 3 of them. Personally.    No. I do not agree with that theory. Far too one sided towards the negative. The thing about that picture is that three of the figures imply violence. A bone, a spear, and a rifle. There is also a shovel with blood on it. What does that signify? A violation of the environment perhaps?  Does the pig imply that mankind is little more than a selfish creature capable of only the most base emotions and actions? The bloated man is also there. Why? Consumerism and  laziness are not intended products of an advanced civilization.  But it does happen. In order for man to become so bloated there needs to be both peace and prosperity. If humanity were truly hell bent on self destruction, the fat man would certainly be a prime target for practice and of little other importance.  There is a missing element as well. A woman. It has been said that the only war ever truly justified was the Trojan war because it was fought over a woman, Helen.", 10950, "RnwrEcY5aa", 3],
	127790 : ["You have a degree in SCIENCE? I find this hard to believe, because if you did, you would recognize that the word \"theory\" is not an idea that hasn't been proven. That would be a hypothesis. A Theory is a hypothesis for which significant and verifiable evidence has been found. A tested hypothesis, which has been repeated, or has a great body of evidence suporting it becomes a theory. A theory is a working model based on significant evidence and testing. \"Atomic theory\" is one such \"theory\" which is used today. It is a \"theory\" that if sufficient fissionable material is compressed into a small area, that it will explode. As this is simply a theory, would you dare to sit beside such a device as the counter goes down to zero? It is a \"theory\" that polarizing filters at the correct angle will polarize light by aligning the polarity. It is a theory that liquid crystals will act as this sort of filter. This theory is used to create liquid crystal displays. If you've got an LCD monitory, you're simply watching a \"theory\". I have a science background as well. My last job was as an engineer developing test equipment for MEMS \"micro-electro-mechanical systems\". I worked with \"theories\" that are used to deploy airbags in automobiles. I worked with \"laws\" and \"facts\" as well. There is little difference between the three with the exception that \"laws\" have been proved for thousands of years. If the \"law\" of gravity had been found perhaps 50 years ago, it would still be called a \"theory\". The hypothesis came about when the apple fell from the tree. After many expirements, it was called a \"law\". You won't hear of an \"atomic law\" as the word \"theory\" is its modern (almost) equivalent. Your understanding of evolution is flawed as well. In saying we don't see creatures evolving, you are missing the point. We are ALL evolving. No theory of evolution claims that humans came from monkeys, but that humans and monkeys had a common ancestor. And further back, humans and monkeys and dolphins, etc. all had a common ancestor. Creatures existing now didn't come from each other... they had common ancestors that were different than each.
