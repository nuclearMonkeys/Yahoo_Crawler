	132773 : ["Cross training and CO-training are different things. Cross training implies that your two arts contradict each other, i.e. learning TKD and Muay Thai together, the kicks are totally different, so learning GOOD technique in TKD is actually teaching you BAD habits for Muay Thai. Or western wrestling and brazilian jiu jitsu, BJJ is comfortable and in control on your back, western wrestling never wants to be on their back. Learning to instinctively pull guard for BJJ might mean you give up back points in a wrestling match, or giving your back to a BJJ opponent will likely mean you get choked out. Contradictory techniques. Co-training, i.e. training a striking art and a grappling art at the same time, usually won't teach you any contradictory techniques. TKD and Judo would be a good mix. The ONLY problem I can see is that TKD and Judo stances are pretty different, so you'll need to focus on being in the proper stance for each sport independently. If you ever fight in an MMA match, you'll need to find a hybrid stance (usually closer to the TKD stance) that works for you.", 11156, "eYyOxxoKaa", 0],

By taking two arts you will have to split your training time between the two therefore it will take you longer. This is provided that the two arts are not going to interfere with each other. If they are then they will slow you down even more and you will be struggling even more. In the beginning all martial arts are 'easy'. There is not a lot of material you have yet but I found that the more I advance the more there is to keep up with and train in. What was a two to three times a week undertaking at white belt quickly increased in spending time training and now at black belt I train almost every day several hours and I feel I am not doing enough. Every answer raises more questions to research and each answer needs to be incorporated into my physical training it is a never ending task. While I cross train with several teachers my goal is to improve my Karate. I can not even imagine training like this in two styles. Also if I am not mistaken judo does teach striking techniques but they are advanced techniques so you won't get them until you are several years into the training. I am not real sure about Wing Chun but I think it has ground fighting too but I do not know at what level they teach that. You might want to visit a few Judo and Wing Chun schools and do some research on the styles so you can compare and make good decisions choosing good schools. The last thing you want to do is end up in a school that only teaches parts of a style and partial techniques.", 11156, "cK1QBHP5aa", 0],

Special Ops, regardless of service, require top flight strength, endurance and intelligence. Probably helps if you know another language as well. These are guys that are recruited by the CIA while they are still in. VERY difficult to get into.  The difference between an SF Soldier and Recon Marine is not fighting ability, strength or efficiency . It is mental and almost spiritual. Strictly speaking, the normal SF Soldier is a professional. They are trained as professionals often are. Hard and well. They do their job effeciently and surgically.  The Recon Marines on the other hand do it through intense mental indoctrination that makes them believe that they are the best instruments of death that God has ever created. This may or may not be true but it gives the average Marine a zealot like fanatacism that puts fear into the enemy.  The Army has courageous heroes.
