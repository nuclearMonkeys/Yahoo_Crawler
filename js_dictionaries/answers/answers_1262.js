Also, if you're drinking a good beer, pouring it in a glass releases alot of the aromas and tastes! Plus, I've noticed that I burp less, and can drink faster if I pour it in a glass first! :-) Having said that, if I am at a party, or at a picnic, and they don't have glasses, or are running low, I have NO problem drinking out of the can!

	68665 : ["Having read other of your answers, I am amazed at how misinformed you are. You really need to check out where you are getting your information from, if you want to really understand what is going on. I suggest you listen to some informed talk radio—the Thom Hartmann show. He's a fine educator, too. You would have to listen to him for maybe a few months, though, to learn some of what he knows. He's a good historian and really explains how we came to be in the state we are in. It gets you to really understand—it's not just a lot of talking points and jokes like Fox \"News\" is.  I know that people of your type say, \"But that was so long ago, and you can't blame it on that,\" but President Bush entered us into two wars (bad mistakes) and did not calculate the cost of these wars, which went on for years, into what seemed to be the national debt. When President Obama took office, the first thing he did was to make the national debt correct, by adding the cost of those wars. That made it more easy to figure out what we are faced with, but it made is seem that suddenly our country was far more in debt under Obama than under Bush. But the Republicans never explained that, they just kept pointing at the new national debt under Obama. That is the kind of thing the Republicans do, to hide what they are doing with our country—which is to help the rich (they are the rich) become richer. (I hate to have to write so much, but this situation is dire, and it isn't simple to explain. You will need to continue this research on your own.) Have you seen the statistics on what has happened to the distribution of wealth in our country? Statistics like 40% of the new wealth in the last year was gained by 1% of the population. This is due to the shipping of jobs overseas, the continual creation of corporations which wipe out small businesses in multiple towns.  They don't have to pay their workers as much as mom and pop stores. And I'm not talking about Walmart. I'm talking about how our businesses have built scores of factories overseas, in Bangladesh (remember the fire and the stories about the working conditions?) and Indonesia, poor sections of China, Mexico, South American countries, and other poor nations. Then, because Reagan did away with tariffs,. which made it cost too much for goods to be just shipped into our country, from where they could make it more cheaply. See, our American corporations are not FOR America and Americans. They are out for themselves. They see the world as their field now, they are citizens of the world. So yes, they employ people and create jobs. Overseas. You know, I'm sure, how many factories have left towns all around America devastated—all the residents had worked at the factory, which the corporation had set up in another country. THEY say it's the fault of the unions, but you know how unions got started. I remember it well. Grindingly awful working conditions, child labor, low wages, lo-o-ong hours —\"I owe my life to the company store,\" (those days, the days that Johnny Cash sang about)  We needed unions to counteract the greed of the Bosses. It balanced it out. America became affluent, and after WWII we got happy. Under Eisenhower, the rich paid much higher taxes than they do now, and our trade policies were balanced. But the rich are never satisfied, they always manipulate themselves into being able to screw the working people AND THAT INCLUDES THE MIDDLE CLASS, be sure you know that. Of which I am a member, and perhaps you are too. (If YOU are rich and know all this stuff I am talking about, shame!)  What took the cake in terms of unregulated capitalistic greed wall the Wall Street crash of 2008—caused by the crazy rules of Wall Street, with its strange insurance against investments that if the investment lost, and you bet on the correct side, you could win a lot of money. I can hardly understand how that ever came to be. People would bet against stocks they were investing in, and then manipulate someone to make sure the stock would fail, and get the money. Still happening. Bad mortgages that had been sold to people who were not going to be able to hold onto them and whose houses were going to be foreclosed on were bundled in with other investments and sold, incorrectly described as premium. Lots of money was made through manipulation and lies. Unregulated banks, which used to be regulated, got into shady investments and arrangements, and made a ton of money—but some of them FAILED!  The main thing that I see going on here is this argument between the rich folks that believe in unregulated capitalism, and the people who do not trust in the morals of rich investors and wheeler-dealers, and understand that, as a country that was founded to uphold the common good (that means everybody) we need to keep an eye on unscrupulous people. Yes, they are smart, and no they are not moral. To them, people are only pawns to help them make money. You must know this by now. Capitalism in a democracy must be a regulated capitalism. There are ALWAYS people, in every country, that are determined to rise to the top, and gain all the power and money that they can, and screw anyone they have to use to do so. Sometimes it may feel like, okay, so if they can do it, let them. But it doesn't work, mainly because those people are sociopathic—they don't care if people died in their factories, they don't care if people are ousted from their homes. More power to them for their cleverness, but they must be watched and regulated to keep them from being dishonest. It's just the way it is. And don't call me a communist, the very same thing has always happened in communist countries.  And this is what is going on now in our country. It's so sad to me to hear people like you who have heard some things that make sense to them, and then who spread these opinions around. The Republicans are so rich they can buy the best propagandists around. They even have their own TV station, Fox. I remember when it was said that the Tea Party was formed as a grass-roots movement. But it was not a grass roots movement. Fox news, and Rupert Murdoch, who owned Fox (right?) started the whole thing and SAID it was a grass roots movement. You should be careful of the kind of information you get from people who lie like that.  So anyway, I don't even know if you will bother to read this, but know that if you don't, and if you just have a few talking points in your mind to repeat and feel good about yourself, feeling that you are helping the US in doing so—you are not helping the United States. You are helping only the something hundred families that own most of the wealth in our country. When it was good, this unequal distribution of wealth was not the case. I remember in the 1950s when, the war being over, everyone was buying a little house, and even a little summer house, and a boat and two cars instead of one. Those were different times, in a regulated capitalism. I want this kind of capitalism to be brought back—the kind where more people can have better jobs, because their won't be being performed in a poor country, leaving them with no job.  And those people who just can't work, who are poor, there will be fewer of them, and we will help them, as we should, for the common good. And then they will buy things, and so on. And we should have single payer health care. For profit companies that are supposed to be for helping people don't work—because they are always trying to squeeze the people they are trying to help.
