Next draw all the points from the center to each vertex (where the sides intersect) and you should see 8 congruent isosceles triangles. Area of a triangle is (1/2)*base*height so find the area of one triangle and multiply by 8 to get the area of the octagon. The base of the triangle is the side length (from your picture) so the question is to find the height. The vertex angle can be found by dividing 360 by 8 (from your picture) = 45. Then draw a height from the vertex to the base which should split the vertex angle into two congruent angles of 22.5 and the base in half. Since you have a right triangle, you use the sine ratio to get an expression that relates the base and the height. sin(22.5) = 5 / height and so the height = 5 / sin(22.5).
