	39555 : ["The Royal Family name and Royal House Name is Windsor. In 1917, George V officially adopted the name. Before that, royals had a Royal House Name, but not necessarily a surname, since royals used titles as names. The Royal House Name had been Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. But after German cousin Kaiser Wilhelm bombed London using 24 twin-engined Gotha war planes, George V was angry with Germany, its leaders, eventhough some were cousins. The British-born George, son of the British-born Edward VII, stripped all his relatives who wished to live in Britain  of all foreign titles, replacing them with British ones. He chose Windsor as the family name as well as Royal House Name--after his favorite residence. The royal family's allegiance is with the UK and its people, not to Germany, not to Nazis. The use of the name Schicklgruber, associated with Hitler's father and grandmother, is a trolling attempt to say the British royals are Nazis. They are not. They fought against Germany in two world wars. To imply otherwise is lying, and ignorant, tasteless trolling.", 5805, "Iqp3ZUAlaa", 1],

Here's more information on what you asked about: Special guests Several celebrities and notables have appeared on Yahoo! Answers to ask questions. These users have an \"official\" badge below their avatar and on their profile page. During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Barack Obama, and Mitt Romney posted questions on Yahoo! Answers, in addition to YouTube. In an awareness campaign, \"UNICEF Up Close 2007\", nine UNICEF ambassadors asked questions. The launch of Answers on Yahoo! India included a question from A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India at that time. Other guests have included international leaders (Queen Rania of Jordan, candidate for United Nations Secretary-General Shashi Tharoor), Nobel Peace Prize laureates (Al Gore, Muhammad Yunus) and other international activists (Bono, Jean-Michel Cousteau), intellectuals (Stephen Hawking, Marilyn vos Savant), and numerous other celebrities.", 5795, "AA11252878", 7],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint VyacheslavKrasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 5795, "None", 0],

West of there, to Lvov and surrounding areas should be safe. EDIT: I looked thru TASS news and Googled Ukraine and of course got conflicting OPINION of right and wrong in the \"occupation\" of Donbass and Crimea. After a deadly coup, regardless if the vote to join Russia was \"real\" or not is meaningless. There has been no violence in Crimea, only tons of aid to rebuild the area. I suggest you Google on the areas you wish to visit and select \"news\" to see what is going on there. I think if you avoid Donbass, Lugansk and Donetsk areas, you will be OK. As for Crimea, if you get a chance, DO go there. Remember though, IT IS RUSSIAN TERRITORY and you will need a Russuan visa for entry.
