	45452 : ["I make an Asian style ginger salad dressing and use a whole orange in it. Peel, pith seeds and all gets chopped up into little pieces and is eaten on salad, chicken, sashimi, whatever! Might give your juice a bit of a different taste. The zest (outer peel) will add a very nice orange flavor, and the pith will probably not be noticed at all.  It wont hurt a the to try.

	45456 : ["White bread is jacked up with carbs which turns into sugar and processed meat has a ton of preservatives, so nobody said Subway was \"HEALTHY\", just more than McDonald's. Subway's meat is actually tasty, unlike Cousin's, but Cousin's bread is insanely better than Subway's. Jimmy John's is like the BEST, but Suburpia is GOD!!! Grew up with a Suburpia in West Allis, then when they reopened in Tosa, people from Illinois were traveling here for them.

Meat is a great way to get a concentrated dose of protein with little effort, but one can get all the protein one needs without consuming meat.", 6526, "ScoO0wbuaa", 0],
	45462 : ["chick peas, quinoa, tofu, buckwheat, chia seeds, cereals, rice and beans, seeds, peanut butter. Those are some options but being vegan isn't necessarily healthy even though you think it might be \"helping the environment.\"  Vegan diets lack nutrients in these particular: Vitamin B12 Calcium Iron Zinc Iodine Essential fatty acids (long chain) EPA and DHA (essential for brain health) Proteins, essential for neurotransmitters (brain function) and healthy tissues Fat soluble vitamins A and D, very important for brain and hormonal health (Also taking a bunch of supplements to try and \"replace\" those things isn't really good. Taking loads of supplements isn't healthy at all.) Vegans may also replace the calories from protein sources with refined carbohydrates including bread, crackers, and cookies. Over-consuming carbohydrates can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, blood sugar dysregulation, and other troublesome symptoms.", 6526, "None", 1],
	45463 : ["It gets pretty complicated.  The actual reference in the USA is in 21CFR101.22.  I would bet that Canada's laws are similar.    The definition of spice is:2) The term spice means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in § 182.10 and part 184 of this chapter, such as the following:Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour, Nutmeg, Oregano, Paprika, Parsley, Pepper, black; Pepper, white; Pepper, red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, Turmeric.Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, shall be declared as \"spice and coloring\" unless declared by their common or usual name.The code goes on to say that:(h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:(1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as \"spice\", \"natural flavor\", or \"artificial flavor\", or any combination thereof, as the case may be.", 6527, "None", 1],
	45464 : ["As others have said, they can get away with generic \"herbs and spices\", which is a problem.  I'm allergic to onions, and they often get grouped under \"herbs and spices\".  I belong to an online support group for people with onion and allium allergies, and what we've found is that if you contact a manufacturer and ask about specific allergens, like alliums, they will tell you if the allergen is present or not.  We've been collecting this info and sharing it so that people know which products are safe.  I'm one of the lucky ones - onions just make me really sick, but I don't go into anaphylactic shock or anything.  But it's still a nasty way to find out too late that what you ate had an allergen in it. ", 6527, "None", 2],

	45466 : ["It, at least seems, cheaper. When you walk past a $23 roast and think about the $15 of other stuff added to it, you can become intimidated by a $40 (long) quick lunch at home. Even when that $40 actually feeds 7 people for 3 days, but that's a business, not a psychology issue. For the end-user shopper, $40 roast vs a $6 pizza is a clear decision. But moreover, these products are heavily marketed and crafted to be desired. I've seen people eat real, fresh food and sneak out afterwards to get McDonald's. Home cooking doesn't give you the high that 37 doctorate holders worked their whole lives to give you, in so many words, by design.  The latest development, as of a decade or so now, is the ready meal. A large portion of a supermarket's sales can come from that cold case with the clamshell chicken wings and sandwiches by the front door. We were moving into cities at an exponential rate where, like areas where density is high, some people rely on eating out. In the West, we are somewhere between 1300s pubs and some dude with a pocket grill on the sidewalk in Ho Chi Minh city. We go to Kroger to get microwave signature rotisserie chicken. The peak of this time was Feb 2019 with an all time record high DOW; then... COVID. Which makes me wonder out loud to the economics guy if population density and thus a high economy has one limit; disease. We can theoretically achieve a singularity of sorts concerning the economy, however, the dick-to-*** living quarters required to have and meet such a material flow is biologically impossible. It will only cause a next new contagion as we set up a perfect breading ground for it. It's like symbiosis, but not.", 6514, "u1thfT1aaa", 2],

If you are vegetarian or vegan make sure you read the labels, but if that isn't an issue for you then just go crazy.

	45482 : ["I doubt you understand the horrible mess in the feed lots where beef are traditionally finished. They exist because the Food and Drug Administration set the classification for beef (that influences price) on the amount and distribution of fat in the beef. Anyway. A feed lot is a confined area where each bovine gets about ten or fifteen square feet of space. This confinement means the ground is soaked with urine and feces, and the cattle move about in this disgusting mess. They are fed cereal grains that are difficult for them to digest, and disease can run rampant in this environment. To counter this, the cattle are fed antibiotics to hold down the illnesses. I'm from Oklahoma and my sister's husband used to graze cattle on the wheat grass he raised because it didn't effect the yield of the wheat grain. He took my wife and I on a tour that included looking at a feed lot. My wife (a city-reared Southern Lady) never really got over the odor and the implicit cruelty. Grass fed beef is just that. They are taken from their grazing pasture to the slaughter house. The best beef I have eaten was raised on our farm. A male calf was allowed to nurse his mother until he weighed half a ton. That's the way to produce flavorful beef, short of the Japanese Wagyu method that feeds the animal beer and gives it daily massages.", 6511, "98lD3z68aa", 2],
