If it's specified that to teach was the intent (and is the goal..that's fine)-if not part of any \"therapy\"-it's wrong..to treat a client with a emotional problem who is unstable in a rude manner would be unethical (he would be causing what he is trying to prevent)..anger, rash action.", 9781, "None", 0],

	101801 : ["I had a terrible one last night, actually. I was running through a secret passageway in a castle, tripping over mutilated corpses with fragments of flesh, and three men with guns were chasing me. I ended up dashing into a Pet Store, where these women were slaughtering pigs by slicing through their throats. All the while, the pigs were looking at me through glistening eyes. Now, i'm an animal lover, and a man put his hand on my shoulder and said: \"It's your fault, you know.\" He then picked up a gun and shot a puppy in it's forehead. He handed the puppy to me and made me slit its throat. For some reason, I then ended up in my bedroom and Regan (From The Exorcist) was sitting on my bed and staring at me, then started screaming \"I don't care!\" And then, she vanished. The three men with guns suddenly appeared - they were carrying butcher knives this time, though - and stabbed my family to death, until they were lying in pools of their own blood. And for the duration of the stabbing, a voice was whispering \"The turtle couldn't help you.\" It was traumatizing, to say the least.", 9788, "None", 1],

In my dream, It forms and creeps toward my school and I run from it, not knowing whether my family is alive as I hitchhike and get a ride with one of my teachers. Even as I leave uncountable people to die I still know that I am only delaying the inevitable, and will eventually also die, because I know no way to stop it and am not rich or important enough to get into an underground shelter, even if I could get to one. It may not have been a graphic dream, but it is worse after consideration- an unfightable en,emy, wiping out everything alive the destruction of all but the lucky few, and even, as they take their last gasps, the guilt of those who left others behind but still couldn't escape it.", 9788, "RHcDVQ2Iaa", 0],

Maybe for your parents sake you should try and talk to each other in an attempt to avoid an altercation at a later date.

	101812 : ["I have such a similar story.  It's scary really.  My sister, who is about a decade older, is very jealous of me and has always been so.  She has been THE source of horror in my life.  She has completely divested me of all my worldly goods twice, then kicked me out on the street, calling me a sponge (this within hours of using up all MY MONEY)  and then she has also called my employer, when I had a really good job, and made me out to be a psychopathic drunk.....and then she called my ex-husbands second wife, and made me out to be a mother who would abandon her children. There is sometimes no good answer to evil in your life.  But, dont ever think evil doesnt exist.  It does.  Its not a black winged demon, its just in the face of the person you love, who treats you badly, who acts like you don't count, who can make your life hell and grin about it while you cry.  That's true evil, in my book. I am over 50 years old, and my sister is 60.  She has spent her entire life trying to ruin my life or make me die, or if thats not possible, then just make me live in the gutter, with nothing and no one.  But hey, I'm used to it now.  50 years of this ****, you know?  :) What's funny, is that my life has turned out well, AND my children are fabulous.

	101827 : ["Yeah, I think I saw the same comic a few months ago. Dwayne Cook or something like that I think. OH well, not really very original material. I suppose he did the thing about an atheist becoming fertilizer for a tree to make paper for bibles out of too. Anyhow, no I don't get offended if somebody says God Bless if I sneeze. If they pass me a tissue I might even say thanks. Tissue paper is a better use of trees than bibles in my opinion. --------- extra: Do you know why they started saying God Bless you? It was like a mini prayer for God to replace however much of your soul had escaped when you sneezed. The people back then in northern Europe actually thought you sneezed a bit of your soul away with every sneeze and if it was not returned you would get sick and die. It was not actually about a demon getting into you. Considering how the diseases that make you sneeze also killed a lot of people 300 years ago it almost seems like a reasonable idea.", 9777, "oZHSU8oXaa", 0],

Tell him/her ANY ob/gyn disease or procedure you've had and if you have any serious illness. In any case the doctor will try to detemine what is going on.
