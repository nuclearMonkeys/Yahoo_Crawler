Taking advantage of the opportunity is the first prerequisite of the Indian politics in today's era, and no political party is a charitable organization today. One may claim that they are party of freedom fighters, another may claim that they are party with difference, another may claim that they are party of dalits and undermined, but when ground reality check is performed, we all know that all of these political parties are only doing business of power.

These guys joined the other opposition to grill the centre on price rise of food items, fuel price rise, etc and brought the Cut Motion. But they chose to shout outside the parliament on the crucial day and not vote in the house? Media did not mince matters while asking the leaders if it was linked to their cases with CBI.. Even Maya's sudden sympathy with INS was due to the cases, as was known to all. For every such withdrawal from other opposition camp, the stock reason for these guys is: 'to prevent communal forces coming to power'! Then why did they all participate in the Motion? Why not Asker look at these things going 'behind the scene'? why only selective diagnosis about political groups? As rightly said by above two respondents, all politicians are in the game with varying degrees of deviance.

Clinton will do things the same old way they have been done for many years and lobbyists will still control our government.  Obama has more experience than Clinton.  Obama has served 8 years in the Illinois State Senate and he has been a U.S. Senator for 3 years = 11 years.  Clinton has been a U.S. Senator for 7 years - that's all.  I hope you don't fall for the illogical thinking that Hillary Clinton has experience because her husband was a President. My husband is a welder, but I have no clue how to weld. And, I'm sure you wouldn't allow a surgeon's wife to operate on you. Obama has better foresight than Clinton.  Clinton voted for going to war with Iraq.  Obama spoke out against going to war with Iraq from the very beginning.  To get an idea of Obama's foresight, you need only read the anti-war speech he gave on 10/02/02.  He is not opposed to all wars, only dumb wars.  Here is a link to the speech in case you're interested:      Obama will not make universal insurance mandatory.  Unlike Clinton, he will not fine people who cannot afford to pay for it.   Obama can beat any Republican competing for the Presidency.  If Clinton wins the nomination for the Democrats, it's very likely the Republicans will win the Presidency.  Clinton is very polarizing and many people cannot tolerate her.  Many people would show up solely for the purpose of voting against her.   Good luck making your decision. Edit: The response from \"baby_doll\" is 100% inaccurate.  Obama is NOT a Muslim.

	128948 : ["OH YEAH!!!! I guess i have to really. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, 8 years ago and was progressively getting more debilitated by it. Doctors gave me medication to help, one of top neurologists in Australia told me that i would never get any better. The medication was bad, it made me feel sick every time i took it (every second day) but that is what it's meant to do. When i got sick Mum gave me a bible, i started reading and was hooked. I knew that this Jesus could heal me if He healed so many. I wanted to stop taking the medication but was advised that God gave us medicine too, so not to be too hasty. We prayed about it and that night i developed a rash all over me, i rang the hospital and they told me to stop taking the medication as i had become allergic to it. I experienced a miracle healing from Jesus over a period of time which culminated in a final touch from God when my Pastor was laying hands on me during a time of prayer. Not only did God heal the MS he has made me fitter and healthier than ever. Now years later i am completely healed and have been given so much more than just health, i received salvation. There is no medical explanation for my healing, the best thing i heard was the doctors telling me that there was nothing they could do for me, coz now they can't take the credit for God's miracle!!

	128957 : ["I would say it is \"because they know people who vote democrat don't understand economics and they are deceiving them to achieve their own agenda.\" The reasons behind this? Without a doubt, the single most difficult fact of public finance to get across to people is the understanding that the burden for the heavy taxation of the wealthy disproportionately falls on the middle class and working poor. People either cannot, or will not recognize it. Consider the new taxes imposed in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. As part of the new taxes imposed by Congress, the law imposed a 10% luxury tax on high ticket items such as private jets and yachts. While many in the working class and the poor cheered because they thought that finally the rich are going to have to pay, they were wrong. The rich did not pay -- everyone else did. Because the rich believed the tax was unfair they simply refused to pay it. They canceled contracts for new jets and yachts. The bottom line was that ship-builders throughout New England were forced to close down. A great many hard working men and women who worked in these yards were thrown out of work, and subsequently went on public assistance. So who was hurt? The Rich? No. The working class got hurt. In a post-expenditure analysis the GAO reported that the tax generated about $75 Million, but cost the government about $125 Million from a combination of reduced revenues and increased outlays to take care of the newly unemployed. There is a simple proposition in taxation policy that (if it were possible) I'd gladly tattoo on the forehead of every single man and woman in government (federal, state and local) THE EFFECTS OF TAXATION ALWAYS FLOW DOWNHILL. If you overtax corporations -- consumers pay higher prices. If you overtax the wealthy -- the working class pays. If you overtax the middle class -- consumer buying dries up. Unfortunately, Modern tax policy isn't about raising revenues anymore; it's about making sure one's constitutents feel good that \"the other guy\" is getting stuck with the bill. The answer, of course, is tax equity; but in these days of polarized politics, what should be a policy based on reason and sensibility has degenerated into another blood-sport.
