	41427 : ["Has your dog had any FORMAL obedience training?Â  Usually, in obedience classes, a dog can learn to heel while on leash (if asked or required to do do) for short periods on a walk.Â  A dog needs to be TAUGHT what is expected (before going out into the world) and will not \"learn\" to give you attention, if not taught to, esp if it is a hunting or hound breed. A BRISK walk for exercise, is also different than a casual walk for going pee or poo or doing sniffing/exploring.Â  If you intend to \"exercise\" - the dog needs to KEEP UP and not DAWDLE & you need to be MOVING out - like doing 5 miles in 45 minutes.... or less.Â  The dog can also carry a weighted back-pack or dog saddle-bags, to burn more calories. All of my dogs have been taught to track & have earned tracking TITLES.Â  They also have advanced obedience titles with scores 190-195 on all legs (thru CDX) since I TRAINED them through my formal obedience classes to PAY ATTENTION TO ME = when commanded to \"HEEL\". I also taught them a RELEASE word to tell them they could break out of heeling. Long line work (aka using a tracking line - which is 20-40 ft) or walking on a long line does NOT tend to \"encourage\" the dog to PAY attention.Â  The POINT in tracking, is for the dog to get OUT AHEAD OF YOU & indicate the direction of the track. Therefore, the equipment used, may not be helping, but is actually HURTING your situation, since in tracking.... the dog is NOT supposed to look at you; UNLIKE in obedience..Â  You also cannot get the dog back quickly, if using a \"long-line\" on a green way - if a biker, skate boarder, person JOGGING or another dog/person or a loose dog is coming QUICKLY upon you - from either direction.Â  Dogs take a \"CLUE\" from the equipment used, as to how they are to BEHAVE.Â  Therefore, I would ditch the LONG LINE, aside from tracking purposes.Â Â  In our house, the long line meant tracking or field work (birds).If you want attention, OR to be able to get the dog back quickly, OR to get them to SIT - if something/someone is approaching -(that is what a 6 ft leash of for.)Â  I absolutely NEVER use a retractable leash for dog \"exercise walking\" or tracking.Â  Far harder to get the dog BACK, than a cotton web, long-line (like for tracking). If you intend to keep using a line, vs a leash on your dog (esp if required to do so - BY LAW in many parks or nature reserves) then I would still advocate for less length = 10-15 ft. max.Â  Too much line, can lead to the it getting CAUGHT on bushes or trees if the dog is not right WITH you.Â Â  I made it a POINT to teach my dogs to come to a whistle, such that I could do a recall via whistle, if they got off leash & too far out, in open fields.Â  The sound of a whistle carries much FURTHER than your voice.Â  A good recall is always importantÂ  WHETHER the dog is off, or on leash, due to all sort of emergencies.Â Â  How much have you worked on his recall - and how well does your dog come back or \"spin on a dime\" off of a distraction?Â  (it does not sound like this is even an OPTION) in YOUR CASE.Â  If you cannot call your dog OFF a squirrel or cat (even in your neighborhood) - letting the dog get 20-40 ft from you is a very BAD IDEA.Â Â  Linear velocity will apply more force to you - as the dog get FURTHER FROM YOU, esp if the dog takes off suddenly, and you may also be more likely to loose control of the line (AND DROP IT) on a hike with the dog \"hunting\" or going off with no warning, vs going down a carefully laid track, while harnessed and at a moderate pace (and during which, you can actually lean backwards - if needed, to slow the dog down) on usually fairly LEVEL surfaces (unlike on hikes). Sorry, but your dog is not WELL ENOUGH trained to be on a long line, other than when harnessed & actually tracking a lost person, or planted articles.", 6040, "v2MrWQimaa", 1],
