	2204 : ["I don't think the prescription is to never induce vomiting.  I think for some poisons, you are supposed to induce vomiting to get the poison out of the system.  For other corrosives, you are to dilute the chemical with copious amounts of liquid, you don't induce vomiting because the corrosives can damage your throat, vocal chords etc. as it comes up.  This is a good question for the poison control hotline 1800-222-1222.  You can call them in an emergency to get their recommendations on how to respond to poisonings. ", 348, "WEWYjxDfaa", 1],
	2205 : ["If you've just swallowed something poisonous or harmful, your first instinct might be to make yourself throw up. For decades, many people, including doctors, thought this was the best course of action. Parents were instructed to keep a bottle of ipecac syrup, which is a thick substance that makes people vomit, on hand for cases like this. Today, doctors and poison control experts advise against making yourself or someone else throw up after swallowing something potentially dangerous. The American Academy of Pediatrics even now encourages people to get rid of any lingering bottles of ipecac. So immediately call Poison Control and ask them. If in some remote area with no phone service and no help available, I would still induce vomiting asap in an emergency.", 348, "AA10954511", 0],

Or perhaps the film wasn't of good quality the first time. I've had that happen- it's a nuisance, but it seldom means that anything is wrong.

Dose their pacemaker keep bringing them back and they are unable to die until it's been removed? Even if they were so old and poorly and ready for death but this pacemaker just wouldn't let them slip away. However back to the freezer talk, yes it sounds like a good idea and I'm sure it's been thought of before.

	2221 : ["Many reasons Opiates (Codeine, Morphine, Heroin, ...) act upon mu receptors. The brain regulates how many receptors are active at one time. If you give it too much. The brain will start deactivating receptors. That means you need a higher dose to get the same affect. Until the rest of your body cannot handle it and fails. The biggest is lung failure. Opiates decrease lung function. Too much and your lungs stop working. If you stop taking it, the brain will start reactivating these receptors again. This is an issue for recovering addicts who relapse. They took X amount before so they will take X amount again. Not realizing that now there are more receptors activated then when they last abused it.", 345, "463df0dc4592fd451002bc61622706ceaa", 1],

	2223 : ["You are floating on a lot of misinformation, 1. You are taking a LOT of aspirin. The normal dose to prevent heart disease and stroke is 75-325mg/d. Aspirin has side effects, it can causes gastric bleeding, bleeding in the brain, kidney damage and in high doses hyperthermia, deafness and even death. Be careful! 2. Aspirin DOES NOT thin the blood. It is not an anticoagulant! What aspirin does is prevent platelets from sticking together to form a \"plug\" in the vascular system. This may be good or bad. It is good because these clumps often contribute to the development of heart attack or stroke, but it will predispose you to bleed. This CAN be fatal in some cases. Be careful!  As to how quickly aspirin will start to work after you have consumed it depends on what type of formulation you are taking, usually 5-10 minutes. chewed aspirin worked fastest. It needed only five minutes to reduce TxB2 concentrations by 50%; the Alka-Seltzer took almost 8 minutes, and the swallowed tablet took 12 minutes. Talk to your doctor.", 354, "pHOQ8qANaa", 0],

One of the vaccines that has been used in Europe, not in the US, might have caused blood clots in about 30 people out of the millions that received the vaccine. But that was mostly in one region, which makes it seem like maybe a coincidence. If someone has a stroke in a movie theater, that doesn't mean popcorn caused the stroke. So many people have been vaccinated by now that of course some of them have died since then. In order to blame the vaccine we would need to compare deaths in vaccinated people vs. unvaccinated people.
