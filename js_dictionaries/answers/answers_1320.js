Just a hunch though. :] 1)Whats your fave Pokemon type? and your fave Pokemon of that type? - I really like water and ice types. And my favorite pokemon of all time is Lapras and Jynk. >3 2)How do you think its like inside a Pokeball? - Probably a habitat suitable to their element.  3)Do you think the new series is better or worse than the classic one? - The original was always more of a thrill for myself. I loved the classic pokemon and characters.  4)Do you think Pokemon is just for kids? - Well if you like something in particular then it is suitable for you, no matter what labels are attached. Also, pokemon was originally made for teenagers/young adults due to suggestive scenes and violence, until they toned it down to be suitable for younger viewers. :3 Bai Nerd! >3", 8620, "JR7HdRZ9aa", 1],

If you want, you could check out Serial Experiments Lain if you haven't already, it's a pretty psychological anime and makes you use your brain. I have to correct you though on the Cowboy Bebop thing. Cowboy Bebop started off as a shoujo manga called Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star which came out in 1997 in Asuka Fantasy DX (and is still running actually), it wasn't until 1998 that the anime version came out so in no way is the manga a spin-off.", 8620, "4haztAC5aa", 0],
