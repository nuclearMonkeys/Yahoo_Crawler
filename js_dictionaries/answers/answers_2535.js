	132587 : ["Here are your 2 main components: 1. Jasmine Rice - you can buy this now in any major grocery store. or if you are not in a major metropolitan area, you would find them in an asian store.  2. A rice cooker - they come with a cup and lines inside the cooker to indicate your water level. So, if you put 2 cups of dried rice in the cooker, level your water on line number 2. Wait for 20 minutes  and Voila! you have an asian style rice that's like what you eat in a chinese restaurant and better.  After the cooker shuts off, let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. Tip: Leftover rice will appear grainy and dry, don't worry, reheating it in the microwave will put them back in their former glory. There is also a way to cook it in the microwave. Make sure your ratio is 1:2 (rice:water) Put the rice/water mix in a microwaveable container (glass is preferrable) and microwave it for 20 minutes. Another way of cooking it is stovetop. Same 1:2 ratio. Gas stove is preferrable to prevent burning. There is a higher risk for burning on electric stove. Even as experienced as I am, I have burned them on elect. stove.  But the procedure is simple. Let the mixture boil. Once it is boling, turn the heat to medium low setting. You don't need to stir it. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.  Overall, the best way to cook asian rice is through a rice cooker. Just set it and leave it. It frees up all 4 of your stoves for other tasks. Good luck!", 11142, "opkz2vMDaa", 2],
	132588 : ["Although a rice cooker is a sure winner in cooking Asian style rice, you don't have to invest in one if you have a pressure cooker.  You can buy Thai jasmine rice or Australian rice.  Rinse it out a bit.  Put it in the pressure cooker with water 1 inch above the rice level.  After the safety valve on the pressure cooker pops up, turn off the stove and let it cool down naturally.  When you can open the pressure cooker, the rice is ready.  If you like really really sticky rice, like the Japanese style, you should buy glutinous rice or sweet rice (they are the same thing).  Soak the rice for an hour or so before cooking then drain the water out before cooking.  The water level should be barely higher than the level of rice because glutinous rice soaks up less water, especially after you've soaked it already.", 11142, "cTfZ0TVTaa", 0],

Ask a really close friend or someone that could talk some sense into her & seek counselling. When I did all that to my wife she did stop hitting me but then she started hurting herself. My situation is different to yours but just in case that happens you might need to involve the cops. Its not like you don't love her or you wanted to embarass her or anything like that. But you just have to somewhat protect yourself. Oh and another one would be just walk out and take a load off then talk to her sensibly when she's cool and ready.

Bring the water to a boil, add rice and stir occasionaly (so it doesn't stick) until water boils again. Cover and turn fire down low for 15 mins. Then turn the fire off and let rice steam for about 5 mins. It's a total of 20 mins from beginning to end. The Key to rice is: It's the steam that cooks the rice! One of the reasons the rice sticks together in the restaurants is that after they add the veggies to the steamed rice, they pour a scrambled egg on top and stir fry it until the egg is cooked.

Plain water would be best. You can also give her some Benadryl (over the counter anti-histamine for humans).
