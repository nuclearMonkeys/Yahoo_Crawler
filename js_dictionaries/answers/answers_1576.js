	84463 : ["I don't think anyone can say McCain will win nor do I believe it has anything to do with whether we're ready for a black President (the white votes he was getting 2 weeks+ ago seems to say we are ready), It comes down to what the public really knows about him beyond speeches and campaign promises. Obama does a nice job handling the press - and by that I mean he keeps them away from him. He speaks only when he's trying to deliver a message, not when they have questions. In doing that, he isn't sinking himself by revealing anything. Unfortunately, some of his campaign staffers have recently hurt him and in order to play damage control he's had to make a few more unplanned press appearances which caused other unwanted questions to be asked (aka Rezko issue and all the links to Iraq, corrupt billionaires and other unfavorable characters that come with that). Him walking out on the press when they lunge at him for answers is a perfect example of something that could likely sink him if he's nominated and, I believe, it will sink him. To think the GOP side doesn't have a file of dirt on him would be naive and amateurish. They do have dirt, and if he's nominated he'll be in the crosshairs of some major controversy which is exactly what they want – a popular, respected candidate of “change” who has yet to have his past scrutinized or exposed like McCain or Clinton have. It will get ugly and perhaps more importantly, how do you fight back or deflect it when you've promised a different kind of politics?  He's having trouble doing that now and his tactic has primarily been trying to spin it toward Clinton by saying she's attempting to cause drama or playing dirty even though most of the controversy he's faced, which has been very mild so far, has been self-inflicted – by his own staff speaking to people or his own past blunders.  That plan isn't working. He's slipping in polls (he was +9 in head-to-head against McCain, he's now +1 with Clinton +2 according to NewsWeek) and support for him is arguably faltering meanwhile more and more questions from voters and press are stacking up unanswered. His campaign is a time bomb in desperate need of a quick nomination. I know many Obama supporters would disagree with this but I don't have a candidate I'm supporting so my view is pretty unbiased.  To support my thoughts I'd point to opposing the FL results as proof of how he knows the clock is ticking against him at the moment. Why not include the current Florida vote which was forced upon the state by GOP leaders and tacked onto needed legislation? His answer: “he was unknown then”. Wha? This was just over a month ago! He did countless televised debates including a CNN debate the week prior, he ran a national ad campaign that was seen in Florida and received tons of national press prior to that primary. You couldn't turn on the news and not hear about him or see him making a speech.  It's just kind of sad that someone who positions themselves the way he does would snub the month-old opinion of those voters and want a “do over” because of how he placed back then but I guess that says a lot about how new his politics are. Imagine a Florida revote where he wins on the 2nd attempt. What message does that send to people who did not vote for him the first time around? Will they vote in the general election if he's nominated? It's a can of worms and more fuel for the GOP to use. So to summarize; it's not a fair prediction that McCain will win but it's a highly probable prediction.", 9164, "3663dd3fb1f1a5eace3331afe992381baa", 0],
	84464 : ["First, we don't know that Obama will get the nomination. Don't count Hillary out. She will do what she has to do to get what she wants. Second, I don't think McCain will necessarily continue all of Bush's policies. If anything, McCain seems to have a need to be liked or approved by the other side, so if he's elected, I think you'll see him \"reaching across the aisle\" in a way that will drive Republicans and conservatives crazy with frustration. Some people will never accept a black president, but I believe that such people are in the minority. So, if Obama gets the nomination, I think he has an excellent chance of being elected.

Dondero posts blogs online, he is lobbied by Jewish Republicans, supports military intervention, and even wrote the racist newsletters that Paul never wrote, he was disgruntled for getting fired by Paul, he even shouted at Paul for not voting for the Iraq war, and for turning down Dondero's jewish friends.

Because most Bush and war supporters believe Bin Laden is from Iraq.  He's not.  Neither is the rest of Al Qaida.  They are from Saudi Arabia.  We're at war with the wrong d*mn country.

We get tired of either party and this becomes cyclical. I have to take issue at your observation that McCain ever really led the polls in 2008.  If he did it was very tight and was only moments immidiately before the GOP convention and immidiately after (which is typical).  You are right that the economic collapse did McCain in and his stunts around that time made him look panicked.... and then Palin was a disaster on the campaign trail.  Even with these issues though I believe that any Democrat would have beat any Republican that year... 8 years of a very unpopular president and his administration in the midst of a economic collapse would have killed any political party's chances.
