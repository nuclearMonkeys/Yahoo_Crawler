	125063 : ["What prompted Stephen to make such an appeal? According to Acts 7:55, 56, Stephen, “being full of holy spirit, gazed into heaven and caught sight of God's glory and of Jesus standing at God's right hand.” Normally, Stephen would have addressed his requests to Jehovah in the name of Jesus. But seeing the resurrected Jesus in vision, Stephen apparently felt free to appeal to him directly, saying: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Stephen knew that Jesus had been given authority to raise the dead. (John 5:27-29) He therefore asked Jesus to safeguard his spirit, or life force, until the day when Jesus would raise him to immortal life in the heavens. Does Stephen's brief utterance set a precedent for praying to Jesus? Not at all. For one thing, Stephen clearly distinguished Jesus from Jehovah, for the account says that he saw Jesus “standing at God's right hand.” Also, these circumstances were exceptional. The only other case of such an utterance being directed to Jesus is that of the apostle John, who similarly addressed Jesus directly when he saw Him in vision.—Revelation 22:16, 20. The King James Version says that Stephen was “calling upon God.”  Barnes' Notes on the New Testament makes this honest admission: “The word God is not in the original, and should not have been in the translation. It is in none of the ancient [manuscripts] or versions.” How did the word “God” come to be inserted into that verse? Scholar Abiel Abbot Livermore called this “an instance of the sectarian biases of the translators.” Most modern translations, therefore, eliminate this spurious reference to God.", 10819, "001e9bd07dadf77ec20df539c1f89161aa", 2],

	125071 : ["Some have concluded that Jesus is God because they interpret Acts 7:59 as Stephen *praying* to Jesus when all prayer should be directed to God. Therefore, according to their reasoning, Jesus must be God. But looking closely at the context we see that Stephen “caught sight of God's glory *and of* Jesus standing at God's right hand.” (Acts 7: 54-60) This alone plainly shows Jesus and God as two separate and distinct individuals who are not one and the same. But Stephen “saw” Jesus in a *vision* and, evidently reacting as if he were in Jesus' personal presence, he felt free to speak this plea to the one whom he recognized as the Lord Jesus Christ, and he appealed to him. There is nothing to indicate that this was a prayer, but instead was an appeal (See below). Mere speech to Jesus does not constitute “prayer” anymore than mere speech to God is necessarily prayer, as is seen in the judgment in Eden and in the case of Cain. (Gen. 3:8-13 and Gen. 4:9-14). It was after this that the account at Acts 7:60 says that “on bended knee” then Stephen cried out, this time, no doubt in prayer: “Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.” Further, the Greek does not say that Stephen “Prayed to God” but simply as translated into English: “called upon and saying: ‘Lord Jesus'…” (Kingdom Interlinear, translated from Westcott and Hort); and “calling upon and saying: ‘O Lord Jesus”…” (Emphatic Diaglott translated from the Vatican 1209 manuscripts). Stephen's appeal to Jesus in Acts 7:59 is just that, an appeal, not a prayer. The Greek word used is “epikaleo”, the very same word Paul used in reference to Caesar as recorded at Acts 25: 11,12, 21: “ ‘…I APPEAL to Caesar!' Then Festus, after speaking with the assembly of counselors, replied: ‘To Caesar you have APPEALED; to Caesar you shall go.' ”…But when Paul APPEALED…” This same Greek word “epikaleo” is used as in Stephen's case. Paul did not “pray” to Caesar. Likewise neither was Stephen “praying” to Jesus.", 10819, "tGfriTyeaa", 1],

	125075 : ["Wow, your post gave me the chills. Yes, that is a Jewish sign, so is the Lion, which is a symbol for God in Judaism. She was probably forced to practice Catholicism as were many Jews back in the day to avoid anti-semitism. For example, I have an old Jewish silver Russian bible pointer and on the tip of it is a beautiful hand carved lion (standing on top of a crown), with a \"star of David\" (the 2 triangles). God is also symbolized as a King and all Torahs (bibles) in a Jewish synagogue are decorated with a crown. I strongly believe she was Jewish. Your grandmother's history is also similar to Einstein's (a Jew) in that Einstein moved to Italy when he was young, where he wrote his first scientific paper, and after that moved to Switzerland where he renounced his German citizenship and got a Swiss citizenship which he kept his whole life, and where he met his first wife and got his degree in physics. ----------------- Within Judaism, the Biblical Judah (in Hebrew: Yehuda) is the original name of the Tribe of Judah - traditionally symbolized by a lion. In Genesis, the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a Gur Aryeh גּוּר אַרְיֵה יְהוּדָה , a \"Young Lion\" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him [1]. In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. (wikipedia) ------------- The Jerusalem coat of arms is of a lion: ----------------- The Star of David or Shield of David (Magen David in Hebrew, מָגֵן דָּוִד with nikkud or מגן דוד without, academically transcribed Māḡēn Dāwīḏ by Biblical Hebrew linguists, pronounced [maˈɡen daˈvid] in Modern Hebrew and Mogein Dovid [ˈmɔɡeɪn ˈdɔvid] or Mogen Dovid [ˈmɔɡen ˈdɔvid] in Ashkenazi Hebrew and Yiddish) is a generally recognized symbol of Jewish identity and Judaism. It is named after King David of ancient Israel; and its earliest known communal usage began in the Middle Ages[citation needed], alongside the more ancient symbol of the menorah. Geometrically it is the hexagram. With the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 the Star of David on the Flag of Israel has also become a symbol of Israel. The symbol is also associated with the Zionism movement. So for at least the past several hundred years it has been used exclusively by Jews. At some point prior to that others began using it to as Jews began to move about the world but I doubt your grandmother had the ring from a thousand years ago when that was the case. More likely it was within the past hundred years. --------------------------------------------- I hope this isn't TMI too much info but here's some info I found (Cori seems to be right next to Rome on the map) -- The Jewish community of Roma is one of the oldest in Europe and one of the oldest continuous Jewish settlement in the world.  Jews were in Roma  in the second century B.C.E. and their number increased in the following centuries because of immigration and because of transportations of  prisoners of war and  slaves during the Roman-Jewish wars in Judea and in Palestine (from 63 B.C.E.  to 135 A.C.).  In 70 A.C. Titus destroyed the Temple of Jerusalem. He brought many Jews to Rome as slaves, as well as the Menorah stolen from the Temple. The Jews living in Rome paid a ransom to liberate their brothers. During those times there were tens of synagogues in town.  Jewish scholars came from Israel to Rome around the year 100 and since then Hebrew studies continued, also during the Darkest Ages  In 212 the emperor Caracalla granted the Jews the privilege of becoming Roman citizens  The condition of the Jews in Roma deteriorated with the diffusion of  Christianity, during Middle Ages and first Renaissance the condition of the Jews of Roma changed following the politics of the Pope.  After the fourth Lateran Council (1215) copies of the Talmud were burned and Jews were forced to wear a  distinctive badge (a red tabard fo the males and a red petticoat for the women).  In 1555 Pope Paul IV decreed that all Jews must be segregated into their own quarters (ghetto),  and that they were allowed to leave the Ghetto only during the daytime.  Jews were banned from most  occupations, and the only two professions permitted were money lending and selling used clothing. .  In the Ghetto there were five Synagogues: Scola Catalana, Scola Castigliana, Scola Siciliana, Scola Tempio and Scola Nova for about 5,000 Jews.   With the unification of Italy (1870) the Jews obtained the full citizenship  During racial persecutions (1943-44) more then two thousands Jews of Roma perished the extermination camps.

	125076 : ["Well, I believe in the tri-unity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, but I don't have any problem with the verses the JWs are bringing up in response to this question about the Father being greater or the Father knowing something Jesus doesn't know. The Bible clearly shows that there is a hierarchy of function within the Trinity, and the Son is eternally subordinate to the Father. This view is widely held by Christian theologians (For example, see Essential Truths of the Christian Faith, \"The Subordination of Christ,\" Chapter 26, by R.C. Sproul). However, the fact that Jesus is eternally subordinate to the Father in position does not mean that the Father is superior in nature to the Son. 1 Cor 11:3: “But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.” To argue that this verse proves that the Father is superior to the Son in nature, one would be required to believe that men are superior in nature to women. This is clearly not the case, as a husband and wife are referred to in Scripture as a composite unity (“one” – echad). They share the identical nature, but the husband functions in a higher God-given position than the wife and is likewise held more accountable than the wife. The position that the Father clearly holds throughout the Bible is that of the Planner, Designer and Architect of the universe. As such, I believe it is His call as to when the world ends. A few Trinitarians maintain that Jesus didn't know the day or the hour simply because He was in human form at the time He said that, but I have to disagree. The General (above) gave good verses where Jesus is shown to be omniscient, but He did not know the day or hour. According to Phil. 2:6-8 and other verses, Jesus laid aside His glory (that part of Him sinful man couldn't look upon without disintegrating to ashes) NOT His deity when He put on humanity. I believe that in debating this, we're missing out on an important concept brought out in this verse coupled with others. We know that the Father is omniscient. He knows our hearts from the beginning to the end of our lives so that, although we have free will to choose, He already knows what our choice will be. (1 Ch. 28:9; Ps. 139:4). We also know that, “The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.” (2 Pet. 3:9) I don't believe there will be a single person eternally separated from God who, if given an extra 24 hours or even 24 years would have made a decision to accept Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. I believe a moment in time is coming where everyone over the age or mental capacity of accountability will have made their choice and, at that precise moment, the Father will say, “It's time,” and the trumpet will sound. One other point that hasn't come up in response to this question is the fact that this phrase “no one knows” is repeated elsewhere in the Bible, at Revelation 19:12, which states concerning Jesus: “His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which NO ONE KNOWS except Himself.” Clearly, the Son is a distinct person from the Father; no Trinitarian believes they are the same person. Clearly, the Son is eternally subordinate to the Father, otherwise, why would the Son subject Himself to the Father after all things are subjected to Him? (1 Cor. 15:27-28) Most Trinitarians hold this view. Clearly, within this matchless unity/individuality, both Persons possess a form of exclusive knowledge pertaining to their unique function within the “Godhead” (KJV) or “Divine Being,” “Godship” and “divine quality” (NWT) (Acts 17:29; Rom. 1:20; Colossians 2:9).

	125084 : ["At Mark 13:32, Jesus acknowledges that he did not know when the end would come.  While it is true that Insight to the Scriptures states that \"selective foreknowledge means that God could choose not to foreknow indiscriminately all the future acts of his creatures,\" there is no basis in these words or in scripture upon which we may apply this to Jesus.  Why not?  Because the Bible clearly demonstrates that Jehovah God selectively chooses whether he will know a thing.  But there is no demonstration whatsoever in scripture to suggest the same of Jesus.  It is undisputed and without qualification:  Jesus acknowledges that nobody knows the day or hour; neither he nor the angels but only the Father.   If, as some would contend, Jesus was here choosing not to know, it would reasonably follow that the angels too were choosing not to know.  For logically, if we apply the selective knowledge to Jesus, we must of necessity apply it to the angels as well.  But we do not, do we?  We quote Jesus saying that the angels did not know because, quite frankly, they didn't.  And Jesus did not know because, quite frankly, he did not either.  Only the father knows, according to Jesus.  There is no basis in scripture to apply selective knowledge to Jesus.  To allege that  \"knowing all things is a recognition of the resurrected Lord's omniscience, an attribute of GOD and, therefore, Jesus is God is circular reasoning.

	125092 : ["the Trinity is a hoax, nothing more than a doctrine invented by man that keeps evolving and changing.  In the first and second centuries the discussions of the Trinity were not three separate persons but \"Three Hypostases in one Ousia\".    Both Hypostases and Ousia are Greek Words totally absent from the Biblical Greek Scriptures. Hypostases does not mean person but \"persona\" meaning substance.  And Ousia means essence which was translated to \"individual reality\".   So the doctrine in the second and third century was \"Three Hypostases in one Ousia\" meaning three substances make up one individual reality.  However, one may take note that \"Ousia\" does not mean \"I AM\" but (TO BE).  Ousia is a FEMININE NOUN describing Jesus as the \"to be\" as in being begotten.  Controversy erupted and the doctrine was CHANGED. Since the early church fathers were APOSTATES who were unable to fit their made up doctrine into the scriptures, the doctrine was completely scraped and reinvented in the fourth century to read, “three separate persons” make up One God.  SO we see a move from Modalism to Trinitarism which are doctrines in complete opposition to one another.   Therefore, Trinitarism was born out of Modalism.  What is extraordinary is that both doctrines denounce Jehovah's Sovereignty as Most High over all the earth. (Psalms 83:18)  And if that is not hypocritical enough, Trinitarians make the claim that Elohim is the explanation of the trinity when in fact, Elohim denounces the trinity as a total fraud.  Elohim is neither the name of God nor does it mean \"three separate persons\".  The meaning of Elohim is \"gods\". Since the Trinity doctrine claims “three separate persons” make up One God, not that, the three Gods are One God. Isn't God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit a contradiction? Why does the trinity claim three Gods with a capital “G” in their doctrine if there is only One? \"And I saw three unclean inspired expressions [that looked] like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.\" (Rev 16:13) Trinity Debunked!   even though there are those who are called “gods,” whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many “gods” and many “lords,” there is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.\" (1 Corinthians 8:5-6)  Paul is stating that there are in fact many gods and many lords.  But to us one \"God the Father\".  You will notice that God the Son and God the Holy Spirit is completely missing from scripture. However, Paul doesn't stop there, but adds \"and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ\". Is Paul wrong?  Is there another God besides \"God the Father\"? Here, we testimony of Jesus Christ himself, calling his Father, \"the only true God\" in John 17:3.  Is Jesus Christ wrong? Is Jesus himself God, forgetting to give credit to himself?  Or is Jesus correct in calling his Father, \"the only true God\". Here is another scripture for to you to research.  \"That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth.\" (Psalms 83:18) If Jehovah alone is Most High then where does that leave Jesus?  Jesus is simply not included in this scripture. In response to Satan, Jesus quoted scripture upholding his Father's Sovereignty.    In reply Jesus said to him: “It is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.'” (Luke 4:8) If Jesus is God then why doesn't he say, \"It is me that you must worship\"???", 10819, "4Aumv4oTaa", 4],

We find a similar usage in 2 Corinthians 6:10:  \"as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.\"  Taken out of context, and applying the same kind reasoning many apply to John 16:30, one could make an argument that Paul is telling the Corinthians that they are possessing absolutely everything that exists in the whole universe, and thus they must be God Almighty.", 10827, "c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa", 1],

(Luke 4:8; 6:12) Under normal circumstances, Stephen would have appealed to Jehovah in the name of Jesus. (John 15:16) In this instance, though, Stephen had a vision of “the Son of man standing at God's right hand.” (Acts 7:56) Fully aware that Jesus had been given the power to resurrect the dead, Stephen spoke, but did not pray, directly to Jesus, asking Him to safeguard his spirit.—John 5:27-29.", 10819, "RF1jX2ZVaa", -1],

	125100 : ["Bernard Jean-Pierre Very well put, one might ask, If Jesus is God, wouldn't he know all things ? Col 1:13-19 tell us that all things were created through Jesus, by Jesus, & for Jesus. Verse 19 says, \"for God saw for all fullness to dwell in him, Jesus did not see for all fullness to dwell in himself, he said the Father is greater than him. Jesus is also the firstborn of the dead, Jesus is the first one to die human & be raised up a spirit being, if we all had a soul that is spirit, there were many faithful men of old that had died way before Jesus, but Jesus was the first to be raised a spirit. Jesus had to be resurrected, who resurrected him, being dead he could not preform this miracle, if he never died, then his dying for us is a lie, & we do not have a savior, the Jews would be right.  We know this to be the work of Satan, trying to confuse man from what Jesus came to do, that is sanctify his heavenly Fathers name(Matt 6:9) and prove Satan a liar(2 Co 4:4). Jehovah is Jesus' Fathers name, Jesus came to sanctify his Fathers name. Psalms 83:18 shows us Gods name, it's Jehovah, H3068 Strong's Lexicon Concordance, in Hebrew its הוה , this is the Tetragrammaton,Yĕhovah is the way the Tetragrammaton is said, Jehovah is the english pronouncement of the Tetragrammaton.

	125101 : ["As with any query about the meaning of a Bible verse, it's necessary to get the context. Stephen concluded his long address to the religious leaders with the accusation, \"You stiff-necked people... You always resist the Holy Spirit... you have betrayed and murdered him [Jesus Christ]...\" (vs 51 onwards) This infuriated them. Verse 55 says, \"But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.\" Given that the Holy Spirit was operating powerfully on Stephen, the next statements Stephen comes out with are critical to our understanding. \"Look! I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!\" At this the mob started to stone him and this was when Stephen exclaimed, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!\" Was that a prayer? The Greek word used is translated \"calling upon\" or \"invoking\". Given that Jesus had died and then ascended back to heaven, Jesus was not actually present on the site of the stoning. Only Stephen could see Jesus, and Jesus was in heaven, besides God. So Stephen was not talking to Jesus as in ordinary speech between two people. When Catholics address their requests to Mary or the 'saints', Protestants have no hesitation in calling such an invocation prayer. Why? Because Mary died physically and is now in heaven. The only way to attempt to speak to a person who has died is to pray to them. The Holy Spirit did not leave Stephen seconds after we are told He was powerfully present! The utterances of Stephen are Holy Spirit utterances, and those who are not stiff-necked people who always resist the Holy Spirit allow themselves to see the clear teaching of Scripture here. Stephen prayed to Jesus, who was in heaven. There is nothing surprising about that when Jesus Himself told his disciples, \"You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.\" (John 14:14)", 10819, "0aN1xIxfaa", 1],
	125102 : ["The scripture in Mark quotes Jesus as saying that the Father knew, but that he did not know. We only point out what the Bible says. I certainly agree that Peter most likely meant \"You know all things (about me), and especially when you consider what peter later wrote about the Father being the God of Jesus: (1 Peter 1:3) 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,", 10827, "QvY5sROoaa", 11],
	125103 : ["No they should not.. Why? Well you again have to consider the context.  What was Jesus asking Peter? 'Do you have affection for me?'. He was asking him a PERSONAL question, not whether he knew how to decipher complex Bible prophecy.  Therefore Peter was basically saying, 'you know all things' ('about me') because Jesus could read hearts.  Jesus could see inside Peter and KNEW that he had affection for him, he was asking him this to emphasis his point, not to acquire 'unknown' information.   But more than that - your argument basically implies that each scripture has to be explicit and clearly understood to be fully literal.   So, if Peter and Jesus came to your house today, imagine the scene:   Peter says to you, \"Jesus knows ALL things in EVERY sense of the word\", and then Jesus quietly steps forward and says, \"Concerning that day and hour nobody knows...\".     Who do you believe??  Jesus Christ or Peter?? Now ALL scriptures are inspired of God, so BOTH scriptures have to harmonize.  So, do you lean toward Jesus knowing 'all' based on Peter (especially considering the context) or do you lean toward Jesus HIMSELF saying that he does not know 'all', which ALSO harmonizes with the ENTIRE Bible which teaches that Jesus is not equal to Jehovah God???  Jesus says also in John 14:28 that the Father is 'greater'.  In Luke 4:8, Jesus HIMSELF says that worship should be given to Jehovah God alone.  In this SAME text he is being tempted by Satan, but then go to James 1:13 which says that Jehovah God can NOT be tested or tempted by anyone or anything. So based on ALL of that - Who do you believe Peter or Jesus?? To me the choice is very clear. Good day", 10827, "xzkp7Pklaa", 15],
	125104 : ["That was Stephen's prayer to Jesus that Stephen would be with Jesus after his earthly body had died. I believe, like many others, that after my physical body dies, my soul or spirit will live on.  That's what Stephen was talking about.  Hope that helps.", 10819, "AA10983429", 2],

	125106 : ["This statement was not improper that Stephen made, why,because God had authorized Jesus to raise others to life.  An how Stephen's faith was strengthened when he ‘gazed into heaven and caught sight of God's glory and of Jesus standing at His right hand'!", 10819, "qRFTEBlGaa", 0],
	125107 : ["Reading through the Gospel accounts, as well as those of the early Christians, we get a good picture of the kind of man Peter was.  Several times he spoke without thinking and was reproved for it.  That's the beauty of the Bible, it doesn't gloss over faults of even the inspired writers of the scriptures. We have several examples of Peter's short temper and occasional lack of judgment.  He urged Jesus to go easy on himself when he knew how urgent Jesus' ministry was.  He cut off the ear of one of the soldiers sent to arrest Jesus.  His denial of any knowledge of Jesus after his arrest.  Yet, he was still a beloved apostle of Christ. So we can imagine when Jesus asked him for third time if Peter loved, or had affection for him, Peter was exasperated.  He says, \"Lord, you know all things, you know I have affection for you.\"   Peter was talking to the man who he had travelled with and learned from for 3 1/2 years.  His teacher, who did know much more than Peter, kept asking him the same question.  Can't you hear it in Peter's last reply?  He wasn't speaking to Jehovah God, he was talking as a disciple Jesus knew well.  As far as Peter was concerned, Jesus knew it all.  But in no way does that indicate Peter was replying to God.", 10827, "PHNEbmnOaa", 6],

	125111 : ["A better question to ask the JW's on this verse is -- What is the  good news or gospel of the kingdom that is to be preached in  (Mat 24:14 ) ? Because I doubt they even know what the gospel of the kingdom is in the first place. Lets read the words of Jesus and see if they are preaching it. (Mark 16:15 -18) Jesus commanded his disciples --  note: the word 'shall' not 'might' \"Go ye into ALL the World, and PREACH the GOSPEL to EVERY creature\" \"He that believeth and is baptized SHALL be saved; but he that believeth not SHALL be damned. \"And these SIGNS shall follow them that believe; In my name SHALL they cast out devils; they SHALL speak with new tongues\" \"They SHALL take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it SHALL not hurt them; they SHALL lay hands on the sick, and they SHALL recover\" (caps mine) Now the JW's will \"worm\" their way out of these verses by saying (Mk 16:15 -20 ) shouldn't be in the bible despite the KJV and other English versions keeping them in. Instead of trying to play the Greek mss evidence game with them lets find other scriptures in Gods word to prove our Lords instructions are true. And if so, means the JW's and other cults are NOT preaching the gospel of the kingdom and more importantly PROVES (Mat 24:14 and Mk 16:15 -20 )  were instructions for the apostles and not the body of Christ. (Mark 16:20 ) \"And they went forth, and preached EVERY WHERE, the Lord working with them, and CONFIRMING the word with SIGNS following\" Peter and the apostles spoke in other tongues and healed (Acts 2:8, 3:2-7 and 4:15-16 )   etc. Paul who had the signs of an apostle ( 2Cor 12:12 ) also did the same. Notice in (Acts 28:5 ) \"And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt NO harm\"   Ok, this proves the gospel of the kingdom was instructions to Peter and the eleven from our Lord (Acts 1:1-8 ) which has a special relationship with the nation of Isael it is also called the 'everlasting gospel' (Rev 14:6 ) God personally saved Paul in (Acts 9 ) and revealed to him the gospel of grace ( Acts 20:24 and 1Cor 15:1-4, Eph 2:8-9, and Gal 2:6-9 )  Paul is the APOSTLE to us Gentiles ( Rom 11:13 and 2 Tim 1:11 ) not Peter, James, or John (Gal 2:7-9 ). Israel as a nation has a 'temporal' blindness placed on them from God (Rom 11:7-11 and Acts 28:28 ) So that us Gentiles along with individual Jews ( Rom 1:16 ) can  be saved by Gods GRACE through faith in Jesus ONLY (Eph 2:8-9 and Rom 10:9-10 ) we then become members of the body of Christ ( 1Cor 12:13 and 27 ) with Christ as the Head ( Col 1:18 ). Our ministry TODAY is the \"ministry of reconciliation\" ( 2Cor 5: 18-20) \"God was IN Christ, reconciling the world unto himself \"... \"we are ambassadors for Christ\"", 10827, "None", -2],
