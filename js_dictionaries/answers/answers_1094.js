The difference may be that I live in a more liberal neighborhood.   I feel bad for the girl.  The only reason many Christians don't believe in gay rights is because of Leviticus, and that's the stupidest book in the Bible (in my opinion).  It tells you that you can have slaves, that you can't eat certain bugs and animals, and that you have to make sacrifices.  Of course Christians disregard all of these now save the one against homosexuals. -_-   Want to see something really ******?  Read this:    This comic writer has sold many copies of comic books because of his bigoted and ignorant views!    All in all, I believe that the Bible is so ambiguous that Christians should be able to pick and choose what they believe.

To clarify what the Bible does say \"We love our neighbors as ourselves\" and reserve judgments because that is God's job, not our own. This means that we should treat one another humanely and regardless of the situation. However, we don't necessarily support the decision according to some denominations. Other denominations accept homosexuality as another form of love.  Fact is... there are no longer set guidelines for ~all~ Christians. We have so many different variations, we can pick and choose WHAT we believe. Strictly taking the Bible literally, however, it is not supported. So, is it Christian? Traditionally, no.  But as a strong believer, I also believe in love in all forms - as long as it is pure. ~nods~ (And when I say pure, I mean 'Not just for fun' as many like to do' - not necessarily the virgins until the night kind of thing... I'm an odd one...)", 8069, "Eh6Fz64Zaa", -1],

	60221 : ["Before I answer, we need to clarify what is meant by \"rights.\" Rights are entitlements that are endowments of the Creator.  The right to marry is clearly one of those rights, for marriage is part of the Creator's design for humans. Since human offspring take about two decades of maturation, nurturance, and education, every child needs both biological parents, mother and father, to have a chance in life.  Long before Christianity and in places today where Christianity is just a footnote, mating couples have promised themselves in marriage so that their children could develop into successful adults. The right to marry is the right to choose an eligible mating partner with whom to begin a family.  To be eligible, the partner must be capable of permanent mating: one, single, unmarried, consenting non-relative adult of the opposite sex.  Without each of these attributes, permanent mating is impossible. With these preliminaries, I'm ready to answer your question.  In America, homosexuals presently enjoy the exact same rights as everyone else. For example, homosexuals already have the legal right to marry, but like everyone else, they have to marry an eligible mating partner. What is claimed to be \"gay rights\" are legal privileges extended to homosexuals but not to anyone else.  For example, homosexuals demand the right to have criminals punished more severely if they speak against homosexuality.  That is a legal privilege the rest of us do no enjoy, and hence not an equal right at all.   Of course, they have begun to demand the right to have their sexual relations with ineligible partners called marriages.  That, too, is not an equal right, because everyone else is subject to the natural restrictions of a mating relationship.  We cannot \"marry\" multiple partners or anyone who is already married, nonconsenting, a close relative, or a child, and of course anyone of the same sex. Finally, to the main question:  If anyone supports giving special privileges on the basis of sexual immorality, and especially if they are for undermining marriage, they are going against Christ because he taught that God sanctions actual marriage, in which \"a man shall leave his mother and and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" Cheers, Bruce", 8069, "Sn0CViR7aa", -2],

	60224 : ["You ovulate 14 days before your period is due. So depending on your cycle, if it's 30 days apart and you got your period today, your next period would be on June 12th and you would be ovulating on May 29th. You just have to calculate the amount of days between period, from the day you start to the next day you start next month. Then count back 14 days before your next period. It's NOT 14 days after your period, unless your cycle is 28 days apart. Another way to know when you're ovulating, is to check your cervix. Start today. Check today to feel if it's wet, open, and soft that means you're ovulating unless it's a day like today where you're on your period then your cervix will be open to let the blood out. If it's tightly closed and dryer that means you're not ovulating yet or you already passed it. You have to do this for awhile to get used to how your cervix feels every single day during your cycles. You have to check it every single day, at the same time to tell the difference from day to day.  Another way to tell when you're ovulating, is to check your temperature in the morning. Once a day, if it's 97.6 usually and it goes up one day to like 98.4 or something or more that means you've already ovulated so it's too late to try to conceive for that month. Hope that helps.

EDIT - By this I mean the top answers - not the ladies who have given you a rough date - you could ovulate in 14 days from now - if you had a regular cycle of 28 days, however no everyone does... So don't assume you will ovulate in 14 days that is inaccurate. You ovulate 14 days BEFORE each period. so when are you expecting your next period? Make sure you have lots of sex 3 weeks BEFORE your next period is due.
