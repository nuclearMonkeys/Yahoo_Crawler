	113032 : ["First let me ask  - are you really so far that you need a lawyer?  There are many advocacy groups that can help you through several levels of due process and those are levels you have to go to before you can litigate anyway.  If you have gone through all the levels and were using an advocacy group - ask them to assist you in finding someone before you retain an attorney for something that may be easily remedied. I see so many parents that rush to litigate when really sitting down and identifying what the issue is - where there is agreement already and what needs to happen next - would go a long way to provide what your child needs.

A lawyer will not take your case unless you have followed the IDEA laws and done everything you are suppose to do to settle the situation, and the school will not do right even after all you have done. A lawyer will tell you to first follow IDEA law and do what it says, and THEN call him IF the school doesnt' do right after that. Mediation in some states is useless. In GA, mediation is 'voluntary' on both sides. If a school is really bad they will not volunteer and you will get nowhere. Also in GA, the mediation is led by a mediator who does not order the school or parent to do anything, they only help both parties come to a decision. This should have been done in an IEP meeting, and this type of mediation is no different.", 10336, "de155aa75ff33c897388f46c5c881f0eaa", -1],

Avocados contribute nearly 20 vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are thought to help prevent many chronic diseases. Avocados contribute nearly 20 vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients, including 4% of the recommended Daily Value (DV) for vitamin E, 4% vitamin C, 8% folate, 4% fiber, 2% iron, 4% potassium, with 81 micrograms of lutein and 19 micrograms of beta-carotene. Avocados act as a \"nutrient booster\" by enabling the body to absorb more fat-soluble nutrients, such as alpha- and beta-carotene as well as lutein, in foods that are eaten with the fruit. Avocados contain 81 micrograms of the carotenoid lutein, which some studies suggest may help maintain healthy eyes. Avocados are included in Fruits & Veggies-More Mattersâ„¢ consumer educational program to promote increased consumption of fruits and vegetables for good health. Avocados contribute nearly 20 vitamins, minerals and beneficial plant compounds that can contribute to the nutrient quality of your diet. Avocados, due to their mono and polyunsaturated fat content, are a healthy substitution for foods rich in saturated fat. One-fifth of a medium avocado (1 oz) has 50 calories and contributes nearly 20 vitamins and minerals making it a good nutrient choice. Avocados contain 76 milligrams beta-sitosterol in a 3-oz serving of avocado. Beta-sitosterol is a natural plant sterol which may help maintain healthy cholesterol levels.

	113076 : ["I see that Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series has been mentioned.  This has been high in demand among the high readers in my son's fourth grade class as well as almost all the children in my daughter's sixth grade class.  My daughter has just started his new series which appears to be based on Egyptian Gods. Savvy by Ingrid Law was really good and is on the AR scale at around 6.0.  We are eagerly looking forward to the follow up, Scumble, that is due out in August. The Mysterious Benedict Society has also been mentioned.  This book is currently a three book series.  My daughter has read them on her own and loved them.  I have read books one and two aloud to the nine year old who also enjoyed them. Someone else has mentioned another of our favorites -- Terry Pratchett.  My children have most of the books he has written that are intended for children.  The Tiffany Aching series -- Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, and Wintersmith -- were so well written that we felt a little lost when we finished the last one.  We followed that up with The Bromeliad Trilogy and enjoyed it equally as much.  My daughter read The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents.  We have Nation in our stack to read.  I will say that we did not care for the series that begins with Johnny and the Bomb as well as we liked the others. Interspersed with our regular stack of books, we have found ourselves reading The 39 Clues.  My son loves the adventure and solving the clues hidden in each book.  The cards are just an added bonus.  If you follow the website, there are many activities to follow up on the history and geography included in each book.  However, there are some drawbacks.  The books are written at fourth to low fifth grade level, fairly short books, issued only in hardback, and they come with cards. Last spring my children both read Pond Scum by Alan Silberberg and loved the adventure and fantasy involved.  I will say that we read it together and were all a little disappointed by the ending.  After such high adventure, it left off a little soft. Horns & Wrinkles by Joseph Helgersen was another fantasy that my was chosen by my children.  We read that one aloud and have recommended it frequently. The Underneath by Kathi Appelt is in our stack to read between now and the start of school next year. If you utilize the AR book finder website as a parent, you can use the advanced search to locate books that interest your son.  The website will let you narrow your search down to reading level, interest level, and subject.  The nice thing about this is that by utilizing the interest level, you can eliminate the books that are written at higher levels that contain questionable material.  However, as the parent you should do a little research on the books.  I have found that there are some classics that have been categorized as UG, or upper grade, simply because they contain material that is not considered suitable by current standards.", 10338, "GvxO0W4Aaa", 0],
