If God basically knows what his plan is, then any suffering that even the main harmless of people bear might desire to be aside of His plan (although if it particularly is the case, then how can we prosecute murderers & rapists, I mean how do all of us comprehend that their acts are not a factor of God's plan besides and if it particularly is authentic then shouldn't we applaud the efforts of such human beings?)", 10912, "ku60rGiEaa", 0],

But God does have a plan to help us, and he will be acting on that plan very soon and he will restore us to the original plan he had for us - to have perfect humans living in peace and harmony on the paradise earth forever.

The two explanations are NOT mutually incompatible. And yes I am a Christian ... but I understand the science well enough to accept it. So, for example, I would NOT call evolution an \"explanation for creation\" ... evolution is NOT about the \"creation\" (or origins) of life.  Evolution is about how life *CHANGES*, not how it *STARTED*. Second, where does it say that a Christian is required to believe the Bible (or more specifically, the book of Genesis) *literally*?    Trust me, the truth of the Bible does NOT fall apart if you choose not to read it as a child would.   And finally, why on earth would it be \"hypocritical\".  Hypocrisy is when you hold people to behavior or standards that you violate yourself.  (E.g. Rush Limbaugh claiming to be a \"defender of marriage\", when he himself has been married 4 times ... THAT is hypocrisy.)   So you would have to explain why it is 'hypocrisy' for a Christian to accept evolution.", 10910, "AA11513203", 2],

Most notably, it contradicts the scientific consensus that humans evolved from more primitive species of hominids.  It is also incompatible with current understanding of human genetics. In particular, if all humans descended from two individuals several thousand years ago, it would require an impossibly high mutation rate to account for the observed variation.  These incompatibilities have caused some Christians to move away from a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative.", 10910, "HhZT5dqFaa", 0],

It's possible that the betta is refusing food because he is stressed by the new environment, or another common issue is that the water is too cold. ~Please purchase him a proper home as soon as possible.

Although, if he doesn't have a heater, he's probably cold. So I would recommend adding one. If he's resting at the bottom of the tank, check your water parameters. Make sure that he was introduced to a fully established tank, and that the nitrites and ammonia are both at 0ppm, and the nitrates are around 20ppm. As far as facts and tips go, just make sure that you're housing him correctly. Betta's do not appreciate spiky objects in their tank, as they can scratch themselves easily, so stick to live or silk plants. Make sure you have at least one hiding spot, like a cave for your betta to seek refuge and protection when threatened. Betta's are carnivores, and enjoy eating blood worms and brine shrimp. Live is best, but frozen and freeze-dried are other options as well. You may also want to fast your betta once or twice a week in order to clear out his digestive system.

Most people who do believe aren't going to make fun of the Eucharist by referring to it as cannibalism. Therefore, I have to assume you don't believe in the Real Presence - which means you don't believe the bread and wine actually become the Body and Blood of Christ - which means you KNOW Catholics are not committing cannibalism. So why make the claim to begin with when you don't even believe it yourself? Second, the the Body and Blood of Christ is the GLORIFIED Body and Blood of Christ; meaning, it's not merely a flesh and blood body like mere human beings have.
