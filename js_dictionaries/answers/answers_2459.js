	128778 : ["Over the last two decades, we have seen the proliferation of many new cable channels, and several all-News networks beginning with CNN and those that followed.  This has greatly expanded the public awareness of political issues such that many watch the news the way some watch sports.  They become AVID FOLLOWERS of \"their team\" and so with incredible zeal, they will get behind one issue or platform or another. With this level of zeal and devotion, one natural (but unfortunate) outcome will be the popularization of NAME CALLING.  In this MOSH PIT of political debate, you will have a section of the audience similar to PROLES who are not held as responsible to public standards of decorum as those, say, on prime time TV.  So they let their nomenclature sink as low as they can because their voice is so small and dwarfed by so much competition over Yahoo! Answers, they are looking for MAXIMUM IMPACT with emotionally-laden monikers like the ones you mention (i.e. Obamabots, Libtards, etc.). In answer to your question -- NO -- these names will not win the opponent over to your point of view.  When did name-calling ever achieve that?  In fact, the first point of order in a reasonable debate is to not resort to name calling.  But people here on Yahoo! Answers do it anyway because there is not enough \"back-and-forth\" between Asker & Responder to create an incentive for more orderly and conscientious debate.  So some Responsders go for maximum impact by engaging in commentary more likened to a DRIVE BY SHOOTING in an effort to placate their own ego, as this is amusing to some.  But the risk, of course, is suspension or cancellation of membership for going over the line with disrespectful commentary and the ones who manage this service (mostly BOTS) along with the TROLLS who cruise these electronic hallways just LOOKING for a fight for their own amusement in trying to get someone cancelled -- will ultimately demonstrate that NAME CALLING is just not a good policy in the long run. But for quick hit, it serves the purpose of CHEAP THRILLS which for many, is the only reason they come here.", 11003, "4NVkkEZWaa", 2],

Same as with the church, we take it up on faith that our understandings are correct, although I'd give science the edge because it admits that it can be fallible and has a system of rules to replace understandings that are incorrect. So yes, in that sense, miracles that violate the known laws of nature are possible because we cannot claim we know all the laws of nature.  However, the known laws of nature are pretty rock solid and applying them yields the correct result often enough to call them true.", 10987, "1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa", 1],

If a thing is possible....then it is not a miracle (although it could be a very unlikely fortunate event...or a \"freak of nature\").  It's impossible, so therefore it would not be rationale to believe in it.  Do I believe for example that a man can command that a arm instantly grow where a arm was severed?  Or a truly blind man be given sight by command?  Etc.?  No generally I do not believe that can happen.  I have never seen anything even approaching that happen either. I do think however that God (and that as Christ as well) can do the impossible.  It would follow that a almighty God could do that which was, to us, impossible to do.   I do believe in the miracles described in Scripture.  I do not think these occur today however, nor have I ever seen such a thing (yet have heard plenty of false claims that they have).   I would suggest The Final Word by O. Palmer Robertson (quick and easy read) for a theological look at this.", 10987, "RermzbWgaa", 1],

Most of the problems with Hume's account of the unverifiabilty of scientific laws can be resolved by using incremental (rather than absolute) confirmation when verifying scientific laws. The argument you've given (everything after however) also makes the category mistake of claiming that scientific laws and our understanding of scientific laws are equivalent.  Hume argued that our understanding of scientific laws was empirically unverifiable, but that doesn't rule out the possibility that there are absolute laws of nature that we simply don't have access to.", 10987, "HOKJNHFoaa", 3],
