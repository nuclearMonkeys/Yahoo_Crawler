	12912 : ["checkmate = king is in check and can't get out = win for the 'mater' stalemate = king is not in check and no legal moves left= draw the possibility of stalemate makes the game interesting and gives hope to a side that is losing otherwise eke out a draw, not to mention all the creativity in chess problems", 2156, "6550b30f9666274461a0ce1fb9acdd51aa", 0],

	12914 : ["If the king is not in check and has nowhere to move and the other pieces on the board cannot move then the player has no moves and it is called a draw. The goal is to trap the king and be able to deal the finishing blow. If they cannot move before you put them in the final checkmate then the player forced a draw, which is the best-case scenario for a losing player. Being able to force a draw is a high-level move that takes much practice. Just like a king and a bishop cannot force checkmate by themselves. A way to look at this is by setting up the board with white having a king and a bishop and black only having their king. If black plays correctly they can force themselves into the corner and not be taken out by either white's king or bishop. This forces a draw and black does not lose.", 2156, "LQw0u3mdaa", -1],

Sure the Ps2 had it's moments but oh man, the moment I first played Last Resort on my friends Xbox 360, I knew what I wanted. Hence I secretly worked odd jobs for people after school, I stashed and Hid my money in various places like my guitar, in a ziploc high in the trees, a clay pot that dried. Because I knew my step parents would sneak around my stuff trying to find stuff. And when it was time my little bro and I went to Best Buy, when Xbox was at it's peak. I'll never forget walking into those doors, walking down that aisle, and grabbing one of the many boxes that contained my pride n joy. Ooh the sensation I had purchasing and walking out with it, two awesome games in tow, it was Magnificent. Damn you best believe those were one of the pinnacles in my life, going to friends houses, staying up all night system linking and playing on Xbox live with a ridiculous amount of junk food. Meeting new and different people across the world, talking smack and having a freakin' blast. Sure I had some dark crap going on at home with the parents (Who doesn't). But were it not for the wonders of my now old and retired Xbox 360 Elite, surely I would've wandered down a path I would to this day probably would be regretting. Ah the little things that can make a large change in one's life. Fast forward years later and here I am hitting that same nostalgia with my son. ", 2172, "None", 0],

I've made a list of cruise ships. I could leave from Seattle, Vancouver, or fly to Anchorage and cruise back to  Seattle or Vancouver.  I've discovered a scenic train ride through a national park. I'm writing down contact information, dates it's open, and the cost. It will cost about $3,000 per person. So, it will take a minimum of 6 months of savings, but probably longer.    There's my goal. I'm still finding out what documentation I will need. passports? And what other activity will my family what to do? My son humors me. Sure mom, let's go zip-lining in Alaska, it's only $150 per person.  ", 2173, "NfSLXHU3aa", 1],
