By the way, Sigma does not make a 25-70mm lens.  I assume you mean 24-70mm, instead.  If you turn the AF activation off at the shutter button and on at the rear AF button, you effectively have the same amount of control of when the AF is activated.  However, if you do need to rack focus or other manual focusing technique, you'll be hosed without full manual focus control. On a side note, unless you absolutely need that shallow depth of field look that you get from a full-frame camera, you will be doing yourself a huge disservice by getting a digital still camera instead of a camcorder.  Camcorders are still the way to go for shooting video while digital cameras are primarily used for B roll.  The total lack of video features, the slow down of workflow due to overheating issues, etc... makes a digital still camera a very bad option as a main camera. But if you just have to get a lens and shoot with a DSLR or mirrorless, then I would strongly suggest that  you rent these lenses and see which one works best for your needs.  You may find that one has better & faster AF and/or one has a noisy AF system that makes it unusable on set.

My own work does not require speed, and so I bought the 1DsII when the 1DsIII came out, saving myself over three thousand dollars. I now look at the Canon 5D II as well as other digital cameras, and, although I feel the tug to buy, I know that there is absolutely no rush. Those cameras that are presently considered top of the line will soon be second or third best again in their own product line. I do shoot film as well, however, and so I picked up some older Hasselblad equipment for very little. I will enjoy working with the Hassy, but I know that most of my shots will continue to be made with a digital camera. When will I need another digital camera? Maybe never. Mine are all still functioning perfectly, even my old 5 MP Olympus E-20 that I bought seven years ago. Claims about digital obsolescence are vastly overstated. --Lannie", 6957, "FJBL60lLaa", 0],

	49468 : ["Digital cameras take pictures that are translated into pixels which correspond to points on a screen which can be a TV screen, a computer monitor or a phone.  The screen projects light electronically which is why your phone can be used as a flashlight. The points are called pixels and the greater number of pixels the sharper the image which is why as the number of mega pixels increase the better quality the picture. They both work with a lens and a shutter so the quality of the lens and the accuracy and speed of the shutter also affect the quality of a picture on either digital or film cameras. Until digital images reached 8, 10, 12 and more megapixels photographers preferred using film cameras but after they reached those higher numbers the digital cameras became equal too then superior to film cameras because of efficacy of use. When you view a picture digitally such as on a TV or phone ti is different than viewing a printed picture because the digital image is bombarding your eyes with light and the printed image is not which is why watching a movie on TV is different than watching it at the movies where the projector projects the light rather than the screen emitting the light. ", 6928, "ZWgp96bZaa", 0],

And the image results from a large lens, large-sensor camera, when properly used, are vastly better than those from any phone camera. Even a good compact digital camera can make photos from a phone look bad in direct comparison. I've done that, photos of the same scenes from the same point with both a high-end compact and a high-end phone, and the differences are very obvious. I don't use my SLR very often (a D5300), but for some things nothing else will work as well as that does. (But I still take ten times more photos with my phone than any other camera). ps. And remember that once you have a decent SLR, to upgrade it you can generally keep the lenses and only upgrade the body; you do not have to buy the entire \"kit\" - and you can then get some of the cost back by selling the old camera body.", 6938, "T5MR7fNHaa", 4],

Given that new mid range and better DSLRs now command a ridiculously high price (that people will pay), it stands to reason that the more decent cameras from a few years back still command quite a price ticket. Don't base that on what a dealer might pay you for your old camera, because they need to put a big mark-up on it to survive. From what I can remember of the evolving market, once APS-C and 35mm sensors got to 8 megapixels, the poor quality at high ISO and dynamic range issues, had been effectively dealt with. ", 6938, "UReKGnGXaa", 1],

	49474 : ["The F60R is an action cam and a very low-end one at that. You mention your phone's camera sucks.  This is to be expected since the camera module in your phone can be replaced for $4 on eBay.  Yes, your expensive phone has a $4 camera in it.  Don't feel too bad, even the $1,300 iPhone uses a $20 camera. If you are interested in photos and not video, then the F60R (or any action cam for that matter) would be a very bad choice.  Reason being is that action cams use fish-eye lenses which produce a HUGE amount of distortion.  They are intended for video and not stills. If you need to record a wide area while being close to said area, or you need to a device to placed in a small and discrete area, then get a action cam.  Its fish-eye lens will allow you to get a large area (e.g. skateboarder's body) while being physically close to it, and it'll be light and small so as to not be a problem on your helmet or skateboard.  In this kind of scenario where you're doing video, the action cam will be a decent option.  Keep in mind that the audio will likely be very, very bad. If you do not a video recorder for this or a similar situation, then do not get an action cam.  Instead, get yourself a used digital camera from places like keh.com, bhphotovideo.com, adorama.com and the like.  For $30 you can get a used Panasonic, Canon, Sony or Nikon digital camera with a decent zoom lens.  Of course these camera will be older and as a result may not have as good video as even a modern day phone, but better than what's in your current phone.", 6961, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
	49475 : ["The anonymous poster doesn't understand specs. Keerok's answer is spot on. Number of pixels must be weighed against sensor area as pixel area is important when talking about dynamic range, noise, & color depth. This camera is a knockoff of a GoPro (action video camera). For still shots, this camera will probably be close to your phone camera (a $10 module) in quality. If you want to do better than your phone camera, get a 1\" sensor pocket camera. Unfortunately, they cost upwards of $400 unless you can find one second hand. As Keerok said, understanding lighting can make or break your picture. For small sensored cameras you need strong lighting. Indoor lighting is challenging for small sensored cameras like your phone camera.", 6961, "HFuI8oVYaa", 0],

	49477 : ["The Mk 3 is much better.  A firmware update totally fixed the autofocus problem and reduced the overheating, and the overheating was only a problem with 4K video recording. If you don't use that feature, and most people don't, then it was never a problem to begin with.  In February Canon announced an internal hardware update which solved the overheating and they quietly recalled existing unsold stocks for replacement. Customers complaining to Canon about it under warranty benefit from a \"soft recall\" where those who make contact send in their G7iii and get sent an exchange model with the hardware update. You have to accept that AF will NEVER be as fast as on cameras which can use phase detect AF like the Sony equivalents and on all modern dSLR and mirrorless CSC models. So if you want faster AF then the G7 is totally the wrong model, but you simply don't get that at that low a price level. If you want that you need to look at models like the FujiFilm X100v (only the v has it, not the earlier X100/x100s/x100t/x100f). Even the Leica D-LUX 7 doesn't have phase detect. Addressing your question about the price difference between the G7ii and G7iii, it is due to simple supply and demand economics. Lots of customers were scared off by the reported G7iii problems and so Canon realised that they did not need to drop the wholesale price of the remaining stocks of G7ii models. But they also had too many G7iii models so lowered the prices on those to stimulate demand. When supplies of the G7ii dry up, you'll see the prices on the G7iii rise as there's nothing else as good at anywhere near that price level.", 6962, "None", 2],
