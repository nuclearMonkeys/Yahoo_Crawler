	130731 : ["Great Question, just some random thoughts. Hippies were, a group of young adults and teens that were anti-war, and anti-establishment, back in the late 60's to early 70's. Many were college kids. Their ideology was simple. Drugs, sex, and rock n roll, and protest. They generally wore tied dyed t-shirts, bell bottom jeans, jackets with the American flag sewed on the back, granny spectacles, had long hair with a bandanna used as a head band. I think if the Vietnam war and or the civil rights movement didn't exist, hippies would have never happened. Hippies were hated by Johnson, Nixon, and J. Edgar Hoover , and others in the establishment. Woodstock was the climax of the Hippy movement, and by the time disco came around it was nearly dead. I think there's probably still some hippies out there, but they had to go more  main stream, and I'm sure they still have a very liberal philosophy. I'm sure they love nothing more than to get in their basement, spark one up, and spin some great rock n roll records. I think the whole aor ( album orientated rock ) movement was greatly influenced by Hippies. That was when bands and artists wanted to put more meaning in their music, and would make the album, instead of a bunch of 3 minute songs on a record. Peace", 11080, "NdnCh26Vaa", 3],

One of the most influential gaming titles in the world, with over six titles under its belt, Halo offers the best in FPS's, both in single and multiplayer. Gears of War - My personal fav, Gears may not do justice in singleplayer, but the multiplayer is hands down, the best on any console, and has been mentioned to be a favourite amongst critics in that aspect. Alan Wake - Taking gaming back to a brave angle, survival horror, Alan Wake is a reputable series. Splinter Cell - This stealth franchise is amongst the most popular in the world. Conviction took the game in a different direction, and for the better. Once a multiplatform experience, Microsoft bought this one out. Fable - A fun, if slightly silly, fantasy RPG full of vibrant colours and characters. Forza- A top contestant in the world of driver simulators. I'm sure there's more...

They like music that has feeling to it. They have a bohemian kind of lifestyle. Sometimes they're passionate about the environment, and although they don't do the peace sign to anyone who'll look, they do want world peace lol! They take a peaceful approach if they disgree with something, usually protesting. They tend to be vegetarian more than other social groups.  Basically, i just think hippies are a group of people who have certain ethical beliefs, and who live a certain kind of lifestyle/ dress sense.  =) Edit: I just thought i'd add, i think that hippies as they once were in the 1960s don't exist anymore.

	130754 : ["Absolutely positively no doubt in my mind the Halo series for Xbox 360. For one, it basically started the first person shooter genre of games we play today and was the first of its kind on console. also, it is definitely a game series you will get hours and hours and hours and hours (i could keep going) of enjoyment from, and even more if you play online. The recent installments of Halo also give an immense span of opportunities of original gameplay. From creating your own map in forge, or making your own custom gametype to play with your friends on YOUR custom made map, to fighting wave after wave of baddies in firefight with up to four of your friends over xbox live, you will NEVER get bored. And best of all? Every single Halo game has one of the most influential and interesting campaigns of all time. the campaign alone of one game will get you hooked immediately in the fantastic story of the Halo universe. Start with the first and go through the series though, please i beg you or you wont enjoy it as much. if you dont know the order of the games it goes: -Halo: Combat evolved -Halo 2 -Halo 3 -Halo 3: ODST -Halo Reach and Halo Wars is in there between 3 and ODST i think, it tells a totally unrelated story and is a strategy game. but great all the same. Halo: Anniversary was recently released which is an HD remake of the first game (Halo: Combat Evolved) so you may want to think about that as well. and next will come Halo 4 in 2012. i hope i was a help to you.  -Devon", 11077, "5pUKSWW4aa", 0],
