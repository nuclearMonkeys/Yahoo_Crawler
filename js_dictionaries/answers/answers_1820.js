	96733 : ["The following will give you some ideas The following was compiled by me to give more help to new rabbit owners and I exhibit rex, dutch, harlequins, magpies and dwarf lop rabbits, also ferrets and ferret cross European polecat hybrids, I got my first pet ferret and pet rabbit over 50+ years ago, when I was a small child. History ... Dutch rabbits, along with the English, were the most popular pet and exhibition rabbits a position that has now been filled by the Lop breeds. Originally from Holland or Belgium, the breed is striking in its appearance with a white blaze carrying up to a point between the ears, a saddle of colour continuing right around the middle of the rabbit with a straight edge and white markings on the hind feet. Their coat should be glossy and they are a medium size rabbit weighing 2.04 -2. 26 kg (4.5 lb. 5 lb.).  Behaviour of all rabbits ... Dutch rabbits are very lively and alert and should make good pets although a prospective owner should be looking for a breeder that handles the rabbits regularly from a young age so that the rabbit is not too jumpy. Colours Black, Blue, Chocolate, Yellow, Tortoiseshell, Steel Grey, Brown Grey, Pale Grey and Tri Colour By using body language rabbits can stamp their feet or with a flash of a tail they can be seen and heard by other rabbits over a long distance. Feeding ... Rabbits require a high fibre with lots of low quality hay (dried grass) or straw and low protein feed to prevent digestive problems, all rabbits do better on a poor quality hay than on a better quality hay such as timothy hay. Use rabbit pellets which can be purchased from pet shops to provide all your rabbits dietary needs and along with the following. Vegetables:  Artichoke leaves and Jerrusalem leaves, stems and tubers, Asparagus, Baby Sweetcorns and full size ones, Beetroot, Broccoli (and its leaves, including purple sprouting varieties), Brussel Sprouts (leaves and sprouts), Cabbage (can sometimes cause digestive upsets), Carrots (and carrot tops), Cauliflower (and the leaves), Celeriac, Celery (and its leaves), Chicory (in small amounts as this is a diretic), Courgette ( also leaves and flowers), Cucumber ( also leaves and flowers), Curly Kale (Excerlent for winter use), Fennel, Green beans (including leaves and stems), Kohl rabi, Parsnip, Peas (including the leaves and pods), Peppers (red, green and yellow), Pumpkin ( also leaves and flowers), Radish Tops, Rocket, Romaine (and all other lettuce as this is a diretic), Spinach (only occasional), Spring Greens, Squash (e.g. Butternut, leaves and flowers), Swede (Excerlent for winter use), Turnip (only occasional), Watercress. Herbs (often powerful tastes so may take some getting used to): Basil, Coriander, Dill, Mint (peppermint), Parsley, Oregano, Rosemary, Sage, Thyme.  Fruits (should be fed in moderation, due to sugar content): all types of fresh fruit including skin Apple, Apricot, Banana (high in potassium),Blackberries (and leaves – excellent astringent properties), Blueberries,Cherries, Grapes, Kiwi Fruit, Melon, Mango, Nectarines, Orange, Papaya, Peach, Pear, Pineapple, Plums, Strawberries, Raspberries (and leaves – excellent astringent properties), Tomatoes (not the leaves) Wild Garden Herbs/Weeds/Flowers: Borage, Calendula, Camomile, Chickweed ( in small amounts as this is a diretic), Clover (leaves and flowers), Coltsfoot, Comfrey, Dandelion (in small amounts as this is a diretic), Goosegrass (cleavers) but may stick to coat!, Lavender, Mallow, Nettle (the type with the white flowers), Nasturtium (leaves and flowers), Shepherd's purse, Sow Thistle, Plantain, Yarrow.                        Extra vitamins and salt licks are not required.                                                                                          Any changes in diet must be made slowly (green stuffs and prepared feeds) over a period of a couple of weeks, to avoid digestive upsets. Fresh water must be available at all times and renewed daily. To enable your rabbit to extract as much protein, vitamins and minerals from their low quality food, they digest their food twice, these are soft, kidney shaped droppings which are covered in a small amount of mucous. These droppings are very different from the dry round droppings that you will usually see your rabbit passing. Rabbits are herbivorous and wild rabbits will spend most of their lives grazing on grass, foliage, flowers and roots Rabbits living indoor will drink more water than rabbits living out of doors because of the dryer atmosphere Housing ... For first time rabbit owner once you get home with your rabbit, put it in your cage and leave it for 48 house so that it can get used to its new surroundings before you start handling it, if you start to handle it too early you could end up with a very grumpy young rabbit from the start. Rabbits can be kept indoors or outdoors, either way they need their own space in an appropriate cage or hutch. There are many purpose built cages and hutches available, alternatively you could build your own. It is recommended that you purchase the best quality you can afford, your rabbit will need it for 7--12 years. Make sure that the hutch is large enough for your rabbit to stretch full out, and high enough for your rabbit to stand upright. Dutch rabbits are generally comfortable in a 4' x 2' hutch. If kept outdoors, the hutch should have a dark enclosed area to provide your rabbit with a quiet space. The main living area should be large enough for your rabbit to stretch full out, and have wire mesh on the door. The hutch should be at least 6\" off the floor to provide adequate ventilation. In the winter you can move your rabbits indoors or into a shed. They are also quite happy remaining out of doors, providing extra protection such as an old blanket draped over the front of the hutch at night in very cold weather. Remember rabbits need good ventilation, you can not therefore leave the cover down permanently otherwise your rabbit will succumb to chest infections from the damp, ammonia or overheating, and rabbits die from all of these.  Rabbits are naturally very clean animals and will only defecate and urinate in one area. Bedding ... Hay, straw and wood chips all make suitable bedding for rabbits. It is down to personal choice which you use, however, research has shown that rabbits will choose straw rather than wood chip or wire bottomed cages. All bedding should be renewed at least once a week, and the hutch should be washed, scrubbed and disinfected several times per year. Rabbits can live out doors quite happily at minus 20c or below, all they need is plenty of bedding and a 4 inch layer of shavings Exercise ... Rabbits need regular stimulation and exercise in a safe environment. This can be in a purpose made rabbit run or simply by bringing your rabbit indoors and letting it play in your living room. Rabbits that are playing outside of their hutches, either in a run or indoors, should be supervised at all times and their play area must be 'rabbit proofed' by removing any hazards. Young rabbits will enjoy exercise, but be careful not to over do it, particularly if you are still in the 'getting to know each other' period. Rabbits are sociable creatures and enjoy the company of humans, dogs, cats and other rabbits if carefully introduced. It is generally suggested that each rabbit has its own hutch (particularly if you intend to show it) as rabbits are like children and prefer not to share 'bedrooms'. They can, however, socialise together in common space, such as rabbit runs, and will like being able to see and hear another rabbit when they are in their own hutches. 2 bucks must never be put together even in a run if they have not been castrated (they will fight). Rabbits need to be occupied and they love playing with toys. This can include manufactured toys for human babies, birds, cats, dogs, hamsters etc. But rabbits will equally get hours of enjoyment from some very cheap, readily available items in the household, blocks of wood, planks, plastic flower pots. Rabbits can get exercise by taking them out on a harness and lead, but the problem with this is that rabbits can pick up diseases and fleas left on the grass by other rabbits, if their vaccinations are up to date they should not get any of the diseases but they will still pick up fleas. Rabbits left to run around the home while the householder is out will chew wires, electric leads and furniture, these pets should be put in a pen or hutch while the householders are not at home. Health ... It is recommend that you get your rabbit covered by Pet Insurance as veterinary fees can mount up. Never leave a rabbit in the sole care of a child. As an adult you will have to assume sole responsibility for the health and welfare of your child's rabbit. To prevent territorial behaviour of both bucks (males) and does (females), it is suggested that pet rabbits are neutered, if they are not neutered then it should be one rabbit per cage. I don't see altering as cruel when the kits may be dead in a year anyway; either through being \"released\" into the wild\" or being slaughtered in a shelter when the owners have got bored of them. Never put intact cavies / guinea-pigs in with intact rabbits as they will both sexually abuse each other, cavies / guinea- pigs should be housed with others of the same species. Males can be neutered at around 3-4 months, and does at 6 months. Females over 2-3 years old that are not being regularly bred from are at high risk of developing uterine cancer unless neutered. Rabbits have little ability to regulate their body temperature and die very easily from heat stroke. Ensure adequate shade is provided at all times. Handle your rabbit daily, and it will generally enjoy your company. Never pick a rabbit up by its ears, and always support your rabbits back and hind quarters when handlin", 9598, "None", 0],

When I studied abroad in Italy last fall, I stayed in Florence, and I made every other major city a day trip. You'll be very tired but you can sleep on the train--how often will you get to go to Italy? Live it up! I don't know where you're arriving, but again, you can make every major city a day trip. In Milian, you have to see the Castle, check out the shops, try to get yourself on the list to see the Last Supper, etc. Then, go to Venice. gondola rides can run you 90 Euro, and up to 10 people can ride in a gondola. I only like modern art, so I only ended up going to the modern art museum there. Next, there's Florence. Again, an art city. The Duomo and the David are must sees, and they're on the same street. Finally, Roma. Rome I would actually give more than a day to but my friend and I saw EVERYTHING in a half a day. We were on a tight schedule but we did it. We actually had a flight to catch to Athens which is what cut our day so short. I don't know where you want to go to in Greece, but I've been to Athens and Thessaloniki. You can find low cost flights through ryanair.com or easyjet.com to Greece from Rome (or many of the other major cities in Italy). Since we didn't book too much in advance, we ended up using Aegean Air. Of course, flying is the quickest way to get to Greece. We had a hard time finding alternative routes (i.e. train to southern Italy then ferry to Greece) that were easy and/or cheap. And if you do make it to Greece, watch out for slicksters.

The least expensive way to get to Greece is to take the train to Brindisi and  the ferry (overnight) to Piraeus.   You can get deck passage, which is the cheapest or you can get a cabin.

There is pellets with a rabbit picture on the bag. Where ever hampster food is, there will be rabbit food. Also, give your rabbit hay. Even horse hay works. To clean the rabbits cage, get a large cage, a litter box, and litter, and get some bedding. I use a broom scoop to scoop out all of the old bedding in the cage. Also, get a waterbottle that hooks to the cage.  Rabbits love to run and play around. Let them run around your basement or fenced back yard. Feed the 2-3 times a day. Your rabbit needs pinaple every once in a while for the teeth, and lettuce for ther digestive system. Only Romaine lettuce though. Keep the rabbit inside. Unless your outside with it. Defiantly get your rabbit fixed at the vet. If there is cords around the bunny, cover them up because they love to chew cords. Our new 48 inch plasma screen tv was just chewed by our rabbit.

It'll be hot, but not unbearably... high temps in the nineties and lows in the upper 70s, but there will be a breeze, usually from the east. Spring Break ends Easter weekend (it starts in mid-March), which is April 8th. How much money you'll need will depend on what you want to do. If you want to sit on a beach for a month and work on your tan, maybe a hundred bucks a week, but it goes up. Also, Cancun is not cheap.  First and foremost, get pesos. Get them while you are there, not from here. The best place for them is from an ATM. You'll get the current exchange rate, and you'll only pay a transaction fee and an ATM fee... probably about three bucks plus one buck per. The problem is, vendors see dollars and will shortchange you. The current exchange rate is about 11 pesos to the dollar (10.93 or something). You'll get change based on TEN pesos to the dollar. For example, if you buy something that is 81 pesos and you give the guy a ten dollar bill, you'll get 19 pesos in change, when at the exchange rate 81 pesos is $7.41. You should have received 28 pesos, not 19. You may think that is just pocket change, but you lose nearly 10 percent on every transaction. Using an ATM you lose 4 percent. Use dollar bills for tips ONLY. My wife and I spent a week in Tulum (about 75 miles south of Cancun) last summer on our honeymoon. If you want to drink, don't go to the glitzy clubs... you'll be paying tourist prices. Go to local bars and the like. Ditto with restaurants. Eat where the locals eat. We visited the ruins at Tulum and there was a Subway sandwich shop at the entrance. We didn't fly 800 miles for a Subway Club, even if the place served beer. We ate in Tulum pueblo instead, and got some great grub. The natives will appreciate it if you try to speak Spanish, although the staff speaks English in most resort areas. Even if it is just to say \"Muchas gracias\" they'll appreciate that you try.  Be sure if, using a credit card, that the transactions are noted in pesos. You buy a dinner and a beer and it is 150 pesos. That's no problem, but the currency symbol is the same ($) as ours. If in doubt, write MXN before the dollar symbol on the merchant copy.
