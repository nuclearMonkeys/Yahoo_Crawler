It depends on the instructor as to when these things are taught to the students. My knowledge of wing chun is limited. But I have personally met 2 wing chun SiFu that teach ground fighting. There are a group of black belt that gt together after the dojo closes. We come from a variety of backgrounds/styles. We get a chance to work on our techniques and keeping ourselves sharp. We also get to share knowledge. Normally My sensei or me teaches the class. Then occasionally this one SiFu comes and he may teach some things. He may bring a guest and the guest might teach a few techniques. A few weeks ago we were working on gun disarms. Then we worked on ground fighting using techniques that the guest SiFu teaches his students. I can't speak for other guys but he is not gentle with us when we trained. You are going to feel some pain...lol When I was studying judo we were taught strikes, kicks, wrist locks, chokes. We were also taught how to defend against them and how to escape from various common holds that people do like head lock, full nelson, bear hug, etc. I briefly trained in another place that didn't teach self defense with their judo.

This branch of aikido focuses more on the development and use of body energy in throws, grounding, weapons, and movements. Good schools for ki-aikido will belong to the ki society.

They offer unlimited access to all weekly shaolin style kung fu, tai chi, qi gong, nei gong, etc. classes for ~100$ monthly. They have good weapons training and teach a great variety of styles that are very useful. You can find more info and a list of locations on their website (shaolin-do.com) Capoeira is very fun. It is also very tiring (1000 calories a class). You can watch some capoeira videos on you tube. Good ones will usually have bahia, batuque, mestre (master), or batizad in the name or description.
