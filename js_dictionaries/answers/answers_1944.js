From 12 years of age diminished blood supply come from lower in that bone. This fact, along with the unusual shape of the neck of the femur  and the way the person falls indicates which bones are going to break.  Osteoporosis plays a part in the severity of the fracture but it is muscle loss and reduced reflexes that leads to the fall. There are about 7 typical fractures of the hip and each one is caused by a slightly different way of landing in the fall. Elderly people tend to have more hip fractures because alot of them lose muscle mass around their 'centre of gravity' or 'core' .  A persons 'centre of gravity' is in their pelvis.  The 'muscular core' are the inner muscles of the upper legs and those of the lower torso.  If these muscles are weak - stability is diminished.", 9835, "None", -1],

Women's hormones protect her against losing bone mass but once she stops producing the hormones (at menopause); men as they get old also start to lose bone mass if they don't ingest enough calcium and Vit. D and other minerals and do weight-bearing exercises to keep the bones in prime shape.  The hips and spine are particularly vulnerable because of the way they are constructed.  The body needs calcium to function too and if it isn't getting enough from the stuff we ingest, it steals it from the bones and it figures the pelvis bone is a big bone so can stand more robbing then, say, your arm bone.  Arms and legs are not immune though--many elderly get wrist fractures (there are a lot of little bones in your wrist) and feet fractures and things.  Many fractures go unattended and are just passed off as arthritis or little aches that don't stop you from carrying on more or less as usual.  But if you fracture your hip or spine, it will affect your ability to be erect (sitting or standing).  Also, even if you don't do much exercising at all, you still use your arms and legs as long as you are mobile so arms and legs tend to get more exercise then the hips and spine.", 9835, "4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa", 0],

I believe that there are no 'boundaries' as such to the Universe, as what we see is based on perception, just as the universe has no centre we could not comprehend the shape of the universe and so we could not find the edge rather just go around in circles for eternity.

We are bounded within a finite universe. Another way to say all this is you can start from anywhere you like, travel away from that point and eventually you'll simply come back to where you were.
