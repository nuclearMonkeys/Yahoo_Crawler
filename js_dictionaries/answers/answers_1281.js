Restart, and before the computer logo comes on( dell, hp, or whatever ur computer is) PRESS F 8 A COUPLE OF TIMES-- a black screen with white lettering will appear. with ur u and down arrows, select SAFE MODE WITH NETWORKING) the computer should look weird as it starts up in safe mode( dont worry/its all fine) Step #2. Download Malwarebytes from:   ( the free one) Here are the instructions after you download it: Double-click mbam-setup.exe and follow the prompts to install the program. At the end, be sure a checkmark is placed next to the following: Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware Then click Finish. If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version. Once the program has loaded, select Perform quick scan, then click Scan. When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Be sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected. Step# 3 Download AVAST from : On the lest side, click DOWNLOAD NOW Follow the same steps from Malwarebytes( it will be a bit different since it is a different program, but the essentials are the same: install AVAST, run scan, check found results, and remove them) After this, restart your computer, and everything should be back to normal.

One of the biggest myts and mistakes made by people in general, is thinking that the more anti virus programs you have installed on your computer the better it is.THAT IS A MISTAKE AND A MYTH. The reason for that is bceause anti virus programs counteract and overwrite eachother, thus errors in removing viruses. One ativirus an one anti malaware, is more then enough.
