Things DO work out \"satisfactorily\" in the end, but his karma is not actually anybody else's business but his own. The only possible thing that could make a difference might be your forgiveness: nobody is perfect!Unsurprisingly you are hurt and angry, and I'm sorry to hear that.

	29564 : ["My husband and I married at an out-of-the-way but upscale resort an hour (by car) west of Orlando (Florida) International airport. It was just us and our parents for a morning ceremony. The hotel provided golf carts and drivers to chauffer everyone from hotel to decorated garden spot. There was a refreshment table with coffee, tea, juice, etc, and of course seating. The hotel provided the officiant and the photographer. After the vow exchange our \"limos\" drove us to some spots by a fountain, overlooking a lake, etc, for photos and then back to the hotel for a champagne (OK, it was really Prosecco) breakfast.¬† Throughout all of this the hotel wedding planner had been with us, quietly in the background holding the ladies' hand bags, producing a much wanted safety pin, and just generally making everything go smoothly. She was still with us, albeit at a distance during our breakfast. The photographer was still with us too, taking photos of the groom opening bottles of bubbly, the parents toasting the newlyweds, and so on.¬† The hotel provided flowers for everyone, for the ceremony spot, and for the breakfast table. Our meal was on a large private balcony, away other diners. It was ordinary breakfast food like eggs, sausages, pancakes -- nothing fancy except the bubbly. The hotel also provided night before accommodations for one set of parents, a car and driver for the other set who lived nearby. And two nights in a large suite for the happy couple. The hotel bill came to about $2,500. I thought that was amazing. Yes, we did omit a fancy cake and i kept the flowers simple. And we had a wedding breakfast instead of a dinner. But the rooms with nice views and balconies, the car and driver, the golf cart caravan with drivers, officiant, the photographer, the flowers, the private dining area, the meal, the wine, and best of all the making it wonderfully easy for us to arrange -- it was a great value for the money.¬†", 4577, "iz1cNz5Laa", 1],
	29565 : ["because women have such high standards. the metoo movement makes it impossible for men to even desire to approach women. because women only value looks money and status; ie rich people or men they call daddy with their tongues to the floor. because women don't give nice guys a chance (genuine nice guys not the nice guy syndrome) women choose disgusting men who actively destroy them and then it's apparently okay to generalise all men as disgusting pigs; but we can't generalise women. double standards. because women are impossible to maintain, they offer nothing but expect everything. because women are held up high in the clouds and can do no ******* wrong but apparently it's a mans fault for everything he does or what happens in a relationship or during sex. because they have too high sex drives and the men don't do it enough for them. because they can't keep them excited long enough. because they get bored quickly. because they prefer to use men for an ego boost. because because because i can go on and on and on all day EDIT LOOOL DISLIKED COS YOU KNOW ITS TRUE :PPPP WHATS THE BET THATS ALL THESE DISLIKES ARE WOMEN?ü§î", 4551, "HvuHvcQqaa", -3],

That isn't attractive, not just to women, but just in general. However, on the other hand, if a man is calm, charming and confident, with a slight air of indifference about him, that's gonna make him intriguing, because human nature tends to want what it can't have. REMEMBER: Don't try to deliberately attract women. Work on yourself as a man, work hard at your job and take pride in your work; and if you don't have one then get one, have hobbies and goals, dress and groom well, exercise, and constantly strive to educate yourself and improve your social skills and women will naturally be drawn to you as a result, as doing these things breeds confidence.

	29568 : ["It is a very interesting question- As far as the definition of cheating is concerned, it seems pretty no-ish... but if you would feel disrespected, then it would seem like a messed up thing for him to do... But all things being even, he has said he wants to go there; so I would imagine it is the kind of thing he has wanted to do prior to meeting you... or if y'all weren't together. So here is an interesting question posed back to you - I hope you read this answer, b/c I think this question will give you something to think about - if you guys broke up [for unrelated reasons] and got back together some time later... but during the time you guys weren't seeing each other, he went to the strip club, would you still be mad at him?? This question will hopefully help determine why it is you feel the way you feel. For instance, are you only against him going b/c his is your bf? Or do you think every gf Should feel disrespected by the bf going to a strip club?? Are you against it b/c he would have [limited] access to women there?? Or b/c women would have access to Him there? Are you against it b/c you don't think it is dignified job for a lady to have? Or b/c you think your bf going to a strip club would reflect poorly on you for one reason or another? As I said, this is quite interesting to me; hopefully you find a good resolution to this situation soon. If it is any consolation, him going to a strip club one time probably wouldn't be the end of the world... even if you would feel disrespected, maybe there is a way to get something out of it... if you give it your [partial] blessing, he has to do something for you... If you do something like that however, do me a favor, don't hold it over his head that he went to a strip club; if you guys came to an agreement where you OK'd it, he shouldn't have to hear about it all the time, you know? That would be grating... Anyways, like I was saying, good luck w/ all of this.", 4587, "RiMX8eAraa", 1],

He noticed me when I was sixteen, then over a period of some six months, pretended to like me so he could make a fool of me in front of the entire school. It took me a long time to get over that, but it also taught me a very valuable lesson about human nature. Then later when I was in my mid 20's there was this older guy I liked a lot. We went out on a date, and I came home to a message from him telling me straight out that he wasn't feeling it. Yeah, it hurts, but it's a part of life and a part of being human.

You say that he's ready to throw away your years together, but then say you never want him back ever, which feels a little like you aren't as ok with things as you'd like to be. Instead of worrying about when karma will catch up with him and ruin his happiness, focus on your own. Be glad you learned this about him before you got married. Figure out what needs to happen to get him out of your life entirely, then do it. Remove and block him from all your social media and make sure your friends know that you don't care about and don't want to hear about anything regarding him. Don't give any energy or thought to what he is doing, or what the other woman might be after.
