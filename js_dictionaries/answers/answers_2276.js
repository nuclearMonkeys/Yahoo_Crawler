	119594 : ["Middle school and high school were horrible. I went to 4 different elementary schools but at least if kids were mean I was gone by the end of the year anyway. Once I got to middle/high school, I was there for 3 years putting up with the same kids.", 10587, "AA11543960", 4],
	119595 : ["It really depends on the school you went to. I went to two elementary schools and two middles schools cuz i moved twice. I'm in high school now. I loved both my elementary schools. I hated the second middle school cuz it wasnt as free as the first one. We had uniforms and we had to walk in a line whenever we left the class and we all had the same classes with the same people all day like in elementary. Between classes, we had to walk in a line with our class to the next classroom. Locker breaks were only before and after school. We had restroom breaks. It was like elementary all over again. But at the first middle school, it was like high school, we all had our own schedules and we could go to lockers when we wanted(well during any transfer between classes i mean). No uniforms. Of course high school is the best. The most freedom. Of course there's drama but its a small price to pay for freedom. Freedom is way better than just dealing with drama and all that emotional crap. I would rather be able to do what i want and have my heart broken than feel like I'm in jail and have happy relationship with all my friends and bfs :P But really if I would have been able to stay at that first middle school I went to, then I would have nothing to complain about with middle school. That was the best middle school ever. I wouldnt be able to choose, then because I liked elementary and I LOVE high school, too.", 10587, "Spwi9OVsaa", 1],
	119596 : ["Hot girls can be pretty, but hot is more of character and body than pretty is. Gorgeous is the best compliment, as well as beautiful. Then pretty, then hot, then sexy. Never say the last one. Unless u r sure they are ok with it.", 10583, "HiM2c92Raa", 0],

	119598 : ["I agree with Aspen. Both are a very good thing!  I think hot girls have stronger sex appeals than pretty girls may have. A pretty girl doesn't mean that she must be a hot girl and vice versa. But lucky those who have both characteristics.", 10583, "fDSgPUmTaa", 8],

	119600 : ["No I don't find it cute its kind of nasty like when my chunky friend uses a video game controller through multiple games then trades it off. Its like you get it on your hand and when you finally let go off hers its like your hand feels wet, gross and cold. Then I get the feeling of \"she's probably never been many guys\" and at the same time I get the weird feeling that in that girls head shes still twelve. Because most the time attractive women act really stupid and immature so the relationship doesn't last.", 10582, "None", -1],
	119601 : ["Every girl I know confesses to having sweaty palms when holding hands with a guy.  We honestly don't care.  We usually are so happy that you are holding our hand it doesn't matter.

Every base has it's own openings and audition schedules - DO NOT TALK TO A RECRUITER FIRST - check out the site and when an opening comes up, contact them directly and go to an audition - then, if you make it into the band, you'll receive a form to take to your local recruiter to sign up.   Local recruiters can't help you much to be in the band, in fact, many don't know much about it at all.  You don't need a degree, just lots of talent and a great audition!
