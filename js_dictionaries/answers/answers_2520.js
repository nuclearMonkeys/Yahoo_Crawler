Adult homosexuals who engage in consenting sex hurt no-one.  P.S. That same Bible condemns women who speak in church or cut their hair short (Corinthians). It says a man who discovers that his wife is not a virgin should stone her to death (Deuteronomy). It says people who work on the Sabbath need to be stoned to death (Numbers).  Why aren't God's children busy doing his will when these things are far more common than homosexuality? Because the hypocrites need someone to hate, and because the reality of following the religion properly is despicable.

Pedophilia IS a disease. One that people are born with. I feel pity for both the children, and the ones who are afflicted with the disease. I encourage people with this affliction to seek help. I also encourage the state to incarcerate anyone with this affliction who succumbs to it. This person has said something similar to my statement above. While he believes homosexuality is a sin, he leaves it to God to sort out. That's good and proper according to his beliefs. As long as he treats the homosexual community with the same respect he treats others in his personal interactions, that's all we can really ask. Remember people, this man is entitled to his beliefs. We are not required to believe the same thing, but we should respect his right to believe as he does. We should respect his right to speak his mind, even when we don't agree with what he has to say.

I am almost sure that it wasn't all because of his politics. Whites were pretty much evenly split in a lot of the states. So, although I don't know how many of them were racists it is a sure bet that if more than 90% of the white population voted for a white person in most of the states, like the blacks did for Obama, than the whites would sure as s**t been called racists. The way I understand it, there are a lot of Obama supporters that are calling whites racists if they didn't vote for Obama and the blacks that didn't vote for him are traitors. So in the eyes of a lot of Obama supporters, you become a label, not a citizen with the right to vote for someone other than Obama. As for the number of white Presidents compared to black?
