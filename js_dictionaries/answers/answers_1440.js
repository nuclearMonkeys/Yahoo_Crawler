And being a geek is only as bad as u make it out to be. would u rather hang with people that dont relate to u at all and are mean, or hang with friends that u can be urself around? its nice to be at the top...but u gotta do what makes u happy", 8898, "MG40X5v4aa", 0],

If they say no and the reason is because it's dangerous, they should learn some more facts that a lot more people die from fishing, football, bicycles, etc. Most guys in the Boxing section are just some Boxing fans and I see more practitioners in the martial arts section although there's a lot of wannabes and some martial arts fans there as well.

	77660 : ["thats great! :) i wanna be  boxer too. I always slap box my brother and boyfriend :P since your 13 it might be hard to find boxing classes. you would have to do some researching on finding a Trainer. Boxers have to be moving all the time so lots of cardio. like running and jump roping for long periods of time. Lots of upper body work outs too. You have to have some power behind your punch so push ups, pull ups, and weights are good way to get a strong upper body. Buying gloves and a punching bag will be helpful for Getting the feel of ffightingwith gloves and punching something. Eating healthy too. I figure being a girl you dont wanna be bulky so you might wanna stay light. The less you weigh the easier it is to move around. I hope this helps :) & good luck!!", 8897, "LtBKqM5baa", 0],

	77666 : ["The hate for the xbox one is over the top especially the console itself. I can get people being angry by what some of the top executives have said but the console does not look bad and some of the fear over the kinnect is nonsense, and beyond paranoid.  for example it can be disconnected from the xbox and you don't need to use it at all. I have got to admit I was angry by the used game thing at first but then I thought it wasn't fair on the game industry for places like gamestop to get all the money from reused games. I bet the fee from third parties will be like for every 100 reused games you sell from the same company give 5 dollars or 1 depending on how old the game is, you can play your game on another console if you're signed into your account and you can give your game to a friend on your xbox list for free and they keep it as do you. I am not sure on this last one but up to 7 or 10 members of your family or friends can play a game you put into the cloud so its not all that bad.  I can get the anger but the immaturity of some people amazes me. Just get the ps4 or xbox one and enjoy, No need to fight. ps you aren't paying extra the companys like gamestop are and if you're getting a ps4 why do you care?", 8901, "bQfN9dcRaa", 0],
