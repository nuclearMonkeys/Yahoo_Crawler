	90100 : ["You're right...not all rescue organizations are the \"full meal deal\" rescue (with temperament/training evals etc), but the heart of the rescuer worker most often comes from a very loving place.  Some are very good rescues...and sometimes you see the evening news with the humane society busting some poor ol' confused couple that are overrun with 30 dogs, and 30 cats and the conditions are so filthy it makes your skin craw.  I would guess that initially they started out with the belief that they would do their part to rescue pets to thwart euthanasia...and it got out of whack (rescue is hard work if done correctly).  You sound like a \"do your homework\" kind of woman...which is excellent.  I'm with you... sometimes a REVERSE interview is a good thing.  As in \"You now know about me (post the adoption paper process)...now what about you...and who are the people who have been handling and assessing the rescue dogs?\".   So... based on your comments..and the fact that you're aware of standard rescue organizations like petfinder, and other shelters -  I'm going to toss out a couple things since you're not looking for a specific breed per se.  If you are hoping to get a dog with specific characteristics (that will be a good fit for your lifestyle) then a breed specific rescue shouldn't be ruled out.  Certain breeds tend to be quiet lap friends - certain breeds would rather be out hiking/camping with you.  One nice thing about dogs that have been in foster care is that the foster family often has a good idea of how the dog is wired.  Seriously, a rescue dog that's been living indoors as opposed to a rescue that 's been abandoned in a back yard with no skills whatsoever are two very different dogs to work with.  A lot of this depends on what you and your husband are willing to tackle.  They all need love and homes.  Do you mean BYB or Puppy Mill... ?  I see a lot of interchanging of those two terms in here...and trust me...they are two very different things (although some people might tell you different).  Also, if you can walk the pound cages (which just rips my heart out) sometimes the family who has turned the dog in (for what ever reason) has left the dogs full history with the staff.    So -  *If you have a good relationship with your veterinarian mention your dog search to him/her and their staff.  They are at the hub of animal care (most with feelers constantly out) and could know of a client who needs to rehome a good dog for various reasons.   *If you have a decent sized circle of friends / coworkers toss out your \"we're starting to look for another dog\".   Again, word travels fast and if there are any \"rescue warriors\" in the area they pick up these comments like radar...lol   *Watch the paper for ads.  We have military here, and some times they get relocated and are facing the harsh realization that they cannot bring the family dog.  They are devastated and launch into \"rehoming\" mode fast for a good and loyal pet.  I run a private rescue from my home, but I do a lot of \"pet trafficking\" for lack of a better term...lol  My feelers are ALWAYS OUT...and my radar is ALWAYS UP. When I feel the most successful is when I can intercept a dog before it has been dumped into a shelter sparing it that trauma and confusion. I don't take on any and all dogs.  I take on what I can handle.  I am not unique in any way... most people who rescue are always \"on the prowl\" for an ♥interception♥.     Good Luck!

	90104 : ["I consider it a veggie because when I cook, I combine it with other veggies. I know that I am wrong. I agree with others that posted regarding the issues of the seeds causing it to belong to the fruit family. I think that I once read (or heard) that tomatoes are part of the berry family, not because of the taste or looks, but because they come from a vine or shrub, as opposed to how the majority of other fruits come from trees. It was something along those lines that made it part of the fruit/ berry family. Anyway, I think many people refer to tomatoes as veggies and consider them to be so. It does have to do with the fact that they aren't sweet like most other fruits are. I'd also like you to know that there is also a veggie that is sometimes thought of as a fruit, called rhubarb. It grows like and resembles celery, but the stalks are pink to deep red instead of green. Since many people may buy it already chopped and frozen, and aren't aware how it looks whole, and they take it to be fruit. When rhubarb is cooked or baked and prepared properly, it's taste becomes sweet. Rhubarb is used in many dessert recipes, like for making pies, etc. and yet it is a vegetable!

The 1982 went 230,000 miles before I sold it and did very well with the new owner until they wrecked it. At 1800,000 miles I replaced the transmission with a Chrysler re-manufactured and had no trouble with it up until I sold the van. I can't tell you about the minivans after 2006 because that is when I retired but I believe the next one will be a Chrysler/Dodge as well.", 9353, "b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa", -1],

While there have been a lot of problems in the past with transmissions, I think they have fixed that.  If you do buy one, I would advise getting an extended warranty though.  Chrysler generally calls them \"Gold Plans.\"  There are so many gadgets on those, you don't want to run into a lot of problems if you keep it for a long time. Another choice, which I think is an excellent vehicle, is the Ford Flex.  Great for families, loads of interior space, and a more modern type of vehicle.  A good one year old Flex is a good deal, because you're not paying the first years depreciation.

I felt I was a bad mummy because I couldn't keep up with all the housework as well as looking after baby and the rest of the family, so the house was neglected and the mess overwhelmed me.  Talking to someone helped me to get things into perspective and helped me to stop thinking badly of myself because of the chaos and mess. It helped me to know when to take it easy and ignore the house and not to condemn myself because of that. If this girly has a supportive husband, that will help immensely. Family and close friends who can come in and just talk or do the dishes or bring a meal round, anything that will take the pressure off, would help as well. I have had help from a professional counselor which I have found very effective. I was offered tablets but didn't feel I could take them because I was still breast feeding and didn't want the tablets to affect baby. There could be many reasons why your friend is feeling so low. Being a new mom can be overwhelming. Sometimes when you look at your new precious little bundle you worry that you are not good enough to do the job properly. Lack of sleep doesn't help either. That can be a big contributing factor.  Your friend needs to eat well and not worry about losing weight yet. Plenty of fresh fruit and veges and this is where friends and family could help. When I felt very low the last thing I wanted to do was cook a wholesome meal. It may be useful if someone could go in and prepare the veges or make a salad or something like that. Your friend needs to try and catch up on lost sleep when baby sleeps during the day  or at least she needs to put her feet up and have a rest during those times. Getting out and about, taking baby for a walk or popping round to see friends can be helpful as well. Just getting out of the house and being somewhere different can recharge the batteries. I was having trouble keeping up with the washing up amongst many things so hubby and I bought a cheap second hand dishwasher from eBay and that sorted that one out. Labour saving devices are brilliant.  If your friend gets the support she requires she may not need tablets. In some cases however they can be useful if taken for a short time.  I found that talking through my anxieties and fears worked for me and even though I still have a few bad days each month I know I can get through and there will be sunshine on the other side.  I wish I could give your friend a hug and tell her it will all be alright. Maybe you could do it for me. And don't worry about when you have baby, everybody gets the baby blues for a few days after the birth. That passes pretty quickly. Just make sure you get plenty of rest and don't do too much too soon. I am excited for you. Make sure you post on here to let us know how the birth goes.  Best wishes to both of you.", 9348, "tKwtiA5baa", 0],
