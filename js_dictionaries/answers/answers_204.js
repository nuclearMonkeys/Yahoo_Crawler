	10209 : ["As vague concepts, they are fine.  The devil is in the detail. How do you prove who you are?  Unlike most countries, we do not have mandatory ID in this country.  And many voter ID laws are very selective as to what forms of government issued IDs are acceptable.  And most election judges are not trained to catch professional fake IDs.  Sending in a photocopy of an ID with a mail-in ballot does not prove that you are the person on that ID.   The right to vote where you are voting?  Well that is a circular position.  In some countries, you can vote in any voting place in the country and they will get your ballot to the right place.  If you have the right to vote, why should you have to go to three different polling places because the election authority can't figure out where you are supposed to be voting.  The key is getting the voter the right ballot not the physical place where they vote. And as to only voting once, that is a duh?  Every state has that basic rule.  You only get one valid vote. And there is no record in any recent election of anybody voting twice.  Some states do hold an absentee ballot to see if the person votes in person, but, in that case, only the in-person vote counts.  ", 1658, "e6V3xf8zaa", 0],
	10210 : ["That sounds like Jim Crow racism to me, son. Shame on you! People should be allowed to vote for their favorite candidate as many times as Democrats and the Press will allow them to get away with and without the need for your fascist photo i.d.'s and 'legitimacy.' How else will our Democratic idols know how much they are loved and appreciated? One vote per person isn't nearly enough. You are what is wrong with America. If everyone thought like you, Democracy as we know it would collapse forever. Actual Republicans might get elected. Is that what you want?", 1658, "fp8i8udTaa", -1],

	10214 : ["The issue is not when it was written.  It is when it was admitted to probate. Until your grandfather died, he had the legal right to change his will.  As such, no will is really official until after a person dies and his will is admitted to probate.   When the will is presented, the probate court will review the will and decide if it is facially valid (i.e. is properly executed and witnessed).  At that point, it is tentatively admitted to probate and the time starts for filing a will contest.  While the exact time frame differs from state to state, a will contest must be filed before the time expires.   You will need to consult with a probate lawyer in the state in which your grandfather lived to see if it is still possible to challenge the will.  From what you are saying, I am doubtful that you are still within the time frame, but, if your grandfather just died, you would be within the time.  However, there are some specific requirements for a will contest, and your question does not include sufficient details to determine if you have a valid basis for challenging the will.", 1661, "e6V3xf8zaa", 1],

	10216 : ["I was the Canadian equivalent.  It is not really a dangerous job at all.  There is an exchange with the Canadian Forces, so when he hits the CTR2 level, he can apply for that, which is pretty cool.  While they do go to sea, there are also many land postings around the world.  I don't know how long they go to sea for though.", 1647, "msNXomjTaa", 0],
	10217 : ["Not that dangerous at all. Yes he can be on a ship or a sub but that is safer than his driving to work every day. The number of people that get injured and killed in the military is minimum in today's world. He might actually never deploy at all depending on what he gets assigned to. If he is assigned to a ship they can be gone 25-80% of the year, every year varies.  The ship can be out for a few days, a week, a few weeks, a month, a few months or over 7 months. If he is stationed at a shore command his hours may not be Monday to Friday 7:30 am to 4 pm, they can be anything. He could also get unaccompanied orders to an overseas location for 12-18 months.

In their eyes, this is the calculation.  Woah its going to become easy for people to vote, the lazy bums who do not cherish waiting on long lines or the too busy low waged workers who cannot afford to take time from work will vote easily now, raise the alarm !  So voting by mail expansion becomes a major threat that that must be taken down.  Trust me, it it was going to help them, they would love it.", 1680, "7BT7XYeuaa", 1],
	10235 : ["There's nothing inherently wrong with that; although if states can allow people to go to liquor stores, casinos and acupuncture salons, then how dangerous is a one-time trip to the polls (assuming masks and social distancing)?  In any case, my main objection is that in some cases it was implemented by election officials and not by the state legislatures.  There was ample time for state legislatures to amend their election laws before the election, and in fact, many state legislatures did just that.", 1680, "HQH1Rlaqaa", -2],
