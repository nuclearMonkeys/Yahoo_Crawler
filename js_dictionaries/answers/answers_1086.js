My answer is based upon the assumption that the only thing the martyr died for was their faith in a nonexistant deity.

Just like Christianity has certain hypocritical elements especially if taken out of context, so to does Islam. But islam itself is no more going to dominate the world than you or I are. They do not have even 1 central authority, they kill each other even more aggressively than they do Christians, Jews, Hindus and Buddhists.  In fact the only thing most Muslims seem to agree on is that the Amadiyya Muslims are the worst people on the planet! The violence we see now is important for two reasons, one real, one only a media illusion. The media illusion is that we aresaturated daily with the violence from relatively remote parts of the world and it in no way represents how 90%+ of how muslims actually live. The more fundamental truth is that Islam, like all oraganized religions is becoming marginalized in our increasingly secular world.  The old men who run these faiths are aware and afraid of losing their power, so they fight back as best they can with what they have, which is almost nothing. They have no real armies, so they send out waves of despondent young men to their futile deaths.  In another generation or so, secular Muslims will take over the Islamic world and will only be interested in profit, not religion. just like the other power brokers in the world.

And yes, Seventh-day Adventists restrain from work on Sabbath, using that day for studying the word of God, getting closer to Him, their families and friends. I think Baptists of the Seventh Day also observe the Sabbath – I apologize if this is not the right name of your denomination. Also, I hope there are many, many people who do not fall into denominations and do not go to church, but have realized the truth about this matter by reading their bibles. Blessed they all be and all those who continue to search.  There is not a single verse in the bible which can confirm that Sunday substituted Sabbath. Romans, who were pagans and worshiped many gods, considered 6th day as the most important day, as it was the day of Sun (Lucifer uses this name to hide himself – observe: Lux in the Latin means the light – in this case false). When Constantine accepted Christianity, he compromised a lot, not having accepted all the truth from Bible and not being true Christian at all. At first, people observed both Sunday and Sabbath (that's the origin of the weekend), without understanding the meaning of Sabbath and breaking God's law, because, you will remember, God said that we shall WORK on six days and observe the seventh. Later, Sunday seemed to be more important, cause, to Romans god of Sun was more important that than the true God, Jesus Christ. When the Christianity started to spread to other countries, Sunday had been already established as the day of worshipping and the truth about Sabbath was less and less visible. But it never died. It was burning in the hearts of men who wanted to be loyal to God 100%.  Thanks for asking this question and read bible for more info. P.S.  As I was typing this answer, my pc restarted all of sudden without any (visible) cause. I am sorry, but the truth will be revealed. another P.S.
