Year 7 was my first year in high school, i'm not going to lie, I was extremely nervous. At my school our new class settled in my finding a new friend, they'll probably do something to that effect with you guys too. I found my friend Kristen, we're still friends now. Everywhere you go there's going to be a few troublemakers. I'm not the coolest of kids, sure, there were a few names thrown at me. I mean, nothing I couldn't deal with. But that's me, the overweight Harry Potter nerd. You seem nice, you'll be okay. At my school there were a few groups, like the goth kids who hung out near the canteen, the pretty (often nasty) girls who would sit together with their noses in the air, sometimes fighting amongst themselves about boys and whatnot, the sporty boys, and there were a lot of people who were just in between. The food is better in high school, there's healthier options like salad and things like that. More of a variety, really. I don't know about the clothing brands, as we wore a uniform. But people kind of tried to make the uniform \"stylish\", the quotation marks are for those who pull their skirt up so high under their blouse, so their skirt looks more like a belt.  Nobody was having sex, no way. Even some of the boys weren't quite out of that 'ew, girls' stage. Don't be influenced by peer pressure, have a good time in high school.", 10587, "None", -2],
	119744 : ["it shouldn't matter what clothes the ppl wear or how the ppl act to who they pick on.  The best advice is to just be yourself.  If you aren't true to yourself through high school you wont know who you are in college and it will be a constant struggle through those for years. High school isn't all its cracked up to be.  Whether you are the most popular or the nerd you will have drama and trouble to deal with. So its best to be who you are and have friends that are like you so that when you need a shoulder to cry on, you will have a true friend, not someone who will stab you in the back a month later. as for sex.  SERIOUSLY!!! i'm a senior in high school and i have seen soooo many of my friends getting pregnant and dropping out and being a single mom.  So many of their dreams have been shattered because they were too stupid to not be themselves and not do what everyone else is doing. and too stupid to have protection.  I wouldn't recommend having sex and if u think u want to get on the pill and talk to ur mom. b/c i don't think she would approve and if she did i do think u would need a person who has experience to talk to after. seriously... high school will eb a let down. yes you will have some amazing memories but looking back on it it wont be everything you always thought it would be.", 10587, "XcSaKzjSaa", 1],

It  really helps me wind down. I think you think of worse case scenarios because it's easier for you, you think , that if the worst case doesnt happen....anything is better than that~so you try to prepare yourself for the worst in every situation.

	119752 : ["Well…if you think yourself as well read, studied, balanced, and more than anything as impartial personal, you have to have that quality of appreciating qualities in others, eventually in a friend or with an enemy. For example, there was a guy in my class and due to some misunderstanding we became sworn enemy for a considerable period. Friends in my group had decided to boycott all the functions which might see his attendance. But since school days, I was well aware of many qualities in his person and one of them was his helping nature even under odd circumstances. So, when two of my good friends caught in car accident (while they were touring to Goa with others….) and were trapped in Ghat section and their car was jammed in a gorge.  When some local men rushed to help the travelers, a very bleeding friend gave one of the helpers, the telephone number of that “friend-turned-enemy” fellow. Mine too, but later. It indicates that even in half-alive half-conscious stage the injured fellow was well aware of the “quality” in enemy as far as question of extending help was concerned. Rest went in smooth manner, as the “enemy” immediately came to my home and we both ran with other car to accident spot and it was he who handled all that required under the circumstances. We were no more enemies thereafter.", 10589, "d5dd88de76ba8c68ff4eca092fd812edaa", 1],

	119763 : ["Here is how my experience has went so far: Clothing Brands=It seems to me that more people wear what they want instead of trying to by the cool brands, also I noticed that not as many people find wearing the name of a brand on their shirt cool. Kids get picked on=Anyone can, but at my school the kids who smell bad get picked on pretty bad, but hey, they should take a shower once in a while LOL, but remember it isn't nice to pick on kids, don't just do it cause other people are.  Just be yourself, I promise it is the best for you! Food=Depends on your school, but mine is the same because the Junior High and High School for my district share the same cafeteria, but I noticed that the other nicer schools in my area have way more variety than my school which just serves the basic meal and a chocolate milk box, it's boring. Social Scene=For me, my cheer competitions, what ever season it is I Like to go watch the sports teams for my school, the maLL, movies, a friends house, the occasional party, I'm not a big party goer though, because there is usually beer and I don't want to get into trouble, so stay away from those parties, u can get arrested for just being there. Sex=The only way to put it really is that some people are a virgin and some are not.  I would definitely say that more people have sex in high school and there is more pressure for it, but don't get dragged into doing something your not ready for, I'm a virgin and nobody could care less, respect yourself and people respect you, it's not like they will go around making fun of u for being a virgin. Dating=Pretty much the same as Junior High, but you will probably see more serious relationships, and there are more things to do and places to go, depending on what your parents let you do. I was scared for my 1st day, and the whole day kinda goes like a blur, but u get used to it in Like 2 weeks, then it seems like u have been there forever, but my experience has been pretty good so far, I'm just trying to make the best of it=]", 10587, "None", 1],
