In such a climate, it's not surprising that there's a lot of rhetoric about meat eating and vegetarianism, but this only makes it harder to discern the facts from the BS. Yes, we've heard it all - from claims about meat being essential for bodybuilding, to those about meat eating being unnatural to humans, and there's little truth to any of them. So, we decided to take a closer look at one claim that we've frequently heard - that meat eating encourages aggression and violence.", 6562, "i0LFm5yzaa", 0],

	46028 : ["You actually noted the true problem... you ARE addicted to a fast food diet. Your body has been thoroughly conditioned to survive on fast food and therefore it CRAVES it. And, THAT is the truth. Planning your shopping and meals is the key to combat the addiction so you can literally go through the withdrawal process. My sister had a battle with a sugar addiction, so I know food addictions do truly exist.  It is true that a change in foods takes determination and will power. You need to retrain your mind and body with better food choices and consumption. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, wholegrains, lean meats and fish are nutritious foods. It is not about \"going on a diet\", it's about CHANGING your diet. These foods do not leave you hungry as they are rich in fiber. Once the battle your body is having with your mind (withdrawals) is over, fastfood will bea thing of the past. I very rarely eat fast food, but when I do, my body is not happy and I seem to get hungry again soon enough, almost like I have not had enough to eat or the opposite, I am bogged down and the enexgy is zapped out of me. Eating real unprocessed snacks and food will not leave you hungry and it is so much better for your digestive system, your weight/ heart health, blood pressure, chlorestral and energy levels.
