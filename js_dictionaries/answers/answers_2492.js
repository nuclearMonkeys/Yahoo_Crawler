It wasn't meant to have an ending.  It was meant to go on, with the words and works of Christ and his apostles continuing forever as new ones replaced old ones who passed, just as they replaced Judas and so on in the New Testament times. Even John in Revelations was told to \"strengthen those things that remain that are ready to die\" speaking unto one of the churches - the church was dying due to persecution and death as their numbers dwindled (Revelations 3:2) The Mormons, or Latter Day Saints, or LDS, as they prefer to be called, believe: Christ Lives!   That his words and works continue!  That his church has been restored prior to the second coming of the Messiah, and he has again called apostles, prophets, and commanded temples to be built just as they were in times of old!   The Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ, contains the covenants of the Lord, including how specifically to baptize, which isn't explained in the bible, there aren't any instructions!  It also contains the sacrament, or communion prayers that have been long lost, as well as explanations of faith and repentance....

Do these titles as used in Matthew 28:19 mean that there are three separate and distinct persons in the Godhead? No, they refer to three offices, roles, or relationship to humanity.  Does the Bible use the word three in reference to God? Only one verse in the entire Bible does so: I John 5:7. It speaks of the Father, the Word (instead of Son), and the Holy Ghost, and it concludes by saying, \"These three are one.\"  Does the Bible use the word one in reference to God? Yes, many times. For example, see Zechariah 14:9; Malachi 2:10; Matthew 23:9; Mark 12:29, 32; John 8:41; 10:30; Romans 3:30; I Corinthians 8:4; Galatians 3:20; I Timothy 2:5; James 2:19.

	130443 : ["There is no requirement in Scripture to believe that the one God is \"three coequal, coeternal, consubstantional persons\" in order to be saved. That Jesus is divine is evident from verses like Colossians 2:19 (\"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\"), 1 Timothy 3:16 (\"God was manifest in the flesh\"), and Revelation 1:8, 11 and 22:13 with Isaiah 44:6 (Jesus said, \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty\" and \"I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last\"; Jehovah said, \"I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.\") The problem with most teaching on the deity of Jesus Christ is that people interpret it through the \"lens\" of Trinitarianism. All of these Scriptures prove the deity of Christ; however, none of them prove the trinity. Unlike man, God is everywhere-present, all-knowing, and all-powerful; hence, He is able to maintain a divine existence and a distinct human existence and yet still remain indivisibly and absolutely One (Deuteronomy 4:6). \"With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible\" (Matthew 19:26). To sum it up, God the Father is the only true God (John 17:1, 3), and Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God the Father, the only true God, manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16). To further expound on this point, the Holy Spirit is not another \"person\" in an alleged \"trinity,\" but rather is the Spirit of God the Father, the only true God (Matthew 10:20). The Spirit of God is no more a distinct \"person\" than is the spirit of man.", 11070, "6Yd3fd8Taa", 0],
	130444 : ["Bible clearly teaches the doctrine of the oneness of God and the absolute deity of Jesus Christ. The early Christians believed this great truth, and many people have adhered to it throughout history. Although in the course of history trinitarianism became the predominant doctrine in Christendom, the Scriptures do not teach it. In fact, the Bible nowhere mentions or alludes to the word trinity, the phrase \"three persons in one substance,\" or the phrase \"three persons in one God.\" Trinitarianism contradicts and detracts from important biblical teachings. It detracts from the Bible's emphasis on God's absolute oneness, and it detracts from Jesus Christ's full deity. Trinitarian doctrine as it exists today did not develop fully and the majority of Christendom did not accept it fully until the fourth century after Christ. God the Father did not so love the world that He sent another person \"God the Son,\" to die and reconcile the world to the Father. On the contrary, it teaches that God the Father so loved the world that He robed Himself in flesh and gave of Himself as the Son of God to reconcile the world to Himself (II Corinthians 5:19). The one Jehovah God of the Old Testament, the great Creator of the universe, humbled Himself in the form of man so that man could see Him, understand Him, and communicate with Him. He made a body for Himself, called the Son of God.  God Himself provided a means of redemption for mankind: \"He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him\" (Isaiah 59:16). His own arm provided salvation. A proper understanding of the Son, therefore, has the effect of magnifying and glorifying the Father. In His role as the Son, Jesus prayed to the Father, \"I have glorified thee on the earth… I have manifested thy name… I have declared unto them thy name\" (John 17:4, 6, 26). The Father has both revealed Himself to the world and reconciled the world to Himself through the Son. The one God is Father of all, is holy, and is a Spirit. Therefore, the titles Father and Holy Spirit describe the same being. To put it another way, the one God can and does fill simultaneously the two roles of Father and Holy Spirit. The Scriptures bear this out. 1. God the Father raised Jesus from the dead (Acts 2:24; Ephesians 1:17-20), yet the Spirit raised Jesus from the dead (Romans 8:11).  2. God the Father quickens (gives life to) the dead (Romans 4:17; I Timothy 6:13), yet the Spirit will do so (Romans 8:11).  3. The Spirit adopts us, which means He is our Father (Romans 8:15-16).  4. The Holy Spirit fills the life of a Christian (John 14:17; Acts 4:31), yet the Spirit of the Father fills hearts (Ephesians 3:14-16). It is the Father who lives in us (John 14:23).  5. The Holy Ghost is our Comforter (John 14:26, Greek parakletos), yet God the Father is the God of all comfort (paraklesis) who comforts (parakaleo) us in all our tribulation (II Corinthians 1:3-4).  6. The Spirit sanctifies us (I Peter 1:2), yet the Father sanctifies us (Jude 1). Blessings! Manuel, Oneness Pentecostal", 11070, "None", 10],

	130455 : ["\"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.\" (I John 5:7) Although this verse of Scripture is often used by those who believe in three persons of God, it actually refutes this view, for it says that \"these three are one.\" Some interpret this phrase to mean one in unity as a man and wife are one. But it should be pointed out that this view is essentially polytheistic. If the word one referred to unity instead of a numerical designation, then the Godhead can be viewed as many gods in a united council or government. If unity were meant, the verse should have read, \"These three agree as one.\" It is also interesting to note that this verse does not use the word Son, but Word. If Son were the special name of a separate person in the Godhead, and if this verse were trying to teach separate persons, why did it use Word instead of Son? Son does not refer primarily to deity, but Word does. The Word is not a separate person from the Father any more than a man and his word are separate persons. Rather, the Word is the thought or plan in the mind of God and also the expression of God. In a similar way, the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit is not a separate person from the Father any more than a man and his spirit are separate persons. Holy Spirit just describes what God is. First John 5:7 says that three bear record in heaven; that is, God has recorded Himself in three modes of activity or has revealed Himself in three ways. He has at least three heavenly roles: Father, Word (not Son), and Holy Ghost. Furthermore, these three roles describe one God: \"these three are ONE.\"  Elmo, Oneness Pentecostal", 11070, "BgoVUAE8aa", 3],

	130468 : ["All cults deny the Trinity.  Christians claim it is true.  But, what is it?  Is it an office held by three gods (Mormonism) or a pagan concept borrowed from ancient cults (as the Jehovah's Witnesses teach)?  The Oneness Pentecostal believers teach that God is not a Trinity but is really one person who takes three forms.  So, which of these is true?  None. The Trinity is the doctrine that there is only one God in all creation, all time, and all places.  This one God exists as three persons:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  Each person is not the same person as the other, yet there are not three gods, but one. The Bible has many references to a plurality concerning the nature of God's existence.  Consider the following verses as an example:  Gen. 19:24, \"Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\" Notice that the Lord rained FROM the Lord out of heaven.  Amos 4:10-11 says, \"I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me, declares the Lord [YHWH]. 11I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me, declares the Lord.\" Notice here that the Lord is talking and says, \"I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.\" Sometimes when I show these verses to Jehovah's Witnesses (without saying anything else), they often respond with, \"Are you trying to show me the Trinity?\"  I then say, \"You got the Trinity out of that?  Wow!\" In the New Testament there are several verses that show God's plurality.  Here are two of those verses.  Matt. 28:19, \"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,\". Note that there is one name and three persons.   Also, 2 Cor. 13:14, \"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.\" These kinds of verses, and others are part of the means by which the doctrine of the Trinity is derived. When we \"theologians\" use the word \"person,\" we are not saying that God is three individual beings walking around who are actually one being.  That would be a contradiction.  Instead, we define a person as having self awareness, identity, can speak, love, grieve, etc.  These are attributes of personhood and we see all of these attributes, and more, in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Trinity is a very important doctrine within Christianity.  It is the correct view of the Godhead and needs to be affirmed by Christians.  Of course, the cults deny the Trinity, often misrepresent it as teaching three gods, or that it is an office, etc.  But the truth is that the Trinity doctrine is derived from Scripture and is unique to Christianity. Finally, the Trinity is important because only in the doctrine of the Trinity can we have the true incarnation of God (the Word become flesh as the Son - John 1:1,14).  Only the God-man Jesus can offer a sacrifice sufficient to appease the infinite Father in heaven.  No mere man can do this.  No mere angel.  Instead, God the Word, in His grace, added to Himself human nature (Phil. 2:5-8) in order to bear our sins in His body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24) so that He might become sin on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21).  This way, He atoned for our sins by the shedding of His blood (Heb. 9:22) and guaranteed that all who trust in Him will receive everlasting life (John 3:16).  Because of what Jesus did on the cross, we might then have eternal life that is received by grace through faith (Eph. 2:8).  Amen to that!", 11070, "None", -5],
