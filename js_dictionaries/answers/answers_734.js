	40943 : ["Luck=Moloch=demon.Gov't is killing you with highfrequencyelectricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbringsthemupalevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put thesewreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism/COVIDrestrictions will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.

I guess he's seen too much television and he thinks something like that can be faked--which it certainly could, if you have the time and ambition. He doesn't seem to get that I posted it almost immediately after he posted his answer--furthermore he doesn't get that regardless of whether you believe it's real, he was caught in a lie about what is full-time as far as teaching goes. Does he seriously think that I invented the concept of a \"weighted teaching unit\" and chose just the right values to prove him wrong? The guy is a lunatic. You'll notice that he has never--not once--provided any evidence that shows I don't teach or that I have multiple accounts. He really doesn't have the faintest idea about building a logical case regarding anything, not global warming and certainly not about me. I apologize for \"answering\" my own question, but the troll says \"He claims he is teaching 3 classes this semester, which is around the equivalent of full-time teaching gig.\"  In fact it isn't. This is a slightly redacted image from my contract as a lecturer.  I am teaching 3 labs, each of which is considered to be 2 \"weighted teaching units\", for a total of 6 WTUs. If you look at the fine print of the image you'll see that 15 WTUs is considered full-time, so this is 40% time. In fact, the labs only take about 2 hours each in (Zoom) class, so that amounts to a total of 6 hours teaching in a regular work week.

It was growing very fast, its TV ratings were climbing faster than the NFL, it was expanding tracks across the country and a new generation of drivers were camera and publicity savvy on race day and through the week. Then NASCAR got greedy, TV time outs in the guise of debris on the tracks when there were none became routine. Other rule changes and marketing gimmicks started coming out one after another and pre-race drama situations were so contrived and obviously phony that millions of life long fans turned their backs. When Winston was forced to drop its sponsorship of the CUP for pure PC reasons, NASCAR started going PC itself. It jumped the shark and has been trying to reinvent itself ever since. ", 5991, "2EddmzfAaa", 1],

	40954 : ["He is one of the greats, but you cannot compare drivers of one era with another. Vehicles, technology, rules and track surface/composition change over the years. What one driver might have done perfectly 20-40-50 years ago may not work today and vice versa.  No one knows how Gordon might have done in the older vehicles that were substantially stock, no power or rack and pinion steering, no cooling fans for drivers and no head rests, polyester tires instead of radials, no radios to the pits or to spotters in the stands, no TV time outs to re-set the pack and allow for commercials, few rules in the pits and for pit stops and until the '60s seat belts and helmets were optional. Drivers were more aggressive and anything that didn't kill another driver was allowed. Hard fighting and drinking was very common after races and on the nights before. And its possible the better drivers of the 50s and 60s wouldn't be able to compete at todays speeds or with technology and spotters that would mitigate their tricks and techniques. So it is impossible and un-fair to compare drivers from one era to another.  Gordons record and driving speaks for itself that he is one of NASCAR's greats...

	40965 : ["I wonder why you would ask this in \"Global Warming\" and not in \"Education & Reference\" So I have to assume you mean in the context of this section. I assume you mean \"denier\", a label commonly used in this section to describe the position of a person or a group of people.  In this context a denier is some one who rejects that human emissions of CO2 leads to earth retaining more of the sun's energy.  (It would be wrong to label some one a denier who accepts that man made global warning is a fact, but wants to leave it to subsequent generations to deal with it.)  Using the term denier means we don't have to write the explanation of their position over and over.  I really don't understand why some one who denies that human emission of CO2 leads to a warming earth, would object. Likewise, as an atheist and thus a denier of all gods, you could be tempted to call me a denier in the context of religion.  The problem with that would be the fact that most religious people, especially monotheists deny the existence of all other gods but their own,  so the term would be inaccurate as religious people would also be labeled denier and thus unfair because they would have to defend themselves from a false label. But if I went to a religious place of worship, where the preacher is teaching that the earth was created 6,000 years ago, I could well be labeled a denier as I deny that the earth was created 6,000 years ago.  It wouldn't make a difference because I am convinced that I am right of and I would proudly accept that label. So it all depends on context and people shouldn't get upset over it. JimZ is either being dishonest, or ignorant by trying to set up a straw man.

Point out that it is like saying that lightning strikes cause forest fires and therefore matches can't. Point out that we have know since the late 1800's that CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  And that burning fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide which is dumped into the atmosphere, which in turn causes the earth to retain more heat. When they start their nonsense about communism, point out that the absence of pollution is not a requirement for communism just like pollution is a requirement for capitalism. If it snows somewhere, ask them how they know and why they accept the source when it tells them it is snowing but not when they report the temperatures. Keep it really simple and put the onus on them to explain their conspiracy theories.  Ask people like Solarwind who predicted cooling due to reduced solar flairs, but since the earth has continued to warm, why his prediction was wrong and why the earth continued to warm. I remember Darwinist pointing out to Maxx that his use of the Vostok ice cores to show that CO2 concentration had fluctuated, couldn't be true if he believed the earth was only 6000 years old.  Max quit a few months later. When Sagebrush makes a claim like \"God has his hand on the thermostat\", point out how silly that argument is from the perspective of a Christians ans that makes his god evil by being responsible for all the heat and cold related deaths. When people ask genuine questions and show they want to learn, that is the time to start explaining things. Start with history how it was discovered that CO2 was a greenhouse gas, how the science builds from previous discoveries and ultimate how science is trying to predict the future based on various levels of CO2 concentrations.  If they say they are skeptics, ask them if they are a fan of myth busters and if so, show the mythbusters episode where they tested CO2 and heat. Personally I am not worried about AGW, Renewables are now cheaper than thermal generation and battery costs are tumbling with high demand expected.  Capitalism will look for the greatest return on investment and that is going to be renewables.  Right now China is leading and the US, with this administration, might be able to catch up.  In the mean time I will buy my batteries and panels from China.", 5974, "erI2oLvjaa", -15],
