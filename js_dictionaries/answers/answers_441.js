A Well Tooled Machine that ambushed Wrestlers, beat them up in the building outside The Building a Great Combination. My personal favorite version of The Horsemen. Second Incarnation: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Lex Luger and The Great James J. Dillon. Tried hard to live up to the legacy of the first incarnation, but were never quite as good. Lex was still learning to wrestle at that point.Third Incarnation: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham and The Great James J. Dillon. 4 Great Wrestlers who excelled as Singles Wrestlers and Tag Team Wrestlers. The Shock of watching Barry Windham become a Heel after all those years as a Baby Face added shock value.Fourth Incarnation: Ric Flair, Ole Anderson, Arn Anderson and Sting. They worked well as a Unit in Both Singles and Tag Team Matches. The most interesting \"What If' would have been if Tully Blanchard had been signed by WCW would we have even seen this incarnation of the Four Horsemen? Probably not.Fifth Incarnation: Ric Flair, Barry Windham, Arn Anderson, Sid Vicious and Managed by Ole Anderson. Sid had the Size and the Look but was simply not a Great Wrestler.Sixth Incarnation: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, and Paul Roma. Paul Roma was a Good Wrestler but was never at The Top of the Card for The WWF or WCW and he had the misfortune to come to The Horsemen after Tully, Barry, Sting, etc.Seventh Incarnation: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Chris Benoit, and Flyin' Brian. Each one of these men were outstanding in the ring, WCW should have tried to hold onto this version. As far as skillset, this had to be the best incarnation since The Fourth Incarnation.Eighth Incarnation: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Chris Benoit, and Steve McMichael. Steve McMichael was still learning and he was no Brian Pillman.Ninth Incarnation: Ric Flair, Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael, and Jeff Jarrett. Just as Steve McMichael was no Brian Pillman, Jeff Jarrett was a Very Good Wrestler, but personality wise he was no Tully Blanchard.Tenth Incarnation: Ric Flair, Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael, and Curt Hennig. Just as Steve McMichael was not Brian Pillman, he wasn't Arn Anderson. However, with Ric, Chris and Curt, I probably would have ranked this combination higher if Curt Hennig hadn't been so quick to betray them to the nWo. Eleventh Incarnation: Ric Flair, Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael, and Dean Malenko. A great combination that could have potentially been ranked a lot higher if they had spent more time together.", 3852, "sqfjfR3iaa", 0],

Yeah, but either way the clean and sober Kurt Angle wasn't the wrestler that left the company nearly ten years earlier.  His best in-ring days are behind him and it showed in his match alongside Shield. I hope he's in a healthier place and stays away before he tarnishes his legacy by sticking around for too long like so many wrestlers before him have.", 3853, "7sa6B6Qhaa", 0],
