	107318 : ["I'm not a vegan. I love cheese and eggs. If you want to become vegan, however, I'd suggest finding a good cookbook to help you transition and then do it gradually. I'm a huge fan of How it All Vegan by Sarah Kramer and Tanya Barnard because the recipes included are relatively quick and easy and the books contain lots of useful information such as substitutions, foods to watch out for and a glossary of terms used in ingredient lists that might contain animal products. Despite what people may tell you, it is entirely possible to be a healthy vegan. You don't need animal products to live well. It's a personal decision, though. Good luck!", 9989, "None", 0],

	107323 : ["The Bible says that Jesus HAS a God who is his Father. (2 Cor. 1:3; Eph 1:3; Col 1:3; Mark 15:34; John 17:1-3; etc.) Also, EVEN IN HEAVEN, Jesus refers to HIS God and the name of HIS God. (Rev. 3:12) Jesus cannot BE God if he is talking about God as a separate person. Nowhere in scripture can it be found that the Father has a God. That is because Jesus himself said that the Father is \"the only true God\". (John 17:1-3)", 9990, "tGfriTyeaa", 2],
	107324 : ["Jesus never said that he was God, people misinterpreted his words. In the bibls, there no verse where he says \" I am the God worship me\"..nor he is the son of the God. God has no wife or son..God is unique and there is nothing like him..if God had a son or wife then what the difference of of being a God and human being?.... Jesus was one of the mightiest messenger of God...He gave life to dead by the permission of God as he says (1) \"…I cast out devils by the Spirit of God….\" [The Bible, Mathew 12:28] (2) \"…I with the finger of God cast out devils….\" [The Bible, Luke 11:20] (3) \"I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgement is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\" [The Bible, John 5:30] God is one and only, he begets not nor he is begotten and there is nothing like him...people if you read the bible carefully, you will find miliions of error and contradictions...and how come a bible has an author if christians believe that Bible is from God..shouldn't God be the Author..", 9990, "6c5RGKCTaa", -2],

By the way, are your words or voice a different person from you? He came here as a human being and so He referred to the Father as God because He proceeded forth from Him. The Bible clearly says that Jesus is God: John 1 :1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. As such He gives life and will raise us up on the last day: John 5:21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. John 6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. 6:44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. .", 9990, "bXEJBxiCaa", 0],
	107338 : ["Some people saying Jesus is God doesn't make it true.  He didn't claim to be God, he worshiped God, his Father.  God, Almighty God, can't \"have\" a God, he is the one and only true God as testified to in the Bible hundreds of times.  ONE true God, the Father of Jesus, his first creation.  That's two, not one, and the second one (Jesus) didn't claim the worship that his Father, Jehovah, alone deserved.", 9990, "PHNEbmnOaa", 1],

	107346 : ["A MUST SEE is the Kelvingrove art gallery museum. It has just been refurbished and is  the most popular place in Glasgow. Also there is the retail sector in Glasgow which has some of the best shop in the UK and the main shopping street, Buchanan Street is ranked as the 7th best shopping street in the WORLD. There is the newly developed Science Centre which has a planetarium, shows and exhibits and a cinema the size of a 5-a-side football pitch. The Science Tower is open and lets you see far and wide all over Glasgow and is the only tower in the world which turns around 360 degrees from the ground. You could take your family to the Glasgow Transport museum where it shows all the ships built on the world famous Clyde River and the old transport  vehicles used in Glasgow at least 50 years ago. If it's a sunny day, you could go to one of the many parks like the kelvingrove park in the west end where there is the calm river Kelvin and human friendly squirrels. It is never hard to get to any of these areas as the city has the only complete underground system in the uk serving 15 stations with one serving near the art gallery and kelvingrove park, it has an airport less than 8 miles from city centre and has many bus routes. The suburban rail is the most extensive system outside London serving 180+ stations just in the city council boundarys alone!!! So Glasgow is a great city for visiting and the weather isn't really as bad as people say. Also not far from Glasgow is the Clyde Valley which within is a world heritage site, - New Lanark - with Perrigran Falcons as local residents. There is also Loch Lomand which is jst 30 minutes from Glasgow where the scenery is nice. I would suggest to stay at the Holiday Inn or find a hotel on the outskirts of Glasgow. Remember to ask anyone in Glasgow if you are lost as we are one of te friendliest places in the world. :D", 9997, "a9fde3dda57d656ed86c4b7b90ef068faa", 1],

God don't need God because he is God (Jehovah is God and don't need God because he is God already himself) So God created Jesus and bunch of Angels, too. So until Adam and Eve were made then they both made incredible messed up later on......... So , Jehovah SENT his Son (Jesus) to replace Adam. (You know the rest) Jehovah can't SENT himself because no one is/are able to see him so he sent his Son.  Just like you showed to us Col 1:15 No one can see God, but Jesus Christ is exactly like him. He ranks higher than everything that has been made. (NCV)  This is (NWT) Col 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation I hope you all understand it.
