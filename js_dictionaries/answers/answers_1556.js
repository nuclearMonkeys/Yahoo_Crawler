If you can find extra $50 you should get Nook Tablet that is Nook Color 2 - is the best and been getting rave pro reviews on the web and it is the best device in it's class - much better than Kindle Fire. It's got Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Angry Brids, etc., the best battery life (30% Better), the best non-glare laminated screen (visibly noticeable difference in side by side tests in video playback and eBooks reading), double the RAM and space for apps/photos/movies, microSD slot (not on Kindle) and a microphone for Skype (not on Kindle), and much zippier performance during video playback and apps usage than choppy/laggy act of Kindle Fire according to many user reviews. Also, it's been reported that many Kindle Fire units have faulty Wi-Fi and people have a lot of issues connecting to internet according to many user reviews. Amazon's own web site has hundreds (more than 1350 now) of reviews of Kindle Fire's new owners that gave it 1 or 2 star reviews because of choppy/laggy experience they got from this underpowered device. Other issues are that it runs hot to touch, video playback is jerky, touch screen is not responsive and it takes 2-3 touches to register, power button placement is very poor and is prone to accidental power off, all the hype of Silk browser is a myth where the browsing is actually slower than on other Android tablets, etc.", 9134, "None", -2],

It does NOT have to be that way. Perhaps if we change how we vote, it will not be necessary to REPLACE any party, but rather, we can have three or more parties stably co-exist. A lot of people don't realize it, but the voting system used throughout the United States is the major reason that the electorate has coalesced into two major parties and that growth and influence of third parties is so severely limited. We use what is called \"plurality voting\", but there are many other systems that are far better for choosing from a list of many candidates to fill one seat. Plurality is one of the worst systems for doing this, if not THE worst. Plurality encourages strategic voting (e.g., voting for the lesser of two evils) and causes the \"spoiler effect\" or vote splitting (Ralph Nader in 2000 and Teddy Roosevelt of the Bull Moose party in 1912 are well-known examples), which causes our electorate to become limited to two parties. Many other voting systems are better because they allow voters to cast a ballot for multiple candidates they like instead of just one; consequently, alternative party candidates cannot act as spoilers and split the vote. This encourages more people to vote their true preference, giving more support and electoral success to an alternative party, which eventually wins more attention from media and a podium at the debates. One of the better alternative voting systems according to those who study them is called range voting. Range voting allows voters to give a score, 0 to 9 for example, to each candidate on the ballot. Here are some websites that describe Range Voting:  and  and You may like the simpler version of range which is Approval voting:", 9131, "U5OP0ooLaa", 0],

By the way, on the Barnes & Noble website, the Nook Tablet has 126 reviews.  On the Amazon site, the Kindle Fire has 3,570 reviews.  I'm not saying that those numbers reflect sales or popularity, but apparently not \"everyone\" who's handled a Kindle Fire has put it down. Just a note.  Neither are true tablets with full features and full access.  In fact, the Android market is limited for each, as both Barnes & Noble and Amazon will have you buy apps from them, and them alone. Both have web access.  Both have access to more books than you or I will ever need.  Both have access to Pandora, Hulu, Youtube, and much of the Web.   The Nook has more onboard memory, though review on the Barnes & Noble website seem to indicate that less than 1g is available for non-B&N content.  A SD card slot allows for expansion. The Kindle Fire has less onboard memory (on paper), but has a large amount of memory in Amazon's Cloud for Amazon content. The Nook Tablet has one advantage of free browsing while you're within the walls of a B&N store.  If you opt for the Amazon Prime membership ($79 per year) you'll have one free book a month from Amazon, plus unlimited access to Amazon's movie & tv library, something that B&N don't have at this point.  Amazon also has a music download site that B&N don't yet have. Both systems have their supporters and both have advantages.  They use different interfaces, offering different personal experiences.
