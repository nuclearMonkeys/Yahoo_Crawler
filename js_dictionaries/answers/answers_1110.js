Since then the war has worsened and al-Qaeda has regrouped and now poses a bigger threat than ever. Obama has always condemned the pointless Iraq distraction and the neglect of the Afghan war, and he has pledged to withdraw combat forces from Iraq and send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in addition to retooling the war strategy. Obama's point in question was that capturing/killing Osama himself, if he is even still alive, will not put an end to al-Qaeda so we need a broader strategy - one more focused than Bush's \"war on terror\" and one to which more attention is given than Bush's Afghanistan disaster.

	60984 : ["I have the same kind of hair. I had it short for a long time and everytime I tried to grow it I would get frustrated with it turning into an afro so I would get it cut short again. The way I finally grew it out was to chemically take out some of the curl.  Don't you an African Amercan chemical straightener use the kind that has the same ingredients as a curly perm for caucasian hair. You can also get a curly perm and instead of using rollers just keep your hair straight (by combing it)  for the recommended amount of time. I won't take out all of the curls but it will make it managable enough to keep letting it grow. If you have the money go and get this done professionally. Once you do this don't use a relaxer for African American hair because it can cause your hair to break off. The longer your hair gets the weight will let your hair hang down and loosen the curl. My hair is halfway down my back. I still sometimes chemically remove some of the curl from my hair about once a year.  Also I recommend using frizz ease straitening shampoon and conditioner.  Then use some leave in conditioner like infusium and then I used a hair smoothing serum an then Lekair gel. Use Cholesteral once a week for deep conditioning.

Don't apply any heat to your air i.e blow drying, flat ironing, etc. Yes, log hair is better but you want to trim at least 1/2 every 6-8 months(2 months) to prevent your hair from splitting to the top. When you dry your hair with a towel, pat it dry instead of rubbing it. Use moisurizing shampoos. I recommend ApHogee Shampoo for damaged hair if you've dyed your hair a lot or recently or apply to heat to your hair a lot. If you just need a good shampoo to being back the shine and sleekness of your hair, try Hairtrition Macadamia Oil Damage Recovery. I know the word damage seems harsh, but your hair isn't damaged. It's just under poor health at the moment and a little nutrients will bring it back up to beauty. P.S. My hair was like that for years. 5th grade - 9th grade. I learned a lot.

	60988 : ["Your lack of knowledge in the traditional arts is huge. The traditional arts do not practice theoretical moves. The techniques practiced in a good traditional Dojo have been proven many times over in life and death situations. Where do you think all the techniques that Krav Maga uses came from? The drills that a traditional class uses are designed to train reflexes. I will agree, that you do need to train with resistance as well as for pure technique, however sparring is just another training tool. It takes all the tools to develop good self defense skills. Sparring once a week is not a sign of a good class. You put entirely way to much importance on sparring. There are many bad classes that spar every class. In fact to much emphasis on sparring is a good indicator of a McDojo. Sparring to soon will only slow your progress. The idea behind sparring is to practice good technique in a more realistic setting. If you spar before you have enough techniques you will only ingrain bad habits. Muay Thai is a sport. As a sport it is trained to a set of rules that have nothing to do with self defense. The instructor you had is obviously an idiot, if he was using a crowbar for anything in class. Kajukenbo is not for everybody. Most students will not make it past the first class, let alone long enough to actually develop useful skills. Kajukenbo classes have a little thing they call \"one shot received\". You stand there in a neutral stance and the instructor hits you any where he decides to. You have 10 seconds to recover. Training full contact has some serious dangers and draw backs. The human body is NOT designed to take that kind of abuse repeatedly. Edit: Just a side note. I have never heard of a permanent fracture. If you do have a bone that is permanently broken in your wrist, you have no business joining any Martial arts class.", 8099, "Lwgi5Wnzaa", 6],
	60989 : ["The term \"traditional martial arts\" is a broad and ill-defined one.  It can mean anything from historical weapons reenactments (more or less) to mass-produced belt factories to classically-preserved unarmed combat systems. The body conditioning you speak of is rare.  It's also unnecessary in many cases.  And actually I've never seen a Muay Thai class that wants one to condition ones body on anything other than modern training equipment (kicking the bag or pads to condition the legs, hitting the belly with pads or medicine balls to condition the abdomen), so I'd say that what you experience was the exception rather than the rule. I'm with you on the notion that one should not injure oneself deliberately in training.  But that's actually not a big part of most \"traditional\" systems. I would suggest you look around and try out classes in your area.  Full-contact sparring is good, but I think you'll find that most full-contact rule sets don't allow groin shots.  Some JKD schools will allow it (most won't) and there's also a Japanese martial art called Kudo that allows groin shots in sparring, but it's rare.  You may just have to accept Muay Thai/kickboxing style rules for your striking training.  Of course, if you get good at kicking the inside of the leg, targeting the groin shouldn't be much of a stretch.", 8099, "nRBC4E5saa", 2],

I must tell you that in Kajukenbo schools, they tone down a bit of the violence when there are visitors so as to not scare off any potential new students. While Kajukenbo is traditional in the sense that they have uniforms, belts, salutations, titles, and forms, Kajukenbo is a bit eccentric for a martial art created by Asians in America. All Kajukenbo schools are different, the training methods vary depending on which Branch it is, and what lineage it follows. What you described seems to be an extremely hard core school. There are hardcore schools, extremely hardcore schools, and not very hardcore schools. Our school is a hardcore school and there are less than 10 regular students. Most people are afraid to try a free class after watching us workout. The ones who are brave enough to sign up last maybe one workout, or a week or two before dropping out. While our school does not have the\"one shot received\", we have other techniques for discouraging a new student from coming back for a second workout. I do not condone these training methods, they are just the training methods I had to go through. In our school, in your first class, you will be asked to allow the entire class to take turns punching and kicking you for real. Then, you will do it back to the us. If you do come back, this will be repeated every class until your body can tolerate going into shock, and be able to recover within a few seconds. And this has to be maintained on a regular basis. This is very unpleasant training, but we have to go through that just to be able to say that we train in Kajukenbo. Unfortunately, in Kajukenbo, you are tested in your first workout, you have to prove to your instructor and the other students that you are a tough guy and that your body can take a beating and you can still continue. And there is worst stuff that Kajukenbo people have to go through besides the sparring. We are not really allowed to be talking about this in a open forum. Let's say that only the most courageous people stay in Kajukenbo. The training is brutal, violent, and dangerous. And it is normal to be banged up on a regular basis. And with an injured wrist, you will be very self-conscious when it is your turn for the other students to be practicing on you. If full contact sparring is the only thing that you are looking for, maybe Kajukenbo is not the best martial arts choice for you. Kajukenbo students are expected to be able to survive the worst beating and still function and be able to take on their opponents.

DRS should be either made compulsory, if ICC believes it has the potential or taken out, to bring out an improved & better version.

	61011 : ["How to Control Frizzy Hair Beautiful hair in the morning, frizzy hair by noon. It's a very common hair problem, and a not so easy one to manage. Sound familiar? Thick, coarse, wavy, and curly hair all have a tendency to frizz, particularly in the summer months when humidity is at it's highest. There's no cure for frizzy hair but here are some remedies to help you control it and calm the fuzz! Frizzy Hair Tips We all know by now that using a conditioner is necessary to control frizzy hair. The trick is to leave the conditioner on for a few minutes before rinsing it out. If you have extra time, try wrapping your hair in a towel with the conditioner on and let your hair soak for about 10-15 minutes. Then rinse it out. When you're done, wrap your hair in a towel for several minutes to get out the access water instead of rubbing the towel over your head. Both towel rubbing and brushes lead to hair breakage and make it much more vulnerable to the frizzies. Try just putting on some mousse and comb it in. Let air dry and don't run your fingers or a comb through it until it's completely dry. Using a blow dryer in hot weather will probably make the problem worse. If you want your hair straight and that's the only way you can get it that way, then by all means, use the dryer. Just use the cool setting and don't use it every day. Many shampoos and conditioners are good. However, not all big-name brands are better, they just carry a larger price tag. It's a good idea to use multiple brands. This helps to avoid build-up that will make your hair appear heavy and dull. Don't wash your hair every day. Your natural oils help tame the frizz. Another way to control frizzy hair is using one of the frizz control remedies that are available in department and drugstores. They are not a shampoo or conditioner but are designed especially for frizzy hair. These serums come in small bottles, but a little goes a long way. Try using one over a thin coat of mousse. As a result, your hair will be more shiny and less frizzy. If you wash your hair in the mornings, you're not going to have time for all of this and you will have to skip leaving it in the towel. Just follow the other steps or consider doing this in the afternoon so that it's dry before you go to bed. A good cut is the best tactic to prevent frizzy hair and you can ask your stylist to use thinning scissors to thin your hair if it is too thick. This should make it much more manageable and tame it down. Thinning scissors are easy to use and available in stores also, but you need to know how to use them. Sometimes just having it done once at a salon is educational. Watch how they use them and follow the lead next time if you can't afford to go there every time. Leave-in conditioners that you can spray on will often help dry and damaged hair. You may need to reapply it later on in the day. What works for one person does not necessarily work for the next because everyone has different lifestyles and climates. It's all trial and error. If, in spite of all your efforts to stop your hair from becoming frizzy, and it's still a mess, always have hair accessories on hand to pull it back for a quick fix. Finally, one last tip. Various hot oil treatments for dry and damaged hair can give you some temporary control to frizzy hair, but you'll probably need to use them weekly or biweekly.", 8096, "RkYhQD3Gaa", 6],
