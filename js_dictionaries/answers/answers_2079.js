The images/pictures is an interesting point to consider though. I suppose technically it COULD be copyright but honestly? No ones going to care the pictures were taken from a site and certainly no police force would spend their time tracing it all down and putting it all together.

This helps you manage your e-mail in several ways: It helps you avoid viewing potentially offensive material.  If you have a dial-up connection, it allows you to decide which images are worth taking the time to download.  It helps reduce the junk mail you get. Junk mail images often include \"Web beacons\" that notify the sender's Web server when you read or preview the message. This validates your e-mail address and often results in more junk mail messages and possible viruses.  When Outlook Express blocks pictures or other content, those items are replaced with a red \"x.\" When you get legitimate messages (for example, a newsletter that you have subscribed to), you can download pictures and other content by clicking the Infobar, which is the banner near the top of the message. When you edit, forward, or reply to a message that references external content, your computer will try to download the content again. The blocked content will be downloaded and included in the reply or forwarded message. When you print a message with content that has not been downloaded automatically, the blocked content is downloaded and will appear in the printed message. **Although it is not recommended, you can automatically download all pictures in Outlook Express by going to the Tools menu, selecting Options, and then clicking the Security tab.
