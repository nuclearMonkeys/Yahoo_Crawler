	21858 : ["Don't worry, all you animal hater/annihilators. Industrial Humans have already made quick work of annihilating the biosphere, and globally killed off 60-80% of all Wild mammals and reptiles, and 80% insect populations beyond extinction. Leaving only human owned livestock, and their pets. All that is going to be left are the most resilient creatures that can adapt to the destruction of most habitat. If you don't like roaches, vector born insects, the bugs that destroy crops, the bacterias and viruses, well, humans killed off all the beneficial ones that kept them at bay. Killed them with their toxic poisons, and destruction of wild places and ecosystems, killed them with their pig headed \"my livestock gets to live, and the wild animals get to die\". Humans annihilated the very life systems that sustain them, that clean the waters, air, and fight the destructive insects and germs. And humans think themselves intelligent creatures? Because they are clever with tools (technology?) Uh, one catch though you might not like, since humans ARE animals, humans don't get to stick around for long without their brothers and sisters, the great community of life, without healthy ecosystems, and the community of life that we ALL depend on, because humans ARE PART of the community of life, and never meant to be separate, better, nor its masters. Native LOVES diversity. Without it, forget it. So, once most wildlife are extinct...humans are not far behind. No bunker is Habitat. Humans ARE animals that depend of Habitat, health habitat. Humans were never meant to be the rulers over which animal, plant, ecosystem lives and who dies on the planet. That was the original Sin, from Genesis. That's the forbidden sin that humans have done. What happens to the rest of the animals and the Earth, so will happen to humans. That's the knowledge that all people on the planet understood, until Agriculture ten thousand years ago began, Called the Great Forgetting.", 3542, "ENZ9zaaDaa", 1],
