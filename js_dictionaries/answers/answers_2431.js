What if a 'God' created Nature, which set evolution in motion? That would not digress from when they say God made everything, because indirectly that would be true. I personally don't believe a God exists, but I am willing to understand that not everybody agrees with me, and also that my own beliefs are not necessarily true, either. Also, it would be obvious that your final argument works both ways, too. Why would we resist the notion of a God that does not exist?

The covenant God made with Moses and the Jews have been carried out to set them different than for the encircling international locations. The rules God gave Moses have been diverse than what the different international locations believed. those Jews had a particular affiliation with their writer. This specific affiliation became between God and the rustic of Israel. yet, as you study the OT you notice the place the Israelites, for the main section, weren't obedient to God. They have been making a mockery of God and his rules. whilst Jesus got here, he additionally talked approximately the Mosaic rules. however the Jews condemned him and finally crucified God's in basic terms begotten son. The nighttime earlier Jesus died, he set up a clean covenant with the Apostles that coated absolutely everyone who could be obedient in spite of in the event that they weren't Israelites.

Some examples of things you can take note of. - The pinky toe on the human foot is dissapearing over generations, we don't need it.  The tail bone humans have, is shrinking, also not needed. The wisdom teeth, present in the back of the mouth, are not needed, and in most cases have to be removed at aulthood because they don't fit in the mouth. Not only is it illogical that a devine god would create humans needing a part of their body removed, but Evolution will explain how early man had signifigantly larger mouths than we do now, needing the extra teeth to chew raw nuts and meat. Humans and apes are the only mammals in the animal kingdom with two nipples, present on the breast. Humans and apes are the only two mammilia, that the male of each species, has nipples. There is a spider, found in Australia; this spider's venom is harmless to all animals, with the exeption of APES, AND HUMANS. Every other creature on earth is immune to its poison.
