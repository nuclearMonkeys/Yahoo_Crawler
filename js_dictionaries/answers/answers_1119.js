Most people would consider Timothy McVeigh a terrorist, though he was an individual not associated with an organized group.   Some other thoughts: Some form of diplomacy is often used in hostage situations, whether they are perpetrated by an organized group of terrorists or an individual. Some people object to negotiating with hostage takers (think pirates) because they believe it perpetuates the problem.  They feel it would be better to allow the hostages to die because it stops people from taking more hostages.  This is the basic idea behind refusing to negotiate with terrorists.  Even engaging with them is seen as encouraging future terrorist acts. It is probably worth trying to separate the tactics used from the demands being made.  Think about the movie \"John Q\", where the guy took hostages in a hospital in order to get healthcare for his child.  It was a just a movie, but it's at least possible to imagine a situation in which the demands being made (my kid needs medical treatment) are reasonable in themselves even though the tactics being used are not.
