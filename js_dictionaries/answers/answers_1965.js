When it was time for her to poop on the potty she didn't want to.  My sil got a big bowl of wrapped prizes, put it in the bathroom.  She..my sil went to go....her daugher followed.  she pooped(sil) and said oooh look at that, what is that mommy...a poopie prize bowl.  I pooped in the potty so I get a prize.  she took it opened it...wow!  My niece asked if she could have it...no..this is mine but when you go poop in the potty you can have one.  IT worked and she went that day. she did it for I think 10 days..when the prizes were all gone.  My niece got to pick something special to do.  she chose to go out for ice cream to celebrate. Does he like going to school... if he does you could say if you don't poop in the potty you wont be able to go anymore.  the teachers said you can't poop in the potty anymore. Whatever..the reason is that he wont poop in the potty(have you asked him?!?!) he has to be the one to decide to go....bribing...small threats... my or may not help.  OR if it hurts him to go and he is scared...I think you need to deal with that issue first..then move on.", 9871, "AFi5kTiEaa", 1],

	104017 : ["Most of the time it's a money issue.  However, I think the owner should have thought about things like this before they bought a horse. People are stubborn, they don't what to admit that they are having problem riding their horse or aren't doing it properly.  Just some lessons on the rider's part would help them immensity.   I agree that people should be more willing to go to trainers if they are having problems (trusting that they can afford it).", 9872, "6GehblM3aa", 2],
	104018 : ["There are several points that can be made here. One common thread is that there are a lot of people that feel they are experts and they can handle the job, not knowing their own limitations.  While they know the horse has an issue, it is never them.  Sending them to a trainer would mean THEY need additional training too so that they could ride their horse. The second is that they were not financially ready for the cost of sending their horses to a trainer since they were sold a bill of good with the bomb proof horse :) And another is so many self-proclaimed trainers out there that actually cause additional issues, so who do they trust. This list could go on and on, but in my opinion these are the top 3 :) Good Luck.", 9872, "j45Q2ipRaa", 2],

	104024 : ["Oh yeah it hurts. It all depends on the paintball, higher end paintball tend to be more brittle so they break easier which means it don't hurt that much. Walmart paintball really hurts sometimes they don't even break and that means you are still in the game. Then you have to take in account the guy that is shooting you, what velocity is his gun set at and what distance you are being shot. The pain does not last that long usually unless you get shot at close range and they are using cheap balls then you get a pretty good welt and bruise and sometimes it will break skin.

You can't rush these things.  My son was 4 when he was completely potty trained and at that age he still peed the bed at night.  He did that until he was 8.  So what.  You do the best you can and deal with it.  It will click one day and he will go poop in the toilet. Just don't make it a big issue then one day, he will do it.  I promise.

If he never stopped pooping in his diaper/pull-up/underpants, then he was never fully toilet trained to begin with. If his school requires him to be fully potty trained, you may need to take him out until he masters it.

Both conversions were in the hundreds of dollars range and involved a good bit of changeout including the stock. I recently got to shoot a modified 10/22 with heavy bull barrel, high end scope, and target trigger. Sweet setup that would put every shot into a half inch hole at 25 yards. I expect the gun would shoot even better, but this was plinking at an outdoor range from an improvised rest.", 9865, "None", 0],
	104034 : ["Yes, the way to make any firearm look cool to anyone who halfway matters is to put it in the hands of someone who can aim at a target the size of a dime and rarely miss it. If that's YOU (which I doubt), great.  If not, practice with your boring-looking 10/22 until it IS you.  Then you'll be cool. If you're going to build a 10/22 worth having, you need a decent scope, a stock that fits you, some decent standard velocity .22lr rounds and a good barrel.  All that other crap is just made to impress the video game and airsoft crowd.", 9865, "5f461c5a57b87f9398a78da9b50d79bbaa", 0],

If you without a doubt know what your doing and how to properly train and care for a horse then by all means getting a few questions answered once in awhile or asking advise isn't bad.. But I too have seen somethings on here that makes me cringe.. you OWE it to your horse to get it trained properly. If you cant afford it then you should find a different hobby one that cant seriously hurt you, the horse or someone else because of a lack of knowledge. In my area $650 is what most of the Show barns charge for a horse in full training. The amish around here actually do wonders with horses and I think its like $200 for a month.

I can turn and stop  my horse just on seat command. and he has been broke for  only 4 months now. ( working on the backing up )  Now I have gone for training sessions with other people for riding, and pointers then I take from there go home and practice.
