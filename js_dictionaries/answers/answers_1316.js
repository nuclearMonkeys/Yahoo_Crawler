	71382 : ["Comparing Pokemon in the universe of Pokemon to the animals in our world, which Pokemon(s) woul be tasty to eat?or, which pokemon would taste good as a type of food that is eaten in reality? for example: Scrambled Togepi Eggs, Magikarp fillets etc. >>Haha I've thought about this before...Did you ever notice in the original series they would eat things like cheeseburgers but there were no actual cows? Anyway, I'd be willing to bet that milktank's milk would be good, as would a burger of them.  I'm not into fish, but maybe some of the plant pokemon would be good?  Bulbasaur salad? hmmm Additional Pokemon questions: 1)Why do Pokemon always fant in battle and get injured, but none of them actually die? >>Because when the games were made the creator was trying to stress nonviolence or something...i think wikipedia has a page on it 2)How come there are Ghost-type pokemon like Gastly, haunter, Gengar, Banette, Dusclops, Drifblim, Spiritomb etc. but Pokemon never actually die, dont Pokemon actually need to die first to become Ghost-Pokemon? >>Well your pokemon can't die in game, but they can die.  Don't you remember lavender town and the huge pokemon tower thing?  When you went in it in the original games the people would say things like \"my poor [pokemon], why did you have to die!?\" And junk like that...", 8620, "dYQUQGflaa", 3],
	71383 : ["In the anime it is implied that Pokémon are eaten, as there appear to be no animals and some of the food does contain meat. Also, in the episode where James' Magikarp evolves into Gyrados, they do fantasize Magikarp cooked different ways, and say they have to eat something. In the games, Team Rocket were cutting off Slowpoke tails to sell as a delicacy. Also, several Pokedex reference the way a Pokémon protects themselves from predators, what they do to capture prey, etc. It is directly stated that Heatmore eat Durant for example. Also, in some of the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, one of the rescue teams is named Team Tasty. It's comprised of a Wurmple and a Swellow, and the Wurmple named the team Team Tasty because that was how it thought its partner saw it as. The Wurmple on this team also makes a reference to how it worries that its partner sees it as dinner. So while it's never directly stated, there is enough implied evidence to assume that yes, Pokémon do get eaten in the Pokémon world.", 8620, "None", 0],

	71385 : ["The game you have described was originally called Reversi, and was invented over 120 years ago by an Englishman named Lewis Waterman.  The German board game company Ravensburger mass marketed it near the close of the 19th century.  A Japanese game company standardized the rules and renamed the game Othello in the 1970s.  The name \"Othello\" refers to a Shakespearean play in which the antagonist describes himself as \"two-faced.\"  In this play, the character Othello is black, while Desdemona is white.  The green board can be likened to the green field upon which Othello wages battle.  The American board game company Pressman began producing this game in mass quantities in the United States.  Therefore, both of these answers, Reversi and Othello, are correct. - LJS", 8618, "IxNQwrKYaa", 0],

Another movie sighting: A game in progress can be seen in Veronica's (Winona Ryder's) bedroom next to her desk in the movie \"Heathers\". It would be easy to describe the rules for placing a stone. However, the rules for scoring a completed game are less trivial. It would be easier for you to just Google for \"Go game\" and check out one of those web sites.", 8618, "l2jT9vKUaa", 0],
	71387 : ["All starters have their strengths and weaknesses. I will be choosing either Snivy or Tepig to begin with. Oshawott has great stats and a great move pool. Snivy and Tepig are more challenging to to use, especially Snivy. -In your case Oshawott would be the obvious choice because of its stats, move pool and since it looks sick in its final evolution. If you want more of a challenge go with Snivy, sure its move pool isnt the greatest but that is where TM's come in handy. Plus it has high speed and the rest of it's stats will go nearly head to head with Oshawott in their final evos stat-wise (Snivy would obviously win since it's a grass type)", 8619, "3FGnOfqjaa", 0],

The fact that he says he does not like being questioned turns me off immediately.  What does he have to hide? Unless he is willing to be forthright with you, and is willing to learn how to upload a pic of himself, I wouldn't give him the time of day. If by chance you do end up meeting him -- let it be in a *public* place so you can talk to him and get some sense of him.

	71390 : ["I think I'd eat Goldeen instead of Magikarp. Magikarp are all scales... 1. Probably because it's a kids show and also, if they died in the video game, it would make things harder. Anyway, the way I see it is that the pokemon fight like it's a boxing match, not a dog fight.  2. Pokemon do die. Just look at the cemetery in that one town (Fusha, I believe). As for ghost pokemon, their origins are kinda vague... Because can't you breed them and stuff?", 8620, "ryLbKatoaa", 5],

So I say you should go for Snivy because not only are the stats awesome, but the Moves it has can give out cool combos like Leaf tornado= Giga Drain, or Leaf Blade= Mega Drain.

If he sends you a pic print two of them, take one with you to meet him leave the other at home with a note hide it in your bed and cover it up.
