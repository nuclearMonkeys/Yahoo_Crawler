	105201 : ["Anytime the government releases money to consumers, it will stimulate economic spending. The benefit is the multiplier effect.  If I buy a hot dog from a street vendor, the vendor will pay his supplier, his supplier will pay his employees, his employees will spend money to various others, and they will continue the process.  In other words, for each $1 that I contribute to the economy, up to $10 will be spent in transition. If the government spends money on blowing up things in Iraq, it only gets spent one time. The economy is in trouble only because people with a boatload of money say it is in trouble.  If you have a job on which you can depend, and you spend your money in the normal fashion, nothing else matters.  If you feel like you got screwed on your mortgage, lost your job, and your cat got run over by the neighbor, you feel like life sucks. As long as the majority of people don't feel like life sucks, we are ok.   Take the money, spend it on what is important to you, vote for your favorite idiot on the ballot, and hope that McCain wins, because Congress and the Senate won't support him.  This means that we spend the next four years without the government being able to screw with us any further. Good luck!", 9913, "Xv3fdtThaa", 0],
	105202 : ["Titleist and Taylormade are the two most respected by golf professionals. Cleveland is close behind and still the leader in wedges. Titleist Scotty Cameron is by far the leader in putters with Ping and Odyssey(Callaway) close behind. Just a little note to the person who said Cobra is least respected with no spokesman or history. They currently have the US Open Winner on staff along with Ian Poulter, etc. Big names, and tons of respect from industry professionals. They are a Acushnet brand (own titleist, footjoy and pinnacle) and are essentially Titelist version of game improvement/oversized/offset clubs Nike has a great R and D department especially with Tiger and all, and is only getting better Callaway is game improvement for the most part as is Cobra. Ping is big in the women and college arena.

	105204 : ["First off let me give respect to your wife. WOW! What a gift!! Although I must say, she probably has no idea what she just got herself into. Golf is like crack. Once you bomb your first drive down the center of the fairway or hit that perfect lazer like iron shot to within a foot of the pin, YOU ARE HOOKED! No doubt about it. The more you play, the more you \"HAVE TO\" play. Golf will creep into every part of your life. Dinner conversations, taking divots in your front yard, making practice swings while standing in the frozen food isle at the grocery store, you name it and golf will be there.Good luck to BOTH of you.;-) As for your question, I would Highly recomend COBRA irons and woods. Many people dont know that COBRA is manufactured by the same company that makes titleist as well as footjoy and pinnacle( Acushnet Company ). Cobra is what is called a \"GAME IMPROVEMENT\" brand. That means they are more geared to help the beginner that is really interested in the game improve his/her game and keep it enjoyable.You definantly do not want to buy a model that you see the guys on tour playing. These guys are PROS and they know how to use pro  model equipment. I myself play all  COBRA equipmentfrom my driver and woods to my irons and wedges and even my putter. They are the most forgiving clubs you can buy. What that means is that even if you do not hit the ball in the center of the clubface( also known as off center hits) you still have a tremendous amount of accuracy and feel. This is created by what is called cavity back design. What that means is  that most of the weight of the clubhead is placeg around the edges of the face leaving a CAVITY in the center. I would recomend the cobra s9 set for you. If the club where your wife got the gift card from does not carry COBRA on the display rack they can certinly order them for you. Go to any major golf retailer and try them out ask them to Fit you for a set of clubs. Take that info back to the club and have them order them for you. Just remember, no clubs can take the place of a few good lessons and plenty of practice( even if it is in the frozen isle!) Good luck!!!! p.s. links for those COBRA clubs are below.", 9912, "None", 6],

	105215 : ["You are not the only one with this concern. Read the papers and other publications because even the other politicians not connected with Bush have the same questions. This is why they are working on other ways to fix the economy such as mortgage assistance etc. We are in the same boat as everyone else because our money will go to bills rather than purchasing frivolous stuff and we worry about tomorrow too. Unfortunately this is what happens when there is a recession. We can only hope that the next administration, which ever candidate is voted into office, can fix what has been done, but it will not be corrected overnight.

	105219 : ["From my personal experience, I would have to say Tommy Armour.   They are cheap and affordable, and are great quality clubs.  Purchase the more expensive brands when you feel more comfortable with your golf game.  Tommy Armour is not a well known club manufacturer, however they are sold in most golf retail stores, nor are they a completely generic brand of clubs.  Try and stay away from old clubs, as they are not beginner-friendly.  Old clubs lack in forgiveness and the technology of today's golf clubs.  Most beginners go with old 70s and 80s clubs because of their price, but then quit golf because its too hard, when in reality, they might have a lot more fun if they put a little more money into a quality set of clubs.  Spend some time seeing what brand is right for you and is in your price range.  Fitting for clubs also helps because one golf club for one golfer might not be fitted properly to another golfer.

Cheap ones abound but they do not have the sophistication of the more expensive ones. I have a Wacom tablet - it cost about Â£80 - that plugs into the USB socket.

	105231 : ["As a beginner you're going to give any set you get a beating - I wouldn't break the bank for a new set. Between mis-hits, unseen rocks, and frustration, these clubs will get their fair share of scratches and dings. If you can get a more inexpensive set and use the balance of the gift card for beginner lessons, I would highly reccommend that. Adams, Wilson,and Dunlop all make an affordable complete beginner set (which will give you 3 iron to pitching wedge, as well as 1,3,5 woods and a putter). If the gift card is to a course's pro shop I'm not sure if they'll carry these. If it's to somewhere like Sports Authority you're good to go. In the event you're locked into a pro shop purchase, go for low end Callaway or Taylor Made Irons. They tend to be forgiving and will mask any deficiencies in your swing. Look for cavity back irons, with a good weight to the head. Also look into steel shafts in order to keep your swing slower and more under control, as you want to learn to consistently hit it straight before trying to kill the ball.", 9912, "OI6CHwebaa", 2],

	105244 : ["If your period isn't due for another 2 weeks, then it is almost impossible that you are pregnant at the moment, no matter what the length of your cycle. Basically there are 2 stages to your cycle. The first is the days leading up to ovulation, called the follicular phase. Then you ovulate, which is around the time you can get pregnant. The next stage of your cycle is called the luteal phase which is the time between ovulation and your period starting. This phase is between 10 and 16 days in ALL fertile women but usually 12-14 days. If you have a luteal phase of less than 12 days it is very difficult to conceive.  So if your period isn't due for 2 weeks then you really can't have already been pregnant at the start of this week because you probably wouldn't have even ovulated. NOW is probably your most ferilte time, so if you want a baby have sex every day for the next week. Pregnancy tests very rarely show up more than 3 or 4 days before a period is due. They are more accurate around the time a period is due. I would recommend going to www.fertilityfriend.com where you can learn lots about your cycle and how it all works and that will increase your chances of conceiving.", 9916, "ca03c4dbfbf739cc439141f60d700173aa", 0],
