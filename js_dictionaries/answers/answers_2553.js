	133477 : ["The reality is that all previous Intifadas from the Palestinians have used violence regardless of the literal translation of the word and there is no reason to think that any subsequent Intifada would be any different. That being the case, calling for a 3rd Intifada is essentially a call for violence. Whether a Facebook group can contribute to such a thing or taking it down can stop such a thing is immaterial. It is (or should be) against Facebook's policy to use it as a platform to call for violence. Update: You wrote: \"for the millionth time,it doesn't call for violence, the page admin said that himself too, read above\" And for the millionth time, all Intifadas that have previously been executed HAVE BEEN VIOLENT. You cannot call for a 3RD Palestinian Intifada and yet at the same time say, \"well, I want an Intifada but it should be nothing like the previous two which were violent uprisings\". If he wants a truly peaceful demonstration (which is a democratic right even if I don't agree with the point of the demonstration), don't call it the 3rd Intifada. And to be quite frank, I don't believe he wants only \"peaceful demonstrations\". And to be even more frank, even if HE wants them, how many of those who clicked on the \"LIKE\" button for this group interpret \"3rd Intifada\" to mean \"peaceful demonstrations\" instead of \"An Intifada just like the previous two\"?", 11178, "AA10645437", -3],

A lot of people can take that a lot of different ways.  One perfectly valid interpretation of that is death to Israelis and/or Jews, as those were the motivations of the second intifada.  I'm sure that you need to understand that if you truly want to criticize.  And, by those who read it that way, that means suicide bombings and killings, which would be a violation of Facebook's rules and thus would be removed. Israel has freedom of speech.  Israel has democracy.  The person who is trying to do this is using HIS free speech and going through a perfectly democratic means to explain  why he thinks the page should be removed.  Like I said before, the way he probably looks at this page, he probably sees it as violent, and I don't believe that there is 0 mention of violence towards Israelis on a page with that many Israel-haters.  Not by him himself, but by others.  If there is enough, it would be grounds for removal as per Facebook's rules.  That is not a violation of free speech:  more like Facebook protecting their image, in extension their free speech. Deleting the page will probably not cause a stop in things.

I did not realize until it was too late in many respects that I had a say in the way things went and turned out, and for a long time, that was a great source of guilt and regret. I have long since gotten over most of those feelings, but things would have turned out vastly different with the knowledge that I was always far from helpless. There is one benefit from the experience though, I now know the true value of empowering children to look at their world and see what they can do to effect it, and I hope to pass that strength on to my own kids. I'll start with the one I'm cooking now that's due in January. Here's crossing my fingers I get it right!I realized that it was a new and wonderful phase of my life! My family and friends were aghast that I was approaching this life passage with such a giddy attitude. But I didn't care. It was the first real moment in my life that I realized how important my opinion and feelings are and how having them does not discount other people; it just brings it into balance. I feel so positive, energetic and hopeful for the future. I wish I had realized all of this when I was younger, but now is even more exciting and important to me than the past.

First of all not only they havent done enough, in fact they did nothing to stop or salvage the attacks plus on top of that, it was part of some of the politicians' strategies to instil hatred amongst the citizen and divided the nation. Malay Muslim cannot distinguish politic with religion. To my opinion, Religion is something very personal and should be kept to oneself wherelse as politic concern, it involves the whole nation ie economy, country stability etc and Malaysia is a multicultural and race nation and you dont a rocket scientist to immediate identify the problem lies ahead.

	133512 : ["I think the two most important life lessons I've only recently learned (and am trying to impress upon my 11 year old son) are: 1) learn to love yourself for who you are.  As soon as I became comfortable in my own skin and comfortable with the kind of person I was, it became very easy for me to grow and to evolve into a better version of the person I'd come to love. A wacky little concept, but it's true.  And 2) learn how to forgive and forget.  I had wasted a lot of years holding grudges that I should have let go of, and because of that I  missed out on developing a stronger relationship with those against whom I held the grudges.  The past is the past, and when apologies have been made, let the past go.  Be the bigger person and grow a little.   It's pretty easy to teach a child how to look both ways before crossing the street, how to say please and thank you at the appropriate times, and how to use the recycling bin rather than the trash can.  But it's not so easy to teach the things that we, as parents, have struggled with a good portion of our own lives.  However, those things are probably the most important life lessons we need to make sure we teach them.  How else can we truly make a difference in their lives and help them through something that has been hard for us?   Had I known, truly known, these two things when I was younger, I wonder how much sooner I would have grown up and become the person I am today?

If not, the minority races in Malaysia would lose their confidence in the Government and will read the speech on racial harmony differently. The Government would be seen as protecting their own national religion and the other religions are viewed as secondary since they are a minority.  So bringing these attackers to tasks and giving them a severe punishment are the most effective ways of dealing with the attacks to show that the Government is serious about racial harmony, which is so often mentioned in the country.
