Our child will play in the backyard, and in the front, only with me or my husband watching her carefully. I defiantly don't believe in playing in the street.

I am always right there with them. 3. We live in a town of only about 1,000 people and only have a few cars on our street.

	66478 : ["Definition of refer: to send or direct for treatment, aid, information Mr. Old Client referred (directed for information) his friend to you. He did nothing to you; you were not referred.  The first sentence is the correct one to convey what you mean.  Appreciate is certainly the word to use - thank never enters the picture here. However, to be grammatically correct, the sentence should read: \" I appreciate Mr. Old Client's referring you to me.\" If a gerund (participle used as a noun), such as 'referring', is preceded by a noun, that noun should be possessive case. This point is often abused today, but is still the correct way. Citation from GPO Style Manual: 8.18. A noun preceding a gerund should be in the possessive  case.       in the event of Mary's leaving       the ship's hovering nearby BTW, avoid like the plague any advice from a purported English teacher who does not understand transitive verbs, who uses \"bare\" in place of \"bear\", and who cannot spell \"client.\"", 8335, "e739a2c4e1e2dcb4dfddc6736311a5ceaa", 0],

	66484 : ["A brain aneurysm IS definitely possible, but would be odd just because of your age and clean medical history. Another possibility includes, but is not limited to, a brain tumor. Since the pain is coming on when your blood pressure is spiking, that further supports the fact that it could be either of the two. Plus, you have family history of aneurysm. I have personally seen a male in his early twenties fall victim to a brain aneurysm.  In the case of tumor or aneurysm, you need to go to a doctor ASAP and get some tests run. Early detection for both of these possibilities is KEY. You can live a perfectly healthy life after a tumor excision or repair of an aneurysm. It is possible, and in fact most likely,  that you have a much less severe ailment, but when it comes to things like this, it is absolutely best to assume the worst and get it checked out. Get seen. Soon. Forget money or insurance, go to a free clinic or emergency room. Special note in regards to another poster's advice: These symptoms are absolutely cause for concern of a dx. of tumor or aneurysm. You can only be sure with a CT and MRI. Dizziness because she's out of shape? Not likely. 2 months of headaches with no nasal symptoms because of a sinus infection (sinusitis). Absolutely not. Sharp pain in her head because she's working too hard? Not likely, we're talking about a brain here not muscle cramps.", 8337, "None", 0],

	66490 : ["They got the idea from the Zoroastrians in Babylon during the Captivity, along with demons, angels, Judgment Day, Lilith, heaven, hell, etc.  That the serpent was supposed to be a serpent was clear from the description that it was \"the most cunning of the beasts\".   And by its punishment:  People also tend to forget the bronze serpent that Moses used to cure a snakebite. ", 8333, "b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa", 2],
	66491 : ["So, how do you know that in 100 years, a chicken might not have evolved enough to actually fly? Tom may be telling you the truth, but you won't see it until the chicken has actually had a chance TO evolve. And don't you tell me, after all the prating about evolution being a fact, that it is not possible for a chicken to fly over Tom's house (eventually). But seriously, there are many ideas about that serpent. My favorite is that God actually sent a contingent of angels to watch over and guide mankind, but got jealous and gave them \"knowledge of good and evil\"...which was actually advanced technology. Metallurgy, for instance, was not used to make better farm tools, but rather, better weapons. Think of Polyphemus, chained to his rock for giving men \"fire from heaven\"... As far as the OT prophecies, did you happen to read about how, in Samuel's time, Israel insisted on having a king \"like the other nations\"...and how God told Samuel that it wasn't Samuel that was being rejected, but God who was rejected as their rightful King. Notice especially that God does warn them what a human king will be like...and compare to politicians throughout time. Also, realize that prophecy is always open to interpretation. Just because the Jews of the time (or even today) don't recognize Christ in those prophecies doesn't mean that He is not there. Notice especially Malachi's assertion that \"The Lord Whom ye seek shall suddenly appear in His temple\" and then consider what Christians believe about how Jesus strode into the temple and cleared it out, crying that His house was meant to be a House of Prayer, but that they had turned it into a den of thieves. Also, consider the assertion that He continued to preach in that self-same temple for nearly a week, and the temple authorities could do nothing about it. Malachi also told them that they would not be able to stand before the Lord in that day. There are many other prophecies I could go to, but that one does seem rather difficult, even for modern day Jews, to refute. It is a difference of opinion...if you look up the Hebrew, you might be surprised. Alot of words and phrases may be interpreted in different ways...but then, again, as you take it overall, the meaning is pretty much as we have it...barring some politcal leanings.", 8333, "None", -3],
	66492 : ["I do experience a certain nostalgic feeling when the sun is going down and I see a couple of young teens throwing a football back and forth in the middle of the street. It's not appropriate everywhere though. There's a cul-de-sac behind my house and the kids over there are constantly in the street. There's no thru-traffic there of course so it doesn't seem that dangerous. Kids playing in the middle of the street where people drive fast - not good. Kids playing in the middle of the street that refuse to move over for cars - not good. Young children in the middle of the street - not good.

You impatient, bull headed, impatient drivers need to be patient.  Allow the kids to get out of the road and drive the speed limit on residential streets. I live on a residential street where there are idiots who think they should go 45 down my street.  The drivers have a responsibility to drive carefully too.

The difference stands in the fact that you bare more consideration to the new client, for trusting his friend and responding to his suggestion, thus giving YOU a chance.

I think you'll find a weight of evidence that suggests the bible has been faithfully recorded word for word, symbol for symbol, translated diligently by numerous dedicated scholars. Is the world's best seller. That Jesus today is as popular, probably more popular today than He was 2000 years ago. Christian martyrs did they all die in vain? Why are so many people dedicated Christians today? 'Take up your cross' and the doctrines of Sin and Hell are hardly appealing to the natural mind. So why are people being converted today with that knowledge. Study of the New and Old Testaments does reveal themes consistent throughout but I strongly doubt that you have studied the Bible enough to identify them.

In Qabalistic Gematria this word adds to 358 - as does the word \"Messiach,\" Mem-Shin-Yod-Cheth.  This fact was held to indicate that the Serpent was actually the Redeemer!  The \"Gnostic\" Christian sects called the Ophites developed this thesis at length, claiming that the \"God\" of Genesis was really the Demiurge, the creator of the illusion of matter, who sought to enslave man and keep him ignorant and benighted - as evidenced by His actions throughout the Old Testament.  The Serpent, then, was literally the \"Christ\" in disguise, and his \"Temptation\" of Adam and Eve was the first \"initiation\" of man into the mysteries of his true spirituality and divinity - as he says, \"you will become as gods, knowing good and evil.\" I'm not saying I subscribe to either the orthodox interpretation or this \"esoteric\" tradition; I'm just saying that there are many ways to interpret the Bible, some directly opposed to each other.", 8333, "None", 2],
