Now that the economy has tanked I think the issue of illegals taking American jobs will come to a head.  The Democrats seem to want to protect the American worker more, while Republicans were pro business. I'm not sure what Obama's position is.  I do know that when people are out of work, they have time to clean their own house and cut their own grass.  Construction is down. If the Gov would crack down on employers hiring illegals, the incentive wouldn't be here. ", 8785, "1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa", 3],

	74884 : ["Yes, those of us who (for the moment) still have jobs are paying for this, pretty well all of us can name or quote the case of somebody who does nothing and is supported by the state.  Round us it's people who can't stay where they've lived in previous years, mostly because they and their children are so objectionable.  If you met them, you'd perhaps want to kill them yourself.  One lot I know have 11 kids, the father would earn less (he's an industrial chemist, supposedly) than they get in support.  Apparently he stays at home, to \"make sure we're brought-up right\" according to one son, who had just returned to school after exclusion for threatening a teacher with a steel bar two feet long. This government shows more signs of finding something for them to do to justify their existence than the last lot, but no real sign that this gigantic drain on the public purse will be reduced, yet.  So the budget for social support is still bigger than the NHS's budget, the armed forces are reduced in numbers again, note, the budget to feed these brave lads and lasses is £2.20 a day per head, less than feeding wasters in prison.  The NHS takes a hit, just when it was working well, and the dreadful behaviour of kids in school makes teaching less and less attractive, not that the government will be paying to attract anyone.  And the kids all think they don't have to work for a living, or that they should just give up and get pregnant now, so somebody else will support them.  And when the government said they would make school and college funding per pupil the same, they did it by reducing school budgets, rather than increasing college funding, so class sizes have got to go up and teachers are being made redundant. And don't get me started about the reductions in research budgets, we already spend less per head than almost all other \"first world\" countries, less than some \"third world\" countries, relying on scientists and engineers to support themselves in developing our few meagre inventions, while the government rewards people like Alan Sugar, who \"make\" their money by buying foreign products and selling them to the rest of us. Here's another example, the BBC may have to drop coverage of Formula 1, the technology of which is something in which we lead the world (yes, along with Ferrari), with more world champions from Britain than any other country, all but two teams are British companies, building cars in Britain, while coverage of football, in which we trail behind and get knocked out of every major competition, unless we pay over the odds for foreign players, is continued.", 8781, "dDcWYhj4aa", -1],
