It would be like comparing a murder with a bullet to the head to a throat slash. Would you say because one didn't involve a pistol and bullet that it was not murder? Apartheid is a crime that has definitions. \"For the purpose of the present Convention, the term 'the crime of apartheid', which shall include SIMILAR (not identical, ed) policies and practices of racial (later amended to include national)segregation and discrimination as practiced in southern Africa, shall apply to the following inhumane acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them:  a.Denial to a member or members of a racial group or groups of the right to life and liberty of person i.By murder of members of a racial group or groups;  ii.By the infliction upon the members of a racial group or groups of serious bodily or mental harm, by the infringement of their freedom or dignity, or by subjecting them to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  iii.By arbitrary arrest and illegal imprisonment of the members of a racial group or groups;   b.Deliberate imposition on a racial group or groups of living conditions calculated to cause its or their physical destruction in whole or in part;  c.Any legislative measures and other measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing the full development of such a group or groups, in particular by denying to members of a racial group or groups basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to work, the right to form recognised trade unions, the right to education, the right to leave and to return to their country, the right to a nationality, the right to freedom of movement and residence, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association;  d.Any measures including legislative measures, designed to divide the population along racial lines by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group or groups, the prohibition of mixed marriages among members of various racial groups, the expropriation of landed property belonging to a racial group or groups or to members thereof;  e.Exploitation of the labour of the members of a racial group or groups, in particular by submitting them to forced labour;  f.Persecution of organizations and persons, by depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms, because they oppose apartheid.\" If short & sweet (or anybody else) disagrees that Israel is in violation of any of the major points, I would be happy to supply examples. @esther, apartheid is also included in areas that are under a nation's control, and need not be applied to every member of an ethnicity/nationality. Surely you are not suggesting that Palestinians living in Area \"C\" (no security nor civilian control by the Palestinian Authority) have the vote? In fact they are under direct military governship. It's a \"back door\" approach, saying that because Arabs in Israel proper have the vote there is no apartheid, but ignoring the West Bank. @short & sweet - I have quoted the original text, I only noted it was later amended to include nationality, and I pointed out that it need not be EVERYBODY in the ethnic, cultural, or national divisions. Notice you didn't question any of the points, bu nice \"red herring\". Notice in the ORIGINAL text it say \"members\" NOT all. But I'm not surprised, you can't fight the facts so try to draw attention elsewhere. Gee, never saw a Zionist do THAT before!! As to your reference to Oslo, well Israel is still building settlements, and I believe the South Africans did the same thing with their bandustans. Funny I can't seem to find anywhere in the text that lists exemptions from disputed territories. How is increasing a civilian population in what who define as a hostile environment, \"protecting yourself\"? Unless you're using the civilians as a shield to protect Israel. @esther, so because a population is only 4% then you don't have to let them vote? You can force them to live in a military dictatorship? Does that sound right to you? And I'm afraid you're mistaken, the majority of attacks in the West Bank is by settlers, and has been for years. Plus you're overlooking the fact that Israel can and does assert its control ANYWHERE in the West Bank if it sees fit too, as when they surrounded Arafat's compound.", 9935, "IAHW9xbjaa", 5],

	105642 : ["To compare Israel to the apartheid that existed in South Africa is morally irresponsible. This seems to be the theme of this section today, and honestly, it's quite offensive. While there are religious and cultural differences between the Arabs and Jews in Israel, this is alone does not constitute apartheid. Excerpt from Wikipedia regarding Israel on the apartheid issue: South African Judge Richard Goldstone, writing in The New York Times in October 2011, said that \"in Israel, there is no apartheid. Nothing there comes close to the definition of apartheid under the 1998 Rome Statute.\" Goldstone noted that Arab citizens of Israel are allowed to vote, have political parties, and hold seats in the Knesset and other positions, including one on the Israeli Supreme Court. Goldstone wrote that the situation in the West Bank was more complex, but that there is no attempt to maintain \"an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group\", and claimed that the seemingly oppressive measures taken by Israel were taken to protect its own citizens from attacks by Palestinian militants. Arabs in Israel have equal voting rights. Arab women may vote, unlike in many Arabic countries. Arabic is an official language in Israel. Arabs may live wherever they want-- the government cannot prevent them from living in a certain place. Arabs are not required to serve in the military so they don't have to fight other Arabs, but many choose to do so anyway. Israeli law prohibits discrimination in employment. Arabs who are arrested are considered innocent until proven guilty. etc., etc., etc. Excerpt from Jewish Virtual Library: Today, within Israel, Jews are a majority, but the Arab minority are full citizens who enjoy equal rights. Arabs are represented in the Knesset, and have served in the Cabinet, high-level foreign ministry posts (e.g., Ambassador to Finland) and on the Supreme Court. Under apartheid, black South Africans could not vote and were not citizens of the country in which they formed the overwhelming majority of the population. Laws dictated where they could live, work and travel. And, in South Africa, the government killed blacks who protested against its policies. By contrast, Israel allows freedom of movement, assembly and speech. Some of the government's harshest critics are Israeli Arabs who are members of the Knesset. The idea of apartheid in Israel is complete fabrication. @Sameer: That's actually a ratio of 1:5, but that's besides the point. Do all 20% use their right to vote? If so, perhaps their votes would have more of an impact, and more Arabs would be voted into office. The point is that they do have the right to vote, and there are Arabs in public office. That being the case, how is it apartheid? South African blacks not only had NO representation, but they also didn't have the right to vote. @Michardav: In addition to how Short & Sweet answered that point, let me just add that the West Bank is sort of an entity of its own. @Sameer: You're still making MY point, ya sahib. At least these Arabs have a parlimentary position for their platform. The South Africans did not. If it were truly apartheid, they would hold NO government positions at all, no right to vote. It would be the the Southern US in the 1960's, and that is not at all how it is in Israel. @Michardav: Btw, only about 4% of the population of your favorite example of Area C are Palestinians. Most of the abuses that take place in the West Bank are carried out by their own people, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. Is that apartheid when it's Arabs torturing their brethren? @Michardav again: Short&Sweet said it best: \"The current arrangements areas a,b & c, are results of prior negotiations, and can not be defined as \"apartheid\" since again, they are stages of negotiation within conflict & dispute over who owns the LAND - not who controls the PEOPLE.\"  The West Bank is a messy situation.
