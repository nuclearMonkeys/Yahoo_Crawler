	118146 : ["I am not sure what the big issue is for posters above.  The route you propose is very do-able in two weeks as all of the big legs in your journey can each be done in one very long day (or 2 short and easy days) of driving, leaving plenty of time to Disneyland and the Grand Canyon and a few other spots in between.  Yes, the US is big, but most of your route is on Interstates which go very fast. Based on Yahoo Maps, LA to the Grand Canyon South Rim is 491 miles and would take a little over 7 hours.  Grand Canyon to San Diego is 553 miles and would take about 8 hours.  San Diego back to LA is 121 miles and takes 2-4 hours depending on traffic.  Even if you broke the LA-GC and GC-SD drives into 2 days each (which I would recommend), you are still looking at only 5 easy days of driving and 10-11 days of pure sightseeing.  More than enough time. There is an RV park at the Grand Canyon South Rim.  It is used mostly by park employees, but visitors can stay and hook up there too (see link below).  This would be ideal because you could then take the free shuttle bus from the RV park to the main lodges and attractions.   Unfortunately, that is all I can tell you about RV parks along your route specifically (other than AZ and southern CA are popular with RVers and so parks of varying quality are pretty common all over).  However, I can give you some general recommendations of things to see (and be aware of) along your route that you might otherwise miss: LA - LA has lots of famous attractions (Hollywood, La Brea tar pits, etc, etc) that you can find tons of info about online, so I won't go into details.  Be warned that LA is also famous for congested traffic which will be even less fun to navigate in a really big RV. Donut Man, Glendora, CA - As you are heading east out of town on I-10, you may want to consider a slight detour north to visit the small farming town of Glendora whose old main street (part of old Route 66) features a semi-legendary donut stand called 'Donut Man' that has been in operation since the 1930s.  LA food critic Jonathan Gold recently won the Pulitzer Prize in part for his review of this place (see link below).  A good place to stock up your RV on tasty pastries. Calico Ghost Town (near Barstow, CA) - Presumably you will take I-10 to I-15 and then I-15 to I-40 and the I-40 east to Arizona and the canyon.  Just north of the town of Barstow (near the I-15, I-40 split) is the old mining camp of Calico that has been turned into an old west tourist attraction.  Kinda fun.  Most of the route from LA to the Arizona border is empty desolate desert, but kinda starkly pretty if you've not seen it before. Old Route 66 Detour through Oatman - After you cross  the Colorado River into Arizona, you could take a little detour north along old Route 66 through the Black Mountains and the old mining camp of Oatman which has many historic buildings and still has semi-wild burros (descendants of the mining days) wandering the hills.  The route is through rough mountain slopes with ruins of old mines on the hills - much more interesting than staying on I-40, but as the road is narrow and winding in place, it might be nerve-wracking if you have a really large RV.  This section of old Route 66 re-joins I-40 near Kingman. Old Route 66 Detour from Kingman to Seligman - The section of old Route 66 running north of I-40 from Kingman to Seligman is the longest surviving stretch of Route 66 in the US (Route 66 was one of the classic American 2-lane highways from the 30s to the 50s).  This stretch winds past small towns that have not changed much since they were by-passed by the Interstate and there is also the Grand Canyon Caverns tourist attractions (I think they may have an RV park).  Although slower and a bit more winding than the interstate, most RVs would not have problems with this stretch. Snow Cap Cafe, Seligman, AZ - Where Route 66 reconnects to I-40 at Seligman is a famous little soda shop called the Snow Cap whose owners (the Delgadillo family) are long time residents who helped lead the restoration of Route 66 as a historic attraction).  The wildly decorated shop is known for its off-beat sense of humor and very popular with travellers. Flagstaff, AZ - Although you can turn off I-40 and take AZ64 up to the Grand Canyon, you may want to consider driving another half an hour on to Flagstaff (where you can also head up to the canyon along US180).  Flagstaff is a historic lumber and railroad town with many interesting attractions and a pretty historic downtown area filled with shops, cafes and art galleries.  Attractions include the Lowell Observatory (where Pluto was discovered in 1930) and the excellent museum of Northern Arizona just north of town.  Williams is also a historic town with a little restored downtown area, but much smaller than Flagstaffs (Williams is also where the Grand Canyon railroad depot is). Grand Canyon, AZ - A good way to get a feel for the canyon is to take the free guided shuttle bus that runs from the lodges out along the rim to Hermits Rest and back (you can get on and off at various overlooks along the way).  The area around the lodges contains many interesting historic buildings including the grand 1905 El Tovar hotel and the nearby 1905 Hopi House (designed to look like an Indian pueblo).  Although looking from the rim is nice, you should try to walk a short distance (even just a half mile or so) down one of the trails (like Bright Angel or South Kaibab) to get a sense of being in the canyon and having the walls rise above you (you would not want to go much further down unless you are an experienced hiker and properly equipped). Be warned that the Grand Canyon and Flagstaff area is up on the Colorado Plateau at an elevation of 7,000 feet - so unlike much of Arizona it can get very cold with snow storms during the winter.  Make sure you have at least a good coat or heavy sweater. Also in the Flagstaff-Grand Canyon area, you should try to check out Wupatki and Sunset Crater National Monuments that are NE of Flagstaff along US89A (which leads to the eastern entrance to the park at Cameron).  Wupatki is a large prehistoric indian pueblo and Sunset Crater is an extinct volcanic field - both are very interesting and often overlooked. Grand Canyon to San Diego - To see something different than what you saw on the way out, you will probably want to take I-17 from Flagstaff down to Phoenix, AZ and then take I-8 from Phoenix to San Diego. Sedona, AZ - This is where the famous red rock canyons are located.  Sedona itself is a pretty pricey tourist and resort town with lots of high-end shops and galleries.  If you have an RV, you will want to take I-17 out of Flagstaff and then turn off for Sedona at AZ179.  You would NOT want to go directly down Oak Creek canyon on 89A or down Schnebly Hill road in an RV. Phoenix, AZ - This is a big modern, sprawling city, with the usual assortment of strip malls, shopping centers, movies theaters, etc but not much in the way of major tourist attractions that are unique to it.  The Heard Museum (downtown) is one of the best museums on Native Americans in the country and the Scottsdale area is popular with visitors for its trendy restuarants and western-themed shops and art galleries. I-8 to Yuma, AZ - A whole lot of wide open nothing for most of the way.  Make sure you are filled up on gas before leaving the Phoenix area. Yuma, AZ - Old historic town on the Colorado River that is now popular with tourists and also supported by a number of local military bases.  The original Arizona Territorial Prison is a popular tourist attractions (it make Alcatraz look like a high end hotel).  Many good Mexican food restuarants here as well as the funky old 'Lutes Casino' which is said to be the oldest continously operated pool hall in AZ (good place for hamburgers and chili dogs too). Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area, CA - Just the other side of the river in California, you start to pass into an area of huge sand dunes (looks like the Sahara Desert) that is worth checking out.  Note that from Yuma to San Diego there are only a few towns (all small) and so facilities are few and far between. San Diego and San Diego to LA - Lots to see and do in San Diego (beaches, zoo, Sea World, museums at Balboa park).  There are many books and web sites on this area that can describe them better than me. Have fun!  Two weeks is enough time to travel the route you plan, spend several days each at the canyon, Disneyland and San Diego and still stop at a few of the other smaller attractions mentioned above along the way.  You just need to ready for very full days and prioritize and make a rough itinerary.", 10533, "AA11523701", 3],

She started losing her fur and even though I'd never been allergic to dogs, when I would pet her I would get a rash too. I thought it was mange and so I took her to the vet. The vet said it wasn't mange, it was an allergy to something in her food, like a protien source, and that I should make her food at home and try  different things till I figure out what she's allergic too. Six months or so later, I had figured out it was chicken, and also learned a lot about dog health and dog food and now I feed her a grain free chicken free diet.  I know your vet said i was mange but vets can be wrong. You should try a second opinion from a different vet. And yes, prices can vary. And price doesn't always correlate with quality either.

	118177 : ["I am not qualified in music beyond being a self-taught guitar finger-picker but may I offer an opinion. Each chord contains certain notes. Some chords share several notes with other chords. If the chords contain different notes, they would sound unpleasant if played at the same time. If the chords share common notes but one of them contains an additional notes (e.g. C major, A minor and Am7) they may sound OK at the same time. In general, the flow of a tune is maintained if all instruments follow a similar, compatible pattern of chord changes.  That does NOT mean all instruments play a note that is part of that chord. There may be a melody or a counter melody that includes incidental notes. There may be dynamics within the tune intentionally caused by passing tensions or transient disharmonies. A melody can 'dance around' within the framework of the chord progression. That keeps it interesting and lively. Even ignoring a melody, the change to the chord progression can be gradual with solo instruments introducing subtle changes so chords evolve from one to another without obvious punctuation in the sound.

	118187 : ["JulieTravelCaster above has some good suggestions and comments.  Here are a few additional ideas and considerations that I would add... First and foremost, when are you planning on going?  Memorial Day to Labor Day is peak tourist season at the canyon and you will be hard pressed to get reservations at rim side lodges if you are planning on going within the next week or two.  This is especially important if you are planning on going to the North Rim as there is only one lodge there and not a lot of other options for some distance (the South Rim has a number of hotels just outside the park gates at Tusayan).   Any camping inside the canyon requires a backcountry permit and these can be reserved 4 months in advance and fill up quickly.  They do save a few permits each day for walk-ups at the Backcountry office on a first come, first serve basis.  These permits are given for the following day and you had better be in line at the backcountry office well before it opens if you want a shot. The only other way to spend a night in the canyon is to stay at Phantom Ranch at the bottom where they have a few cabins and dorms in addition to the backpacker campground, but Phantom Ranch allows reservations over a year in advance and fills up quick. Reservations and permits aside, in summer, I greatly prefer the North Rim to South Rim (even though it is a much further drive for me in Phx - about the same distance either way from LV).  The South Rim is a 1000 feet higher in elevation which makes it much cooler.  It is also less crowded and more peaceful, while the South Rim is a zoo with long lines at the gate, limited parking and crowds at all the major overlooks.  If you can get a room there (or maybe at nearby Jacob Lake), I would recommend the North Rim.  Views from the North and South rim are very different, but as the poster above notes they are both incredible and it would be hard to rate one rim over the other. The other consideration with visiting in summer is that temperatures get hotter as you go deeper into the canyon until you reach scorching Phoenix-like temps near the river at the bottom (110 degree plus).  You do not want to be hiking to the bottom (or camping at the bottom) in summer. That being said, I definitely agree that you should try to get down into the canyon a ways, because it is a much different (and in my opinion more rewarding) experience than staying on the rim.  The short hike down South Kaibab to Cedar Ridge is my personal favorite on the South Rim, but you can also do short day hikes on the North Rim too.  Going down the North Kaibab to the Supai Tunnel (1.8 miles) is nice or (if the weather is not too hot and you are an experienced hiker) going the beautiful Roaring Springs (5 miles one way).  Another nice little North Rim day hike is to go down the North Bass trail to Muav saddle where there is an old cabin and a pretty little spring (although it requires some driving on dirt forest service roads to reach the trailhead at Swamp Point). If you want to shoot for a walk-in backpacking permit, you could try staying one night at Indian Gardens campground on the Bright Angel trail (South Rim) which is about half way down on the Tonto Plateau and quite a bit cooler than the bottom (it also has drinking water, trees and a stream).  It is also a fairly easy backpack trip for the canyon (4.6 miles one way). On the North Rim, you could try going out on the Powell Plateau (a forested mesa above Muav Saddle) which is a nice summer backpack with spectacular views, but requires you to carry in all your own water and do some basic route finding. Given the time of year and your limited time, I would recommend trying to get a room at the North Rim and just doing some little day hikes and taking in the view from the rim and then planning a longer GC trip (with overnight camping) for a cooler season when you have time to prepare and get reservations.   Also, as the poster above notes, Zion is a great place in summer, has many excellent day hike of various difficulty and is a shorter drive from LV. Finally, as a different poster notes, I would definitely NOT recommend the glass SkyWalk and 'Grand Canyon West' area (which is NOT part of the National Park) even though it is closer to Las Vegas.  It is expensive, the scenery is less grand, you can't do any hiking there, and many visitors to it (myself included) consider it something of a tourist trap.", 10533, "AA11523701", 2],
