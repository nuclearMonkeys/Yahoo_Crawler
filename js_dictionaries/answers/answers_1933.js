	102390 : ["People are rude for four reasons: 1. They are too afraid of confrontation to tell you that you are annoying or pissing them off, so they hope that if they are rude, you'll just go away. 2. They have poor social skills, and either don't know they're being rude, or don't know how to stop. 3. You caught them at a bad time for them personally, and they are taking it out on you. 4. Rudeness is a defense mechanism. If you live in an area where homophobia tends to be pronounced, or if your neighborhood simply has the appearance of being very traditional (nuclear families, stay-at-home moms, 2-3 children per household) , there's a possibility that someone who is openly gay may feel unwelcome or discriminated against (whether or not this is actually true), and employ reason #4. That's the only reason I can think of for these women's sexuality to factor in to the situation. Regardless, my advice is to ignore them when you can and kill them with kindness when you can't. Hopefully, they'll follow your example.", 9810, "hYVu6ZlHaa", 2],
