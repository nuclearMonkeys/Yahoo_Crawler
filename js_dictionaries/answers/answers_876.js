	48644 : ["Short answer: Genetics. This is presuming that the girl has done nothing to herself to change herself cosmetically (hair dye etc). Black/brown eye colour come from having dominant genes. Blue/green eye colour comes from having both recessive genes. If the person had both a dominant and a  recessive gene then the dominant gene would be the gene expressed. Green eye colour is more rare as a recessive gene than blue. If you see an individual with black skin and light coloured hair, or black skin and light coloured eyes (presuming no contacts etc) then it's due to a genetic mutation that's expressed a recessive gene that would not normally be expressed. The gene expressed for the hair colour is completely separate to the gene expressed for any other body feature, such as hair.  It could also be that the type of hair that the family has is the type that lightens over time due to UV exposure, such as those individuals that start the summer with darker hair, spend time in the sun, then end the summer with natural highlights or lightened hair.", 6860, "AA12049356", 0],
