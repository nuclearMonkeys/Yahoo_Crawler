	30806 : [" • \"Why does a dog on a 50-yard leash runs straight to the end of it and bark and bark some more.\" There are 2 parts to that incorrectly punctuated question. Q1: Why does it run to the end of the tether?         Presumably because it saw YOU and regarded you as an intruder. Q2: Why does it bark & bark?        The probabilities are:    (a) It is loyally telling its owner that you - an intruder - are there.    (b) It is WARNING you to come no closer.    (c) It is nervous and wants its owner to come and PROTECT it from you. You've told us NOTHING about this pooch's character, so we cannot guess which of that trio is strongest. • \"Have you ever noticed whenever you have a fenced in yard miles long or put your dog on a really long leash that dog either runs right to the end of the leash and barks and barks or runs to the end of the fence and runs back and forth snarling at you❓\" AGAIN you didn't end your QUESTION with a question-mark. So I put it. 🔹1: I have NEVER had a yard that is miles long. Most properties in my nation are on a ¼-acre section. I did, for about a year while waiting for a city house I could afford to buy, rent an ancient mansion on a property that was on at least 4 acres. The old stables behind the house were leased by a car-painter. The front paddock was leased by a horse owner. 🔸2: I never competed in Tracking Tests, so never put a dog on a really long leash. 🔹3: I was given my first pup in 1950 or '51. There was no distemper vaccine available where we lived, so he died in a bit less than 2 weeks. A year later I was given another pup. He was vaccinated, but neither of my parents had had a pup, and we were living 40 miles (the route going through a one-way tunnel near the top of Mt. Messenger) from the only city in that province. During the milking season both my parents worked in the local dairy factory so couldn't drive me there. As I wasn't yet a teenager I couldn't drive myself, so I had to work our for myself what worked & didn't work when training \"Pal2\". I then spent 14 years at boarding school > at teachers' college & university > as a foot loose teacher at 1 city & 3 rural schools before getting married and my bride demanding a GSD (German Shepherd Dog) as her \"bride price\". Luckily \"Caesar\" was a VERY trainable GSD, and I learnt more despite having no mentor. We then moved into the city (where we rented the mansion until we bought our first house) andjoined the city's dog training club - where I learnt MORE. At the end of that year I was invited to be the instructor of the club's \"new owners\" class. Caesar WAS tethered at the mansion, but he was NOT a barker. Since then, my dogs have had a PEN each, and only one was a barker. Because my wife & I were both wage-slaves at the time, the barker had to be de-barked. Thereafter SHE thought she was barking - but no neighbour heard any barks. 🔸4: After I retired I did Market Research. There were 3 dogs that bit me. 2 were cowardly Toy dogs that backed away from me when I entered the property, cowered against its mistress while I conducted the research, then grabbed my hamstring as I turned away to leave. The other was a Boxer or Boxer-cross out on the public footpath that calmly walked towards me as I walked towards it, then it grabbed my calf as we passed each other. 🔹5: I can remember bits of about 77 of my 80 years. I can't remember a dog EVER snarling at me. When I was about 12 I went to pat a Labrador Retriever type of dog that was tethered outside the pub Dad was having a booze in.The dog grabbed my hand, gently heldit a moment, then released me. I deduced that he was a pig-hunting dog and had a tender spot where I had touched him. During 2 of his trips (1769-70, 1773 and 1777) to New Zealand, Captain James Cook released English pigs into our mostly-tree-covered land, and they THRIVED! If you DO frequently come across dogs that \"run back and forth snarling at you\", I suggest that either: ☻1: You live in a VERY undesirable neighbourhood where occupants tether dogs to guard the house's doors. (Maybe the humans are drug traffickers who rely on their dogs delaying the police long enough for all the evidence to be flushed away.... Is it time for you to move out?) or ☻2: You stupidly stand STARING at the dog instead of calmly walking past, or you stupidly TAUNT the dog by such as jumping up & down, opening & closing the gate, swearing at the dog (dogs learn few words - but they sure do understand the TONE of human voices). 🐕‍🦺Those readers who own (or are owned by!) a 🐕‍🦺GSD are invited to read: then join it.

	30807 : ["50 foot is no longer a leash.  You must be using a cable, rope, lunge cord, chain or something else.  This is giving the dog enough rope to hang itself.  If your yard is fenced why do you have the dog tied up?  Here it is illegal to tie out, stake out, chain up, hobble any animal.  There is no logical reason to do this.  If it is due to the lack of training, train your dog.  If you were tied up, you'd run to the end & scream for help.", 4723, "18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa", 0],

I personally do once the dog is mature and maturity depends on the dog, you 'know' it has matured if it has had a season, but I would get it done just before that first season it is better long term healthwise.... you trust the vet you use or you don't, you ask them questions and  you challenge their thinking/beleiving... vets are people, they are not the be all and end all for advice, many are dog owners themselves and they don't do for their own dogs what they recommend to clients .... and I say that as two of my long term friends are vets", 4724, "afcLu9YMaa", 1],
