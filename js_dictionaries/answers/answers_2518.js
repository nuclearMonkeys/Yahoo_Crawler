	131720 : ["We've had the same problem.  I agree with the answers about making sure your son isn't overtired (try putting him to bed earlier or lengthening his nap), and the answers about waking him a little before he usually has the night terror.  If that fails and he has one anyway, we've found that the night terror episode is shorter if we keep everything very quiet and dark.  Since I can't stand feeling helpless, I'll often very quietly sing a song or recite \"goodnight moon\", but honestly I'm not sure if it makes a difference other than making me feel like I'm doing something.  For awhile we were trying to move him into a different room, get him a drink, etc., but that's just hopeless since he's not even really awake and doesn't process what's going on -- and it just delays him calming back down and falling into more restful sleep. Do remember that though it's terribly stressful for you, he won't remember a night terror in the morning.  It's different from a bad dream; it's not during REM sleep and he really won't remember it in the morning.  Also, don't be alarmed by the post about abuse.  Plenty of kids have night terrors without having had anything traumatic happen.  He'll grow out of them eventually.", 11110, "1WGP0Tpeaa", 0],
	131721 : ["This is so hard, and I totally understand where you are coming from.  My daughter had something similar but not on that scale; however a neighbor's child used to set off their burgular alarm with her high pitched screams from night terrors!!    I hope these tips will help you: Make sure he does not eat dinner too close to bedtime.  Let him have at least two hours between food and sleep. Make sure he's got a very regular bedtime every night, and stick to that very carefully no matter what.  Do not let him get over-tired for any reason!    Warm milk at night will help him sleep deeper because of the tryptophan in it when you warm it up.  You can warm it and give it to him in a cup or bottle - make it chocolate or some other flavor if it helps him drink it down!  It takes about 30 minutes to get into the system and help out.  I know all the lectures about the teeth, but at this point that's the least of your issues. Benadrill used to make my daughter sleep really hard and in your case, I'd give him one small dose of it and just try it and see if it will make him sleep or not.  Some kids are more hyper on it, but most will sleep and sleep hard.    Best of luck to you!  Let me know how your doing!  Hang in there, it will get better, I promise it will, and some day, it will be only a memory.", 11110, "None", 0],

	131726 : ["Yes it's true,  20 year's ago we had a dog named Bingo who was a shepperd mix for 9 years.  One day my mother had let Bingo out in the yard & someone left the gate open.  Bingo got out. I ran out looking for her for days & called all shelters etc. Heartbroken not knowing where she was w/signs up everywhere. We went to the anti cruelty society looking,  There was one little black & white puppy there that I found adorable & was playing w/it.  My mother was distraught & we went home.  3 & a half weeks later...  I was asleep and dreaming that Bingo came in to my room to say goodby & licked me on my arm. She looked younger then her 9 years? I woke up w/my heart beating fast but still felt that kiss on my arm. I knew that Bingo was never coming home.  It felt empty in the house without her & my mother never went in to that bedroom where Bingo always slept. Keeping the door shut.  I knew it was time for a new dog & started looking in the paper.  My mother asked to get another shepperd that looked like Bingo at the anti cruelty society that she saw. So I went back there to find it.  Unfortunatley that puppy was not up for adoption yet & was not in the adoption room?  I thought I would have to go home w/no playful pup!  I asked where is the adoption room?  They showed me & walked around looking at all the frisky pups until I saw this cute frightened young boarder collie/shepard mix that looked up @ me & yipped.  The guard came over & wanted to tell me about the other puppy.  When I asked him about this one.  He told me she was brought in a month ago (same time when Bingo was lost) & was just spaded a few days ago for adoption.  OMG This was the pup I was playing with when we were here for Bingo?   It was fate & adopted Tasha right then & there, 13 years Tasha lived & was a wonderful loving dog!  But it was fate we got her. Now we have Rambo But thats another story! :)  ************************** Added extra about the answer below me about the bond being so strong that the universe will send your deceased puppy being so strong that it may come back as a new puppy for you?  When Tasha died at 13? It was so heartbreaking I said No more dogs. (I did not want to feel that pain again.) 3 years after her death my daughter & I were going to the store for grocerys & found this golden puppy at 8 weeks old on the street in front of a house loose.  Sitting on the grass (Like waiting?) My daughter picked him up & I asked the people in the house if that was their puppy?  They said yes but they have to move & their new landlord wants no pets.  SO YOU THROW HIM ON THE STREET? I yelled!  My daughter was holding the puppy & looked at me like oh oh! I was thinking oh oh too?  I went & picked up the puppy and saw he had Tasha's Collie eyes. (the other half golden retriever.) That was it I fell in love.   (Many times I wondered If that Tasha saw we never got another dog? and wanted to come back to us?  Many things Rambo does reminds me of her. It might be a possibility?  I do believe it is so!", 11109, "0Hk9QCltaa", 0],

Not only that, but if the bond between you is still strong, you can ask the universe that the spirit of the dog that you had be reincarnated into a dog that you are about to get.

Anyway you need to be able to hold your breath so try that on land and then put your head in the water and try it in there, hold your breath for maybe 4 secs. then come out and try it again. If you can't do that, try first pinching your nose together so water can't enter and just hold your breath int he water. Can you do that? Good. Anyway, now you need to be able to use your arms, just kind of kick the water, like you're an egg beater and move your arms, you should be able to get the dog paddle then. If you want to learn the strokes the following links should help: and you can search for the other strokes. It's okay if you can't swim, my aunt who's 57 can't swim either. And I have a friend who's 15 and also can't swim so don't worry, you're not alone, however it would always be nice to know how to.

Things in the dark seem much scarier than in daylight to anybody.    If he has any older siblings tell them, to not tell him anything scary. Younger kids beleive things they hear.    Try to remove clocks at night. They kept me up all night as a child.     As I said, kids believe in everything they hear. Give your son a small teddy or something comforting. Tell him, the item is a protector and keeps him safe all the time.      Have a nature CD?

	131746 : ["Our youngest daughter had night terrors beginning just before she turned 2 and lasted until she was 6.  Screaming is just one of the things common to night terrors.  Children who suffer from night terrors will often appear awake, but will not respond to you when you speak to them.  Sometimes they look around in panic at something unseen to you.  Some children will try to get out of bed.  There is nothing you can really do for a child suffering a night terror.  For our daughter, she would have her episodes in the middle of the night.  Blood curdling screams followed by loud crying would jolt us all from a sound sleep.  After many episodes of trying to talk to her and calm her, we eventually learned to go to her bed, sit beside her, hold her if she would let us, speak calmly and quietly to her, telling her it was OK, mom and dad were there now.  It would take between 5-30 minutes until she calmed enough for us to help her lay back down.  Then we'd stay with her, rub her hair and her back until her breathing returned to normal.  As she got older and more verbal, we'd ask her about her \"bad dream\", but she never remembered being up in the night.  She also had nightmares which were considerably different.  With nightmares she would wake with the same blood curdling scream, but when we went to her, she would grab us, cry in a different way, talk about her fears, and be able to remember the next morning that she had a bad dream.  She is the youngest of our 4 kids and was born when her siblings were 18, 15, and 12 (long story - conceived unexpectedly when I had been taking birth control pills for 11 years!).  None of our older kids had night terrors and the instances of nightmares were infrequent for them.  We spoke several times with her doctor, especially at times when the night terror episodes seemed to increase.  Apparently most kids outgrow them by about age 6 and our daughter did.  Whether is was what was need to make them stop or she just naturally stopped, when we moved her to another bedroom she never had another night terror again.  She is 10 now and is prone to nightmares, still, but generally foregoes the screaming and just shows up in our room and comes into our bed.", 11110, "AA10624857", 1],

Not only would this type of literature be informational to you and your brother, but it can even help you both understand the deeper meaning behind your special dream visitor. Try looking into dreams and their meanings before you read too far into anyone else's opinions or advice.

You see, a dream is usually a fragment of memory or something that you've been thinking about a lot. In this case, you've been worrying about your dog and sad that your pet is gone. (I don't blame you!) Therefore, it would make sense to reason that you would dream of your dog as she is now in \"Doggy Heaven\" as my parents used to tell me in my younger years. So yes, I do believe your pets can visit you in your dream. In fact, I have had several dreams about a hamster and guinea pig I had even though it has been several years since I had them, since they died.

	131754 : ["You should really use quotation marks to distinguish what is your question and what is the guy's remarks. So I address this at the subject of the preaching: Bear this in mind, all of us sin, all of have broken at least one of the Ten Commandments. This was why Jesus said: Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. That was in defense of a prostitute working on the Sabbath which biblically is a greater sin than homosexuality. Paedophiles rape and manipulate children so it is a lot different from Homosexuality, unless the gay person in question rapes and manipulates. Gay men are born that way, is it so terribly wrong? Why does it concern you so much? Should you be paying more attention to your own actions rather than concentrating on the actions of others I guess the thing which is most important is to understand that the only place we can fight sin and Evil is inside ourselves. Until I am without sin, I can't judge others. I can try to help them but they may not want my help. True Evil is only destructive and cruel but provides little satisfaction and usually only to the ego.  On that basis I don't believe homosexuality is evil. It may be a sin like any kind of gratuitous sex. But again, God invented our reproductive methods and desires - Do people think that God just didn't realise that homosexuality would occur? I don't believe in church weddings for gay couples but I think civil partnerships are a good idea. I wouldn't encourage homosexuality but I consider it much less sinful than making war with other countries. I'm speaking as an ex-infantry soldier. I don't believe any human should turn other people away from God. I don't have an issue with Gay men, it's their life. God may not like it but that's between God and them. Gay men know what religion says about homosexuality. What I've found is that people hate most in others what they see and hate in themselves. However, I don't know of any quote in the Bible condemning unrelated women from having sex. So lesbians, chill out about God. Life is difficult and full of very painful choices, i'm having a real tough time at the moment fighting temptation....it's nothing to do with sex! Our difficult choices are what make us what we are.

This is thought to interrupt or alter the sleep cycle and prevent night terrors from occuring.

These kids will usually also be sweating, breathing fast and have a rapid heart rate (autonomic signs).
