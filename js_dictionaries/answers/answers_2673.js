In any case, a bankruptcy won't plague you any more than what your credit report looks like right now with a bunch of chargeoffs on it. I don't know what you're doing while living abroad but if you're still a student you ought to figure out what you want to do for a living and start doing it, whether abroad or wherever you're at and start behaving like a responsible, tax paying citizen instead of dodging your responsibilities. Having said all that the banks are to a degree responsible for your situation by loaning you the money in the first place. If they gave a rat's rear end about how they invested that $20,000 of their depositors money (they invested it in you, a bad investment) they never would have issued the card to a student. So, they took a real high and bad risk. The only way the Banks will change their lending habits is if about a million guys like you all file bankruptcy at the same time. It would send a message, not about bankruptcy but about lending and borrowing. Start earning a living and paying cash.

After it is gone open up a few department store cards ( they give credit to almost anyone) and slowly build your credit that way. If you do not file bankruptcy before you are forced to go to Litigation then you will be in even more trouble. You can have a judgment put against you that will not only garnish your wages now, but anything in the future. If you where to purchase a home years down the road ( or even inherit one) it could have a lien put against it. Do yourself a favor and file. You can also put a statement on your credit report about why your had to file, like no employment or medical reasons, etc. Best of luck and I hope I was able to help some.", 11429, "HYIR33G1aa", -1],

What you need to do is contact a local qualified attorney and bring all of your paperwork (bills, last 4 yrs taxes, pay stubs for last 6 months), and see if you can get in to see an attorney that will see you for a free consultation. Call a few in your phonebook and tell them what you are needing to discuss. While the attorneys can send you demands and tell you they are going to sue, yes, they can and will, bankruptcy will stop them dead in their tracks. I don't advise it, but with the debt you have and the part time income, you have no means to pay this back. If nothing is done, you will be sued, garnished and this won't stop until you don't have a dime. Once you find an attorney, they will work with you to give you options on what to pay and not pay so you can at least pay the retainer fee they are going to want in full to file your bankruptcy.

Based upon what you wrote, it sounds like Chapter 7 might be your best bet...However, one option is to use this as a tactic for dealing with your creditors. If they are going to threaten litigation then you can threaten filing for BK....You might be able to get a substantial settlement of this $4K debt...i.e....$700...for example....Be forewarned that they might respond to this by serving you a summons and taking you to court....In this case you should probably file. If it's just this one creditor coming after you, try to get a settlement deal. Be sure to get all terms in writing prior to paying. Never give a debt collector direct access to your bank account.  If you have multiple creditors threatening litigation, you should probably file for Chapter 7. FYI: If you file for Chapter 7.....make sure that you and your dependents are fully covered with health insurance.

	139503 : ["Fear manifests itself in many forms. At its mildest, it appears as just a mild form of uneasy or discomfort, a feeling that something is not quite right. At its worse, fear can kill. In between these two extremes are found all types of fear - anger, frustrations, rage and just about any negative emotions. In fact, all negative emotions have their roots in fear. Another way of saying this is that fear is the mother of all negativity in us. However, despite the many forms of fear, it can be gathered into 3 main fears: 1. Fear of insecurity 2. Fear of loneliness 3. Fear of loss Fear of insecurity : manifests out of a need for safety. When our safety or security is threatened, this fear arises. Safety here refers not only to physical safety but also emotional and mental safety. Loneliness                                                                                                        This fear includes also the fear of separation and arises out of our need to be accepted and included.  Fear of Loss This fear arises out of our need to hold on. We fear loss of our life, our property, our family, our money, our reputation, our fame, our freedom, and just about anything you can think of. We cling on to things we like and run away from things we don't. This fear of loss is the fear of loosing everything we considered dear and near to us.", 11431, "xXs9Xuheaa", 0],
