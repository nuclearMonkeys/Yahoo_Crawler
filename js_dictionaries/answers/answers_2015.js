In August 2010 the court held that to be unconstitutional.  On 15 June 2011 the San Francisco court upheld that decision because it violates the constitutional rights of citizens.  On 7 February 2012 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck the California law again finding that the California state constitution banning same-sex marriage violated principles of due process and equal protection under the law. The court found that the ban violates equality laws to target a minority group and withdraw a right that it possessed, without a legitimate reason for doing so.  Proposition 8 serves no purpose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians in California.  The constitution simply does not allow for laws of this sort. It is now awaiting the Supreme Court verdict  which is expected to uphold the early court decision.

Pray this prayer out loud and mean it:  God, I recognize that I have not lived my life for You up until now. I have been living for myself and that is wrong. I need You in my life; I want You in my life. I acknowledge the completed work of Your Son Jesus Christ in giving His life for me on the cross at Calvary, and I long to receive the forgiveness you have made freely available to me through this sacrifice. Come into my life now, Lord. Take up residence in my heart and be my king, my Lord, and my Savior. From this day forward, I will no longer be controlled by sin, or the desire to please myself, but I will follow You all the days of my life. Those days are in Your hands. I ask this in Jesus' precious and holy name. Amen.\" You do not have to beg God to forgive you. All you have to do is pray to Him in the name of Jesus and believe that when you repent and say you are sorry for backsliding and living in sin that it is the truth and that you will stop doing those things. Move out of where you are living and find another place to live. Get back to church and do not hesitate get there. The devil will torment you if you do not get to church and he will have a perfect right since you are saved now. Do your best to find a church that teaches the whole word of God and moves in the gifts like a pentecostal church of full gospel. You have wrong bad thoughts coming into your mind because you have not been taught what to do with those thoughts plus your mouth says all the wrong things so now I want you to start confessing out loud the Faith Scriptures that are on this site. Print them out and put them around your apt. on the mirror and on the cupboards wherever you will see them and confess them always out loud because Faith comes by Hearing and hearing by the word of God. You can put some on the fridge too.   You are gonna remind the devil that you belong to the Lord Jesus. So when you start to feel depressed or like you feel that God did not forgive you remind yourself that when we repent the Lord God not only forgives us but He forgets that we did it. Psalm 103 says that As far as the East is from the West He will not remember your sin.  Rest in that. You are going to learn to take captive your wrong thoughts to the obedience of Christ. 2 Corinthians 10:5 (King James Version)  5Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; Each time you feel sad or you feel like you cannot make it start confessing the scriptures on faith from the above site. And say this too:  No you don't Satan I will not act on those thoughts, or mental images you are giving me to tempt me I belong to Jesus and you cannot have me.  Greater is He that is in me then he that is in the world. I have the mind of Christ and hold the thoughts, feelings and purposes of his heart. Man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the Word of God.  Greater is He that is in me then he that is in the world.  Jesus died for me because He loves me. I forgive my parents for all that they have said to me or about me they do not know what they are saying.  Jesus loves me this I know for the bible tells me so.  I am a blessing , I am necessary, I am loved by God and my parents.  The word of God says to call things that be not as though they were.

Himself (Jesus) bore my sins and sicknesses on the tree of Calvary and by His stripes I was healed. 1 Peter 2:24   I have the mind of Christ and hold the thoughts, feelings and purposes of His heart. I belong to Jesus. I plead the blood against these temptations and they have to go now in Jesus name.  Now that is what you will say each time you get the idea, the thoughts the temptation to obey the flesh rather then the what you do not want to do.  You see the devil is ruling over your mind and you need to take this control off of you and the only way is to tell him no and confess the scriptures from the bible.

If you are doing things that are harmful to yourself and others, consider not doing that. If you don't think they are harmful, think about why. There are no religions that know everything and are 100% correct, although certainly God is real. To explore reality in a different sense, go to   and read quite a few Near Death Experiences. It could change your understanding of religion.  You know, when you are brought up in a certain religion from the time you are little, you accept as true EVERYTHING, the harmful and the good. When you grow up, you must start thinking about this and sorting things out. You have an inherent sense of whether you are hurting anyone, so follow that.", 9960, "BC97yskSaa", 0],
	106548 : ["Realize that your own mind is at odds with God. This is true for every living person on the planet. Theologians say that every person has a three-fold enemy that fights to break us free from faith. That three-fold enemy is the world, the flesh, and the Devil. The philosophy of the world will always deride faith as superstitious, archaic, worthless, etc. Our flesh will always lead us to seek pleasure for ourselves instead of denying those lusts and trying to remain pure of mind, body and spirit. The Devil is the accuser. He will plant thoughts in our mind and he will distract us with any possible thing to shake us from following after the example of Jesus. He will tell us that we are not good enough and don't deserve salvation. Jesus said don't trust feelings or emotions, they can lead us astray. Trust God's word. Pick up a bible, or read one of many bibles available online. Start with the book of John and ask God to help you see with His eyes, and be filled with His Spirit. The Holy Spirit will comfort you and help you. But like I said, don't feel let down if you don't have some out of the ordinary rush of euphoria or elevated consciousness. God's voice is still, small and humble. Trust Him day by day, and He will direct your paths and enlighten your eyes.  Take care, my friend...and God bless you.", 9960, "None", 0],

Walking in faith means to let him do the things he says he will do. We just do our part, love our neighbors, and trust that he will take care of the rest. 22And He said to His disciples, “For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your life, as to what you will eat; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. 23“For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. 24“Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap; they have no storeroom nor barn, and yet God feeds them; how much more valuable you are than the birds! 25“And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life's span? 26“If then you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about other matters? 27“Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. 28“But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you? You men of little faith! 29“And do not seek what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not keep worrying. 30“For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; but your Father knows that you need these things. 31“But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you. 32“Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
