But then you start watching your moves because you know that she is going to tell her friend. WRONG. DON'T DO THAT. First of all: she tells her friend every little detail, not just the basics so don't believe that. Don't worry there is a solution that I discovered: Get really friendly with her best friend so that you can find out about what your girl likes and dislikes about you. Then use your girl's bestfriend to convince your girl to do other stuff (like go on a specific date scenario or some other...physical things). Once you can get close to her bestfriend everything is solid", 10968, "None", 0],

	128216 : ["Hmm. I take it from the spelling of coeliac that you are not in the US. (Celiac is how its spelled here in America usually). I really dont see why gluten free bread would be causing you heartburn. Are you sure you are not getting it from something else? Do you have other problems liek acid reflux?  I personally like Kinninnick's Frozen bread (again this is in the US). I find it to be the closest to regular bread. I dont eat it plain, it comes frozen, so I use it for toast, grilled cheese, french toast, etc. Glutino also makes breads that arrive at room temp but then are to be frozen. I liked their raisin bread. Both are available on line. REmember when shipping something frozen it often costs a lot bc they are havint to ship it frozen and  they ship the frozen container the same size no matter if u buy one loaf or 20. So if u can afford it, buy in bulk and store. But Glutino does ship their bread at room temp.  If u are having continued heartburn I'd seek the advice of the doctor who diagnosed you with CD. If you were not officially diagnosed, I'd seek out a good GI doc who understands CD and get a proper diagnosis bc perhaps you dont really have CD at all, perhaps you have something else? I do believe Tums, Mylanta and other heartburn meds are GF. U dont mention your age, sex or what not. If u are a woman whos pregnant, heartburn is kinda par for the course--just wait it out. Best of luck to you and send me a message if I can be of any further assistance. Amy Chairperson Louisiana NOrth Shore Celiac Sprue Association Chapter 125", 10973, "kD1aAc3saa", 0],
