It is what you plan to do when you meet them that is the important question. If you see a girl that you think is pretty it doesn't hurt just to go up and say hi. If she smiles and says hi back then just ask her her name. Don't try those corny pick up lines that were written by guys who are still single. Just be yourself and you will find the right person.  And no, it is not a problem to ask a clerk at the store. She would like the fact that a nice guy was interested in her while wearing work clothes.", 8621, "32a92213f5549648470aefc0aef2bf5baa", 1],
