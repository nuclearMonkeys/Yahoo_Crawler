	103514 : ["Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to 4 million illegal immigrants In 1986. Why the outrage if it happens again? 1. Because we want the border secured first before we talk about amnesty. 2. In 1986 we had only 4 million illegals. Today we have anywhere from 12 to 20 million illegals. 3. It's about race on  both sides. The democrats politically need it and the republicans can't politically afford it. In 1986  America was overwhelmingly white so the republicans felt they could afford  to grant amnesty to 4 million illegal Mexican immigrants  who they believed would then vote for republicans for this gift  given to  them. The democrats at the time, like the republicans of today, where strongly against granting amnesty to 4 million illegals because the democrats knew that most white Americans  didn't support it, so the democrats sided with white America for political reason in what they believed would help the democratic party. Today with  the racial demographic makeup of America not being quite the same as it was back in1986  where white people now find themselves becoming a minority in America, the republicans know they can't afford to  allow  12 to 20 million illegal Mexicans be granted amnesty because most will vote for the democratic party.   The democrats today, unlike back in 1986, don't need to rely on white people anymore or  need to worry about what white people think to win votes. The democrats now have a growing minority  population  on their side who they   rely heavily on to win votes and to help empower   their very liberal  political agenda for America  that a white majority America has rejected. The democrats will  do whatever it takes to keep minorities on their side. Sadly, it usually involves playing the race card for everything it's worth.   As long as nonwhites believe all republicans are racist, they will never vote for them which is what the left wants.", 9846, "dRZHxhNIaa", -1],

	103528 : ["Back when the country was born, the entire US Army consisted of one battery of artillery.  They kept one battery of artillery because artillery was too time consuming to train where infantry and cavalry could be conscripted out of mainly farmers at the time. Then the Creek Indians attacked.  Congress conscripted an army together and sent it to fight the Creeks.  The conscripts quickly ran leaving the artillery battery alone.  All of the officers and all but 33 men of the battery were killed.  This happened while a lot of the Founding Fathers were still alive.   From that point on, it was decided that a standing professional military was needed and that conscripts alone could not be relied upon.   Today that is even more true since even the most ready National Guard units still take weeks to get ready and a lot of national issues need to be settled in less time then that.   The same thing happened with the Navy.  The Navy was disbanded and congress figured we could just commission private ships in time of war.  Then the French began raiding our ships in the 1790s.  So a full time Navy was created to protect our ships. As for funding.  Our budget process is less then two year each time.

If they did that again, the public would be outraged. Immigration reform will only work if there are strict sanctions against employers that hire illegals.
