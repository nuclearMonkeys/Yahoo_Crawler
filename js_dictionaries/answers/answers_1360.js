I fear that when faced with a man whom he could not fell with that tremendous right hand he would crumble. Louis' superior speed and boxing skill saw him wipe Baer all over the floor and I think once Jeffries had walked through a couple of right hands he'd start mauling and slugging at Baer who was pretty easy to find. Baer was almost always the stronger man in the ring but I think Jeffries would equal and better him in this department. Jeffries may not have had the explosive speed and accuracy of Louis, but he was plenty heavy haded enough to wear down and KO Baer, and I believe he would in round 10.

The following year Oswald became interested in politics. He read books written by Karl Marx and told friends that he was a Marxist. He also joined the Young People's Socialist League. He later told a friend that his involvement in politics dated back to reading a pamphlet about the execution of Ethel Rosenberg and Julius Rosenberg.  Oswald left school at sixteen and the following year joined the U.S. Marines. After basic training Oswald qualified as an Aviation Electronics Operator and in 1957 was posted to the Atsugi Air Base in Japan.

	73617 : ["Hello sir and with all due respect to Bernard Hopkins and his great skills, boxing technique, defensive abilities and marvelous career, he never saw anything like Stanley Ketchel! I know that there are probably a few here on this forum who would disagree with me but I'm telling you Ketchel lived a very hard life as a hobo and a bouncer. A movie should be done about his life. He was a growling, mean, tough fighter with dynamite in his fists and undeniable stamina and aggressiveness. At one time before Robinson came along he was widely considered the best middleweight who ever lived and I would still rank him about #5 all time and would have been a handful for any of the greats because of his strength and endurance. He would have been like a LaMotta with punching power and was a much better fighter than either Gene Fullmer or Carmen Basillio for examples. He completely knocked out Philadelphia Jack O'Brien and won a newspaper decision over the great Sam Langford finishing with a career record of 54-4-4 with 49 kayo's. Bernard Hopkins much like the great Archie Moore has used his great ring experience to beat much younger opponents and has a special ability to adapt to any opponents style. In this fight it would be the boxer Hopkins vs the slugger Ketchel and who could impose their style on who. I just believe that Ketchel would have came right after Hopkins and worked his way inside and would not have been denied using his superior strength. Hopkins would have landed some good counter shots and fought well from the outside and would win some rounds but in the Championship rounds particularly 12-15 Ketchel would have dominated Hopkins down the stretch.

With all due respect your question however valid is nothing more than a distraction from what is important today. We've got an economy that is rapidly going into the tubes. And a government who is throwing money down a rat hole faster than any other on record.  Questions like was the US government involved in the JFK assasination? Why were AIG execs given bonuses? Who said they could be given bonuses? Or what did Obama mean when he bowled like a retard? Are red herrings. Look as what has happened in just the past few months. $700B for TARP. $787B for Stimulus. Money we really don't have to spend. And a proposed budget that will be according to the Congressional Budget Office will be $2 TRILLION dollars short. CBO also predicts an increase in the debt by approximately $10 TRILLION dollars. The uproar on the hill over the AIG bonuses proves beyond a shadow of a doubt one thing.

	73644 : ["At Jones Jr's middleweight prime, only Harry Greb and the Shotgun, for me, would have a legitimate chance of beating him. I think for me the key to beating Roy Jones is to have a titanium chin to absorb Jone's blindingly fast and sneaky attacks and stamina to maintain a high workrate especially at later rounds to punish Jones once he inevitably slows down. Both men have both tools. Greb was the middleweight version of Henry Armstrong. He just doesnt stop punching. He would walk through a barrage of punches with his chin and unleash a barrage of his own. Roy would be playing defense all night. Jones could backpedal, dodge, bob and weave to safety (never considered Roy as good in blocking with his arms and gloves) but the accumulated punches he would receive, weak it may be, and the stamina drain of back-pedaling would make it difficult for him to potshot an Energizer bunny like Greb in the later rounds. Roy Jones have a chance in beating Harry Greb but i just see the Pittsburgh Windmill winning more times by just a little bit. Carlos Monzon for me, would be, stylistically and physically, the best equipped fighter to beat the athletic freak that is Roy Jones. Monzon has this stiff, long and accurate jab - arguably the best jab in middleweight history and comparable to Larry Holmes' - that he could use to score and punish Jones at any point of their fight. Good jabs are the bane of fighters who rely on footspeed and reflexes (see Norton vs Ali) for their defense. Remember Monzon has a longer reach than Roy. It would be very difficult for Jones to attack or counter Monzon properly with such a dangerous object almost always on or near his face. And even if he did he would still have to watch out for Monzon's equally powerful right cross. And even if he did land an attack, it would take a lot to hurt Monzon as he is one tough SOB. Also, Monzon likes to bait his opponents for a counterpunch. This would make Jones extra cautious for his own good. The way i see this fight, Roy's blitzing attacks would be held at bay by Monzon's jab. While he may hurt Monzon in spurts, he takes more sustained punishment from the Shotgun.

He managed to get Congress to enact some of Kennedy's proposals (including the 1964 Civil Rights Act and a tax cut). He ignored Vietnam at first until the Gulf of Tonkin incident, but even then he avoided doing anything drastic. Once he got reelected by a wide margin, he could then start running things the way he wanted to without having to think \"What would Kennedy do?\". He was very skilled at persuaded Congress to support his proposals so in that respect was centralized, but a lot of the Great Society proposals ran dry due to the expensive Vietnam War.

	73649 : ["The difference is that conservatives have our Constitution; the democrat party has its Agenda: Democrat President Wilson (1913-1918) presented The Agenda in broad terms, saying “You are not here merely to make a living. You are here to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, and with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world. You impoverish yourself if you forget this errand.”  He may have been the first democrat to realize the value of multiculturalism in deconstructing America, saying, “No nation is fit to sit in judgment upon any other nation.”  Obama put it this way:  \"Every nation is exceptional in its own way.\" Democrat President Roosevelt (1933-1945) articulated The Agenda before Congress on January 11, 1944: “We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights...” which included: -The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation -The right of every family to a decent home -The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health -The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment. The Agenda advanced hugely with LBJ's Great Society.  And Obama's “Hope and Change” amounts to a Great Leap Forward. The Agenda is?  To reconstitute America as a European style welfare state. Most democrats support it: -2/4/10 Gallup poll: 61% of liberals have a positive view of socialism. -6/2/11 Gallup poll: 71% of democrats favor re-distributing wealth. -They are ecstatic that the foundation of all welfare and socialist states, national health care, has been established in America. And they're ready to take the next step: -3/30/12 the blaze:  Vice Pres. Biden as seen on cspan, saying, “We want to create what's called a global minimum tax.” Other democrats are unaware of it because they rely on grossly pro-Agenda biased “news”: Polls on how Americans saw the mainstream media (TV and print) election coverage in 2008: -Rasmussen poll: 69% for Obama, 6% for McCain -Pew Research poll: 67% for Obama, 11% for McCain  -Sacred Heart University poll: 68% for Obama, 9% for McCain -Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll: 67% for Obama, 11% for McCain University of Connecticut's Department of Public Policy survey of journalists, nationwide, during the 2008 election: 52% supported Obama versus 19% for McCain. 8/27/10 The Examiner: “Obama and Democrats got 88% of 2008 contributions by TV network execs, writers, reporters”: Senior executives, on-air personalities, producers, reporters, editors, writers and other self-identifying employees of ABC, CBS and NBC contributed more than $1 million to Democratic candidates and campaign committees in 2008. Democratic total of $1,020,816 was given by 1,160 employees of the three major broadcast television networks, with an average contribution of $880. By contrast, only 193 of the employees contributed to Republican candidates and campaign committees, for a total of $142,863.  True-believer democrats will say and do anything to advance the Agenda.
