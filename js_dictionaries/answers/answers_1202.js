Even if you just installed a tank less water heater for your Business (you know hot water in the bathroom) you would get the full tax reduction and the cost of the parts and installation as tax credits. 3 - get a new tax account that is aware of the tax break, credits and incentives and generalize your incorporation purpose so you can do things that make you qualify for additional tax breaks under your corporate charter. 4 - if you are living hand to mouth with 108 employees maybe you might try cutting back on the self indulgence.", 8300, "2T7AosJ4aa", 1],

Right now the top 1% of earners in the country have control of 33% of the nations wealth.  It was republican policies that created this huge gap.  Meanwhile right now average people are having a hard time putting gas in their vehicles.  John McCain wants to give more money to the rich.   Right now that is not going to help America. I understand your point though, it is valid.  But consider that helping the middle class would allow some to start a business for themselves if they were so inclined.

Many small businesses are registered as sole proprietorships which means an ENTIRE BUSINESS would have to make less than $200,000/year or else it would see Obama's heavy tax burden as well. Obama's tax plan would give mild short-term tax relief to the majority at the expense of American businesses and employers..what good is paying $1,000 less per year in taxes when you've been laid off due to your employer having to find a way to pay an extra $150,000/year?

Also, the middle and lower class spend much more of their paychecks, which goes directly into the economy. If they have more to spend, then you will likely have more customers and improved margins.

Better responsibility with money means you get more of it.  There are only 2 ways to ensure that the government receives more money in order to pay our national debt and help out with social programs - either tax more, or close loopholes that allow people to dodge taxes.  That's it.   3. If your goal is to say that raising taxes at all is a problem, take a look at our economy.  Right now, we're in a financial crisis as a nation, and the only way out of it (apparently) is to pay out a massive sum of money that we barely even have.
