Unlike passive transport, this process requires the expenditure of cellular energy, often in the form of ATP, to move molecules \"uphill\" against a concentration gradient Passive transport means moving biochemicals and other atomic or molecular substances across membranes. Unlike active transport, this process does not involve chemical energy. Passive transport is dependent on the permeability of the cell membrane, which, in turn, is dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. The four main kinds of passive transport are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration and osmosis.", 8563, "None", -1],

This site actually has key logger programs that will recall the username and password you typed in. Once they have your username, password to your email account they will be able to access it and look through your online banking, credit cards electronic statements and notifications. This is just the start of intelligence gathering for a persons account info. Remember scammers need the following important information. 1. Access to your primary email: email accounts store much information like which online banks you have accounts with. your Full Name, Billing address and phone number in case you still have old electronic receipts from previous purchases. 2. They can get more ways to access other accounts by using the gathered information above. Advice; 1. Delete old electronic receipts. 2. Use different email accounts for personal mail purposes, one email for just your online credit/financial accounts. another email for social networks (myspace etc). THE LESSER INFO THE HAVE THE BETTER, PLUS MORE EMAIL ACCOUNTS IS BETTER THAN ONE. AT LEAST YOUR SENSITIVE INFO IS STORE ON DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS. 3. Maintain your computer, delete your offline files, cookies, have a good security protection not just anti virus. Get total protection like mcafee 12 n 1, has anti spy, anti virus etc. 4.

ATP channeled pumps use ATP (energy) to let molecules pass against the gradient. Sodium - potassium pumps are the most common that constantly push sodium out and potassium inside the cell against the gradient to maintain the amount of sodium to potassium inside and outside the cell acoording to the requirements of the cell (which is that sodium ions line the outside of the cell membrane while potassium ions line the inside)", 8563, "fGPYogH4aa", 0],

	70489 : ["cold water is the best first aid when you burn yourself - 20 minutes under the tap is ideal. NEVER ice or vinegar or milk or butter or green tea or mustard or toothpaste or sunscreen or semen or vaseline or tomatoes or vanilla extract or yogurt or sour cream or egg white or lavender oil or cocoa butter or salt or tea bags or potato or shaving cream or olive oil or baking soda or banana peel or petroleum jelly or whipped cream or avocado or bacon grease or corn starch or tumeric or lemon juice or curd- not until the skin is fully healed! alcohol might help with the pain but it is a serious risk as it will dehydrate you - so don't drink any. ibuprofen or aspirin will help but larger burns are often accompanied by stomach ulcers, so tylenol/panadol is best for pain if you are gonna tough it out. drink plenty of water or energy drinks that don't have caffeine (gatorade)  i would advise that you cover the burnt area with sterile paraffin wax or aqueous cream bp. (check the links below and see if you can find a local equivalent). wash the burn and reapply every 4-6 hours - cover with cling wrap if you wish to cover with clothes - this will stop your clothes getting covered with paraffin and maintains the burn. cling wrap alone is ok if you can't get hold of any paraffin. it also acts as a protective artificial skin - helping retain moisture and protect from further damage and pain. cling wrap is cheap and clean off the roll. in Australia ambulances often use this when someone has been burnt. - please note that cling wrap isn't always practical, like on your face. the paraffin imitates the natural oils, creating a seal stopping water leaving the body and reduces pain by protecting sensitised nerves. both of these factors improve healing - good stuff stays in, bad stays out - that is one job of healthy skin. aloe is good coz it remoisturises but that moisture can be quickly lost as the skin can't contain fluids. so put aloe on, and then the paraffin on over the top. if there is broken skin leave out the aloe - just paraffin. hope this helps - let me know how you go and what similar brands/alternatives are available in your area  email if you still have questions - send photos feedingthedogcustard@hotmail.com finally if you are really worried go to a hospital that has a burns unit or plastic surgeons. serious sunburn i.e. blisters (and all other burns) should be seen by a burns trained doctor or nurse.", 8559, "None", 1],
	70490 : ["Aloe alot, also some other remedies are:  1. Apple Cider Vinegar- soak the area with the vinegar, it will help prevent blistering and peeling. 2. Aspirin- reduces inflammation and redness and kills some pain 3. Baking soda- add a little to your bath, its cooling and retains moisture. Air dry instead of towel drying. 4. Cucumber slices- Very cool and will soothe. 5. Good ole fashioned ice 6. Lemon water- cools, disinfects, and promotes healing 7. Whole Milk- apply to area but make sure to rinse off so you won't smell sour. 8. Warm shower- Take a warm shower to draw out the heat of your sunburn. The warm water will increase circulation to the area while hydrating it, thereby speeding the healing process.

	70500 : ["Photosynthesis is by which light energy is absorbed by the chlorophyll which contains chloroplast that is used for the synthesis of carbohydrates in water and carbon dioxide with oxygen being given off in the process. The conditions needed are water, CO2, H2O, chlorophyll,temperature. There are two stages of photosynthesis-the light dependent stage and the light independent stage. Lets start with the light dependent stage.  First, light energy is being absorbed by the chloroplast in the chlorophyll which is converted into chemical energy. Secondly, Photolysis of water occurs, which break down the water molecules to oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is given off. The light independent stage First, Carbon dioxide is taken in by the plants. Secondly, the carbon dioxide that is taken in is being reduced by the hydrogen that is from the photolysis of water in the light dependent stage to form glucose with the help of chemical energy. The word equation for photosynthesis is  Carbon dioxide + water -> Oxygen + Glucose Chemical eqn: 6CO2 + 12H2O->C6H12O6+6O2+6H2O Blue and red lights are the most effective for photosynthesis. Light intensity, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration are the limiting factors of photosynthesis. The higher the light intesity/temperature/carbon dioxide concentration, the higher the rate of photosynthesis. However, for light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration, the is a saturation point to it. As for temperature, at low tempt., enzymes are inactive, thus rate of photosynthesis occurs alowly. As tempt. increase, it gets more active and rate of photosynthesis increase. At 40 degree, enzymes are the most active as it is the optimum temperature and rate of photosynthesis is at ts maximum. As temperature continues to rise, enzymes starts to denature and rate of photosynthesis slows down or even stops. Entry of carbon dioxide to leaf 1) Photosynthesis occurs -> 2) CO2 in leaf used up rapidly-> 3) diffusion gradient occurs-> 4) CO2 diffuse onto the leaf->CO2 dissolves into water mesophyll cells and othe cells.-> back to 1). Adaptations 1) petiole- Holds leaf in positions to expose leaf to as much sunlight and air as possible. 2)large surface area- To absrb maximum sunlight 3) Thin lamina-To allow sunlight to penetrate through all cells and also CO2 to diffuse in rapidly. 4)Stomata in epidermal layer- Allow CO2 and O2 to diffuse in and out 5)Intellectual air spaces in mesophyll layers- To allow CO2 and O2 to diffues in and out rapidly. 6)Xylem and phleom near mesophyll cells- To transport water for photosynthesis(xylem) -To transport sugars away from leaf(phleom) 7)Chloroplast in mesophyll layers- To photosynthesis to take place 8)More chloroplast in upper palisade tissue- More light energy can be absrbed at the leaf surface. Glucose in leaf 1) Converts to starch at night and back to glucose at day 2) Reacts with nitrates in soil to form amino acids to form proteins that is fr the formation of new protoplasm in leaves while excess amino acid are transported to other parts of the plants. 3)Used in tissue respiration and cellulose cell wal 4)Excess are converted to sucrose that is use to transport to storage organs. 5)convert to fats for storage, cellular respiration and forming new protoplasm 6)CO2 + H2O to form glucose Xylem and Phleom Functions: (phleom)Conducts sugars and amino acids form leaf to other parts of the plants.active process. : (xylem)Conducts water with dissolved mineral salts from roots to stem to leaves and providing mechanical support to the plant.Passive process.
