	107414 : ["Your question is a false one and it has been answered many times already. As long as you set up false premises, you will come up with false answers. This question cannot be answered apart from knowing how the Bible uses and defines the words \"true\" and \"god,\" not by the definitions you choose to give the words, or even by the definitions that modern theology gives the words. You have to interpret the Bible by the Bible. First, it is the Lord Jesus Christ who said that his FATHER is the only true God. Period. (John 17:3) In the Bible, the opposite of true is not always \"false.\" Verses that show this have been given you. You can either accept how the Bible defines it or miss what the Bible means. Satan is not a \"false\" god. He really is the god of this world. He really is worshipped by millions of people, either knowingly or unknowingly. But Satan is not the \"only true God,\" as defined by the Bible, because Satan is not equal to Almighty God in all God's attributes and qualities and being. Your argument also denies the Trinity. If Jesus is \"God the Son,\" then the Father cannot be the ONLY true God. By your way of defining it, then \"God the Son\" would be a FALSE God, because he is not God the Father. Jesus said that the Father -- not the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit -- is the ONLY true God. If, as you say, you know Hebrew and have a Hebrew Bible -- I also know Hebrew and have several Hebrew Bibles -- then you should know that the Bible applies the word \"god\" to angels and to men as well as to the Almighty. But ONLY the Father is Almighty. Only the Father is the Uncreated Creator of all that exists, including Jesus. Likewise, as a divine spirit, Jesus is a god. Not a false god, but truly a divine spirit. But Jesus is not Almighty, he is not from eternity, and the power that Jesus has, the Bible tells us, was GIVEN to him by his Father. And Jesus himself worshipped the Father, and said that true worshippers worship the Father. (John 4:23, 24) Your dichotomy is a false dichotomy. Jehovah is the only true God because Jesus said He is. Jesus is a god or divine because the Bible says he is. Neither one is a false god. But ONLY the Father is without origin and Almighty, and the Source of everything else. ONLY the Father, Jehovah, did not receive his authority, power, and life from anyone else. Everyone in the Universe, including Jesus, has a Head over him, except Jehovah. So, the Bible calls others gods in a limited sense, in that they receive a certain authority from God. They are true in the authority they have and in the roles they perform. That's what the Bible says.", 9990, "None", 0],
	107415 : ["The answer on the existence of God has to be UNDETERMINED.  There is no verifiable evidence for the existence of God, and likewise there is no evidence that can disprove the existence of God. However, sections of what has been written is religious scripture such as the Bible, Qua-ran, Vedas, etc which followers consider the word of God can be proven to be incorrect, and thus one can say if the word of God is wrong it should mean that no reliance can be placed on such scriptures and religion to be considered as the word of a so called Higher Power. The extract you have provided is a fallacy for the existence of God, I can twist it around and ask the families of victims in the recent Norway massacre that why would God take away their children and this should mean that there is no God?", 9990, "None", 0],

	107424 : ["God is true and there is more proof then what you have written. Can you build a car without people or knowledge about how to build one? Can a baby be born without parent / parents (sexual / asexual reproduction) If you can then there is no God. If you can not then there must be a God. Science says you need parent / parents in order to have offspring. It says nothing could be with out someone doing it. This is a fact. It can be tested. It can be observed. It can be measured. Due to this reasoning then any and all other theories must be false cause you can not disprove what is proven using the same science.  Science is based on facts that can be observed, measured and tested. I observe all things being born having parent/ parents. I observe things living and dying and those things can be measured. I can test to see if anything can be born with/ with out parent / parents. If birth occurs and parent/ parents were not needed then that would be proof of no God.", 9990, "FYvT5ODAaa", 0],
