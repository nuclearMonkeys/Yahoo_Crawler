This makes them unpopular with Evangelical Chistians.

They just don't know better. -Some do it because they believe that their particular denomination, out of the 39,000+ Christian denominations worldwide, possesses all truth and everyone else is going to Hell if they don't see things their way ie.

	87527 : ["I feel Jehovah's Witnesses are criticized and persecuted for the same reason that early Christians were: “The conscientious refusal of the Christians to pay divine honors to the emperor and his statue, and to take part in any idolatrous ceremonies at public festivities, their aversion to the imperial military service, their disregard for politics and depreciation of all civil and temporal affairs as compared with the spiritual and eternal interests of man, their close brotherly union and frequent meetings, drew upon them the suspicion of hostility to the Caesars and the Roman people.” (History of the Christian Church by Philip Schaff) So, the Romans were \"hostile\" because the early Christians did not take part in public festivities, did not get involved in military service or politics, and they had a \"close brotherly union.\"   Sadly, many today cannot understand the love and unity among Jehovah's Witnesses. They can only \"explain\" it by saying that we are brainwashed and feel they must free us from this \"cult.\" Of course, we are not a cult. Instead we are a worldwide brotherhood that transcends all racial, ethnic, and national boundaries.  We worship the true God, Jehovah, the same way in every country on earth. Isn't that what you would expect of true Christians? Jehovah's Witnesses do not enjoy being bashed by others; however, we are neither surprised by it nor is our faith shaken by it. Our hope is that some of those who ridicule us will in time come to view us differently as did the man Saul (who became the apostle Paul) and who went from persecuting Christians to working alongside them as a zealous preacher of the good news.

God let us do whatever we want because he loves us, believe it, he even still loves Adam Lanza or James Holmes, he loves everybody!! No matter what we do! We SIN, he can't make US sin, that's why we have FREE WILL!!! I don't quite get your question but I hope to get it right, I will edit this answer when I get this question reading it over again. Thank You and God Bless:) Edit: Yes, if God did that, he would have eliminated all the crime in the world but he must give us free will, like he promised because once god promises he can't take back that promise. For he is God, anything can turn into a nightmare for him easily, many people already hate him! God has broke the rules sometimes.. Free will isn't always a good thing. Think of the time you were going to die, you have free will to do whatever you want to do but you have to think quickly or that time you were going to commit suicide, god would save us but we have free will! So God has saved us, that time you were looking at the knife to kill someone or commit suicide but you couldn't, God broke the Free Will Promise or the time you were about to die but you didn't, God broke the Free Will Promise.

When Children were taught GOD, they could tell any such Devil-Possessed Gunman: \"I cast thee out in the Name of Jesus!\" and the Kindergarten girls could have wrapped him up. .  MATTHEW 18:1-4. AT the same time came the Disciples unto Jesus, saying,  \"Who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?\" 2. And Jesus called a little child unto him,  and set him in the midst of them, 3. And said,  \"Verily I say unto you,  'Except ye be converted, and become as little children,  ye shall not enter into The Kingdom of Heaven.' 4. \"Whosoever therefore shall  humble himself as this little child,  the same is greatest in The Kingdom of Heaven.\" The Devil-Possessed Government you have- Hillary Clinton proudly professing to be a Witch when it was fashionable, during the 1990s, knows that THE PRAYERS OF CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS TO THEM- therefore they sent in their MK-ULTRA MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE to Shock-Test for that. They have established that they have ELIMINATED Righteous Children, and will move on to a Next Step. (Your Government did this.) .   GENESIS 18:32-33. 32. And he said,  \"Oh let not The LORD be angry,  and I will speak yet but this once:  'Peradventure ten shall be found there.' \"  And He said,  \"I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\" 33. And The LORD went His Way,  as soon as He had left communing with Abraham:  and Abraham returned unto his place. TEN RIGHTEOUS MEN, which is MINYAN, will support ONE Holy man with their Tithes. Any place that has NO MINYAN is living on BORROWED TIME. I doubt if there are ten Righteous men or ONE Holy man in the entirety of America. I tried to educate you on this subject earlier, but my Question has been \"Quarantined,\" so that you wouldn't see it, and understand the truth of what the Satanic Atheists are doing. Why should you be so murderous as to assume that you know so much that ADAM LANZA had to DIE? How do you know that he was not an MK-ULTRA Drone? What gives you the right not to be one of the Righteous men or the Holy man protecting your area, instead of indulging in Sin and Blasphemy, expecting God to do YOUR duty for you?

	87554 : ["Sam.. so far off... It is obvious throughout Jesus' ministry, His first and foremost concern was the children of Israel, God's chosen people. It is also obvious that Jesus knew the hearts of those He encountered and it is pointed out often in the scriptures reason why He would and would not heal, or do other \"favors\" for people. He wasn't some side show freak doing \"tricks\" nor was He given the powers He had, but they were inherent in Him, as God. Also as God it was His option to heal or not heal as He saw fit, and judging the basis of God's benevolence is simply ridiculous. He is God, and His say is best for any situation whether it suits the palate of men or not. That having been said, watch the nuances of the story and conversation, and see that Jesus didn't \"change His mind\" and then heal the girl, but knew all along He would do so. What He did manage to do was impress that woman's heart to bring out what the disciples needed to see, that faith was the key to salvation, not birthright (as was held by the Jews). The disciples asked that He turn her away, and He confronts her as follows: And he answered, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.\" She said, \"Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.\" Then Jesus answered her, \"O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.\" And her daughter was healed instantly.  (Matthew 15:26-28) The prejudice of the Jews to the Samaritans and the Canaanites and most Gentiles, was sharp, and Jesus needed only to do this, and dispel that deep seated angst in the hearts of His disciples, and at the same time show the Gentiles their hope, in faith in Him. I'm told the word \"dogs\" can be translated \"puppies\" in the response, and you can see the answer was indeed clever, but it was not the motivation for Jesus' healing of the child. Know the background to the story and you will judge it more clearly, it doesn't need embellishment to be seen, it simply needs background and the knowledge of the situation and moods of the cultures involved.", 9267, "aFzoGoq4aa", 0],

A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.  God may not want to prevent evil for a couple of reasons - 1 - it is necessary for a perfect outcome, and 2 - there is no good without evil - balance is necessary 7.)
