As I lay claim to a bit of Jewish blood myself - genealogical research is continuing, I don't have much fear if the BNP increase their vote. Cleverly, the questioner does not actually cite the BNP in his question,.but provides a link. An excellent example of how to dodge responsibility and remain 'respectable' The established politicians are worried, as it is this precise kind of fudging and avoiding directly confronting contentious issues that has led the UK to its current parlous state. The BNP are gaining support, and it is noticeable that this has been going on for some years - members are renewing their membership. The last major resurgence of the Right took place in the mid to late 1970s when the National Front was a serious threat to the Conservative Party - many Conservative Party Members, including some quite prominent ones, has connections to the NF and there was a far-Right ginger-group called the \"Monday Club\" which was a Tory equivalent of the Far Left \"Tribune Group\"  that existed within the contemporaneous Labour party. NF membership at this time was like a bath with both taps running and the plug out - people joined for a year and did not bother to renew their membership. In the 1970s, many contentious issues relating in particular to Immigration came up - the absorption without question of the Kenyan and Ugandan Asians is a case in point. In fact, at one time Trades Unionists banded together to form a pressure group known as \"Tru-Aim\" (Trades Unionists against Immigration\") - an action that shook the Trades Unionist establishment to the roots. However, splits within the NF leadership put and end to this revival, a lot of money was spent to ensure that the Kenyan and Ugandan Asians were settled down and eventually we got Margaret Thatcher, whose Right Wing agenda of socking the Unions, and her luck at being gifted with a war (Falklands) kept the middle-Right Patriots satisfied. Today, the BNP is growing from an assured membership base. What is left of the Working Class find that the Labour Party no longer represents them. Patriots not of the Left find that the Tories are so ineffectual that they cannot issue a single strong policy. The Lib Dems strain at procedural gnats and ask for gerrymandering tofit their own limited aims. The Three Mainstream parties have a shared, milksop agenda. For perhaps the first time, a Far Right party has come out with a coherent ideology that is not anti-Semitic, looks with realism at what Britain is and what it could be, and has replaced racialism with a broad agenda that only the irresponsible can fear. Thus the Establishment Politicians quake. The British People are waking up.", 8723, "02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa", 0],
	73406 : ["At 135 I have to go with what I consider that all time best lightweight and that is Duran.", 8724, "WrDGhduxaa", 2],
	73407 : ["Kumusta pare, Great question! :-) flyweight pancho villa vs ivan calderon Ivan Calderon is a vry slick counter puncher who has great later movements and great precision. But Pancho Villa is out of this world. he is one of the greatest boxers ever. He is ranked by Bert Sugar as greater than Tommy Hearns, Aaron pryor and Mike Tyson. He has been ranked one of the 80 greatest boxers in the last 80 years by Ring Magazine. Villa has the speed, the agility, and the precision to knock out Calderon in my opinion. Villa at the start of his career weighted as little as 85 pounds but was able to knock out guys at 130. Calderon gets KO'd in Round 8. bantamweight nonito donaire vs eder jofre Tough fight. Donaire is a slick counter puncher who is the bigger representation of Ivan Calderon. But Donaire has the power in both hands and the southpaw stance is difficult to beat. Eder Jofre, however, has the power, speed, agility, timing, and movements to beat Donaire by UD. featherweight willie pepp vs flash elorde A very tough fight between fighters with similar style. Elorde is very slick and has upsetted the odds by beating Sandy Saddler, the same guy that Knocked Out Willie Pep. But style makes fights. I would want Elorde to win but the match up is all wrong for him. Willie Pep is a great boxer and is perhaps one of the top 2 most accurate punchers in history. I say Willie Pep wins by a controversial Split Decision that could go either way. lightweight roberto duran vs manny pacquiao As much as I love Pacquaio, Roberto Duran was a beast at lightweight. Him and Joe Gans are the greatest lightweights ever. Pacquaio only fought once at lightweight, but I do believe it is his natural fighting weight, in between 135-140. Duran has the power and the scrappy movements with incredible chin. He knows when to clinch and when to slip and knows how to capitalize in any of his opponents mistakes. My pick is Duran by Unanimous Decision. Pacquaio has one of the greatest chins in the 21st century, I don't think Duran can KO Pacquaio but he will outbox him. welterweight sugar ray leonard vs henry armstrong Tough fight. Henry Armstrong has the greater resume and is one of the 3 greatest boxers ever. Leonard is not in the top 10 but he is also an all time great. But again styles makes fights. i think Leonard has the greater reflex, greater speed, while Armstrong has the better ring IQ and better lateral movements. This will be a close fight once which Armstrong will win by a disputed Split Decision. middleweight sugar ray robinson vs tommy hearns Sugar Ray Robinson beats Tommy Hearns by decision. Robinson is one of the greatest welterweight and middleweight in history. Hearns has incredible power and chin but Robinson has both, and then SOME.  lightheavyweight roy jones vs archie moore Archie Moore with his power would KO Roy Jones Jr. who have shown some vulnerability with his chin. Roy Jones jr. has the great power and speed but Moore had more power and had a scrappy style to slow down Roy Jones.  heavyweight muhammad ali vs rocky marciano Muhammad Ali by a wide decision. Marciano is a great swarmer/brawler/slugger. His defeat of Joe Louis is memorable. But Ali in his prime, would have the height, reach, and weight advantage over the naturally smaller Marciano. i don't think Marciano can hurt Ali at all. Maybe he will land a few clean punches but Ali had a great defense and his pull away jabs would dictated the fight. I say Ali win by a clear decision.", 8724, "None", 4],

	73416 : ["Flyweight-Pancho Villa was a very agressive fighter and had an iron chin.  He takes the decision over Calderon. Jofre is a legend and one of the most complete fighters ever.  Donaire has a punchers chance but is not quite at the skill level of Jofre.  Jofre by decision. Elorde is one of the greatest Filipino fighters in history and very skilled.  That being said, he isn't as skilled as Pep who could do it all.  Pep by decision. At lightweight Duran was a monster.  As a welter I'd give Armstron a slight edge maybe but not at this weight.  Duran by late rounds stoppage in a great fight. Armstrong at welterweight was a beast and despite the boxing ability and fast hands of Leonard, Armstrong would smother and wear down Leonard and take the decision. Hearns can punch and is a good boxer but Robinson was even better and would have gotten to Hearns by the 8th round by kayo. Archie is the greatest light heavyweight champ of all time and a power puncher.  Jones Jr would be winning until a late rounds rally by Archie.  Archie by technical knockout in a great fight. I love Rocky Marciano but Ali was too fast at his best.  Marciano would give him trouble just like Frazier with pressure and power but Ali would take a controversial decision.", 8724, "AA12325046", 2],
	73417 : ["I notice that you were posting some very interesting question like this one, some kind of hard though. My pick (guess) would be; Flyweight - Pancho Villa, after the recent showing of Ivan, I don't think he can make it past Pancho Villa. Bantamweight - Eder Jofre, Nonito was not proven yet at that weight class. Featherweight - Flash Elorde, I might be biased on this as this match up is kinda hard but Featherweight is where D'Flash perform his best fights. Lightweight - This is another hard one but my guess would be Roberto Duran. Not much to use for Manny Pacquaio except his fight against David Diaz and Diaz is not at the caliber of Duran. If this match up happens at Jr. Welterweight, I am picking Manny. Welterweight - Henry Armstrong, He is not #3 in the greatest all time list for nothing. Middleweight - Sugar Ray Robinson, This is a no brainer, Sugar is the greatest fighter of all time. Lightheavyweight - Archie Moore, A warrior par excellence. Heavyweight - Rocky Marciano, I pick him because they fed this match up to a computer before and the winner is Rocky. Not only that he is one of my favorite fighter but also the computer gave him a late stoppage over Ali. @ KIZMAH, Walang anuman, Kaibigan.", 8724, "SXlrQGnJaa", 1],

Eder Jofre by UD. Willie Pep has the edge in everything except size and power. But I do think he has enough to decision Flash Elorde. As much as I love Pacquiao, nobody can seem to beat a prime Duran @ 135. Maybe @140 or @147 Pacquiao has the edge. But at 135, Duran takes this by late stoppage. I'll bet my money on Henry Armstrong.

	73422 : ["You made some outstanding and logical points. Here's the problem as I see it. Both the Constitution and Libertarian parties (and the Conservative ideology in general) emphasize and advocate individualism, as in individual freedom, security, achievement and will. They are, by nature, anti-bandwagon. Conservatives and freedom loving people do not like to be stereotyped and generally give little credence to the popular view and conformity. Having so many people (which I believe actually makes up the majority of Americans) who are seemingly like-minded, splintered into small groups which are often undefined, has strategic and political strengths and weaknesses. One strength is that it promotes a true grassroots basis with a higher level of individual/personal ideological passion. Another strength is that a group/organization/ideology that is difficult to categorize, isolate and define is also very difficult to attack. For example... Before the Tea Party became the Tea party, it was nothing more than a large number of individual Americans that were joined only in sentiment. It was a grassroots movement that seemingly manifested overnight. It was impressive and had enormous strength and potential. Without a doubt, it changed America's political landscape. Most importantly, the Liberal opposition was simply unable to counter it at the beginning. They were scrambling to find a way to attack. How could they attack what, in the public perspective, was nothing more than the public itself, without having the public turn on them even more? The answer came in the form of a name. Tea Party. In my opinion, the worst thing that the Tea Party did was to adopt a name. Now the opposition had something definable. They now had a label to attack, and they wasted no time. Anti-Tea Party propaganda flooded every media outlet. Within months, all they had to do associate any idea, group or person to the Tea Party, and then attack. I'm sure that the Tea Part name originated somewhere within the movement. However, it was the Liberal opposition that spared no expense in making it a household name. Heck, even people who rallied with passion in the early days, found themselves wanting to separate from the Tea Party name. Remember, these folks don't like being stereotyped or fall for conformity. To answer your question; Find a way to unite these people without a label, and America will enter its greatest age. Once organized, any attempt to stereotype, label, smear or assign a leader must be immediately and thoroughly countered and shot down. It should remain seemingly leaderless and nothing more than Americans uniting for a common goal, for that is exactly what it would be.", 8722, "16uxJA69aa", 1],

	73428 : ["Pancho Villa vs Ivan Calderon Calderon is pretty slick, but I think that Pancho Villa just had too much in his arsenal. Villa had a good chin and Calderon has little to no power, so Villa would walk through everything that Calderon would throw and give better than he got. I'm not sure that there would be a ring big enough for Calderon to get away from Villa, and he would apply a lot of pressure. Eventually, Calderon would fold from the constant onslaught that Pancho would put on him and be put away in the later middle rounds - maybe the 9th. Nonito Donaire vs Eder Jofre Donaire is a really slick counter-puncher, but I wouldn't put him close to Jofre's class. Jofre was proven in tough fights against top competition over and over in his career. Donaire's biggest victory comes over the wildly overrated Vic Darchinyan. I would definitely have to give the edge once again to the pressure and experience of the legend over the slick skills of the newcomer. I'm not sure that Jofre will stop Donaire, but I do see him winning. If not a late round stoppage, then definitely by thorough decision. Willie Pep vs Flash Elorde Flash Elorde was an exceptional fighter, but I think that I would have to give the edge to Willie Pep in this one. Willie was a master in a boxing ring and I think that he would dance and jab his way to a decision over Elorde. (Don't get me wrong though, it won't be easy because Elorde was always game and would have put the heat on Pep to the final bell. Pep would just have a little bit more throughout the fight.) Roberto Duran vs Manny Pacquiao I would definitely give this one to Roberto Duran. Duran is by far the greatest lightweight ever. This would definitely be a good one though, because Duran's non-stop aggression and Manny's power would mix to create one for the history books. I think that Duran would have to walk through some pretty rugged moments in this fight, but his hard head and consistent offense would break Manny's will maybe even ending his night before the final bell. I give this one to Duran in a fun, exciting, classic brawl. Sugar Ray Leonard vs Henry Armstrong I think that I would have to give the adgantage to Sugar Ray Leonard in this one. Sugar Ray was pretty fast and he had really good lateral movement. I think that Armstrong would apply a lot of pressure, but Ray Leonard would have enough movement and punches to keep Armstrong away long enough to build a decent lead on points. Then, Homicide Hank would come on strong in the later rounds and put a hurting on Leonard with some big bombs, but it would be too late and Ray Leonard would hang on to win by decision. Sugar Ray Robinson vs Tommy Hearns I'll definitely take Sugar Ray Robinson in this one - especially at middleweight. Ray Robinson is the best middleweight in history and Tommy Hearns may not even be in the top ten. Hearns was a special fighter at welterweight, but I think his stock went down as he moved up. Ray Robinson would finish The Hitman off somewhere around the sixth round and show why he's considered the greatest fighter ever by a lot of experts. Roy Jones vs Archie Moore (I'm assuming that this is the Roy Jones that first moved up to Light Heavy and not the one that gets knocked out every other fight now.) I think that this one would be an exceptional fight. Roy Jones would use his speed and power to slice Moore up. Moore would have a punchers chance, but Roy had arguably the best reflexes in the game. In his prime, Roy Jones was a monster and I'm not sure that Moore would be able to handle all of Roy's raw talent. I think that Roy Jones beats Archie Moore by a wide and painful decision. Muhammad Ali vs Rocky Marciano Ali would box Marciano's ears off. Like Moore though, Marciano would have a punchers chance. Marciano was a solid fighter, but he never fought anybody that was as big and talented as Ali and I think that would give Marciano fits. Ali would punish Marciano all fight with stiff jabs and quick right hands. I would say that Ali has the ability to finish this one maybe by the eighth, but Marciano was one tough customer, so I wouldn't have been surprised if he made it to the final bell.", 8724, "None", 1],
