We may get better close-ups from the military, as they have better technology : though our authorities will still be trying to remain in control of the situation ; and hide THEIR OWN technology at the same time  It's hardly surprising there's so much CONFUSION on the subject : secrecy ; dishonesty ; disbelief ; make-believe. And we are just ordinary people  Or are we ? The government could be releasing its information slowly. We know there are exoplanets etc. Some aliens will be from there ; others live in space permanently I would like to think some of these craft are from our solar system - instead of visiting -; but dauntingly there's a good chance some aren't. The witnesses aren't ALL professional story-tellers - and I reckon they'd HAVE TO BE to invent these accounts   Some crafts will be from motherships - which themselves have also been seen on Earth. You see the enormous difference between humans and aliens. The crafts will have UNBELIEVABLE technology humans can't understand (annoyingly another reason why they're disbelieved) ; just like their motherships. The aliens will NOT want to be captured on Earth    It's actually ALIENS who're controlling the situation Of course, some of the stories are untrue ; but only one has to be true", 2538, "2ifr1sIRaa", 2],
