Does your girlfriend have her own place or does she also live with her parents? And why was you having sex in you mother's house when she was home and being so loud? Have yall ever heard of putting a pillow over your face or some **** like that to muffle the sound? You already know that you are going to do as your parents say. Do you even have a freakin job? Move the hell out of your parents house, and live your own life. Or should I say get a life?", 11316, "0iwc3znqaa", 0],
	136324 : ["You're 33 and she's 20. Sure there's an age difference, but you're both adults. You can have sex if you both want to -- legally, at least. Your parents may have a moral concern if you aren't married. You may not share that ethic, but if you're living in their home, they do properly have some degree of control over what happens in their house. What seems weird here is that both your family and your girlfriend's family are trying to break up the relationship. And you both live at home. Is there more going on here than the answer indicates? Do you or your girlfriend have a mental illness or incapacity of some sort? If you were teenagers, then this sort of behavior on their part would make more sense.", 11316, "Q5OEbSBcaa", 0],
	136325 : ["Not sure about boiler set ups, I have a central heating system, if your getting a flame from a pilot, but its not igniting the burner, its probably a bad regulator(i'm not 100%), because there are plenty of horns a whistles that do minor things, but can prevent it from working...even a broken thermostat is possible. hopefully thats all it is. easy fix. good luck! stay warm.", 11317, "51ffe1363d554561e1aea841802c65b5aa", 0],

Puma im afraid arent very good and at 7yrs its doing well you will have a few breakdowns to come but if replacing my advice go worcester.... All the best", 11317, "UZkxBY1Waa", 1],
	136329 : ["Most definitely! That was a pretty good Moonsault! Before Cody came to Smackdown, I didn't really think of him highly. Now I actually see some potential in him, and I think it was a great move to move him to Smackdown. Before, he was overshadowed by Ted, when they were Legacy. He has been putting good matches ever since coming to Smackdown, and I liked last night's match against Christian, even though he lost. I like him, as a singles competitor more. I can see him becoming the Intercotinental Champion soon. I am also glad Drew has finally lost the Intercontinental Title! He never even defended it, and he was not that interesting, to be honest. Now we have talented guys, like Christian, Kofi, and Cody going for it, which I think is great! Overall, Cody Rhodes should make this a weekly move, the way John Cena does the 5 Knuckle Shuffle.", 11322, "xqgy9n0Xaa", 3],

I want Christian to win the IC Title next week then have Cody Challenge him for it, or at Fatal Four Way have Christian (c) vs Dolph Ziggler vs Cody vs Kofi for the IC Title.
