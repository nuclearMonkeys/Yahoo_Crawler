You may want to experiment with different brands of chocolate to see if there's one that agrees with you. Because the ingrediants do vary. Too, you might want to try dark versus milk or vica versa (depending on which one you normally eat). You can also try some of the organic chocolate bars available to see if they don't cause you to fart. One more thing, if you always eat chocolate with nuts, it may be the nuts that are giving you gas and not the chocolate. In either case, you have my sympathy.", 11114, "nRodpKQvaa", 0],

And last, but certainly the most to blame is Hillary herself, who used to be the pillar of the Civil Rights movement, but has yet to \"reject and denounce\" the white voters that are voting for her because they're \"anti-black.\" Debra, I don't ever think you could put yourself in the situation of being black, but, I can assure you that if you were, you wouldn't be voting for the Clintons after that.", 11120, "None", -2],

Programing The Brow Chakra Just in between and slightly above your eyebrows is an organic valve or energy center also known as the \"brow chakra.\" This brow chakra is the seat of your ability to use logic (you can use logic to gain full consciousness within your dream), perception (which is your ability to use insight and also to understand things without the conscious use of logic), and also psychic power, such as clairvoyance, precognition, telepathy, etc. 1.) The Daytime Meditation Technique: Go and find a comfortable place to sit down and relax. Close your eyes and visualize your thalamus gland inside your brain. Now visualize your thalamus gland glowing very brightly with bioelectric energy. Now see in your imagination a white mental cinema scree/huge white movie screen. Fire your mental laser from your thalamus gland into the upper left hand corner of the mental cinema screen and begin moving your thalamus laser clockwise, slowly. You are now moving your mental laser clockwise from the upper left hand corner of the mental cinema screen and following your mental laser is a wavering blue flame. Continue doing this until your entire mental cinema screen is completely filled with a blue flame. For a little while, visualize this blue flame mental cinema screen. Then visualize the blue flames disappearing and now you simple have a blue cinema screen in front of you. Now see an image of yourself on this mental cinema screen and try to visualize your brow chakra. The color of this brow chakra can be indigo (bluish black) or amethyst purple. Fire your powerful mental laser into your brow chakra with the \"intention\" of programing it to give you fully conscious lucid dreams and also, flawless logic & perception. Or perhaps you can even program it to also give you psychic powers. Continue with this mental exercise for about 30 minutes. You must do this mental exercise every single day for about one year or eighteen months until your brow chakra is permanently awakened. You may go to   and see more about the thalamus gland. If the above technique doesn't really appeal to you, then try the below technique. 2.) Nighttime Mediation Technique: When you lie down to go to sleep, begin to visualize your brow chakra, only this time, see your brow chakra glowing very brightly with energy. I prefer to visualize my brow chakra glowing very brightly with deep amethyst purple. Okay, while you're visualizing this, begin repeating an affirmation like this one, \"MY BROW CHAKRA WILL CAUSE ME TO HAVE A LONG LASTING OUT OF BODY LUCID DREAM.\" You must repeat this affirmation 100x while doing the visualizing your chakra glowing. Your chakra doesn't necessarily have to be a purple color, it can be a very bright white glowing color if you like. After about two weeks of repeating the above affirmation, you'll be able to repeat it without even thinking. After one month of repeating this affirmation, you'll notice how your dreams will become more and more lucid. Within seven months, you might even master lucid dreaming by then. I myself prefer to use both of the above techniques. 3.) It might also be a good idea to keep and maintain a dream journal. When you wake up from your dream make sure that you write down with as much grueling detail as possible what you saw in your dreams. This will help entrain you to remember your dreams. 4.) The Nova Dreamer Mask: This breakthrough in lucid dream technology might help you out if you disagree with the above mediational techniques.  You might also want to check out this truly awesome website to learn about what sort of fantastic things can be achieved through lucid dreaming.  Did you know that if you master lucid dreaming well enough, that you can freeze time in your dream and stay there for long periods of time? You can even use lucid dreaming as a doorway into remote viewing or astral projection. Its very important that you never use mind altering drugs including marijuana. Don't drink alcoholic beverages. Don't use any kind of pharmaceutical tranquilizers or antidepressants while you're doing this meditational work or you will fail. If you use tobacco, then it would be advisable to stop smoking because the nicotine will hinder your ability to use your thalamus laser. These are things that I know from actual experience. Very highly recommended books: 1.) Adventures Beyond The Body, by William Buhlman 2.) The Secret Of The Soul, by William Buhlman 3.) Remote Viewing, by Tim Rifat 4.)

I dislike that they are the two too no longer undemanding headed, conceited, and might't administration their anger.

I once stood by the lockers and he put his hands either side of me, it made me soo uncomfortable. I didn't say anything as I knew my partner would've gone mental.

You may hear \"I won't vote for Obama unless Hillary is his running mate\", in the next couple days by some of these supporters which sounds more like political blackmail, but hey they can vote for whoever they want. I won't be surprised. You have to ask yourself, is this how it will always end when a woman canidate doesn't get the nomination? Women will spitefully turn their noses in the air in defiance because they've been shot down again by some sexist loner in the media like Rush Limbaugh or Chris Matthews instead of looking at the strategies and tactics used by each of the campaigns. Its easy to point the finger anyways right?  Years ago you saw the same pundits talking about how Hillary would route anyone who ran against her, now the story is drastically different. Would groups of female/male Obama supporters about face and vote for McCain if Hillary won the nomination? How would Hillary reach across the aisle to these voters?
