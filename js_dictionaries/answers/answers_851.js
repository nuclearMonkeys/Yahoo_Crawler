It is based on something that gives a firefly its glow.  For science reasons I can't explain, it's useful in however the vaccine works. The word is Latin.  It is made of two parts; 'lux' for light, and 'ferre' for 'to bring'.  Lucifer is the Latin name for the planet Venus aka 'the Morning Star', and as an adjective, it means 'bringer of light'.  Why that adjective was attached to a bringer of darkness is something you'll have to study religious texts for, but it would appear that irony was alive and well a couple of millennia ago.

Cathedrals and castles were built in the Middle Ages, around 1100-1400 A.D., with tools not so different than those used today.

The stitches don't ever show unless you are using a top-stitch, or some sort of decorative stitch or overlock on the outside of the garment. An old instructor of mine used off-white/ecru for almost every purpose, and nobody ever complained - because the thread was never visable.

Trash. Garbage. Recycling. Those 4-inch long yarn scraps that you trim off a finished piece after weaving in your ends? I save those. Old pizza boxes?  If it's not greasy, I'm easy!

	47219 : ["Our steady requirement for new garments gives up a ton of old garments, making a gigantic pile of texture squander. Americans toss out 13.1 million tons of materials every year, of which 11 million tons winds up in landfills.  Seattle startup Evrnu offers another option: reusing that takes old dress and makes totally new yarn for new attire. Its cycle utilizes dissolvable to transform cottons and different textures into mash which it at that point expels through a fine channel, somewhat like how water is pushed out through a shower head. A few major brands, as H&M and Eileen Fisher, presently reclaim garments in their stores. However, Evrnu fellow benefactor Stacy Flynn says they don't really have second uses for it. \"It's accumulating and they don't generally have a clue how to do it.
