	57932 : ["\"Should people who disagree with feminism on social media be cancelled?\" Not at all.  The entire West up until now has been the product of the Enlightenment, whereby all opinions were to be heard and discussed on their merits, and not just the Kings, or the supreme elite.  The modern day assumption in the West today however, is to push critical theory, otherwise known as cultural Marxism, which is totalitarian in nature, and does not accept any diversity of opinion beyond its own demanded ideals.  And the Left is happy to cede all freedoms to let the authorities \"cancel\" the opinions they don't like today.  But what about _their own_ opinions tomorrow?? If we ever accept those principles as a society, then we are doomed.  The Left is glad to accept them now because the elite is on board with their critical theory identity politics.  But once the freedoms have been traded for the \"safety\" of no \"hate speech\" or alternate opinion that hurts the Left's feelings, then anything goes, including their safety and feelings as well as their control on the narrative for society.  The generation afterwards will have no freedoms, rights or any say in how society is run.  It will be run by the totalitarian authorities whatever way they see fit under the guise of \"protecting\" society. .", 8022, "aSm9xSn3aa", 4],

Your IP address belongs to your ISP provider.  They lease it to you for your usage.  If you go to a different location, you will get a different IP address.  If someone else plugs there computer into your connection, they will get your IP address.  Your IP address changes. Plus the IP address is not actually the address of your computer.  It is the address of the modem that your ISP provides you.  If you hook up your PC, your laptop, your tablet and your phone all to your modem/router, they will get the same (public) IP address.  But your router knows which device is doing the talking by the devices MAC address.  So if your laptop ask for a web site, and your PC ask for a different one, both request go out with the IP address.  But when the web site replies, the router uses the MAC address to know whether to send the reply to your laptop or our PC.   When something is send over the Internet (or a local network) but the IP and the MAC address are included.  Each is used a different point in the process to determine how to transfer the information between your device, the web site, and back.

A lot of good answers have been given as to why cameras did not pick up stars. If you cannot be bothered to think I suppose the rest of my answer will be a waste of my time. If the USA did not land men on the Moon can you explain why the Soviets kept quiet? They certainly had the means of tracking the Apollo missions and they would have known if no US lunar module had landed on the Moon. Another thing to think about. No one, absolutely no one, involved in these missions has spoken out once and said we did not really get to the Moon. It would have cost the USA far less money to fund the Apollo missions and put men on the Moon than it would to have paid off everybody who was involved with enough money to ensure they never spoke out.
