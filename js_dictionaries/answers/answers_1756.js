	93538 : ["“Is it obvious the time period we are living in, called \"the last days”? No it is not obvious nor do I believe we are in the ‘last days.' So, a few things happen, particularly with the weather and one not only sees it as a bad omen, but also scripture fulfilling itself. The weather has for millennium and will continue to have bouts of aggression with its floods, earthquakes, and the like; it is a cycle in nature, a pattern reemerging. Others signs might be wars, famine, disease and the like, but these also are reemerging signs. Moreover, ‘days' imply just that - ‘days,' when the pattern has found its form; to be sure its barely in its infancy, it will happen in days, but those last days are many, many years off. There have always been selfish times, during the height of ‘free market economics' selfishness had its boom years. The problem is that the selfishness of the boom years has stayed with us, just as its economic failings and greed has. There have always been those who have and those who have not, those who desire more and those who desire what is not theirs. Signs are everywhere, what signs exactly, like those signs mentioned above, signs can be quite ambiguous. The Battle in heaven has already been fought as can been seen in Revelation, this battle began when Christ died on the Cross, and for three days He fought with Satan and defeated him and then rose again at the end of the third day. All on Earth will see the next great battle. Nor do I believe the World is under the control of the evil one, if we as Christians say such, then we give power to him who should not have it and we forget our free will and in consequence, follow a wrong path, but no one made one follow such and such a path. The gospel is hid to those that are lost, then as Christians we must make known the gospel that is hid, so the light may come out from under the bushel and shine on all who are receptive to receive it. And should their minds be truly closed, then by all means close the book, but where Satan has closed a mind, God can open it. Finally, I would just add that when the ‘last days' are with us, we would most certainly be fully aware of it, and those days are not with us yet. Edited on: Catastrophes have happened for millennium all over the world, if it wasn't war and the destruction it brings, it has been the weather and the destruction it brings. Since recorded time there has not been a single century without a war somewhere on this planet; nor has there been a single century where the weather had not seen some extremes. I would say that is pretty worldwide and abundant. In the two readings on ‘Figs; Luke 13-6 and Matthew 21-19, there is not a hint of any ‘time-period,' nor of any impeding danger on a catastrophic scale of which scripture speaks.", 9482, "skwjUMTgaa", 0],
	93539 : ["I don't know if your lack in empathy makes you wicked, but it does make you cold.  If you don't feel for the people who are in pain, then perhaps you should just keep your mouth shut.  I couldn't imagine not putting myself in other people's positions.  It makes you a better person for it.  How else are you going to know what the other person is going through.  Again, if you have nothing helpful to offer someone who is in need or grieving, then just don't say anything at all.  Believe me, they will appreciate it more if you are silent than if you open your mouth and say something insensitive.  Thank you and good luck.", 9482, "819e1f19fe218313b6fa5b466e0b0c40aa", 2],

Arguing makes us better people in the long run, because it separates us from each other. I think we need it.

This leads to climate change, disrupted weather patterns and such. The second and far more devastating are oil spills (like the one in the gulf) the natural chemicals in crude oil destroy any life it touches, sticks to plant and animal life, seeps into soil, contaminates water and can affect the food chain all the way up.
