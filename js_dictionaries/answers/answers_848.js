	47004 : ["I've eaten Subway maybe twice in my life. That twerp had nothing to do with it.", 6671, "None", 1],
	47005 : ["I've always drunk more tea than coffee.  That probably was so because I was born just as World War 2 was ending and many things were rationed. Tea was cheaper than coffee and needed less milk also.  It just became the usual thing to make tea far more often than coffee.", 6663, "Tf7eaIpuaa", 2],

	47008 : ["Having vegetarian and non vegetarian population is basically the nature's way of maintaining the balance. If the entire population will shift to vegetarian diet then there would be lot of waste that will be produced due to the death of the animals. This would cause pollution in environment and would create imbalance. So there is no need for the entire population to stop consuming meat.", 6679, "MhgOEZKRaa", 0],
	47009 : ["Nope Dietary cholesterol is not effected by what you eat. Meat is good for you", 6659, "uNgS0Cqraa", 2],
	47010 : ["It's possible. But not all vegan foods are low in cholesterol and fats. Think of something like fries. A lot of foods are prepared in ways that make them less healthy. Also, as other have said, diet isn't the only contributing factor.", 6659, "p0guNQhiaa", 2],
	47011 : ["Cheese has nutrients and vitamins like A, B-12 and K-2 that are good for you. However, some cheeses can be high in saturated fat and salt. In moderation cheeses can be good for you.", 6660, "kgBPU4xxaa", 3],
	47012 : ["There is no one answer that fits everyone.  It depends upon what you need in your diet.  If you are eating a very low protein diet, then eating cheese (along with other forms of protein) is good for you.  If you have a very low calorie diet, then eating cheese will help you get needed calories.  If you eat only foods that have very little salt, then eating cheese will help you get needed salt.  But if you are already eating lots of protein, if you are overweight, and if you already have enough salt intake, then cheese may be a negative, especially if you eat a lot of it.  Of course, if you are lactose intolerant, then it can be downright bad for you.  For most people, though, a little cheese here and there is fine.", 6660, "rPdBoondaa", 5],
	47013 : ["Not all that good.  It has the wrong kind of fats in it, too much salt, and sugar too. There are other sources of protein, and drinking milk is better for you than eating cheese.", 6660, "sMtpQ4f2aa", -1],

	47018 : ["I buy a local brand of pasture raised eggs because I think they taste better and I'm only buying for 2 of us.   All the eggs available in a well run supermarket are safe.   Also, eggs are white or brown depending on the breed of chicken, nothing to do with the quality. ", 6672, "1py4NFXBaa", 2],

	47021 : ["No, a person who eats fish and seafood but no other flesh is a pescatarian, from the Italian 'pesches' [fish]. idk why an Italian name was chosen for this diet, the typical Italian diet is not pescatarian. The confusion arises because the term pescatarian was only coined around 25-30 years ago, and previously such diets were described as demi-vegetarian, This term was more ambiguous however as it could also describe other not-quite-vegetarian diets such as flexitarian.", 6658, "sgZDU7mgaa", 1],

	47024 : ["Fresh Lemons!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do I need to express that even more????!!!!!!!!!!! \"Lemon Juice\" is not meant to be used as a drink. It's for a little squirt on fish or maybe a tsp in a recipe, it's NOT for drinking. The whole point of making and selling lemon juice as a kid is that it's a process. Learning and working. Come on dude, DONT MAKE ME LOSE ANOTHER 10 points, but I will say it. How the **** did you ever become a Father? You sound like a complete idiot!!! ****!!! ROY, is it? You need to go to the ******* store and buy a **** ton of Lemons. Go home and (only an idiot needs to) Google Lemonade recipes. Don't worry, your kids will NEVER see me calling you an idiot, YA is shutting down, but you should actually be more concerned of them thinking you are. I'll bet you are an awesome Dad, but you need to get a clue. NO, LEMON JUICE will taste like crap. Fresh Lemons, Sugar and water/ice. Sorry.", 6685, "AKZYBFTxaa", 1],
	47025 : ["Dogs need 1/3 of their food to be meat protein. Cats need 100% meat protein. People who try to make their animals vegan are harming their animals. They are more attached to their ideaology about diet than they are attached to the welfare of their pets.   Wrong choice in my opinion.  If you aren't going to be a good pet-owner, you shouldn't have pets.", 6680, "None", 0],
	47026 : ["It's a tiny, tiny minority of people who think that. Anyone with a reasonable vocabulary and common sense knows that humans are the only animals that can be vegan: a vegan is an omnivore who chooses to consume no animal products at all. You are mistaken, “many people” do not “make their animals be vegan” (no one can do that) but a tiny few seem to feed their pets a vegan diet. I guess that's because of ignorance and the idea that animals are toys.", 6680, "2vZEqZZMaa", 4],

	47029 : ["The good and bad about YA is that 99.9% of the answers can be found using a simple google search - so for the most part not necessary. Then there are forums available (albeit you wold need to sign up to post a question) on the .1% of the questions that may need some disambiguation.....but always a better bet than answers from YA users. Especially Pearl L.   The second 'bad' is that you come to realize just how stupid, gullible, lazy to a fault so many of the people are who NEED to ask a question (not just the idiot trolls - real questions that wouldn't even need to be asked if the person had a lick of common sense).  The good - is that it offered a random way to spark interest and learning - question sparks some interest then look up the answer and maybe read more about the inquiry and learn something useful.It will be missed but not as a source of information but a source of entertainment. ", 6681, "MI2v6pxdaa", 1],

	47041 : ["Jared didn't mess it up for me. My wife and I had a friendly relationship with the manager of a local Subway and we had lunch there once or twice a week. One day we went in and he was swamped (scheduling employees was part of his job) and he asked us to go away and come back an hour later. I happen to think it is incredibly stupid to ask loyal customers to bail you out when you have created a bad service reputation. We left, but didn't come back in an hour, or a week, or so far ever. You reward superior loyalty with deferential service, not with denial of service. I thought he went too far, and have avoided his store and the Subway brand for the last three years.", 6671, "98lD3z68aa", 1],

	47045 : ["No. Nobody should have to stop eating meat because of your woke SJW agenda. People have a right to choose what they want to eat. Grow up, get over yourself, and leave other people alone. And if you have been brainwashed by PETA, then come out of the deception. The only reason to impose veganism onto a whole society is to manipulate, control, enslave, and oppress people. But the ones pushing this veganism agenda doesn't tell anybody that. Instead, they start a propaganda war and deceive people through manipulating emotions and false guilt.", 6679, "None", 3],
	47046 : ["If you want to stop eating meat, fine. But do you want me telling you what you should and shouldn't be eating, wearing, driving, listening to or reading?    I didn't think so.   So leave everyone else alone.  What they eat is none of your business.", 6679, "None", 5],
