	82508 : ["He is a libertarian, which is something of a Constitutionalists, but they have some ideas that are a little off the farm so to speak. I don't think he is opposed to the separation of church and state, as much as he is opposed to the positions the courts have taken which he considers to be anti church.", 9107, "WrDGhduxaa", -1],
	82509 : ["No.  In my experience, \"strict constitutionalists\" believe the Constitution to be dry words on dead pages.  They are VERY selective about judicial interpretation, and seemingly pick and choose which amendments they support.", 9107, "None", -5],

	82514 : ["Because Republicans don't care what the American people want or about their well being.  Republicans are tools of the corporatate interests.", 9106, "s2QqPyZsaa", 1],
	82515 : ["Most people are against the bill as it's written. They want reform, but not Obama's reform of mandated government-controlled care. Learn the facts.", 9106, "None", 0],
	82516 : ["Lee of course. Just cause the Cubs have no one else. He was their defense, hitting, and franchise player. I know the injury of Pujols hurts Cards fans, but they still have Cy Young pitcher Chris Carpenter and SS David Eckstein. The Cards still have a shot at the World Series.", 9103, "AA10944764", 0],
	82517 : ["Pujols for sure. The Cubs aren't going anywhere.", 9103, "None", 0],
	82518 : ["Both are the biggest hitters on their teams, and without them both teams offense suffers greatly.  But since St. Louis has Edmonds and Rolen while the Cubs only have Ramirez, I'd say the Cubs are hurt a little more than the Cardinals.", 9103, "AA12237330", 0],
	82519 : ["You conveniently left out the terrorist attack of 9/11 which had a grave negative effect on America's economy--the purpose for the attack. Also, when Bush left office, unemployment was 5.7%. Also, the debt also included billions of dollars spent on the war on terror, which btw, kept Americans safe for the following 8 years after 9/11.As for as obama fixing it, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  Unemployment is at 10% and you quoted the stock market, Obama hates that--he called them \"fat cats\"--remember? The GDP THE LAST QUARTER--lets see what it does next quarter.", 9104, "None", 5],
	82520 : ["what can i say? it's bad enough that republicans are spinning the economic crisis such that Obama appears to be at fault for it, but  even worse is the fact that many of their faithful supporters believe it and, ironically, may end up voting against democratic measures designed to keep them from being screwed over by republican measures that champion corporate greed (the brunt of the objection to health care overhaul in the current debate). Obama is the first president in a very, very long time to focus on important, critical domestic issues other than national security and \"terrorism\",  and these idiots are calling him a Nazi for doing so! lol i really have no words for that!", 9104, "ytQz70JIaa", -3],
	82521 : ["What's up with all the labeling in the first place? You either agree or disagree. I'm getting sick of people generalizing so much. It is possible for a liberal to agree with a conservative and vice versa.", 9100, "AA12023256", 1],
	82522 : ["Do you know how many times I have been called a Bushbot, even though I have been openly critical of his handling of the war in Iraq, Immigration - the border issue, homeland secuity , to name a few.. It cuts both ways on this board..", 9100, "None", 2],

	82526 : ["lol...more people who think that because the specific words aren't there that means we don't have a secular country. Did you know that the word \"trinity\" also never appears in the Bible? Ron Paul is a religious fundie. He's been taped saying he doesn't believe in evolution or the seperation of church and state.", 9107, "7vNtAOmuaa", -4],
	82527 : ["No. Like most politicians, Ron Paul embraces those parts of the Constitution that he finds convenient and discards the rest. He is a Libertarian and like all Libertarians, his version of the Constitution is based on fiction not fact. I also find it humorous how Ron Paul whines about government waste, yet he is one of the top pork barrel beneficiaries in Congress.", 9107, "1KhaMCRhaa", -4],
	82528 : ["At this point everything hangs on the occupation of Iraq and the war in Afghanistan.  Both of these events are costing this country billions of borrowed dollars every day.  If you recall, the old USSR went belly up in much the same way...expensive spending for lost wars...both the cold and the one they lost in Afghanistan.  The situation in Pakistan is growing worse by the say.  five years ago I said that Pakistan is a single bullet away from going over to the muslim extremists and getting their hands on nuclear weapons.  Unless we withdraw entirely from the middle east all that we're doing is stirring the pot and losing lives and any real chance of dealing with our budget problems.  Without a resolution of this war we're up against history.  We could well deal effectively with 'terrorism' at a different level as was suggested by almost everyone at the start of this situation, but we can't deal with the situation the way it is.", 9108, "84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa", 2],
	82529 : ["Several months ago I would have said the war in Iraq. But now I believe the most important issue to be illegal immigration. Our open borders pose a bigger threat to our nations security and economy than the terrorists operating half a world away from here. It's estimated that anywhere from 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants have crossed our borders. I wonder how many might be terrorists just waiting for the word to strike!!", 9108, "None", 1],
	82530 : ["That website is whack! 70% of Americans do NOT want nationalized Healthcare. It doesn't work in Canada or the UK and it's not going to work here. Yes everyone would have healthcare but the tricky part is WHEN you get it. It's not going to do me any good if I have government healthcare, but I can't get a CT scan or an MRI to confirm a diagnosis of cancer for 6 months!", 9106, "None", 0],
	82531 : ["Where were you when the vast majority of people didn't want this Health Care bill passed?  Pelosi and her cronies certainly didn't care what the American people wanted.  She passed it so we could see what was in it.", 9106, "Oz3vdOixaa", 1],

	82536 : ["Obama approval ratings in the mid 40s, says he's not fixing anything. Bush didn't hit approval ratings that low until his 5th year in office and he had the dot.com burst to clean up, 9/11, rebuild security infrastructure, war in afghanistan, war in iraq, all on his plate. Obama's fall in approval is of historic proportions.   He's a total failure after 1 year.   No spinning that.", 9104, "oo6sYBPVaa", 3],
	82537 : ["HISTORY IS A CONTINUUM,  NOT A VACUUM.  To my knowledge, life didn't begin in 2001 under George W. Bush. Sigh...  Another Bush-blamer.  It's so tiresome.", 9104, "e2H340ydaa", 1],
	82538 : ["Why do Libs attack anyone who disagrees with them as Neocon (they don't seem to know what a Neocon is & are too lazy to learn), Nazi, moron etc? You call yourself a \"moderate\" but if you don't see that there is more venom from the left than from the right, I have to question your self identification.", 9100, "62722318232c81986840d7aa35854bc4aa", -1],

	82545 : ["It is quite amazing to me that nobody has mentioned global warming as an important issue. I can understand why, because most americans don't really care about global warming or its implications on the environment. I understand that the war in iraq is an important issue, but if mass floods wreak havoc on earth, will it really matter what happens in iraq? By making global warming the number one issue in America, we can save the earth, create more jobs from alternative resources, and also reclaim our prestige as being the country that can get anything done.", 9108, "None", 1],
	82546 : ["Illegal aliens in our country. Now for a few other major issues for me. Getting out of Iraq. Securing our borders. Our debt. Our trade deficits and from this point forward, no more free trade, now it's fair trade. Outsourcing of jobs with no consideration of how it affects American workers. No more corporate welfare. No more lobbying or special interest groups, PACS or any other group buying legislation. Term limits. Cut Senators terms from four to three years and no more then two terms. Congressmen, three two year terms. After that's it's over and no fat retirement and health care package courtesy of the American taxpayers. Less power for the federal government and more for the states.", 9108, "None", 2],

	82548 : ["They would do it because it is a terrible bill that is bad for America and bad for Americans. There is a vast difference between this and Social Security and Medicare. Both of those were passed bipartisanly with a majority of both parties supporting. But the only bipartisan vote for the Democrat Health Care reform was the opposition to it. Another significant difference is that a majority of Americans were not vociferously against Social Security or Medicare as they are against this bad bill. As for elderly voters, the fact is that this bill will but their Medicare advantage coverages (used by some 35% of the elderly) and threatens to even further decrease the health care provider reimbursement rates, which will further incur a reduction in the number of Medicare patients that doctors will take on. One of the most active groups against this bill have been the senior citizens. I find that all these reasons are quite compelling enough to demand a repeal attempt.", 9106, "3heyWI90aa", 0],

Pretty much everything with these nationality groups and whining about something or another it's like \"yea go for it\" with me at this point. I  don't want to hear about it, now I hear that transsexuals want \"rights\". It's like now a bunch of guys who mutilate their private parts and dress up as women want my respect, a couple a decades ago that got you into a mental hospital.
