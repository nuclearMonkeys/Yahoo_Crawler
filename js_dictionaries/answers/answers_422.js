	23116 : ["@ BB- My wind and solar travels from the generators to the inverters and converters to the batteries to my appliances. You know how many CEO salaries I'm NOT contributing to?Â  @ y- True, but a payment plan puts the entire upfront cost into terms of about 8 years of utility bills, w/o the price hikes.Â ", 3702, "8drOkCMFaa", 0],
	23117 : ["Everything is unreliable, reliability of the grid depends on how much you are willing to invest in it.Â  When Obama talked about improving the grid and creating a \"smart grid\" republicans were against it. However, if you live in Texas, rooftop solar, with battery backup would be feasible.Â  It is even cost effective.Â  I just build my first small battery (7kWh) and it would be quite possible to scale that to 70kWh (enough for 2 -4 days) and would cost about 12,000. Charging the battery with solar (including taxes) would add another 7 ,000 dollars.Â  This would be a DIY system for under 20,000, or 1,000 per year, no subsidies required. Not every one is willing to do that, most of us prefer to rely on the grid and make everything some one else's problem.Â  The good news is that solar panels are now 30cents per Watt, batteries are continuing to drop in price and the electronic equipment required are getting better and cheaper.Â  The bad news is that all this is not happening in the US and we have to import it from China, which is leading the way.", 3702, "None", 1],

	23121 : ["Expense. In order to dispose of trash domesticly you would have to pass enviromental regulations, and that is expensive, the few facilities that do comply can't handle the volume.

	23131 : ["does nothing for the environment it moves money around between rich people is all it does. Could Tesla survive without subsidies from carbon offsets?
