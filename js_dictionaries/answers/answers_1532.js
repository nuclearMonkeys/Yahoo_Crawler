You also state the \"we are influencing the climate\" as though it is a fact, whereas not a single human being has ever been able to cool the tropics to make life more comfortable, irrigate the deserts to make them able to sustain crops, and warm the frozen tundra so that areas of land and resources previously unreachable could used for productive purposes.  It simply cannot be done, or believe me, industrialists would be DOING IT and profiting from it beyond their wildest dreams. When you drive on the roadway, there is a 50% probability that EACH vehicle coming in the opposite direction will cross that 1/16\" painted boundary line and slam into your vehicle, killing you or giving you life-threatening injuries in an instant... and yet you continue to drive without demanding an 8' solid concrete barrier between you and the opposing traffic. 50%?  Absolutely.  They can stay in their lane, or they can drift across to hit you.  50/50.  And that's per each driver.  But yet, you have blind faith that it won't happen. There is a common sense boundary between imagined danger and actual danger, and you and the other people who have bought into the totally unproven, totally unreproduceable, completely imagined fantasy that mankind can \"control nature, and next, the solar system, and then onto the universe\", clearly do not believe such boundaries exist. Don't you realize, if we could actually affect climate in the least bit, we'd already be doing it -- intentionally! The simple reality is, nature is bigger than us.  And really, we're quite irrelevant in the greater scheme of things.  Bacteria and viruses... they rule this planet, and THEY actually do control the climate (and have been proven to, with reproducable results -- see the Oceanic Genome project, which was stunned to discover that oceanic bacteria in the Pacific actually regulate and control all airborne and seaborne pollutants... and they could reproduce their results in the laboratory!).

We're incessantly being told that such evidence exists and are constantly bombarded with claims about how climate change has been shown to be false or how it's due to natural cycles.  Yet for some strange reason, no-one has yet managed to produce this evidence; it would almost make one think that it didn't exist. I must have asked 2, 3, 4, 500 times for the deniers to validate their claims and as far as I'm aware this has never been done.  It's enough to make people think that the deniers don't actually have any evidence and are simply lying through their teeth or fabricating ‘evidence' as they go along. Anyway, good luck in your quest and don't be too disappointed when nothing of substance materialises.

(try 40% max) etc etc Quoted from other sources - Climate sensitivity of ≈0.5°C or ≈0.6°C doesn't add up (where's the other warming come from), historical CO2 levels up to 390ppmv is contradicted by more reliable evidence (empirical mass spectrometrics as opposed to indicative stomatal data).", 9101, "AA10993476", -3],

That is over 11 years, for Pete's sake. The predictions were that as CO2 increases, then the temperature increases. Skeptics tried to rebut that in the 90's when by Gores on chart, it showed CO2 followed temp. in the Vostok ice core samples. Also, the earth has been in a long term warming trend for over 16,000 years according to the ice core sample data. During that long warming trend, there are many thousands of shorter periods in which the rate of warming and/or cooling either skyrockets up or down for fairly long (10-30) years. Why is so ridiculous to think we may be in one of those periods? I am a SKEPTIC. I believe the AGW theory is a valid one, but not yet an accepted fact. You can call me whatever you want, but until I see factual data back up your theory without far-reaching assumptions, then I will remain a skeptic and believe that the earth will go on warming until it decides to start cooling again.
