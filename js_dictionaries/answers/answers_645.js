	36076 : ["False... Diego Corralles and Jose Louis Castillo and he beat both, and Ricky Hatton Edit - by anyone I'm assuming you mean top level fighters. I get this attitude... Lets be honest his record is padded to an extent but every fighters is. De La Hoya was past it by the point he fought Mayweather, as was Mosely. Cotto was never the same after being cheated by Margarito and Pacman had already beat him. Marquez was getting there and fighting too heavy. Pacman he fought 3 years too late IMO, Alvarez was too young and not at his peak yet. He did beat Corrales, Castillo and Hatton who were all at their peak. I'm not discrediting Mayweather as his wise rises to me offset the age decline of a lot of the fighters. Pacquiao is the exception, though i do believe had Pacquiao not got KO'd off JMM, Mayweather doesn't take the fight and it was 3 years too late. He's a phenomenal fighter, would i put him up there with Sugar Ray Robinson, hell no, the calibre of fighters robinson fought and beat was far greater. However along with B-Hop and Pacquiao, he's in the conversation for being the best fighter post 2000", 5427, "TdmTjKt8aa", 3],

	36086 : ["Last I checked, most rankings had them both at a bit of an arm's length. Wladimir is habitually ranked outside the top 15 by qualified and casual scribes alike, and Vitali outside the top 20. And I'd say that's about what they derserve. They both checked longevity and versatility in a big way (especially Wladimir), but they also proved definitively that they were beatable, without enough of a linchpin win to counteract the dents in their head-to-head viability. Most of the established all time greats are generally considered to have made a stronger case. Still, the more you study the Klitschkos, the more you come to admire them. Wladimir's turn towards defensive ring generalship applied every ounce of the skill he showed in his younger, more aggressive days and then some. Watching him take the play away so utterly from boxers with at least some provable skill was like watching a man get crushed by a glacier. He forced opponents who remembered being so fierce and competent, only one fight ago, to chose between hanging back and hoping for a miracle, while the life was slowly ground out of them, or pushing themselves through more lethal pain, in exchange for pretty much nothing. And Vitali's iron jaw and fist make people forget how many tools he had as well, including stiff jabs and mobility that could leave you out in the cold, if you weren't prepared to close that door on him and force him to beat you down the old fashioned way. They did what they were supposed to do with what they had, and in another lifetime, who knows? Maybe the chips could have fallen their way even more. But then, that's not what you really want to hear, is it? Like the average old-school gatekeeper, you're so unable to do an honest assessment, you can't even tell that you're already holding all the cards (for now, at least) and have to use blethering hyperbole. Wladimir punches like a wimp compared to Ali? With a higher knockout percentage, even after more fights, far further into his twilight years? (Seriously, you tried to hype the ONE quality at which the greatest and possibly most complete heavyweight boxer was just decent?) Vitali's historically great 87% KO ratio didn't include the fight in which he tore his shoulder early, against one of the better chins he'd faced? And he feared the guy who was just another prospect when he retired, still a few fringe contenders away from a title challenge? Mike Tyson is ranked ahead of them more often than not as well, for the record, but using him in the same sentence you accused them of never beating legends was just icing on the cake.", 5429, "xmP6udDwaa", 0],
