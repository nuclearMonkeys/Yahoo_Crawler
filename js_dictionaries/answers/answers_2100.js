	110796 : ["Yes, I believe Nuclear is our best solution for the foreseeable future! A diverse mix of  power sources is necessary, but nuclear should play a much larger role, here are some pros and cons. PROS !. Fission is the most energy for the least fuel with current technology. 2. Less fuel means less waste, and the waste is all accounted for, not released into the atmosphere to become someone else's problem. 3. Uranium is readily available, very common in the earth's crust (about the same as tin) 4. Economical - operating cost about the same as coal, fuel cost is a much smaller percentage of the total, therefore less susceptible to price fluctuations. 5. Reliable - Nuclear power plants have very high capacity factors. 6. No combustion, no Co, CO2 or SO2 released. 7. Creates jobs. 8. Reduce dependence on foreign oil/ fuel. Uranium available domestically and in oceans. 9. High temperature reactors could produce Hydrogen as well as electricity. 10. Fantastic safety record. CONS 1. Irrational fear of all things nuclear. 2. High cost to build and license, large initial investment for long term pay back. 3. Publicly accepted high level storage facility not domestically available. 4. Reprocessing facility not domestically available. 4. High cost of personnel. 5. Security concerns; terrorism, nuclear proliferation Nuclear power, I believe is the best, safest, most reliable, current technology to provide energy. The plants operating now are safe and the new designs are even safer. Building 100's of new nuclear power plants would improve the economy, reduce or eliminate dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, reduce pollution, and provide for future technological advancement.  I have been working with nuclear power for about 30 years, I would be glad to have a Nuclear power plant or high level waste disposal facility in my backyard. My family and I live in a home within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant. (where I work) I have a great understanding of the risks involved and am completely comfortable with a plant \"in my backyard\".  Using Chernobyl as a reason not to build is like saying because of the Hindenburg I will never fly in a commercial airliner. Nuclear power has the smallest environmental impact of any current energy production method per unit of energy produced. One fuel pellet about the size of a pencil eraser produces the same energy as about 1 ton of coal, and if reprocessed 2/3 of what's left can be reclaimed. Nuclear power is our best option for reliable, environmentally friendly, base-load electrical power. By the way a US Nuclear Powered Aircraft Carrier can go more than 20 years before refueling the reactor.", 10148, "y0MnsQRNaa", -4],

	110814 : ["Although nuclear power can provide for the energy needs of the future, but it is not a \"green\" energy.  The social cost we all have to pay in the future outweighs the benefits of nuclear plants / nuclear energy, taking the lessons from our past experiences with nuclear plant all over the world. Alternatively, more R&D should be channeled into areas of wind, solar, & water energy generation.  The key word here is alternative \"green\" energy.  After all, we only have 1 earth and it is clear to all of us that polluting it further would only result in killing ourselves and our future generations.  Only \"green\" energy guarantees our & future generations' continued existence on this one and only home we have; Earth. As in all developments, initial development costs are high but as we develop and move towards \"green\" energy, there is invariably a tipping point where \"green\" energy becomes economically viable energy. Furthermore, how can human kind trade-off the cost of developing clean energy against the known certainty of pure negative environmental effects of nuclear plants ? There should not be a consideration of developing further nuclear power plants at all, in the face of certainty of the negative effects to the environment.  \"Green\" and clean energy should be pursued as the future energy solution for the future.", 10148, "cZyfxELLaa", 0],
	110815 : ["Nuclear power plants is worth it and it is a good solution for future energy. As we can see, one of the aircraft carrier belongs to U.S can go around the world without refueling for 1 year. This is a great news because of new source of energy but in the other way round we should see the radioactive waste that produce by this nuclear power plant. This kind of waste can be harm to human, animal, earth even ozone. It is too risky.  If we are prepared to heal the human, animal, earth even ozone from the radioactive, than we can welcome the new source of energy called NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.", 10148, "We5ynHltaa", 2],
	110816 : ["Yes, it do. But there is disadvantages to use nuclear energy. That is because will be a lot of the waste produced, whether it is fusion or fission.
