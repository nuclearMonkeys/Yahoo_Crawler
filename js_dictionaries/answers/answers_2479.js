Let's face the facts and cut the crap, if you read a story about a woman who was found dead in the river, you might think that is sad for a second, but you would forget about it very fast. But American society is so drugged up on drama and action that no one would give a rats ***, except that the woman who played Wonder Woman found her. I mean do you think that if that didn't happen that the story would have even spread beyond the local community? Individuals in a society are smart and compassionate, but the society as a whole is uncaring and violent. To quote a line from Men in Black, \"Individuals are smart(I can't remember what he uses might be individuals), people are stupid.\" Journalists only write stories that they know people are going to read.

What you usually trying to do is either a) find some function that is the continuous analogue of a discrete function, for example the way the Gamma function behaves such that Γ(n+1) = n! or b) find some function that when expanded as a power series has the values of your recursive sequence as the coefficients of the terms in the series. But there is, as far as I know, no general purpose technique to derive such functions. Also for a recursive function you need to pin at least one starting value such as A(0) or A(1).

And some have been noble in their search for the \"truth\" behind the big stories and have exposed some major wrong doings in the past.   But most tend to conform to the types of stories editors think will \"make it\" for the readers. So over time what becomes \"popular\" is a reflection of society.
