To answer your question...   if you were to taste a vegetarian roast side-by-side with the real thing, the difference would be very apparent.  But the distinction is far less noticeable to someone who hasn't tasted real meat in months or even years.  For many of them, vegetarian meat is a perfectly acceptable substitute for the real thing.", 6501, "piZ4xDBqaa", 0],

The world is already so over populated that every other problem is increased because of it. You think, with five kids, you could still work? Forget about it ! You are not only a prime candidate for birth control, but I would vote for total sterilization because of your immature and unrealistic attitude.  If you want to focus on helping him to \"become a better man\", good luck, people are what they are.

	45368 : ["Grass feeding is not just referring to the type of food they are eating, it also refers to the type of feeding method they are using. Grass fed beef is cattle which are eating grass sure, but are also roaming around the meadow finding their own grass, rather than stuck in a barn being force-fed their food. So they are getting a little exercise while they are feeding, thus they don't get as fat as cattle which aren't roaming around. This is much better than the previous feeding method where farms would refeed ground up cattle to living cattle to get them to fatten up further. Cannibal cows are not for me.", 6511, "bz34wCGSaa", 0],

Look on a dating site at the different men on there, you will realise the majority are average or below, but there's a tiny minority that are between 7-10 and they always stand out. People like your profile cos they like what they see, but when you message them, they probably feel too intimidated to reply!
