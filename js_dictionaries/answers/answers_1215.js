	66254 : ["You don't need to get too precise. The ovulation calendar is only a rough guess - your mileage may vary a few days either way. Sperm can live 2 or 3 days waiting for the egg and the egg will wait a day or so for sperm to show up before it dies; so there's a 3 to 5 day window where you can \"catch\".  So you don't know for sure if that calculator is accurate. You can google \"Cervical Mucus\" which can give you a bit of a clue when you ovulate, but the exact time is still one of the fun mysteries of life. By now, all you can do is wait and see. That's another of life's fun mysteries. Some home tests claim to detect pregnancy within 9 or 10 days; but usually you have to wait about 14 days to be sure. Test early if you want. If you test too early, all that happens is that it could say \"No\" instead of \"yes'. Having sex around your fertile time always means a very good chance for getting pregnant. So all you can do is wait and hope and see what happens. After the 28th or you should have a clue one way or the other. Some women catch first month, some take months or a few take years.

Not even Dr Goebbells, aided by distorted versions by Nietzsche\"s sister of her brother\"s writings, could make a mass-movement out of it. This Superman (Overman, one who has transcended man, gone beyond the ordinary man, is a much better translation) was never meant to refer to the germans as a race at all. In fact, Nietzsche distrusted, even feared, anything to do with the masses, knowing that whatever is or becomes popular can be of no esteem. It can become dangerous though. The Higher Men, the forerunners of the future Overmen, are advised:\".......the mob blink and say; you Higher Men, there are no Higher Men, men are all equal before God.\"\"  Before God!

	66311 : ["Nietzsche believes that it is possible to escape the trap of the rational (everyday) man, that an individual may transcend social conventions and use language in a creative way that allows him (and potentially others) to understand the true reality that he experiences; this is the intuitive man (or Superman/ Ubermench).  The intuitive man was once a rational man and has moved beyond the restrictions of a life of reason. He does not try to hide from his suffering and allows himself to experience things freely.   The life of the intuitive man, however, is not one of complete suffering.  In fact, the intuitive man is able to experience things that would not be possible if he were still acting as a rational man; he is free from conventions, has been liberated from controlling metaphors and is able to live according to a creative inner drive; he can live according to his passions.  The rational man uses metaphors to subvert, suppress and hide his emotions, while the intuitive man is able to embrace emotions and to allow them to guide his life; this man is the creator of art.  The intuitive man is in touch with his inner self, with his emotions, that which drives him to creativity, happiness, and misery.   Truth, for the intuitive man, is completely subjective.  He tries to embrace life without presuppositions.  This attempt to experience things without the influence of socialized conventions and assumptions allows the individual to be himself when he relates to and attempts to understand other things that exist in the world.      The intuitive man is only able to assert what is true to him in this world.  He does not attempt to understand the way that others would view a particular object.  Instead, his focus is to gain the best understanding of the way that he experiences things.  This allows the intuitive individual to become aware of himself in way that is impossible for the rational man, who is caught of in the web of metaphors and conventions that attempt (futilely) to connect themselves to other individuals in the world.", 8328, "AA10493109", 0],

	66316 : ["Nietzsche famously put forward the idea that \"God is dead\", and this death may result in radical perspectivism or may lead one to confront the fact that humans have always regarded truth perspectivally. Nietzsche also distinguished between master and slave moralities, the former arising from a celebration of life, the latter the result of ressentiment at those capable of the former. This distinction becomes in summary the difference between \"good and bad\" on the one hand, and \"good and evil\" on the other; importantly, the \"good\" man of the master morality equates to the \"evil\" man of the slave morality. The superman is someone who in discovering himself  also discovers that it is in his best interests to reject any outside notions about values, trusting rather what he finds within himself. He creates his own good and evil, based on that which helps him to succeed or fail. In this way good is something which helps one to realize his potential and evil is whatever hampers or stands in the way of this effort. Since to Nietzsche everything in the world, including good and evil, is transitory  everything is being continually reinvented. The superman embraces this idea of change which to him appears evident, he understands the fact that since there is nothing in the world which is permanent whatever exists must eventually be overcome by something else which comes along. Seeing himself and his values in the same light he knows that these aspects must also be overcome by something stronger if not by him than by someone or something else. So in order to keep up with the times he continuously reinvents himself over and over always building something stronger, more powerful, on top of what went before. The superman therefore is the ideal of someone who has mastered the practice of overcoming himself.", 8328, "XmavGLljaa", 1],
