	96435 : ["I converted to islam because Islam is beauty and perfection. Islam is the last religion sent by God but also a way of life. Why Islam? Because I trully believe, we shouldn't pray to saints, confess our sins, believe that God could take sons, that Jesus died on the cross and that only through Jesus we can reach God and so on and so forth. Muslims believe in the bible but in the original bible not in today's bible. I was christian-orthodox before and I converted for me not for a man. Many people are thinking I married a rich Arab but I'm not married yet. People is misjudging Islam because they know very few about Islam and Muslims. I also needed to leave my home, because I am a \"disgrace\" for my familly. The don't like the way I dress and they think I shouldn't wear hijab. I am glad I found my peace of mind, elhamdoulillah.

I, personally, used to hate Tegan (don't ask me why). Rose was good as a typical low-skilled London teenager who turns out to have bags of compassion, bravery and common-sense, while Martha is a highly-skilled London (bit of a London-bias here?!) woman who turns out to have bags of compassion, bravery and common-sense.

Because we did not have to learn so much with her we basically were not given as much background for Martha and she also got proportionally less screen time per story because Martha was a character while Rose was a character and a plot device.

	96443 : ["I think Martha has been excellent so far (considering we've only seen her in 4 episodes). To my mind the situation between the Doctor and Martha has been a lot more like that between the Doctor and his companions in the classic series. I liked Rose a lot, and I think Billy Piper is a great young actress,  but the series was getting a bit too close to soap opera when Rose and her family were involved in the majority of stories. Currently its just the Doctor and his companion travelling in space and time, just as it should be and just as it always was prior to Rose. For those who say they prefer Rose and want her back - I prefer Susan and want her back, but she left Doctor Who in 1964 and Carole Ann Ford who played her must be about 70 by now :-)) That's the nature of Doctor Who. Companions change and Doctors change, but as long as the basic principle of the show stays the same, and as long as the writing and story telling are up to scratch, it will continue to be must see television for me.

I am happy to answer any questions you have and help educate you about Islam and quash any fears for me you may have. All I ask at this time is your patience and love, nothing that I did not ask of you before. I understand it might take you a while to accept my decision but in the meantime, I love you and that remains the same.'' Of course you might be surprised though and they might not have an issue with it, it might be the easiest conversation you ever had. I reverted to Islam and it was hard and many did not understand but 5 years down the line they know it was the best decision for me and I was lucky that my parents (protestant and christian with Atheist brothers) have always supported any path in life I chose.

So what sect have you chosen shia sunni? as only one sect will get paradise. Abu Amir al- Hawdhani said, \"Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan stood among us and said, 'Beware! The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood among us and said': 'Beware! The People of the Book before (you) were split up into 72 sects, and this community will be split up into 73, seventy-two of them will go to Hell and one of them will go to Paradise, and it is the majority group\" Let us see what we understand here, is this why Sunnis are bombing Shi'ite mosques, to be the MAJORITY GROUP?  But still, which one of the sects are correct and which ones are going to hell (there can only be one right one) lets leave that to allah, it is a specialist at throwing people into \"Hellfire\" and giving them new skin so that they will burn again and again. FYI, I have heard your comments about accepting islam months back, get over it already.", 9586, "xv7KV1jAaa", 2],
	96480 : ["asalamualikum, how are you!! Alumdulilah Allah heas guided you towards the truth. welcome to a family of over 1.5 billion brothers and sisters. i am not sure if you know this but when you become a muslim all your past sin are forgiven. how exciting. i want to wish you luck in your journey. please pray for all muslims and may Allah contiue to guide you and make you a more happy and better person. as for your questioon,Oftentimes, this is a situation which is best handled with care. There are no exact directions that I can offer to you, because how you and your family deal with this is based on a number of things: your age, your community, your relationship with your family, your previous religious experiences, your parents' commitment (or lack of) to a certain religion, and their willingness to explore new ideas. Although it seems like a wacky idea, it has been said by other converts, and now by myself as well, that it oftentimes might be better to wait six months, a year or more to tell them. The reasons for this vary: you need to be more established in Islamic practices, and you need time to make friends and build a support system within the Muslim community. This is so that if your parents react to your announcement by attempting to \"deprogram you,\" or schedule \"an appointment\" with the local minister / priest / rabbi, you will be able to rely on your knowledge of Qur'an, and the strength that being a practicing Muslim has given you. Allowing yourself time to build a support system within the Muslim community is important so that you will have friends to help and guide you, to help answer any questions or concerns your family might have, and to help you out should your parents decide that you can no longer live in their house.  Another reason that it might be wise to wait awhile is to allow your parents to see the positive changes that Islam will bring about in you: greater care to hygiene and appearance, greater discipline in your daily activities and your schoolwork, the fact that you are not falling under negative peer pressure to drink or drug or have sex, that you are more willing to honor your parents by helping around the house, that you are more attentive in your job (if you have one), etc. Allow them time to be pleased with these positive changes, so that they may see that Islam is for the better, not just for you, but for all people. If they see that Islam is \"good for you,\" they may react more positively when you talk with them about it.  If you are fearful that your family may react with physical abuse, or a kidnapping and \"deprogramming\" attempt (yes, it happens), please make sure that you have someone there as a witness and support. Whether you are Muslim or not, you have the right not to be abused. If your family is abusive towards you, seek the necessary help to get out of that situation as soon as possible.  if you are an adult:As an adult, especially one who lives on their own, and who may be married, your parents and family are already aware that you are entitled to your own decisions. There are some converts who are not bothered one way or the other with the way their family may react because of this reality. However, for many others, it is important to them that their family respect and accept their decision. It may be difficult, especially if there are children or a disliked son-in-law involved. dealing with siblings: Many of us have at least one sibling, and it is important that you deal with any siblings you may have on an individual basis, if at all possible. If you are a teenager, this means talking to younger and older siblings in person, and letting them ask any questions of you that they may have. Let them know you are the same person who may argue about whose night it is to do the dishes, and that you are still their brother or sister. Stress that you still love them, especially if they are very young, and unable to understand why you don't go to Church anymore. Above all, make sure that you are acting as a proper role model for both your younger and older brothers and sisters. The most important thing, and I can't stress this enough, is that you do not allow yourself to get dragged into a \"Christianity vs. Islam,\" \"Judaism vs. Islam,\" \"Hinduism vs. Islam,\" or any sort of interfaith debate with your parents or other family members. Oftentimes, I have heard of new Muslims whose parents or siblings are in the Christian ministry, and who have been baited, taunted, and condemned by them. DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO DRAG YOU INTO A CONFLICT REGARDING RELIGION AT ALL. If a family member hurls a \"judgment\" at you (i.e., \"You're a Satan worshipper who's going to hell!\"),  do NOT respond in kind! If your relationship outside of this religious difference is salvageable, then avoid any religious discussions until everyone is willing to discuss it in a more open minded and civilized manner. The second most important thing is that you do not allow yourself to become an act", 9586, "None", -2],
