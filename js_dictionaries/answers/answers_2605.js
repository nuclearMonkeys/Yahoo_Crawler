	136108 : ["It is clear that social services and the police do not believe that the best place for Shannon right now is with her mother and step-father, otherwise that is where she would be.  Of course Shannon needs to be interviewed to get the full picture of what has been happening to her since she disappeared (and possibly before in case that is relevant too) but this would not necessarily preclude her from returning to her family.   According to the media reports, she has not even spent any time with her mother or family - her mother just confirmed her identity by seeing her through a 2 way mirror.  At the very least, I would expect her to be allowed to have some supervised visits with her family even if she does not return home just yet. There really is no other conclusion to be drawn - it is not believed to be in Shannon's best interests to be allowed contact with her family now.  This does not mean that her mother or step-father have had any direct involvement in her disappearance.  The decision to keep her in care could also relate to circumstances before her abduction which have only just come to light.  This decision may of course change as the investigation continues and this may (and probably should) happen in private.  Either way, it is likely her mother has been told to be very careful about what she says to the media and her statements are probably vetted by social services before release - if there is any doubt about her parenting (and the circumstances suggest this is the case right now), she would only make it worse by shooting her mouth off to the press.
