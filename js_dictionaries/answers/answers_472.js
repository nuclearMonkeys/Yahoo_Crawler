	26160 : ["If you have an ulcer, the venom will get into your bloodstream. I recall a story in a magazine about someone who used to sell curare and would downplay the value of a competitor's curare by swallowing some of it. The competitor gave him some fresh pineapple.

You can potentially have your pet housed in the pet shop under such an arrangement by setting a high price on it and hope that nobody buys it.  2. There are pet hotels or boarding facilities for dogs and cats. When pet owners go on vacation, they can check their pets in and pay a fee and pick their pets up when they come back from vacation. It probably won't be cheap.. 3. Rent a run down apartment and keep your pet there while you live elsewhere. ", 4128, "None", -1],
	26182 : ["Yes, but why would you want to do that? That would make it someone else's per, at your expense. Get a small monitor; Komodo monitors aren't that great as pets anyway.", 4128, "DVdX6I4kaa", -1],

	26184 : ["It can be difficult for both new mom and pet to adjust when a kid is born, but it's by no means impossible to balance both, as many MANY people manage. Some new moms feel that maybe their pet would be neglected with the new baby around, from affection to feeding and playtimes, and it can be a lot. Some new moms also get it in their head that the pet will attack the kid or something. Some pets DO NOT ADJUST AT ALL to a new baby and will act out, try as the new parents might, it just doesn't happen. And some new moms get overwhelmed, no matter how prepared they think they are. You have a newborn to feed and take care of, and on top of that, a cat to still feed and take care of. Enlist HELP when needed. If you have to pay a kid $20 to come over and clean out the litter box and feed a few times per day, so be it. If you feel like setting a timer on your phone or writing something down will help you remember, so be it. You will be exhausted, there are no two ways around that, so ask for help if you need to.  So while you still have some sane hormones for now, you can read up all you can on introducing your pet to the baby process and once the baby is actually born, go from there. Many new moms think it's ok to not let the pet into the new nursery or have them be around anything baby-related at all: WRONG. You should get the kitty in the new room, let them smell all the lotions and wipes, let them \"claim\" the new crib, carseat, and swings, and play the mobile, talk in the monitor, set off toys. This is going to be his life in 9 months, so getting the cat used to new things now is a good idea. Once you start to show, you can even introduce kitty to baby bump. You already smell different, so it's not like your cat doesn't know, just has no idea that another human is being formed. Many pets are very gentle when the new baby arrives; they just want to sniff and figure out the little hairless potato for themselves, so let them, ALWAYS MONITOR THE BABY, and with caution, of course. Once the baby arrives, try to see how your cat is adjusting. If he kind of shys away from you and hides, it's ok. He's just trying to get used to it. If he's pooping and peeing outside the litter box, he's begging for attention. Do not punish. Instead, right now, give your kitty extra love and attention, and get him used to baby things now.", 4118, "0V875zvYaa", 3],
