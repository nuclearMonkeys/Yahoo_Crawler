	56382 : ["Not usually.  It can if the surface is totally impermeable, but that is extremely unusual.  If there is open space in the ground, even tiny open space, some of the surface runoff will fall into it, and as long as the open space connects to other open space, some of that water will make it downhill by passing through the underground. Around here where I live, it is pretty common to encounter the water table at somewhere around 1-2 m below surface, sometimes as much as several meters, depending on the situation.  But it is always there.  Some of the runoff always bleeds into the ground instead of making it all the way to a surface water body.  Just a matter of what proportion. The question is a bit vague or too specific, I cannot tell which, because the term \"surface runoff\" could be taken to mean any water which does not infiltrate, and does not evaporate, and thus excludes any portion of some of the runoff which might evaporate or sink into the ground even if spending part of the trip on the surface, and thus it must all end up at some surface water body eventually. If water stays as surface runoff the entire distance, it will end up in a waterbody.  But that is pretty well defining the term \"surface runoff\" as water which travels all the way to a waterbody without some diversion through a different route, so the answer is defined as yes.  If you use the term to mean water which runs overland the entire way until reaching a water body, it definitely will be water that does exactly that or the term won't apply and you wouldn't call it that. But to answer, not all surface runoff stays on the surface all the way and so becomes not-surface runoff.", 7827, "WbVE1cXKaa", 0],

	56384 : ["No. Because \"all\" and \"directly\" usually mean the answer is no. Or more to the point of your question, because some of it doesn't.

Of course I don't know that simply repealing Daylight Savings will help all that much... where I live the sunrise in June currently occurs at around 5:50am. If we repeal Daylight Savings then in June the sunrise would be at 4:50am. And then we would lose an hour of sunlight in the evening as sunset would change from the current 8:50pm to now be at 7:50pm. I would rather have an extra hour of light in the evening rather than an extra hour of light in the morning. And repealing Daylight Savings does nothing to help us in the winter since DST runs from March to November. That is why some have suggested that rather than getting rid of Daylight Savings we should keep it year round and get rid of Standard Time. Where I live the sun sets at around 5pm in December, so switching to Daylight Savings year round would make it so we still have sunlight until 6pm. However, in December we don't have sunrise until about 7:40am, so getting rid of Standard Time and going to Daylight Savings year round would mean that the sun doesn't come out until 8:40am.
