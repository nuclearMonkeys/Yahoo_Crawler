	104056 : ["It sounds like you are on your way to tactacool, when you put on the commando quad rail, make sure you remove the barrel band, if not it will apply pressure on the barrel and change your point of impact or even compromise your accuracy. If you are looking for a butt stock Extension here it is. This one ads about 2 inches to the pull length of the stock. If you are going to keep the stock barrel, you might try this to get the most accuracy out of it. Buy 10 different, 50 rnd boxes of .22LR ammo (velocity's of 1100 and less will perform the best),  on a nice day using the bi-pod, shoot 3/ 5 round groups of each ammo at 25 yards, make sure you label the target of the ammo shot for each 15 rounds so you know which ammo worked best in your barrel.  Even out of 10 different ammo's, you will see a big difference in your groups, 1 1/2\" groups down to 3/4\" groups. The big difference in groups is because each barrel is made a little different and has different stresses induced on it in the manurfacturing process, each ammo has different bullet weights, bullet shapes, powder types and charges. These variables create different explosions in the chamber, each sending different vibrations down the barrel called harmonics or barrel whip. It would look like a sound wave with the bore as the center point with the high and low points of the wave or whip being above and below the barrel. The smaller groups will be when the sound wave gets close or crosses the bore as the bullet exits the bore, the 1 1/2\" or 2\" groups will be when the bullet exits the bore, at the soundwave high or low points. Hope this helps. If you want to make your rifle work as cool as it looks, try this website.", 9865, "VNlEl4aEaa", 0],

I still have a daughter in the next town. I'm making cookies & we put up a few decorations, but that's it. My daughter & I are going to cook   dinner together & our guys will be there to partake. (We could feed them hot dogs & they'd be happy!) The few gifts are little things I picked up throughout the year when I saw something I thought someone would like. I'm not crazy about jewelry nor flowers (although I'll take some good chocolate).  Back to Martha.....in that minimum security prison she \"attended\", they had a decorating contest & she lost! I loved that! I found a pack of beef ribs for $4.00 the other day, so I cooked them for the 3 dogs after we were done with the grill the other night & the coals were still hot. I guarantee they will like them! OK...I've ranted enough. Have a great holiday in whatever you choose to do. My motto is: \"Do no harm, help those you can. Peace!", 9862, "AA12038658", 5],

	104064 : ["I think a lot of it is that people do not like to 'give in' and 'admit defeat.'  Everyone thinks they can fix everything on their own.. Price is another factor I think.. In my area, training is either very, very expensive or very cheap.. You just have to know where to look.  I just want to add that I'm not against people working with horses on their own, but you have to take time to educate yourself and know when to step away and ask for help if the situation calls for it.. Almost all training problems are the direct result of being spoiled, mishandled, poorly started, ect by people.  I do quite a bit of training and re-training for people and most problems I see are very easily avoided in the first place or could be easily fixed.   I offer a sizable discount to my prices if the owner comes to so many training sessions to at least watch and maybe participate if the situation allows.  I love to see people who are actively interested in their horses progress and want to learn with them.. I do most of my work with 'problem' horses, trail horses, and reiners.. But I've seen a bit of everything.. I charge $500/month, down to $250 depending on how many sessions the owner makes.", 9872, "155tC9ltaa", 3],
	104065 : ["We'll the way i see it, if i send my horse to a pro, my horse learns how to be a good horse and i learn nothing. i think it's better to find a trainer that lives close to you and will work with you and the horse. Most problems arise from owners not knowing how to deal with the horse. But if every time a person has a problem with the horse, they send it to a pro trainer, they never learn to be a real horse person and work with horses.  It is also very expensive. If you have tons of money you can afford to send the horse to a pro every time it decides to throw a buck, then you are lucky. most people don't have that kind of money, so people try to find the cheaper way to help the horse and the person.  just my opinions.", 9872, "neBbQURPaa", 1],
	104066 : ["I guess unless the problem is dangerous, people want to sort the problem themselves and learn from them.  If a trainer works on a horse and the problem is solved, but then he comes back to his owner, the horse is likely to revert back to character and it will be a waste of money especially if the horse has not been retrained with the rider.

	104084 : ["Because it's freakin expensive. Most people on here aren't rich. They are barley getting by with what they have. I disagree with the poster below me (and thanks for the thumbs down - like it isn't obvious). You can't expect all the people who just have horse's for \"fun\" to be able to afford a professional trainer. I mean if you are planning on being competitive then sure you need to be able to afford a trainer but if it's just for fun...no.  ------ Me personally, I would never send my horse off to a professional trainer. I know 100% what I'm doing and why I'm doing it and I don't trust 98% of trainers out there anyway. I know I can trust myself to have researched what's correct though.  For example, I bought a clinic DVD by Sandy Ferrell, a top hunter rider. She was training someones horse for them and she had a German martingale on the horse and spurs (that by the way were rubbing the horse's side raw) and she was saying and I quote \"When I got this horse I didn't really know what to do because he has a buck\" and I was like oh my gosh. You are training a horse but don't know what to do when a horse has a buck. She also was jumping him over fences and complaining about how his jumps aren't consistent...if that is the case it's called gymnastics...duh! And on top of that he was a three yr. old and jumping. Which is the kicker. If she was smart she'd know a horse shouldn't be broken until they were 4, more the less jumped! If she was smart she would have refused to ride him at three. Just goes to show you that even TOP riders don't know what they are doing. Another example, Phillip Dutton...I saw a video of him and he was saying \"if my horse gets rubbed on his withers I just treat it like a minor wound and don't pay much attention to it\". If he was smart he'd find the cause and eliminate it. I hate to bash all of these riders but it's true...most people don't know what they are talking about.", 9872, "None", 3],
