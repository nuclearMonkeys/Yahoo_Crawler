However, years prior to that I was on an atkins diet and also lost a quick amount of weight. Maybe both of them caused the gallstones. However, now I'm thinking of doing atkins again... however, with no gall bladder there's no place to store up bile to process fat... so does that mean that I can't do a high protein/fat diet?", 11573, "ydsWlVIzaa", 0],

	143254 : ["I think unassisted birth is wonderful. It is about standing back and allowing the laboring body to do what it needs to do and what it KNOWS to do. Intervention from doctor's is not needed 98% of the time. Birth is a money maker in today's hospitals which is why the AMA and most doctor's are pressuring for births to happen in a medical setting. These high-intervention doctors cause complications to happen for those who want to birth naturally and then (still not leaving well enough alone) go on to \"clean up\" with poor solutions such as epidurals and/or C-sections. If you research you might understand what I mean.   Our son was born unassisted. In the months leading up to his birth we intuitively knew two things: One, that our home was the safest place for him to be born. Two, that he was meant to be born with only my husband and I present. We felt much peace in these things . For months we studied up so that we would know beforehand what to do in this or that situation. But beyond that what it came down to was our instinct and intuition. It was our intuition that let us know that everything would be alright and a mix of intuition and instinct that guided us along the way. The body knows how to birth. It does not need \"help\". If you haven't already check out these websites and articles: Btw, the high rate of death in childbirth that happened \"back in the day\" was because of unsanitary living conditions. Same for the high death rate in other countries. That and just general poor quality living. That is why it is so important to maintain a healthy pregnancy. The baby and body need it...not just for the development of the baby, but also for those important last steps - the labor and birth!", 11570, "kKq0ki5haa", -4],
	143255 : ["I think it's incredibly selfish. I'm sorry, I know that some people seem to go for it, but birth is about the child, not the mother. I don't like hospitals, but I gave birth there - twice - because I knew that there was the staff and equipment available in the same building should something go wrong. Home births aren't for me, but I can accept them (although I think especially in the UK, with the current midwife shortage and the fact that home birth takes up MORE midwife care than hospital, that it's also quite selfish) for other people, but free birthing is just asking for trouble. I think a lot of things depend on what your perception of a good birth is. For me, it was in a hospital, secure with a good midwife and my husband with me. For others, they're more comfortable at home and prefer to go without meds - it's a personal choice. But freebirthing is not fair to the baby.", 11570, "r7q8LW7Aaa", 1],

	143270 : ["I think doctors/pharmacists/nurses etc. should be required to disclose their limitations (whether self-imposed or not) when they apply for a job. If there is something on the job description that they are unable or unwilling to do, then they should not get hired. I do think it is hypocritical of them to impose their will on patients and other doctors by hiding a request by the patient from them. As a metaphor consider: if someone is not able to lift something over 50 pounds, they might still be able to other parts required of a job, but they would go find someone to help them lift if it was necessary; they should not going and leave something in undone (unlifted) in the middle of the floor then HIDE the fact that it is not done from other people who could complete the task. BTW, the doctor or whatever is perfectly fine to learn a specialized version of medicine that does not use certain techniques; how else would their cult/religion get medical care unless they had special doctors trained in those techniques. If those doctors were to apply for a job OUTSIDE their specialized group, however, they should accept their limitations. They might have to get a lesser position or take a lower pay scale because they are limited. If they are so intrusive that they cannot allow other people to get their jobs done as well, then the nut-job belongs in their little commune with the other people like them.", 11570, "ruLdWILsaa", 0],

McCain's time was mostly spent on storytelling and \"feelings not facts\" that I think we've all had quite enough of for one lifetime. His anecdote about the soldier's wristband was disrespectful- this was not the time for heart-rending stories, or gleaning votes from dead people. McCain's feeling good about the economy, is he? Well, that's great, but he needs to go sit in one of his several mansions and contemplate that, because reality dictates otherwise. Obama represents a different kind of politics- he's honest. I just heard one news reporter describe him like a dog-whisperer in that younger people can still recognise honesty while older people just aren't hearing it. I don't know if older Americans have become so jaded that we can't even recognise the truth when we hear it, or if we're so inclined to egalitarianism that we just can't stand to point out that someone is EVER at fault for something, without quickly inserting that \"the other guy does it too\". Obama laid out clear plans in each of the topics discussed, and for once we have a Democratic candidate who has some courage.
