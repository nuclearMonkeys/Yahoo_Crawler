	138990 : ["In 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature (also trademarked WWF), an environmental organization, sued World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. in the United Kingdom. The Law Lords agreed that the promotion company had violated a 1994 agreement as Titan Sports which had limited the permissible use of the WWF trademark in Europe, particularly in merchandising. The World Wide Fund and World Wrestling Federation used the initials since March 1979.The last televised event to market the WWF logo was UK based pay-per-view Insurrextion 2002. On May 5, 2002, the company launched its \"Get The F Out\" marketing campaign and changed all references on its website from \"WWF\" to \"WWE\", while switching the URL from WWF.com to WWE.com. The next day, a press release announced the official name change from World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., or WWE, and the change was publicized later that day during a telecast of Monday Night Raw, which was broadcast from the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut.   Following the case, the use of the \"Attitude\" logo became prohibited on all World Wrestling Federation properties. Additionally, past references to the WWF trademark and initials in 'specified circumstances' became censored. Despite litigation, WWE is still permitted use of the original WWF logo, which was used from 1979 through 1994, as well as the \"New WWF Generation\" logo, which was used from 1994 through 1998. Furthermore, the company may still make use of the full \"World Wrestling Federation\" and \"World Wrestling Federation Entertainment\" names without consequence. In 2003, WWE won a limited decision to continue marketing certain classic video games from THQ and Jakks Pacific that contained the WWF \"Attitude\" logo.However, the packaging was changed to replace all WWF references with WWE.", 11411, "B8yYVMs8aa", -1],

	138994 : ["You said it yourself, that encounter a decade ago of Cena shaking Undertaker's hand was pretty significant. Though, that can't certainly be the only reason why the match is \"destined\" to happen.  We all consider Cena as the top guy in the company. That is universally accepted and true. I clearly recognize the guy's uniqueness in the company, being able to handle ANY crowd, and always being able to get a reaction. Undertaker has done that as well.  Cena has been here young and strong for a decade, and he really still is aside from minor injuries. The guy is controversially at his prime, some may say years ago, some may say years to come. When any superstar is in such a position, you know he's special.  Finally, Cena doesn't lose cleanly. Only rarely. Same applies to Undertaker, especially at WrestleMania, of course. Cena's gimmick is plain and simple- never give up. The classic moral we find in nearly every story, never ever give up. Being applied to the wrestling world of course made it seem idealistic and unreal, in the sense that only superheroes can obtain that gimmick and make it work. Nobody else had this gimmick and been able to work it as finely as Cena. Except for Undertaker.  Put these two megastars in the main event at Mania, and you're calling for a very unpredictable anything goes match. This is the one match people are completely scared of, and this is why it must happen. The IWC can ***** all they want about Cena potentially ruining the streak, but that's the whole ******* point. These type of matches are best when nobody but the two wrestlers and Vince know the outcome. Bleacher Report will rehash rumor and speculation articles for months, and not a single one of these articles will provide a solid, definite proof that either one will win. Punk vs Taker was very obvious. This match won't be. Considering also how Undertaker and Cena are the best at \"sudden kick outs\", this is a match where everybody will be on the edge of their seat.  I expect great things from this match which I feel very certain to happen. And if this turns into an I quit match, well, I'll let somebody else explain it since that's a whole another level of surprise.", 11409, "eXZ5O8vdaa", 1],

	139013 : ["This match, if it ever comes together, is very important to me. At my core, for all the analyzing I like doing of the WWE and wrestling in general, I'm a fan. I love seeing the big, epic dream matches. Cena/Rock, Triple H/Lesnar, Undertaker/Triple H. I love that. The biggest names on the biggest stages putting it all on the line. That's when wrestling is at it's best to me.  With that said, there is no bigger match under the current roster than John Cena vs. The Undertaker. Not Lesnar/Rock, not Rock/Undertaker, not Undertaker/Lesnar. None. Cena is my favorite wrestler, and The Undertaker is the best wrestler I've ever seen (and not far behind Cena on my list of all time favorites). To me as a fan, Cena vs. Undertaker at Wrestlemania is the ultimate dream match. Nothing even comes close to it.  Plus, the symmetry of it all comes together next year. Wrestlemania 30. The Undertaker's, seemingly, last match. Cena always excels on the grandest stages of them all. The Streak has, as The Dragon said, transcended everything else in the WWE. It's bigger than any title. The potential of ending The Streak is the biggest thing a WWE superstar, any WWE superstar, could hope to accomplish in his career. Nothing even compares, really.  The Streak, especially since Wrestlemania 23, is truly amazing, but it lacks one name. Cena. Batista, Edge, Micahels, Triple H, Punk. All of them are elite stars with great pedigrees (pun kind of intended), but none of them are the face of the company. None of them are the biggest star of the last decade, the Austin or Hogan of this generation of fans. Cena is THE GUY in that regard. The Undertaker can run the streak for as long as he wants, but unless he faces John Cena, it'll always remain incomplete.  At the end of the day, that's the single biggest reason for not only why this match should happen, but why it HAS to happen.  BQ: Not to me. I only say that because I have very little first hand knowledge or experience with them. They were before my time. I know that isn't the most solid answer of all time, but it's the one I kind of have to go with.  To me, Evolution is probably the greatest stable I've ever seen.", 11409, "rseD4OG2aa", 5],

	139031 : ["Because both superstars have virtually broken the barrier of popularity throughout their careers and they've yet to have a major rivalry. The Undertaker is among a very thin class of the greatest of all time, not just to the WWE population but wrestling fans as a whole, too. He's become more than just an asset to the company; he's a legendary presence, a God among men if you will. And his streak list consists of men just like him, including Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels and Triple H who are all mega-stars in their own right. But there's still one man on the roster whose presence is just as important, who's just as close to The Undertaker's level of prominence than anyone else in the history of professional wrestling, and that's John Cena. And until The Undertaker beats Cena at Wrestlemania, his career is incomplete.  John Cena, like The Undertaker, has transcended traditional value. He's been the WWE's main financial source for eight years. Though he's not the most.. \"beloved\" name throughout the online wrestling community, he's still popular among several other age demographics. You're right, John Cena and The Undertaker did have a short rivalry in 2003, but that was during Cena's \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick. He wasn't nearly as popular back then as he is today. Now that Cena's stock has risen beyond expectations, I think Wrestlemania 30 is the perfect place for The Undertaker's career to end (if that's where he plans to end it) and, even in loss, Cena will still gain the credibility that he deserves. Let's face it, there's no way the creative team is going to allow Cena to lose without him putting up a fight. If history serves us all right, wasn't it Randy Orton who lost to The Undertaker at Wrestlemania 21 and was still put over to the point where he became a multi-time World Champion? And wasn't it Shawn Michaels to fought The Undertaker at Wrestlemania 25 and 26 and, in loss both times, retired from wrestling known as the greatest wrestler of all time? It isn't about wins and losses against The Undertaker, it's about how much you brought The Undertaker to the wire and if or if not you left the ring with some pride and dignity. John Cena's personality further promotes the fact that he'll leave the ring, win or lose, known as The Undertaker's greatest challenge to date. And that benefits both The Undertaker and Cena. I don't think Undertaker or Cena can retire without this match happening, special emphasis on The Undertaker. Notice how he has wrestlers like Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, and Gorilla Monsoon, and Mark Henry on his streak list, but he doesn't have ANY wrestler on his list who has been the face of the company at some point. Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Rock, Stone Cold.. and there are several more. John Cena would be the only person on the streak list who's been the face of the company at some point and time; does that not boost the streak tenfold? The Undertaker can't afford to hang up his boots without putting them on one more time against John Cena. All signs point to this match happening at Wrestlemania 30. It's a milestone event (if you count by fives or tens), in one of the biggest stadiums in the country, among one of the loudest audiences in the world. I don't know what else could even come close if this match doesn't happen. BQ: I'm not too familiar with the Four Horsemen. I wasn't born around that time, nor was I watching wrestling around that time. In my opinion, the greatest stable of all time is Evolution.", 11409, "fZgEjsvgaa", 5],

Again, I smoked for thirty years and once I prepared myself I was able to stop and had no desires to go back.
