	97861 : ["Ok. This is a sticky one. Do not be offended. Thinking like a man.....he is showing you that he sees you as his partner, including the involvement with his daughter. You should have a relationship with his daughter that is healthy and involved. BUT, he should have discussed this with the childs mom, and then with you before doing ANYTHING. Unfortunately, he is not respecting your stance nor hers in this matter. Only his. This is not a bad thing from his point of view...he thinks he is doing what is best for his daughter. He would not be engaged to you if he did not think you were a fantastic person, and a great potentioal stpe mom! But, thinking like a girl now, he needs to know that when it comes to raising his daughter, it is him and his ex wife that raise her, you can be his helper, and the girl's friend and a good step mom, but things like this, you need to take the back seat. It is not an insult from his point of view at all! Remember this! From your point of view, and the mom's point of view it would be! Women think differentyl than guys do! He needs to be told in a really nice way that he has to have his priorities defined a little differently to show respect to all three of you ladies, and communication and truthfulness is the key to keeping the peace with all three of you. He just needs some coaching and some patience. This is going to take PRACTICE! Do not get in a fight with him, this might set the tone of your marraige to him later, so you need to make sure that this small thing is handled right here in the begining. Bigger things will come knocking, belevie me! If he does not communicate with you three correctly, things will blow up and everyone will be confused and unhappy, especially that little girl. Good luck! You might want to find a counselor to help you communicate and stay positive. It is easier to get coaching now than wait until things are harder and more complicated! And little girls become teens that are COMPLICATED! Since you are not married yet, and you have no custody over the little one, you should not really be parenting her. Once you are her step mom, you need to defer to the wants and needs of the child in relationship to the parents. I think that showin her mom respect by letting her be the parent is prudent. I really did not like my daughter's step mom. (She is not that much older than my daughter! LOL!) But, once they were married and my daughter was sometimes in her care, she would call me and tell me what my daughter was doing, ask advice aobut sleeping problems or how to connect with her. They lived in a different state, so she was will them the summers, and not near me at all.  She also encouraged her to call me and return my phone calls and write back when I sent letters. Being her mom's cheer leader is not a bad thing. She will see you as a team, not an enemy. You might want to enlist the help of a counselor in this and see what they might say. You could call athe ex and tell her you just want some time to talk to her by yourself. Tell her you want to keep the little princess happy and healthy. You know that as the mom she is in charge and you want to do whatever it takes to keep all of you feeling comfortable. If she needs help with child arrangements, you are her ally. If not, let her know that you will steer clear and not interfere. Encourage your man to be open and honest and communicate with everyone regularly. It can be done!   ", 9636, "xvey8ixPaa", 0],
	97862 : ["The ex wife is jealous and mad -- and I don't think you should put too much energy at this point into establishing a good relationship with her.  However, if you want to take some step in the right direction at this point, I suppose you could write her a letter telling her explaining that you really care about the daughter and plan for everyone's sake to do what you can to encourage harmonious relations between the mother, father, daughter and you.  You realize how upset she was about the accident when you dropped her daughter, but you want her to understand that you were absolutely traumatized by that, too, and that you try always to be really careful with the daughter, too.   Beyond that, your best bet is just to be nice to (and responsible with) the daughter, never bad-mouth the mother in front of the daughter, and work to make sure that you and the daughter establish a great relationship between you that isn't supposed to supplant or compete with her relationship with her mother.  SInce you're getting married to your fiance, you shouldn't shy away from taking responsibility for the daughter jsut because you're afraid of the ex wife -- you will inherit some responsibility when you're married, so it's just a matter of you and the mother both becoming comfortable with that reality.", 9636, "SCAgs52Zaa", 1],

	97873 : ["The previous poster might have his ROTC information correct, but I don't think he's accurately describing the OCS process for ARNG. Your recruiter is correct that you have to enter the enlisted side in order to go into OCS. You need to have 90 credit hours, have a GT score of 110 or higher, be able to get secret security clearance (clean record).  Go through basic, with an MOS of 09S, come back, report to unit. Unit will coordinate with OSM officer to get them enrolled in OCS course...there are usually 4 per year, so you'll be able to get in rather quickly. As an officer candidate, once you're enrolled, you will be paid E-5 drill pay. You do not have to be PROMOTED to E-5 before you enter, you will just be paid that for drills and training. Depending on whether you go traditional or accelerated, the whole process of becoming commissioned takes about 3-18 months. ", 9638, "yMT37ftGaa", 1],

	97883 : ["You have a lot of options for becoming an officer in the national guard.  The one that I highly suggest is to go through an ROTC program.  They pay for your college, and you typically get a scholarship along with it.  If you go in enlisted you have to be promoted to an E5 before you can even think about going to OBC...That takes a long time, usually about 4 years and you have to go to WLC, another school, before you can be promoted to an E5 and that is if your unit has the slots for you.   My wife is in 4 years now and is getting ready to go to WLC this summer.  She will finally be promoted to E5 (still not an officer) after a total of about 5 years in. On the other hand I started ROTC one year ago, I didn't have to go to basic training, I got to go to Airborne school (hard for enlisted to get in), and I will commission in 18 months as a second LT with a bachelors and masters degrees.  A total of less than 3 years and the army is paying for all of it.", 9638, "None", 0],
