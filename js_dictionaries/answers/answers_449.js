Honestly I don't remember someone named Spyro so you'll have to remind me in case you had a different name back then.  I mean, what can I say, I want to say these are my favorites but honestly I might forget some names: The Dragon Donovan T King Kjors (he was divisive, people either liked him or hated him) Candle Ms. Lol (I actually still chat with her and have so since becoming inactive in Y/A) Truly Phenomenal Geese The amount of users that came on here and just joined in on the wrestling convos and questions and shared their knowledge was insane. Superior Quality 85, Clark W, I could go on for a long time and never get everybody.  We all left, a lot of the users were in their teenage years so I'm sure they went ahead and had to make a life for themselves. Some just left because so many left that the wrestling section wasn't as great anymore (no offense to anybody who stuck around or came in after the 2008-2012 years who might've been great in this section)  But yeah, there were some great users that just made this section worth while for quite a long time...

Every question in th.answers.yahoo.com has tons of blank answers (using space bar); it was posted by Shadowfire to gain points for his troll accounts. Jewish user Shadowfire (who has been on Yahoo Answers since the beginning and could possibly be the infamous homosexual flying antichrist from the tribe of Dan) from Portland [or so he claims because he could've been born in Russia in Valday (Russian: Валда́й) to a 12th generation Jewish prostitute who pretends to be a virgin)] has many trolls accounts on Yahoo Answers: Blackthorne1979, James Blackthorne, ✟ summer of night omega crow † ⚔, Saint James Tiberius Troll, Lord Shadowfire, Carter Berg, Fireball, ThatToiletguy, Tublet Huglet, Tut Uncommon: 3peat Offender, Cult Free, Reynaldo Weeks, Juli, Petri Lindroos, Knightwulf, Nonplussed, Nightwulf, Toilet John, Master Debator, Magistra, Desiree, D-girl, Firecock, Yahoo User, Corvus Blackthorne, Patrick McCluskey, Torchbug, Arni, r.wolfpaw, No Bozos, Fuzzface McGee, First Dragon, L.E.

With one his accounts Fireball, he pretends to be a Methodist old lady who posts short-hand slang TIRH (this is religion here). He reports all answers and questions that he doesn't like just so that his questions stay on top in the Religion and Spirituality section. He trolls in other categories too. It gives Christians a bad name (just because of this troll's sock puppet account). His Toilet John account keeps posting questions where Jesus was sodomized by Roman soldiers. Remember the prophecy where it says that the antichrist will have personal hatred towards the real Jesus Christ. That's why Shadowfire keeps posting thousands of similar questions along the line: “Did Romans sodomize Jesus?” or “Did Romans buttrape Jesus?”. He asks multiple idiotic mundane questions like “Is Hinduism true?”, “What makes a girl harden?” [like he enjoyed killing little girls], etc. and answers them with his sock puppet accounts just to gain points. Some questions you can see that he answered with like five or seven accounts (especially the ones about himself that he reports right away). With his Reynaldo Weeks account he boasts that he was the reason why their accounts were suspended. With his Magistra account he threatens people with clowns and CIA assassins. Shadowfire mocks Christians with his sock puppet account Fireball in the Religion and Spirituality section by answering very destructively and adding \"TIRH here\" or reported (anonymously) or “fck you nigers”. He gives Christians a bad name because he promotes sins like sodomy, fornication, ecumenism, astrology (horoscopes), etc. He should be executed and burned at the stake for blasphemy. He spreads rapture heresy, reincarnation heresy, ecumenism heresy, etc. and many more subtle heresies. Antichrist will ride on a donkey into the 3rd Temple. Stop him before it's too late. Antichrist is gay flying wizard who was born from a prostitute and who will ride on a donkey into the 3rd Temple. Antichrist's mother is a 12th generation prostitute (according to saint Lavrentiy of Chernigov). According to researcher Grigoriy Klimov, prostitutes = lesbians = witches; so, antichrist's mother is a witch, a lesbian, and a prostitute. Hide your kids, hide your wife ‘cuz de evil antichrist is flying thru town; take your glocks out and shoot dat son of a bytch down! Again, he's an s-o-b ‘cuz his mother is a prostitute to Jews and Hindus. Funny thing is that she pretends to be a virgin. Don't be deceived by this skumbag and his fake miracles trying to emulate Christ's miracles! If wrongfully accused, forgive me; state under your account that you are not Corvus Blackthorne then. Shadowfire claims to be extraterrestrial raven when demons pretend to be extraterrestrials. I'm paranoid and think that all Yahoo accounts that talk about ravens are about him.

Gading beef usually involves checking to see how much fat \"marbling\" is in the meat.  The more fat, the more tender and flavorful the meat will be (see image) Prime is the best, but usually only available to high-end restaurants. So it will be hard to find for cooking at home.  Which is fine because most home cooks will ruin it.  But if you get a chance to try it, and $$ is no object, by all means do.  Below Prime grade is Choice grade.   This is usually the grade of meat found at many supermarkets.  Most beef is grade Choice.  Below Choice is \"Select.\" grade.  It's nothing to write home about.  It's actually kind of hard to find in grocery stores.  Many discount stores who sell it won't bother to tell you what grade it is.  There are grades lower than Select, but those are usually used in processed and canned meat.
