Or they wish to eat healthy.  Too much meat isn't good for your gut.  Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals in your diet. However, if you currently eat more than 90g (cooked weight) of red and processed meat a day, the Department of Health advises that you cut down to 70g, which is the average daily consumption in the UK.", 6644, "BGj3gzuRaa", 0],

	46762 : ["The simple answer is yes, in moderation like so many other things that we eat.  Cheese is full of a variety of essential nutrients required by the human body and, contrary to some of the answers given, it is more beneficial than consuming milk depending on your age.  The human body during (approximately) the 40's to mid 50's actually absorbs more calcium from cheese according to some studies than it does from milk.  In addition, despite it being high in fat, a moderate amount of cheese per day (a 3cm cube or a 1 1/4 inch cube) can actually assist the human body in losing weight. If you are vegetarian the only concern is the use of animal rennet in cheese however there are cheeses that use a vegetarian friendly form of rennet rather than animal.  This information can often be found on the manufacturers website or on websites devoted to vegetarian friendly cheese. ", 6660, "None", -1],
