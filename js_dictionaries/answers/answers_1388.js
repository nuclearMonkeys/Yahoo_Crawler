	75002 : ["Would you chronicle how the God of slaves defeated your multitude of gods and wiped out your entire army? Here is how they documented this event... The Egyptians picked and chose what they wanted to record. If you read the account of the Merneptah stele, it notes that \"Israel is laid waste; its seed is no more.\". True? They do the same thing today. I went to Egypt and was shocked to discover that they actually won the Six Day War. In the ancient Egyptian days, yes, they were meticulous record keepers. But they carried these records into the next life. Do you really think they would carry an immense defeat--from SLAVES--at the hands of one single God over their own myriad of gods? A papyrus called the Admonitions of Ipuwer describes a catastrophe like the Exodus. The author of Admonitions complains of a lack of authority, justice and social order as if the central authority no longer had the will or power to keep control. He also complains about barbarians and foreigners as if the country has been invaded. Nobody is planting crops because they are not sure what will happen. The southern most districts are paying no taxes. He complains that the Nile has strangely turned to blood and \"If one drinks it, one rejects it as human (blood) and thirsts for water.\" He wrote, \"Grain is perished on every side.\" Gardiner dated its events to the FIP but it is conceded that the language and orthography belong to the Middle Kingdom [Wilson, 1969c, p 442]. Velikovsky noted the obvious similarities with the plagues of the Exodus and pointed out that, contrary to Gardiner, Sethe dated the Ipuwer Papyrus to the SIP [Velikovsky, 1952, p. 48-50]. Van Seters also argues for an SIP date [Van Seters, 1966, p103-120]. There are also records beyond the written letter you know. Ancient chariot parts were discovered in the Gulf of Aqaba. The city of Python has lower bricks with straw, mid bricks with stubble, and upper bricks with anything they could get their hands on. Exactly as the event of Exodus chronicles.", 8786, "None", 1],

	75005 : ["The ACLU often does things that are against majority public opinion.  That's when they get vilified.  But those who do ignore the fact that they have also joined suits by people like Rush Limbaugh to protect the privacy of his medical records.  They will represent the side of the Constitution no matter whose rights are being violated.   It's true.  The Founding Fathers didn't set up the Constitution to always agree with the majority opinion.  In the year after Loving v Virginia was ruled on, 76% of Americans still didn't want to allow interracial marriage.   But those of you who claim to support the Constitution in all matters will never acknowledge that what you support are the parts of the Constitution you personally agree with, not the whole thing.  Which tells us just how much you really support the Constitution.", 8787, "AFqZEOlRaa", 0],

The people who do not get it are the problem, not the ACLU. Either you believe in the rights of the individual or you do not.  If you do not, you support big, abusive, tyrannical government. Those who continually complain about the ACLU never have read and understood the Bill of Rights. We don't need or want big government.  Those who complain about the ACLU are the supporters of big government, the supporters and enablers of tyranny.", 8787, "AA10201404", 3],

Regardless of what he is doing, he deserves a trial, under the Constitution.  If he is seditious he should be tried for treason and sentenced accordingly.

While I wouldn't shed a tear if the guy was stomped by an elephant tomorrow, I might even smile, I have to admit that the idea that my government was going into the death-on-demand business was a little surprising.

He is correct we are too comfortable with our life's and not helping our brothers/sisters who are suffering and oppressed around the world. That does not mean we go killing Innocent people, rather we try our best in protecting them, what is wrong in that??  If you have heard something directly from his mouth then it is a different issue, but from the Media, please I am sick of them twisting aspects. They target anyone and label them as terrorists. Sorry I am a little angry because this happened to someone who was very dear to me too and he was innocent. Yet how the media loves to twist aspects and not only that these so called goverments help aid in the torture of muslims.
