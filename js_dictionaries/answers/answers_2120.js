	111793 : ["Jay Dax is not quite correct.  Most a/c units are not designed to be run below 60 degrees outside, because the high-side pressure will drop low enough to cause the low-side pressure to fall below freezing.  This will ice up the indoor coil, cause liquid refrigerant to flood back to the compressor and eventually kill it.  Most manufacturers make or provide an accessory device called a \"Low Ambient Kit\" that either turns the outdoor fan on & off, or slows it down in order to keep the high-side pressure elevated and prevent indoor coil freeze-up.  Your contractor should be able to get this device from the distributor of your brand of equipment.  If you have packaged cooling and heating units, you could also get an accessory economizer kit that will bring in cold outside air, mix it with the hot return air from the rooms, and deliver cool air to keep the place comfortable without running the compressor.  This device will use a lot less electricity in the long run, and pay for itself.", 10198, "URS1uRY8aa", 2],

Also noted, is that some sites will give it in different units Megabits or Megabytes, etc. I get about 2.4 megabits, but a byte is 8 bits, so 2.4 megabits divided by 8 is 300 kilobytes, which is the speed my internet browser reads as it is downloading a file.

Klitschko is 7 in taller, has a weight advantage of around 30 lbs and a reach advantage of 8 in, also he is a very good defensive fighter with decent power, so you could make a very good case for Wladimir Klitschko beating Joe Frazier.  Personally though I would pick Frazier despite his disadvantages, Klitschko would give him trouble but I think it will boil down to two things: Frazier was relentless and has one of the best and most powerful left hooks in History, Klitschko has a very suspect jaw and has been knocked down, and knocked out, by much lesser punchers than Frazier. Ross Purrity, Corrie Sanders and Lamon Brewster knocked him out, Sam Peter floored him three times and all of those fighters with respect to them aren't Joe Frazier. I think that Frazier would have some trouble getting past Klitschko's defense and size advantage, but in a 12 or 15 round fight his left hook would find its mark eventually and Frazier would put Klitschko down for the count.", 10197, "KmeFmRz6aa", 7],
