We are not to live out our lives in isolation. And the greatest of these relationships is marriage.  The point is HOW do we have meaningful and fulfilling relationships with one another without killing each other?  Serious! We are all different and it is in this contentious world that we need an Intercessor to find and allow us common ground to understand and really, love each other.  The story of the Bible, the point of the Bible is God telling us HOW to develop His kingdom here on earth.  THink about it. If everyone acted like Jesus showing compassion for everyone and rejecting evil - this would, in fact, be heaven on earth. This was the point of the Lord's Prayer.  Where is heaven and where is hell?  It's right here! This is where the Garden of Eden started out and we, as humans, corrupted it so that we can no longer enter into it. Only when we can come back to what Adam and Eve started out can we find heaven again.  Christians are telling everyone WHAT they are supposed to do even though they can't do it themselves. This is not hypocrisy - this is the failure of the human condition to do what it right. We just can't do it!", 9341, "iblT1HJpaa", 0],

Edit: i cant... the first question you asked seems flawed or either i am reading it wrong therefore  the rest of the question flawed as well.. you asked....if a person CAN NOT sin without knowing that what they are doing is a sin???? this question is wither worded wrong, or your point didnt come across, b/c it implies as typed that i CANT sin and not know its a sin.. it should read CAN ppl sin and not know its a sin.. if this is what u are asking, the answer is YES! the bible mentions that sometimes we sin in our hearts and we dont even have to act on it... anything in you whether it be a thought or feeling that goes against LOVE/GOD is a sin to GOD and these things we will indeed give an account for.. yes even our thoughts! the bible states that if we had the true love of christ in us, then we would not entertain anything, or thoughts, or feeliings that will go against GOD!

Sigmund Freud said   For the individual, life is hard to bear.   there are the elements, there are diseases, and finally, the the painful riddle of death.   Once before, we have found ourselves feeling such insecurities and wander, when as a small child, in relation to ones father.    I think what he meant was that we need to find a belief system as human beings. To explain our existence. As children we looked to our parents for the answers, but as an adult, we have to look elsewhere, i.e. God/Religion/Creator etc, (the father).     So we believe the Bible/Khoran/Tau Te Ching, whatever. Because they provide us with all the answers we need or at least, they used to when religion was government in primitive cultures like ours was.      the point is that self consciousness, requires justification to balance it out.

I never did very well fit in with any of the Christian denominations i attended over the years (17 yrs)  but I learned a WHOLE lot!! I am grateful for all my experiences... I became Messianic last year because I wanted to be Jewish, but I cannot forsake my Jesus... so that was where I felt most welcomed and comfortable.

Per my life experiences and the way God revealed himself to me and the way he has helped me improve in so many ways is why I believe what I believe!

I think you're right, most don't even really know what the writers of the bible meant when referring to \"sin\"....the Bible was written a LONG time ago and things have changed a little since then. I believe in mistakes...we all make them and you have to make mistakes in life to learn and grow. Those who toss around bible versus to make others fall into place have missed the point entirely. They base what they think they know on fear - a fear that was hammered into them by someone who thinks they know what God said or wants. They then use the Bible to justify the fear claiming it has ALL of the answers for everyone. To me, that is scary - someone or a book that has all of the answers for everyone - answers that I am supposed to just accept without question, input or understanding. What's the point in living life if you can't make a choice or have an opinion? How can it be fulfilling to not come to any conclusion for yourself concerning who you are, what you want and how you want to live because someone has already told you how all of that is supposed to be?  It's this way because “I said” God wants it this way??? No, you can't put God in a box. To do that would be to truly “sin”.", 9341, "da6ac7706e8163dbdb1bf97ba796cc4daa", 2],

I don't mind others not believing or seeing things the way I do, just don't preach to me about the only way, or the right way being theirs.

If you need evidence attend a exorcism.  There isn't a more powerful way to see the love God shows us.  If there really wasn't a God, there wouldn't be people  exclaiming that there is.
