	141771 : ["Don't ever take the sleeping pills route!!  1. They will damage your liver big time and you can get into serious health problems. 2. You will get hooked up on them and you won't be able to have a normal life any more if you don't take your pills everyday. The sleeping pills industry is damaging our health by capitalizing on our ignorance, and by distracting people from effective and natural ways to deal with this problem. I had been taking prescription sleep medications [Ambien] for over 5 years. It stopped working and I simply took more. Still did not work. Nights were very difficult - medication put me to sleep but I would wake up after 2–3 hours with a strong sympathetic response (fast pulse, pounding heartbeat, wide awake alert). It was a very difficult cycle to break. I was really in bad shape due to lack of sleep.  After years of struggling I was able to cure my insomnia naturally and pretty fast. I followed the Sleep Tracks sleep optimization program, here is their official web -site if you want to take a look:  Ohhh..and Good Luck!", 11520, "None", 0],
