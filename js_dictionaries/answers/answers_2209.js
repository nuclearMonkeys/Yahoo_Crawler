Classical Big Band Crooner - Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, etc. Jazz Good Pop - no Lady Gaga or Bieber please. MQ3 - you have great taste in music and are certainly not narrow minded. I like that about you. BQ - Good BQ2 - We have company coming over and maybe watch a little football.

Giving you the benefit of the doubt, we looked up the word dairy in a dictionary to find that it comes from an Old English word for a \"female bread baker.\" The root of the word is the modern-day word for \"dough.\" And it is conceivable to us that eggs have as much relevance to the origin of the word dairy as butter does.  But nowadays, the word dairy only has to do with milk and cream and related products: sour cream, butter, cheese, yogurt, etc. You may often find eggs and dairy categorized together (several Ochef directory pages lump them together, for example), but they remain as distinct as the species from which they come.", 10463, "None", 0],

	116273 : ["There are several things that a person must do to be considered elgible to enter into the Celestial Kingdom (Mormon version of heaven).  A person must be baptized, be given the gift of the Holy Spirit, have their endowment, and be sealed (married) in the temple.  The first two, the baptism and the holy spirit are of course done when a person joins the church at the local church, not the temple.  These rituals are however performed at the temple on behalf of those people who have passed on.  LDS/Mormons believe that every single soul that will have ever existed on this planet needs to recieve these ordinances, and so the members of the LDS church who have had these ordinances done go to the temple to act as proxy (basically take on the name of the dead person) so that that person's ordinances can be done.  The endowment ceremony is pretty much a right of passage in the LDS/Mormon church.  Before a person goes on a mission, or gets married in the temple, they must have recieved their endowment.  The endowment ceremony basically teaches the person what they must do to pass through the \"veil\" (aka the pearly gates) to get into the Celestial Kingdom.  You have to wear special clothing in the temple such as a dress (if you are a girl), and apron, a sash, a hat/veil, slippers, etc.  While you are in the endowment ceremony you watch a video that instructs you on what to do, as in taking the sash off and tying it differently.  You learn different handshakes that you are supposed to need to know to pass through the veil.  At the end of the ceremony you similate passing through the veil by going up to a curtain and doing the handshakes and saying the sayings you just learned, and they you are led into the Celestial Room which is supposed to be like going to the Celestial Kingdom.  When couples get married in the temple, they are considered to be sealed \"for time and all eternity\" as LDS/Mormons believe that any marriage ceremony not sealed in the temple leads to separation for the family at death.  The couple are both dressed in white, and temple worthy family members and friends are allowed into watch.  The bride and groom are placed at an alter in which they kneel and look at each other.  The rooms walls are mirrors so that this makes it feel for the couple that they are looking into eternity with each other.  I've never actually been to an LDS/Mormon temple sealing, so I can't tell you any more about it.  There is one more temple ceremony that I know nothing about since a vast majority of even temple attending mormons are never invited to participate in it. And C M SarahLShaw 1967 said that ex-mormons description will be biased...I tried to keep this as unbiased as possible and stuck to the straight facts.", 10455, "Xb8ZPTO5aa", 0],

However, that doesn't answer the question, which is regarding Microsoft Internet Explorer... Anyway, you're right, it may very well be the hot-switching that's getting you into trouble, though that should only be the case if you're sharing files -- there may be some configuration setting either in MSIE or in the Windows control panel that may change this. I'd have a peek but at the moment I'm on a Windows 2000 machine. Meanwhile, verify that logging off one user and then logging in as another fixes the problem.
