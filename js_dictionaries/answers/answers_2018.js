Also the Eb clarinetist will play 'D' parts transposed on the Eb and the bass clarinetist will play A bass clarinet parts transposed on the Bb bass. C clarinet transposition is important to learn if you want to play in good orchestras. Just add 2 sharps (you are a hotshot at your scales aren't you?) and play up a full step. You could copy the part over but it is almost easier to learn transposing. It would be an important skill if you want to pla professionally.

So the points are facing the edges of the cookie sheet. Make a sturdy base with the widest part of the dough, make sure there are no gaps.  Mix broccoli, ham and cheese in a medium bowl.  Spoon mixture on the crossiant about one inch across the dough ring and about one inch high, or until all the mix is used.  Fold the points of the dough over the mix and press into the inside of the ring. It is best if there are some openings on the top of the ring.

	106668 : ["There is no significant difference in playing a Bb or C clarinet.  In fact, the entire family plays essentially the same from Ab sopranino down to BBb contrabass.   The difference is in the key of the instrument and the timbre it produces.  The C soprano is slightly smaller than the Bb soprano and produces a tone quality that is a little more bright and piercing than the Bb.  In fact, the tone of the C soprano is closer to that of an Eb soprano than to that of the Bb because of the acoustical physics involved. The C soprano is called for in much opera work and in some orchestral work.  It's pretty uncommon otherwise.  For this reason alone, there aren't a lot of makers of lesser-priced C soprano clarinets.  The C kinderklarinet on the market isn't really suitable as a substitute for a real soprano beyond very young beginners. You might want to borrow a technique from recorder and tuba players if you're faced with transposing a lot - you learn a different set of fingerings for playing in C.  Most professional level players just learn to transpose at sight by practicing transposing at sight.  The other alternative is to write out all of the music beforehand in the correct transposition. If you can afford it and can find one, there's nothing wrong with getting a C soprano for the type of playing that you're doing. Add:  The entire family of clarinets include:  Ab sopranino; Eb, D, C, Bb, A soprano; A basset clarinet, G, F (basset horn), Eb alto; C, Bb, A bass; EEb contra-alto; BBb contra-bass; EEEb octo-contra-alto; BBBb octo-contra-bass.

But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. Deuteronomy Chapter 22 5. The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so [are] abomination unto the LORD thy God. Exodus Chapter 20 3. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 4. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth: 5. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me; Matthew Chapter 5 27. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: 28. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. Romans Chapter 3 10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 11. There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. 12. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Romans Chapter 1 28. And even as they did not like to retain God in [their] knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31. Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32. Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. Galatians Chapter 5 19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20. Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 21. Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Revelation Chapter 21 8. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you]. 1 John Chapter 4 11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4 8. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 9. But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. Proverbs Chapter 31 10. Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far above rubies. 26. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue [is] the law of kindness. Romans Chapter 12 9. [Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. James Chapter 1 14. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 15. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 16. Do not err, my beloved brethren. Acts Chapter 3 19. Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; Ecclesiastes Chapter 12 13. Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this [is] the whole [duty] of man. Matthew Chapter 22 37. Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38. This is the first and great commandment. 39. And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. John Chapter 10 23. And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 30. I and [my] Father are one. John Chapter 14 15. If ye love me, keep my commandments. Matthew Chapter 28 20. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, [even] unto the end of the world.

The C clarinet will tune on the same note as most of the rest of the orchestra (usually an A from the oboe) and the Bb clarinet will play a note that is written a tone higher so it sounds the same pitch, as the instrument is tuned a tone lower than the C instruments (usually, you would play a B). I have to admit this seems rather strange to me, as in 10 years of playing clarinet in orchestras, wind bands and even clarinet groups I have never seen a C clarinet used - only Eb, Bb, A, alto and bass. I hope they have some good music lined up! Don't forget to give your fingers some time practicing the switch between the two instruments, as the C will probably feel slightly small and it might take a little time to get used to!

Don't mean to sound rude,  but people don't volunteer to pay hundreds of dollars if they don't need to.  And since they're not married it's not the bfs responsibility. What to do?  Chill.

Now, that being said, there IS a difference between playing a clarinet in Bb and a clarinet in A. A written C played on a clarinet in Bb will sound a Bb. Playing that same written C on a clarinet in A will sound an A. As such, the piece itself will be in a different key, as if you played a part written for Clarinet in Bb on a clarinet in A, every note would sound a half-step (semitone) lower than desired, throwing the whole piece off. And specifically, a clarinet in A will just sound a little bit mellower and darker than a clarinet in Bb, while the clarinet in Bb will sound a little bit brighter and joyous.", 9964, "Q5vJ0Vreaa", 0],
