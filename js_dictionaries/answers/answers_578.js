The European Cup used to be strictly for league champions.  Then, UEFA decided to open it up to more teams, sell the rights for a lot more money, and come up with a catchy intro tune.  Behold...THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE?  Why?  MONEY! But by all means, please watch Sky Sports news where they complain about how the integrity of a competition that they worked to set up, and by all means, don't look at Rupert Murdoch trying to take over rugby league in Australia with his 'Super League' competition (all because of Pay TV).   What if I told you that four of the breakaway clubs listed were part of the group of five that started the breakaway into the Premier League?  Man City were a 2nd/3rd tier club gifted a new stadium by the government when Bonesaw PetroState took over.  Their fans getting worked up are really hilarious.", 5007, "Pc0QjrQ4aa", 0],

One thing football and rugby to an extent has always had over the American sports and even sports like cricket and basketball is that you could theoretically create a team with your mates and on sporting merit alone, get to the elite level. Yes youd need to fulfill stadium criteria etc but the league's are open and with various promotions etc, you can make the top. This kills that, it takes away the sporting merit from the game and makes it more like the American sports with closed off competition only open to the rich that can afford it. While it is inevitable that the biggest clubs will want more cash, it's a negotiation tool at the moment.  Uefa and FIFA know without the top clubs or players, their competitions are worthless and at the moment the big clubs have all the cards. If they are kicked out of the league's, whoop de Doo, the super League becomes a Saturday and Wednesday league with a few more teams Uefa and FIFA will be dragged back to the negotiation table and a compromise will be reached. Also for those saying this is new, it's not. The original idea behind the premier League was the top 6 go alone with no relegation, the football league caved and you got what you have now. The biggest thing from this for me is it shows that the people running the game are not fit to run it. They lack the long term ability to control the game.
