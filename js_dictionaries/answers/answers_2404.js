	126025 : ["God's Spirit Since God himself is a Spirit and is holy and since all his faithful angelic sons are spirits and are holy, it is evident that if the \"holy spirit\" were a person, there should reasonably be given some means in the Scriptures to distinguish and identify such spirit person from all these other 'holy spirits.' On the contrary, in a large number of cases the expression \"holy spirit\" appears in the original Greek without the article, thus indicating its lack of personality.---- Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55; 8:15,17,19; 9:17; 11:24; 13:9, 52; 19:2; Ro 9:1; 14:17; 15:13,16,19; 1Corinthians 12:3; Hebrews 2:4; 6:4; 2Peter 1:21; Jude 20.  Not a person It was not until the fourth century C.E. that the teaching that the holy spirit was a person and part of the \"Godhead\" become official church dogma.  Personification does not prove personality.  It is true that Jesus spoke of the holy spirit as a \"helper\" and spoke of such helper as 'teaching', 'bearing witness,' 'giving evidence,' 'guiding,' 'speaking,' 'hearing,' and 'receiving.' However, it is not unusual in the Scriptures for something that is not actually a person to be personalized or personified. Wisdom is personified in the book of Proverbs (1:20-33; 8: 1-36). Wisdom is also personified at Matthew 11:19 and Luke 7:35, where it is depicted as having both \"works\" and \"children.\" The apostle Paul Personified sin as \"receiving an inducement,\" 'working out covetousness,' 'seducing,' and 'killing.' (Romans 7:8-11) Yet it is obvious that Paul did not mean that sin was actually a person.    Soul \"Soul\" ----- A Living  Creature, Human or Animal; Life as an Intelligent Person; Hebrew, (ne'phesh); Greek, (psy-khe' ).  In the Hebrew Scriptures the Hebrew word ne'phesh occurs 754 times, first in Ge 1:20.  In the Christian Greek Scriptures the Greek word psy-khe' occurs by itself 102 times, first in Mt 2:20. This includes Eph 6:6 and Col 3:23, where it is in the expression \"whole-souled.\"  Animals are Souls Ge 1:20, 21, 24, 30; 2:19; 9:10, 12, 15, 16; Le 11:10, 46, 47; 24:18; Nu 31:28; Job 41:21; Eze 47:9.

The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies. 4.

Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life. 7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church. 8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise. 9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary. 10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven. 11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary. 12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities. 13.

	126044 : ["I think the best thing for you to do is to wait until you get into counseling. I think you both love each other very much and it would be sad if you just gave up now. You really need a third party to help you solve this problem. If you don't get professional help then you won't be able to work things out. Your wife has put the religion between her and you and as long as she keeps it there it's going to be impossible for you to get through her. Your change of heart regarding religion is now a big issue in your home. I honestly believe that what she is doing is wrong. But this has nothing to do with who is right or who is wrong. It all has to do with you having a change of heart about what you believe in. And since that problem is there then everything has been going down hills for you guys. If you get the help that you need then your wife will have to see that you never lied to her. She will have to understand that you have a right to change your mind about certain things. Your wife has to learn that just because your religious views are no longer the same that it means that you are a bad person and that you can no longer be trusted. This is really not fair to you. Marriage is about love, commitment, trust, etc. And it seems that you are giving all of that to her. And for her to say that she doesn't want to have kids with you because you told her the truth about your views on religion is ridiculous. It's almost like she is telling you that because you changed where religion is concerned  that you cannot be a good father and that is so unfair to you. And I think if you are both in counseling that your wife is going to learn what is really important in a relationship.  I think right now you are having mixed feelings about everything that is going on. You are now questioning you if you were too young when you got married. You are also wondering if you should be together. You're even worried about what it's going to be like if you have children. It's not hard to tell that your mind is spinning right now and you no longer know what is the right thing to do. But I tell you once you get into counseling you are going to learn more about you, your wife, your marriage and what you want out of life. By going for counseling you will know if you want to stay in the marriage or if you want out. So, the best gift you can give you is for you to go to talk to a marriage counselor. Once you can start to sort out your feelings and once your wife can start to sort out hers then it's going to be easier on both of you. A lot of what you are both going through has a lot to do with the way you were both brought up. But you also need to keep in mind that you are both not living with your parents.And what you want to do with your lives no longer has to do with what your parents wanted for you while you were growing up.  Because now that you are a man then you can decide what is best for you.  Your mom was a domineering religious mother and she thought what she was doing was what was best for you. But what your mother wanted for you is not what you want for you and your wife needs to understand that.  Once you clear everything about your past and you come to terms with everything that is going on then you will be able to decide if you stay in the marriage of if you leave it. But right now I think it's too soon for you to even go there and think about a separation or a divorce. Give you, your wife and your marriage a change.

Salvation is a gift from God given to those who put faith in the sin-atoning value of the sacrifice of His Son. Heb 5:9 (RS): \"He [Jesus] became the source of eternal  salvation to all who OBEY him.\"  {caps, my own, couldn't add italics}  Does this conflict with the statement that Christians are \"saved through faith\" ?  Not At All.  Obedience simply demonstrates that their faith is genuine. James 2:14,26 (RS) \"What does it profit, my bretheren,  if a man says he has faith but has not works?  Can his faith save him?  For as the body apart from the spirit is dead,  so faith apart from works is dead.\" Acts 16:30,31 (RS) \" 'Men, what must I do to be saved?'  And they [Paul & Silas] said, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus,  and you will be saved, you and your household.' \" If that man and his household truly believe,  would they not act in harmony with their belief? Certainly. Faith without works is dead---James 2:24-26. There's 1 more 1 want to add, lemme go find it, I'll B-R-B. I couldn't find it. But it goes like this: \"Show me your faith apart from your works,  and I'll show you my faith by my works.\" Works demonstrates Obedience to your faith,  what you believe. This text is in harmony with the Scriptures I did provide.", 10874, "None", 9],

I am glad that the Information Officer of the Army in the Roswell case admitted that there was “a UFO crash and that he personally saw the bodies and the craft.”  UFOs have been sighted and even video taped by civilians.  The Holy Spirit who we talk to told us that a time will come, and it will not be far away, when beings from another planet will come to earth and take the marked good people out.  They will be allowed to board their spacecraft.  There will be those who are not marked but would like to get in will not be allowed. These earthlings will be transported somewhere out there in another place in the universe.  Those who will be left behind who are not marked will suffer until they are annihilated.  After they are annihilated, then those people who were taken out will be returned back to earth to restart and repopulate the world.  These are the 144,000 people mentioned in Revelation 7:4.  I do not know what age they will be when they return.  I did not ask.  Nobody did. This is the kind of vessel that will be used to save the elect.  If Noah and his family were saved from the Great Flood in an ark as the vessel, this time, the vessel that will be used will be spacecrafts.  This revelation came from no other than the Holy Spirit and what He said is tape recorded. So what do we do to be eligible and be marked.  First and foremost is change our wrong beliefs.  The Holy Spirit has said this several times.  Search for the true God—not just any god but the true God.  Then change our wrong and evil ways.  Follow the commandments of the true God and be good, and remain good until the end.  Matthew 24:13 states: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”", 10873, "Sv2PihBgaa", -1],

By saying that one is saved by faith alone gives people an excuse to do virtually nothing. They go to church on Sundays and sit on their hands while a professional clergymen does the preaching for them. After service, they go about their business. Easy enough, isn't it? Jehovah's Witnesses know full well that they can do nothing to earn salvation, as if Jehovah owes them something. They know salvation depends on their faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
