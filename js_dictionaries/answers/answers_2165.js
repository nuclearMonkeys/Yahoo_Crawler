	114031 : ["The American involvement in the Vietnam War really began in 1945 when Trumann gave aid to the French who were retaking French Indochina following the Japanese defeat after WWII. That went on until 1954, when the French were defeated by the communists at Dien Bien Phu. The country was then split into two parts, the communist north, run by the government of Ho Chi Minh. And the south, which was run by I think Ngo Dinh Diem. Until the US staged a rogue coup on him two weeks before Kennedy was shot. After that, the Eisenhower administration sent the US Army Special Forces in there to act as advisers to the ARVN in South Vietnam to resist the communist insurgency. And it was really like that until Johnson escalated troops levels to 250,000 in 1965 following the Gulf of Tonkin incident which now \"offically\" DID happen, but it was never proven to have actually happened. It was also a provoked attack, because for a long time nobody knew about Operation Rolling Thunder, which was LBJ's bombing campaign of North Vietnam. He also gave the CIA the green light for covert actions against North Vietnam, Laos, and China. Kennedy signed National Security Action Memo 263, which widthdrew 1,000 US military personnel. It didn't fully widthdrawal US support to South Vietnam, but it was a widthdrawal. Kennedy today would be a Republican, not a Democrat. As for who actually \"ended\" it... That was Richard Nixon. He came up with the Vietnamization program, which widthdrew US support and replaced it with higher numbers of ARVN troops. He made a deal with China in '73, which helped force North Vietnam to the bargaining table. They signed the cease-fire in '73. US forces were completely widthdrawn on April 30, 1975. Operation Frequent Wind airlifted fleeing South Vietnamese off of the top of the Presidential Palace as the NVA took Saigon. Uncle knew a guy who was there and saw the tanks roll in. At that time, Gerald Ford was President. As for Afghanistan, I think what it will come down to is Congress ordering the military to widthdraw the troops. I remember when Reagan gave his speech about the \"freedom fighters\" the Contras were, and Congress told the Reagan WH that they could not supply aid to the Contras in any way because they didn't want another Vietnam. And a few years later, the Iran-Contra scandal broke when one of the planes loaded with weapons landed in El Salvador, and left with cocaine headed for the United States and was shot down by the Sandinistas. Yeah that was Bush's Cuban buddy Felix Rodriquez - one of the Watergate Burglars and a member of Operation 40 that was said to have helped kill JFK.", 10375, "None", 2],

	114049 : ["ACTUALLY, in a nut shell of the final days  on 5 March 1971, the 5th Special Forces Group, which was the first American unit deployed to South Vietnam, returned to America........This was under Nixon's reign. The  Paris Peace Accords had more to do regarding the North and South coming to terms with prisoner exchanges and logistics as the withdraw of troops continued. During this cease-fire, Saigon was bolstered by a surge of U.S. aid while Vietcong's top commander participated in meetings in Hanoi to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for the 1975–76 dry season. Meanwhile the November 1972 election favored a Congressionally supported \"Come home America\" campaign theme. And On 15 March 1973, U.S. President Richard Nixon implied that the United States would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire The Vietcong resumed offensive operations when dry season began and by January 1974 it had recaptured the territory it lost during the previous dry season and After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thiá»u announced on 4 January that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There had been over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period. Gerald Ford took over as U.S. president on 9 August 1974 after President Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal. Congress immediately voted in restrictions on funding and military activities to be phased in through 1975 and to culminate in a total cutoff of funding in 1976. The success of the 1973–74 dry season offensive inspired TrÃ  to return to Hanoi in October 1974 and plead for a larger offensive in the next dry season. On 13 December 1974, North Vietnamese forces attacked the provincial capital, which fell on 6 January 1975. Ford desperately asked Congress for funds to assist and re-supply the South. Congress refused. The fall of Phuoc Binh and the lack of an American response left the South Vietnamese elite demoralized. President Gerald Ford had given a televised speech on 23 April 1975, declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all U.S. aid. Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from Saigon by helicopter of the last U.S. diplomatic, military, and civilian personnel.

Maybe she is playing one parent against another, which is quite common too, so a unified approach from all the parents is what may be needed.  Perhaps you could suggest she does her own ironing because SIMPLY you don't feel like it ... so why should you do this.  My 15yo does quite a few jobs around the home, not because I am lazy, but because I feel he should contribute in some way, and I do feel it is important children need to appreciate what their parents do for them.  Maybe telling her that you don't see why you should do all these things for her would give her reasons to appreciate what you actually do for her.  Where does it say that you HAVE to make lunch for her either? ... I have not seen this written down in any book.  As long as there is food in the cupboard and fridge I am sure she would not starve; hardly the stuff child abuse is written about.  I think you could apply the \"I don't feel like doing ... this/that ... that is to her benefit.\"  If she complains, simply explain that you don't have to, you don't feel like it and surely she is old enough to do these things for herself.  You really have to be a little tough to get the message across, and you should at least expect a thank you when you are doing things for her.  Don't let her take you so for granted.
