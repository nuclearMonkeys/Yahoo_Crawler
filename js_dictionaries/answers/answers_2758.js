	143756 : ["We knew that sailors used the phrase to refer to the bottom of the ocean, but we had no clue as to its origin. After entering the phrase \"Davy Jones' Locker\" in the Yahoo! search bar, we discovered several possibilities: Michael Quinion's excellent World Wide Words site offers a great quote from Tobias Smollet's The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle (1751): \"This same Davy Jones, according to the mythology of sailors, is the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep....\" One legend suggests that a particularly fiendish pub owner named David Jones used to incapacitate hapless drinkers in his ale locker, and send them off aboard ships. Sounds like a handy way of disposing of your enemies. Brewer¿s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable offers an interesting linguistic take on the issue: Davy is a bastardization of Duffy, the West Indian term for ghost. Jones comes from Jonah, the prophet who spent a few uncomfortable days lodged in the GI tract of a whale. And a locker, loosely defined, is a place to store valuable things. So the phrase \"He's gone to Davy Jones' locker\" (i.e., he cashed it in) loosely translates as \"He's safe with Duffy Jonah now.\" A random Navy Trivia page we stumbled across has some entertaining guesses: Duffer Jones was a notoriously myopic sailor who often found himself overboard. Davy could also come from the horned one himself, the Devil. The shortest sailor on board usually impersonates him during the the Crossing of the Line, a bizarre naval cross-dressing ceremony. The less said, the better. And finally, we were happy to read that Cool Word of the Day denies a link between the phrase and Davy Jones of the Monkees. They also suggest that Davy comes from St. David, a patron saint of Welsh sailors, and reiterate the Jones/Jonah connection. That sounds", 11599, "None", 3],

It is used as a euphemism for death at sea (e.g. to be \"sent to Davy Jones' Locker\")[1]; Davy Jones is a nickname (used primarily by sailors) for what would be the devil of the seas. His origins are unclear, and many theories have been put forth, including incompetent sailors, a pub owner who kidnapped sailors, or that Davy Jones is another name for the devil.

I still have no idea what makes people think their terrible poems are worthwhile, but let me repeat this: your poems will be terrible, and you will not know it.  If you must write poetry, do it in secret.  Eventually you'll have your epiphany, and realize that your secret poems were terrible, but at least you'll be spared the embarrassment.  And then -- when you finally do know what poetry is about -- then you can start writing good poems.

They've done this for decades, the purpose being to allow a radio DJ to talk over the end of the record. Back in the 1960s when cheap tape recorders came out (cassette recorders), radio stations would always have the DJ talk over the beginning or end of the record.  This was thought to give the show more 'motion', to keep listeners' attention.  And also it kept listeners from recording a 'clean' copy of the record for themselves.

It is used as a euphemism for death at sea (e.g. to be \"sent to Davy Jones' Locker\"); Davy Jones is a nickname (used primarily by sailors) for what would be the devil of the seas. Origin The earliest known reference to Davy Jones occurs in The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle by Tobias Smollett, published in 1751: This same Davy Jones, according to the mythology of sailors, is the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep, and is often seen in various shapes, perching among the rigging on the eve of hurricanes, ship-wrecks, and other disasters to which sea-faring life is exposed, warning the devoted wretch of death and woe.  He is described as having saucer eyes, three rows of teeth, horns, a tail, and blue smoke coming from his nostrils. The term appears to have been common among sailors, as the name Davy Jones appears often in popular nautical literature. As is common with slang, the exact origin of \"Davy Jones\" is hard to discover. These explanations have been proposed: A pub owner named David Jones who used to incapacitate helpless drinkers in his ale locker, and send them off aboard ships.  Duffer Jones, a notoriously myopic sailor who often found himself overboard.  Davy comes from Duffy, a West Indian term for ghost, or from Saint David, also known as Dewi, the patron saint of Wales, while Jones comes from the prophet Jonah.  A euphemism for a \"Devil Jonah\"; Jonah being a term referring to any bad luck on the ocean.  David Jones, a pirate on the Indian Ocean in the 1630s. - Jan RogoziÅski, The Wordsworth Dictionary of Pirates, Ware, Hertfordshire, 1997  Only the first theory explains the locker.
