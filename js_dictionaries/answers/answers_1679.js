	89640 : ["The Diaper Bag This is a memory game where the first person says an item that would be found in a diaper bag.  The second player re-states that first item and then adds one of their own.  This keeps going and each new person has to list off everything mentioned in the proper order and then add something to it.  Players are disqualified if they forget to mention one of the items or say them out of order.  The last person standing is the winner. Baby Concentration This is a game where guests match the candy that best fits the pregnancy or baby-related description given.  Here is a list, with answers in parentheses.  List the baby-related items to the left, then list the candy bars on the right in random order.  Have guests match the baby item with the corresponding candy from the list. Twins – (M&Ms) Triplets – (3 musketeers) Epidural – (Lifesavers) Hospital bill – (Payday) Contractions – (Whoppers) Girl's Name – (Baby Ruth) College Costs – (100 Grand) Breastfeeding – (Milky Way) Boy's Names – (Mike & Ike) Mom's tummy after pregnancy – (Jelly Belly) What you can't give baby enough of – (Hugs & Kisses) New Parent Questionnaire The night before the shower ask the dad-to-be a series of questions about his knowledge of babies. At the shower have an envelope that has strips of paper, each of which has a different question on it that you have asked the father. At the start of the game tell all the ladies that you have asked the dad-to-be 15 questions and their goal is to guess how many of his answers the mom-to-be could get right. Then pass around the envelope and take turns asking the questions to the mom-to-be. The lady who guesses closest wins the game. Here is a list of sample questions.  Add your own to make it really hilarious. How many diapers do you think a baby needs each day? How many diapers do you plan to change each day? How many hours does a baby sleep each day? At what age does a baby start eating solid food? Do you think that your baby will be born with a lot of hair? How many kids do you want to have? Who will be the disciplinarian?  ...and so on. Baby Bag Mystery Take about five baby items and place each in a paper bag. Staple the bags shut and number them. Pass out paper and pencil to the guests. Then pass the bags around and have them write down their answers. After all have finished, the one who gets the most right wins. Get some easy items like diaper pins, pacifiers, rattles, and a few harder items like fingernail clippers.  Use items mom-to-be can take home after the shower. Baby Fear Factor Purchase an assortment of baby foods: green beans, carrots, bananas, etc. You can mix different flavors together or just put a couple of different ones on the same plate. Give one to each participant, with a baby spoon.  First person to finish eating their baby food wins.  This was hilarious! Who Am I?  As your guests arrive, stick a label with the name of a celebrity or a fictional character onto their backs so they cannot see it. One person stands up to show her back and that person has to guess who she is by asking questions. For instance, you might be Martha Stewart, and you would ask questions like, “Am I on TV?” “Am I young or old?” “Am I a performer?” “Am I a talk show host?”  Participants are only allowed to ask yes/no questions.  The guests respond accordingly until you have guessed correctly. Then it is the next person's turn to guess which character she is.  The guest who correctly guesses the name on her label with the fewest questions wins a prize. Baby Memory Trey with a Twist! Arrange about 20 baby items on a small trey.  Use a bottle, a diaper, Qtips, nail clippers, a baby spoon, a washcloth, etc.  Have the mom-to-be carry the trey around the room for guests to look at.  Send her around the room again so they can have a second look.  Then have her leave the room with the trey.  Once she is gone, tell your guests that instead of writing down all the baby items they can remember, instead they have to write down everything they can remember about the appearance of the mom-to-be.  They get a point for each detail, such as the color of her top or her skirt, style of her shoes, style of her earrings, etc.  This is loads of fun because it totally catches your guests off guard! Animal Families Every animal has a unique name for a male, a female, a baby, and a family.  For example, a deer would be a buck, a doe, a fawn, and a herd.  List 10 animals to the left on a sheet of paper.  On the right, place 4 columns: Daddy, Mommy, Baby, and Family.  Guests have to fill in the names of each member of the “family” for each of the animals you've listed.  This is a great name because most people know more of these than they realize.  Another variation of this is to ask guests to list just the “baby” name for each animal or just the “family” name.  Go to this website to choose your list of animals – Role Reversal If the baby shower is co-ed, blow up a balloon (as big as possible) for each man.  Have them put the balloons under their shirts, then tuck shirts in.  They have to take off their shoes and socks, and put on pink fuzzy “pampering” slippers without popping the balloon.  (Remember to blow the balloon up as big as it will get, to give the men a better idea of what a mom is up against while she is trying to go about her daily life sporting that big belly!  This makes the balloons easier to pop too, so you will get some surprises!)  While the men are trying to get out of their shoes so they can pamper their tired “pregnant” feet in the slippers, the women will be cracking up.  You can assign them any other task you'd like that requires them to bend over!  The man who completes the task the fastest (without popping the “belly”) wins the game.  Mom-to-be can take the fuzzy slippers home after the party! Diaper Name Tag Everyone gets a little diaper pin with a napkin folded like a diaper with their name on it, which is used as a name tag. At the end, everyone opens their diaper and the \"dirty\" one gets a prize. Hope you like a couple of these!  Enjoy the baby shower!", 9333, "aoKcIixzaa", 1],

Don't let me scare you, I am not totally wacky, I just really enjoy Halloween. If I could go back and redo my wedding, I think I would do what you are planning. I don't know of any sites for halloween weddings, but I see another answerer to question gave you a few, but I had a few ideas I wanted to share with you. If you plan on getting married next Halloween, after Halloween this year, go to the stores, and buy decorations when they are marked down. You can load up on all kind of stuff. My husband and I were in Kmart one year and got Halloween items 90% off. Are you going to ask that the quests come in costumes too? So, they can get into the \"spirit\" of the wedding. I seen a cake that was patterned after Jack the Pumpkin King, it was grogeous. We decorate our yard, and have had several haunted houses. If you have a beauty school around your area, check with them for the manniguan heads that they practice on. We use them for decorations, and making fake people. If you lived close by, my husband craves the most beautiful pumpkins. you could have the steps lined with craved pumpkins. We have built a torture rack, and the old fashion guilatine. We also have the things that you put your head through and hands. Like they did back in the Purtain days. For your reception, you could build some of those and let the quests take pictures. They aren't hard to make and pretty cheap too. There's so much you can do, and one thing about Halloween props they don't have to be perfect and beautiful. We made candle holders, and cages for creatures. Sam's has the coolest vampire bat, it's large and lights up $60. I am hoping for one of those for my birthday this year. lol Make some awesome punch with frozen hands floating in it. We used red punch, and frozed clear ginger ale in plastic gloves. The possiblities are endless, I am so excited for you, wish I could help you. Lots of candles, orange and purple lights...Walmart. Again, if you got some cash this year you could really get some nice things. The hobby stores carry more items you could use at the receptions like trays and bowls. A lot of decorations you can make yourself, ghosts can be made out of cloth or for outside you can use plastic white garbage bags. The dollar tree stores have nice little halloween what-knots that you could use when doing your centerpeices, and again after the 31st you could get them for a fraction of the cost. Make sure you get a notebook and if you have a digital camera take pictures of everything you have so you won't over buy or buy the same thing twice. You just have the most happiest of weddings, and the spookiest! God bless us all..............", 9334, "q9UHkqGqaa", 0],

	89656 : ["Some poetry is just what you say, it has guidelines but no fast hard rules.  Other forms do have fast hard rules, such as rhyme scheme, meter, number of lines, number of syllables in each line.  There are so many different forms that even those with no rules or guidelines generally follow a pattern of some sort.  As for spelling, first a lot of mispelled words show that the writer doesn't care enough for his/her own work to spell properly, if it is full of spelling errors, it is difficult to read, as the mind will slow down and respell the words and the flow, if any, goes away.  The same with punctuation.  No punctuation in a poem makes it a long run-on sentence regardless of line breaks.  Just as it is your right to call anything you want poetry, it is someone else's right to call it non-poetry.  If it flows, and reads well and has some type poetic quality to it, I will not argue if it is or isn't poetry, but if you write an English sonnet with 7 lines that don't rhyme and are not iambic pentameter, then we will disagree, for that form has rules.  The same with a Dondicrostic Quint.  That is a quintuple acrostic with the first letter of each word forming another word reading down line by line, except for the end words, and the use the last letter of the word.
