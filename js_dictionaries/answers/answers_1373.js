	74261 : ["Because Israel has an extremely weak government, led by an idiot prime minister.  Let me explain: unlike the US, Israeli parliament, the Knesset, is built of political parties. When voting, we, Israeli citizens, vote not for president, electors or even one of two or three parties, but asked to choose between 20 to 30 viable parties.  How is that disastrous? In order to make a move, the Israeli government must form a coalition out of tiny little particles - each carrying its own agenda. And so, while orthodox parties cry \"More money for orthodox education!\"  Rightist parties bellow: \"Building outside the green line must go on!\"  And the liberal party insists: \"Legalize civil marriage!\" (which would cause orthodox parties to automatically drop the bomb and leave the government). Thus we're left with one weak, squeezable prime minister- who'd actually stop building new settlements if he could, but then- he'd have no coalition, no government and no prime-ministry. So on the one hand, Netanyahu is doing the best he can under the heavy pressure he's in. On the other hand- from outsider perspective- this does seem to be very little. Which make Israel, Netanyahu and whatever effort Israel is doing towards peace-talk an easy target for ridicule. If you wish to keep inhibiting the peace talks- go on. Belittle whatever Israel is doing. Interested parties (interested in preserving the current stand-still) inside and outside the Middle East do exactly that in order to crush the talks.", 8768, "LvUHfRfGaa", -1],

The settlements are all placed in strategic grounds, for example high grounds, they do this to fragment the palestinian society. Slowly but surely the settlements will devour the entire land in the West Bank. Notice how defensive all the pro-israel people get. They start talking about how palestinians launch rockets into Israel. That has nothing to do with the issue of settlements, the rockets are the justification Israel uses for routinely bombing palestinians, the settlements have NO justification whatsoever, and it shows the true intentions of the Israel Govt. they dont care about the Palestinians.", 8768, "uLFwsKJHaa", 1],

Under UN SC Res 242, the land is not part of any country and Israel can administer it until Arabs stop violence and all parties peacefully negotiate final status borders that are defensible and secure.  2. I think it is more relevant to ask how can Arabs still want to discuss peace when they continue to engage in terrorist attacks against Israel, and when they continue to preach in Mosques and teach in schools and on children's tv that every Jew must be killed as an Islamic obligation and that 100% of Israel must be destroyed.  Heck Israel implemented a 10 month moratorium on settlement construction and Arabs would not negotiate until the week before they were set to run out... Meanwhile, Hamas killed Israeli civilians in 2 separate ambush attacks. In one case they killed a pregnant woman on the eve of negotiations. But, of course the \"problem\" is the settlements.  3. Most of those \"settlements\" are built on land that is either Jewish owned private property or government owned property. The reason there were no Jews there in 1967 was because Arabs ethnically cleansed the Jews out of there in 1948.  Arabs were trying to ethnically cleanse the Jews BEFORE the 1967 war and any alleged \"occupation.\" Arabs started the 67 war. Israel offered to trade all the land for peace in 1967. No takers.  Years later, Egypt asked if the deal was still on the table.  Israel said yes and traded all the land won for peace even though Israel built a billion dollar airport and found oil on the land in question.  Israel gave most of the WB and Gaza to the PA under Oslo to start peace and even removed settlements.  Arabs breached every one of their obligations and the terrorist attacks on Israel INCREASED in response.  The Arabs sometimes talk about peace but consistently act in ways that show war (and also talk that way too. While negotiating Oslo, Arafat and other PA ministers were simultaneously saying in the Arab press that it was just a trick to destroy all of Israel and Israel negotiated anyway...)", 8768, "l4NWlTUTaa", -2],
	74281 : ["Firstly it's not Palestinian territory but dispute territory. and accordingly is subject to negotiations. Those who claim that all the West Bank is palestinian are trying to presume the results of final status talks before they've even begun. There has never been an independent Palestinian state.The country belonged to the Ottomans and theBritish formed a Mandate there from 1917-48. Peace means the absence of violent confrontation. The palestinian arabs have waged a terror campaign for over 70 years and got no where.In fact it set them backwards. Now is the time to try peace. Micharda's claim below that the West Bank including East jerusalem is occupied because of some UN resolution defies logic- since it would include the Jewish quarter of the Old City that was taken by Jordan by force after its Jewish population were expelled and the Etzion block which was similarly evacuated. Remember that there are 55 muslim countries in the UN that influenced by Russia vote en bloc on issues involving Israel and carry many african countries with them. The pre-1967 borders were the ceasefire lines following the war of independence which ended in 1949. The Arab League countries and palestinian arab leadership refused to recognize partition and launched a war of aggression involving 5 arab armies in order to drive the Jews into the sea. The arabs lost that war yet encouraged the Palestinians to engage in a 60 year terror campaign that failed. You cannot now put the clock back to 1947.
