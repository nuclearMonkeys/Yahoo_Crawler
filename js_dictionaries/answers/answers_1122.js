It's like a Chinese robot going \"ching chong chang\" with squinty eyes/headlights. there is a way to do it tastefully (I don't mind a homage to culture, but to make a culture the butt of a joke is lame). If your race/culture was shown in 99% of movies to be buffoons and \"accessories\" you'd be flippy too. ...

In Europe, the term is used to apply to the music of the Celts, who occupied a broad swath of land including France and Galicia in Spain. It is rather hard to pin down all music that might be \"Celtic\" in origin, as it is to write the real history of the Celts. According to the Wikipedia article on Celtic music, \"Gaelic music\" is a term used by some to distinguish between the Gaelic, meaning Irish, Scottish, and Manx group of pieces and the Brythonic, meaning Breton, Welsh and Cornish group. These differ in their range and in the scale used.  I suspect this Celtic/Gaelic distinction is not made by the average listener, but by the inner circle of musicians.
