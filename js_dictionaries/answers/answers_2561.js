My dobermans were awesome at their job and that was keeping the couch from walking off. They had no desire to do anything more. They knew basic commands and loved going places with me but they had no drive for \"anything bigger and better\". If you have a dog who want to do something, who is really responsive to training, etc they have the ability to do anything you want to teach them whether it's agility or personal protection. Here is an example of a dog who has the desire and is being trained to do more than just retrieve:  As far as the trainer, I think most people who are actively involved with personal protection training have some sort of mentor or are involved with a training group. There are many seminars held dealing with how to properly train your dog and I think in the end the owner/trainer is the one training the dog, but the mentor is the one training the trainer. I do not think you can read a book or watch a you tube video and learn everything you need to know to effectively train a dog. The other thing to remember is obedience training is the most important part of personal protection training. add: replace everywhere I wrote trainer with handler and mentor with trainer/mentor", 11189, "ylACvbSsaa", 0],

On a side note. 90% of training is done at home...a lot of people don't put their Schutzhund dogs on a decoy until the dog is 1+ years old and do all the groundwork training themselves. Obviously if you've never trained a dog for the sport in question you have no choice but to attend classes...and they aren't cheap...I'd say about $3,500 on average for 1 year of study. -edit- Dobiz_Rule is a perfect example of the RIGHT and ONLY way to get involved in sport.

	133895 : ["Hello Ruby Jane,                          Here's how I compost. I have three bins supplied by the local council. No1 bin is used as a holding bay where all compostable material is put (more on the ingredients later). Everything is mixed together and when the bin is full (about four weeks for me) I empty the contents and mix a couple of buckets of horse manure into the compost (any manure will do but horse muck seems to work best). This is then put into No2 bin and doused with a couple of gallons of water. The process is then started again and then No3 is filled. From starting to fill No1 bin in March I can have compost ready for use from No2 by the end of June. The secret to making good compost is mixing and I do that once per Month then refill the bin and add water.       Now for the recipe. Grass clippings, weeds(try not to include any that have gone to seed, or has a creeping rootstock) vegetable waste(not cooked), paper & cardboard shredded, leaves in fact anything that is organic and dosn't attract vermin. Hope this helps, by the way welcome to the world of gardening. If you have any other queries please ask.                                      Mel.", 11199, "E9jpDw3Oaa", 0],

	133908 : ["In many ways I agree with you - there are people who think that a dog attacking someone is 'protection' but do not realise the standard of obedience training that is needed to have a protection dog that is safe. I think it is wrong to blanket all family pets with the rule of confiscation if they are trained to attack. What about people who have GSDs and attend Schutzhund training? These dogs (not just GSDs) are highly trained not only in protection but tracking and obedience (They have to pass an obedience test before they can even begin training in the three phases) This would mean that these clubs would be banned and dogs confiscated yet these dogs are probably less likely to cause problems than others that have not been trained. SchH is recognised as a test of the nerve and capabilities of the working GSD.  If you were to get a dog of 'strong' character and someone say like me, applied to adopt it and stated that I wanted to train it SchH would I be turned down because of this when the chance is that the dog would love having a job to do and have an excellent home for life. Rules like these need serious thinking on and the wording of them so as those with a genuine reason for training a protection dog do not get their dog taken away from them.", 11189, "70yxUIHDaa", 1],
