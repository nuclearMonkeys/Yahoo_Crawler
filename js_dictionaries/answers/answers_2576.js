I generally use a thick-mouthed copper D-ring snaffle, or sometimes a large loose-ringed sweet-iron snaffle, sometimes with a roller if I have a horse that likes to play with the bit.  I warm it in my hands or in some warm water on cold days so they don't get an ice-cold hunk of metal stuffed in their mouth.  I don't ever use shanked bits, twisted bits, thin bits, or anything else designed to hurt.  A bit will NOT tear up a horses mouth when chosen and used appropriately.  Absolutely some of the torturous devices people have invented can do serious damage to a mouth in the wrong hands- but they should never ever be necessary.  A harsh bit doesn't solve problems- it creates them and is the easy way out with a horse that needs retraining.  The harsher the bit- the harder the mouth, so you'll constantly be 'upping the ante' with harsher and more painful bits to get the horse to obey.  I buy or am given 'problem' horses and retrain them as a hobby- I have NEVER had need of anything harsher than a plain snaffle bit, and these are horses labeled 'psychotic', 'bolter', 'uncontrollable', 'vicious', and worse.   The traditional mechanical hackamores are actually HARSHER than many bits- they often have long shanks and chain curbs.  Basically when you put pressure on a mechanical hackamore, it squeezes their nose (and can squeeze it quite hard if you don't have soft hands).  In hackamores with chain curb straps, it not only squeezes the top of their nose, but the chain bites into the bottom jaw as well.  I have used bosals- which are designed to be gentle in the right hands, but can become harsh and painful in the hands of a novice.  And I have used sidepulls- which are a more modern adaptation of the bosal.  Sidepulls are generally a good choice for a beginning rider- unless you have a particularly thin and harsh example of this bridle type, it is gentle and a novice can't abuse it to the extent of a mechanical hackamore, bosal, or a harsher bitted bridle.  So to summarize- mechanical hackamores and bosals: Experienced riders with soft hands ONLY- they can be downright abusive in a novice's hands.  Mild bit or sidepull: should be okay for any rider- use whatever suits the horse and rider best.", 11224, "8NSh1D4Maa", 0],
	134624 : ["In The Name Of Allah The Most Gracious The Most Merciful When it is said hijab it does not only mean for women but for men as well, Hijab is something that covers so that this certain thing that is covered cannot be shown.  This is a mistake that many of my sisters in islam are making, they think that hijab is only a head scarf.  Hijab means that you not only cover your head but your body as well, sisters may say we do cover our body, but do you really? The prophet peace and blessings be upon him said \"there will come a time where women will walk while clothed but they will be naked\" what he meant by that is that women are clothed but the clothing is so tight that you can see the actual form of the body which is forbidden in islam.  Another thing is hijab goes for men as well whereby they must cover there private parts and so do women. Allah the Almighty says: In The Name Of Allah The Most Gracious The Most Merciful (Tell the believing men that they should lower their gazes and guard their sexual organs; that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is well-acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women that they should lower their gazes and guard their sexual organs, and not display their adornment, except that which is apparent of it; and that they should draw their head-coverings over their bosoms, and not display their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers or their husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers or their brothers' sons or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands possess, or male servants who lack sexual desire, or children who are not aware of women's nakedness; and that they should not strike their feet in order to make known what they hide of their adornment.) (An-Nur 24: 30-31) Several divine injunctions are contained in these two verses. Two of them pertain to both men and women, namely, the lowering of the gaze and the guarding of the sexual organs, while the rest are addressed exclusively to women. A difference is to be noted here between the expressions, ‘lower their gazes' and ‘guard their sexual organs,' signifying that while the sexual organs must be totally guarded without any leeway, the lowering of the gaze is only partial, because necessity and the general interest of the people require that some looking at members of the opposite sex be allowed. ‘Lowering the gazes' does not mean that in the presence of the opposite sex the eyes should be shut or that the head should be bowed toward the ground, since this would be impossible; in another place the Qur'an says, ‘Lower your voice' (Luqman 31: 19), which does not mean sealing the lips. Here, ‘lowering of the gazes' means to avert one's gaze from the faces of the passers-by and not to caress the attractive features of the members of the opposite sex with one's eyes. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) told `Ali ibn Abi Talib, ‘Ali, do not let a second look follow the first. The first look is allowed to you but not the second.' The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) considered hungry and lustful looks at a person of the opposite sex as ‘the zina (adultery or fornication) of the eye,' according to his saying, ‘The eyes also commit zina, and their zina is the lustful look.” He termed the lustful look zina because it gives sexual pleasure and gratification in an unlawful way. This is also what Jesus (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said in the Gospel of Matthew: You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery'. But I say to you that everyone who so much as looks at woman with evil desire for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matt. 5:2728) Indeed, such hungry and lustful looks are not merely a danger to chastity but they also result in agitation of the mind and disturbed thoughts.

Where as with the hackamore (if not using the bosal) the communication is blurred. The signals are not clear because it's the same general effect as pulling on the halter.

However, I don't think it can truly be defined in any one religion. 3. I am Wiccan. 4. There aren't any designated doctrines in Wicca except for the Wiccan Rede (“An it harm none, do as ye will”) and the Threefold Law (Everything you do comes back to you three times, whether good or bad – this is essentially karma). 5. What other religions/spiritualties besides your own do you admire/like/draw inspiration from?  I draw inspiration and spirituality from Native American religions, Celtic and Norse mythology or basic beliefs, and Buddhism (especially for meditation purposes). 6. I was uncertain as a Christian but have found my spiritual path in Wicca.  I still think that things cannot fully be known in respects to whatever deity or deities out there.  We just can't truly know what the afterlife and such is like until after we die. 7. There is no way to truly know what it is like in the afterlife without dying.  People who have died and returned and preached about what the afterlife really is are usually cons in disguise. I believe in a Summerland (similar to heaven but can't really be called that) and/or reincarnation and that the wicked are still punished for their misdeeds but not with an eternity in the Christian hell. 8. I do believe this is possible.  I have been visited by my deceased cousin and I have seen both the spirits of humans that have passed away as well as those of animals and, unfortunately, malicious spirits.  I believe the way I do because of my personal experiences which if I were to write them here, it would take you over a week to read everything that has happened to me. 9. I believe that there are good spirits and bad spirits, the true identity and nature of these not capable of full understanding by humans.  Angels and demons are more so associated with the three Abrahamic religions, but in a way you can say I believe that there are both good (angels) and bad (demons). 10. Meditation and quiet reflection on nature, spirit, mind, and body has helped me become a much calmer and stable person.  I say stable in the form of spiritual stability as well as with the use of meditation because it is healthy for the body and really centers or grounds you to the present.  I think those are my favorite things about my faith unless you count that I can truly feel my Goddess and God in all things.  I also like how my religion is inclusive, that it doesn't discriminate because of someone's sexual orientation, etc. 11. Meditation is my favorite if you couldn't tell from my previous answer.  I also enjoy our prayer because it makes me feel involved with the Goddess and God (our rituals are our prayers, but I also pray without ritual). 12. It is helpful, I think, for the individual person but not for groups.  When you get groups going you tend to get the formation of radically conservative and radically liberal groups.  This causes conflict and then the destruction of a lot of good things let alone society. 13. I was raised a very fundamentalist Baptist.  What changed me was that I got sick of hearing about hellfire, the damnation of all those who didn't believe the way my church did, how women were ignorant and had to be controlled (that we had to be submissive to male relatives in body and mind), and many more issues.  It made me sick and I felt that it was destroying me as a person and destroying my soul to believe in such a way and to act in such a way.  After finding Wicca, I have  started to live as I should, to be accepting of all people and things, to find the joy in spirituality through duality (Goddess and God, yin and yang, etc.).  My views changed so much when I separated myself from how I was raised, to see the world for what it really is. My travels have helped me see the world with new eyes and being.  I am so thankful for the opportunities I had to change my outlook and become a better person. 14. As I said, I'm Wiccan, so I don't believe in an ultimate heaven or hell. 15. Depending on what religion, I have had both positive and negative experiences (if that was not evident by my answers).", 11226, "gtVMPnAWaa", 1],

	134667 : ["Personally it depends on the horses reaction and their personality. Some horses cant stand bits but love hackamores and sometimes its the opposite. I have Two horses... Well my other one died Saturday:( but my barrel racer works good with both but on the other hand my trail horse cant use a bit and has to use a hackamore!!  As we all know their are tons of different bits, I myself have many like the twisted dog bone, a snaffle and a wonder bit i also have a good Hackamore that i use when im at Home. Bits are designed to be a better control for the rider. they are made to ease the horse and to keep the control of the horse for the rider. Each bit works differently and each bit reacts differently to every horse. The best way to decide for a bit is to try to a soft but strong one and one that your horse will like. Hackamores are designed with the horse in mind. It keeps the horse in line but also lets it relax at the same time. As compared to the bits it doesnt put as much pressure on the mouth and doesnt pull at the horses mouth cause severe pain like some bits do. Personally i like both but im more towards the hackamore because it works well with both horses and i have the same tack for both so its easier to use then having to change the whole bridle and that costs me more time.. Hope i helped:)!!!", 11224, "None", -1],

And on the bad bits, some people make bits that are torture on purpose, which is wrong. I use a snaffle, or D-ring bits, which does nothing wrong to the horses mouth.

	134671 : ["you said women have to wear hijab and men mustn't. WRONG. we men have a hijab to wear too. we are to cover the area between our navels and our knees in public at the minimum, and prophet Muhammad himself said it's indecent for men to show their shoulders in public. this is in al-Bukhari. i think your understanding of hijab is wrong:  1 - hijab refers to covering, not the headscarf. both men and women are to cover up in public, but the qur'an does not specify that the hair must be covered for either sex. for women it says that their breasts are to be covered, which should be obvious, but back then the pagan arabs had a tradition of going round the ka'bah naked, which looks indecent in and of itself. plus, it looks indecent nowadays that so many women wear low-cut tops or bikinis, yet the qur'an specifies that this shouldn't be so.  2 - even if it were referring to the headscarf, there's nothing stipulating that men mustn't wear something to cover their hair. in fact, Muhammad himself sometimes covered his hair, and back in those days men and women's mode of dress was surprisingly similar. the men even wore headscarves too, and there was nothing wrong with this.  see Sky Rake for further clarification.", 11221, "FKW5D3buaa", 0],
