	97786 : ["That's not true. As an employer I have interviewed hundreds of people in my time...and what everyone does is calls the person you want first, if that person misses the call or turns the job down, we still have all the rejected applicants to re-consider. Just call them back - employers are people too, we don't expect you to be sitting by the phone for days waiting for us to call! Just call them back, apologise for missing their call (you don't have to explain why you missed the call) and that your calling back with regards to the interview. If it's good news, don't forget to ask when you start! lol If it's bad just ask them to keep you on file in case the situation changes and thank them for their time. Legally in the UK you can ask for feedback on an interview, if you would like feedback just ask them so you can improve next time - feedback isn't why you didn't get the job, it's how you came across, if the answers were detailed enough, did you look the part (could you have dressed differently). Don't expect the employer to be able to give you feedback then and there - ask them if they would be willing to give you feedback about your interview, and when would be a convenient time to discuss it, or if you like ask them to write a letter with your feedback (this gives them an out in case they've never done it before and they need to check how to do it with a colleague) Good luck!", 9633, "0AtqJeIWaa", 1],

But no, you are in the normal range (BMI of 1.85 Mg/a to 2.5 Mg/a, although after 2.29 Mg/a adults may begin to have a moderate risk of certain health problems). To be exact your Body Mass Index is 2.(093 663 911 845 730 027 548 2) mega grammes-per-are*, not even 40% of the way to the normal range maximum. Although, I guess I should also mention that the ideal BMI for your age and sex (seventeen year old female) is about 2.116 Mg/a. * where the formula for Body Mass Index is BMI = m/hÂ² and a mega gramme-per-are (Mg/a) = 10 kg/mÂ². But don't worry at all, you're not too far from there. The difference is only 6,081 grammes, so I don't think it would hurt at all to not gain that tiny, tiny amount of weight.

	97823 : ["yeah cuz its next to ur mouth The lip can often swell considerably after the piercing and will need both facial and oral aftercare to keep both sides of the jewelery clean at all times. Monroes, like all piercings, are prone to infection and it is vital that the piercing is cleaned regularly. Scarring is minimal to none if properly taken care of. An advantage of a Monroe piercing is that the lip area generally heals faster than other piercings. The estimated healing time given by professional piercers for this type of lip piercing is between 8–12 weeks,[2] but many find it heals in 3–6 weeks.[1] The Monroe is said to be a relatively painless piercing process, compared to others, as this area of the body is soft and contains few nerves. There is a small risk of piercing the superior labial artery, which lies just above the upper lip. As with similar piercings, Monroes can cause long-term damage to the gums and teeth. The back-disk of metal jewelery worn in this piercing rubs against them, potentially resulting in gum recession or damage to tooth enamel. Plastic labret-studs are available to minimize this problem.", 9631, "None", 1],

You recognize that these things bother you and I think you need some healing to get past that.  I would also suggest that you show your husband your original post.  Not so that he can change anything, but so that he can be aware.  If he's watching True Blood and you walk out in a bad mood, he's going to be clueless.  If he knows how you are feeling he can have the opportunity to show you why he fell in love with you.
