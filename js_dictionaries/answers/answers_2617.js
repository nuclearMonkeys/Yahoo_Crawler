Shawn is called Mr. WrestleMania cause of the quality of matches he has had at WrestleMania..    I've only watched every WrestleMania since WM 9 ans Shawn has stolen the show constantly.. Except for his match against Vince (which was pretty entertaining for what it was) he hasn't had many bad matches..  The Undertaker has had best or 2nd best show for past 6 years and with that combined with the streak it's hard to argue with The Undertaker being called Mr. WrestleMania..", 11323, "OO0kZVeKaa", 0],

	136701 : ["I'm going the other way on this one. I think it's awesome.  Now, let me start this off by saying that overall, Triple H was not my first choice to face The Undertaker this year. In fact, there are three or four guys I'd rather see ahead of him. But now that we know this is the match we're getting, like it or not, having it inside Hell in a Cell really adds to it, in my opinion. At its core, it's a bit of a dream match. The Undertaker and Triple H are easily 1 and 1A in terms of who is the greatest Hell in a Cell performer of all time, so having them clash one-on-one inside of it is something I've always wanted to see. Plus, the fact that HIAC has it's own PPV now and they're still stepping outside the conventional boundaries to bring it to Wrestlemania is pretty cool to me.  Now, to your points. Number one, the fact that one match over a decade ago was not good doesn't mean anything at all. Just because one HIAC match was bad means you shouldn't ever have another one? I don't agree with that. Sure, there have been more than a few duds inside HIAC, but we've seen some all time classics as well.  Number two, I don't think there is any chance at all that this match will have interference or a screwy ending. This is one of those mega-grudge matches. It will end cleanly, one way or another. And besides, the WWE had Money in the Bank for years, a wild gimmick match, and it took off brilliantly.  Number three, this one might be correct. They don't have to top their first one simply because it was so long ago and the bulk of today's fans have forgotten it or never saw it in the first place. Their match last year was a war, and you're right, it'll be VERY hard to approach, but Hell in a Cell plays into that. It's like the retirement angle two years ago with Shawn Michaels. They couldn't just have a repeat of their first match, that was a classic and nearly impossible to touch, so they changed up the settings and went for something different. It's the same deal this year with Triple H.  BQ: No, I don't think he will, but at the same time, I don't think that saying there are \"far greater performers\" is accurate though. Shawn Michaels is better than him, but other than him, Triple H is the biggest name on The Streak.  I've heard that The Rock is planning on sticking around past Wrestlemania is a part-time capacity (the occasional feud or match, much like we see now with Triple H and The Undertaker), so if that is indeed the case I would think it'll be him or John Cena to face The Undertaker next year. My biggest reason for thinking that The Streak will remain intact though? If the WWE ever decides to end it, it'll be the main event of Wrestlemania, no if ands or butts. That's not even a question. And this year the main event belongs to John Cena and The Rock. I do believe that some day, The Streak will be broken, but it won't be when The Undertaker isn't in the true main event.", 11328, "rseD4OG2aa", 3],
	136702 : ["@Sandi ur actually wrong on that account big time..he lost to Stone Cold in 1998 and had a count out loss to Tatanka in 1993..And lost to Diesel in 1995 to name 3 but with that said I wouldn't give the Hbk/Hart iron man match a 4/10 it was more like an 8/10..The reason why Taker isn't Mr.Wrestlemania is bc if u watch all of HBK's WM matches rather he wins or loses they are 5 star matches..Taker is undefeated at Mania but I'd say probably 4 of those 20 wins were 5 star which is why Michaels is \"Mr Wrestlemania\" his record isn't great but he's been in lots of high profile matches...Lets not forget the time at WM 22 when he was on the ladder and did the DX chop and elbow dropped McMahon who had a trashcan on his head through a table!

	136703 : ["It's because he is an amazing performer. Although Undertaker has the streak, he's been outperformed by Shawn Michaels in almost every Wrestlemania. Michaels can capitalize on this huge event and make an amazing performance that is often unforgettable.", 11323, "F9rZUk0Eaa", 0],
	136704 : ["I guess because he's the most entertaining performer in the business and at WrestleMania he elevates his game even further.

Btw I'm not sure if you were referring to this or not but Taker hasn't appeared at 20 WrestleMania's in a row. He had his first match at WM VII, his second at WM VIII and his third at WM IX.

EDIT: Ok, why the heck is this question directed to Clown Prince & LOD? That ain't fair. I'm gonna answer the additional details. Vince does have the power as you mentioned however, Vince is aware of Undertaker's loyalty and hard work for the company. And as a reward for his loyalty, I think the streak will remain. They made the match a no holds barred because it's HHH's speciality which would make the fans think that HHH's is gonna win. Another thing WWE's doing to make the fans think the streak will end is having Shawn Michaels involved.", 11328, "None", 0],

His matches at WrestleMania X, XI, XII, XX, 21, 22, XXIV, XXV and XXVI have all won PWI's match of the year award, as well as X winning Wrestling Observer Newsletter's match of the year award.

	136717 : ["Nah I think it's good. I don't think judging by one WM HIAC match is fair to this one. These are the two greatest HIAC performers of all time. These are the two best wrestlers from their \"era\", and this is Undertaker's last dance, and HHH's last try. To me, there is no better place to settle the \"finale\" than inside of a HIAC. HIAC has been trash for a while now, and hasn't been close to the way it use to back when Foley, HBK, HHH, Taker, Y2J, etc had theirs in the early 2000s and 90s. It would be a GREAT thing if they were to bring back some of that aura the HIAC use to have. And I think that's what they plan on doing during the match. It won't be your average HIAC with no weapons, and no one going to the top of the cell. I think they're going to bring it. And I look forward to a classic type of HIAC match. I think it's THE PERFECT match for them. I would give it a chance. BQ: I don't think he should, but I disagree about your statement. HHH is one of the few people that if WWE decided to have someone end it, should. But as I said, I don't think he should. I also remember you saying Taker should win in dominant fashion for 20-0. I strongly disagree with that. I think they should put on a once in a life time classic, that's ultra competitive, and makes it look like the streak is in more danger than it's ever been in. It would be a huge let down if Taker's last match was won in dominant fashion. When I watch WM, I always look forward to see which match will end up being one of the classics. And even with all the critics, and people who are skeptical about HHH vs Taker going at it for a 3rd time, I still believe they can put on the best match if they bring their A games. Also with HHH being portrayed as the guy who came closest to ending the streak, and making Taker unable to walk under his own power after the match, it would just look weird that Taker beats him convincingly. If these are the last two from such a great era, it should end in one epic, unforgetable, clash.", 11328, "gDuET2jgaa", 3],
