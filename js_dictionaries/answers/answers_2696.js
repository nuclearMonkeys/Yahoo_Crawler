I do know that early this morning WMR was out of order, and it has had issues all weekend. It seems that 9001 has to do with entering the wrong TIN or SSN, which is not the case with my friend. Her SSN brought up the 14th projected date, now the 9001. Hopefully it's just a problem that the IRS will fix in the morning. The friend who is receiving their refund the 8th is a family, receiving a larger refund. The lady who has 9001 is a single mom with one dependent and is receiving EIC and Child tax credit. One friend I helped, received her refund unexpectedly on Saturday???", 11476, "spWemAPPaa", 1],

Hopefully he's not lying to you, and actually does want to be alone (on some rare occasions guys will suddenly find someone else). If he actually does want to be alone for a while you have to respect that and basically move on if you don't want to stick around and HOPE that he'll still want you. You're most likely never going to have him back as the boyfriend he once was (sorry to tell you that). I know its hard to do but you really have to move on.

Edit Just got off the phone with the IRS, they stated that 'due to a computer glitch, your return needs additional processing time.'  I then said, 'so it was a computer glitch on the IRS's end?'  The rep. then said 'Yes, we had a high number of electronic returns and we had a computer glitch, your return was a part of that glitch and needs extra processing time.'
