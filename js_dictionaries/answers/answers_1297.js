	70406 : ["Hey! I see you don't have much help as far as answers because this is a chemistry question. I took chemistry my junior year and I'm planning to major in Biochemistry in college so I think I can be a little bit of a help with this question; lol ^-^.  Ok so what you need to do is look at how they are arranged on the periodic table.  a. 2 of your three elements can be Fluorine and Chlorine. I chose these because they are in the same group on the table. Due to their outer most electron configuration they both have the charge -1 For your last element you can use any of the others but as an opposite to what you chose the in the first two you could use Sodium and Potassium because they are the polar opposite of F and Cl because their charge is +1. On your periodic table there should be tiny numbers in the top right corner of each element's box that tell you the number of electrons in each energy level. In F and Cl the outer most energy level is 7 and that is why the charge is -1.  b. If you want to do two different elements, you know to score a few points with your chem teacher, you can use Helium and Neon for your next problem. He and Ne have similar properties because they are in the same group known as Noble Gases. You will note that despite each gas having one more energy level than the last that all of their energy levels are full. That is why the Noble Gases will not form compounds. Their group is known as 0 while others are known as 1-7 a or b (N is in group 5a while As is in group 5b).   Well that should pretty much give you whatever you need to answer your questions. If the teacher needs more than that you can always research your Noble Gases on google or in your text book. Hope that helped! ^.^", 8557, "NbKM3nJlaa", 0],

	70418 : ["No, y.a. is way too immature/unprofessional to use as any kind of forum. There are numerous forums on these subjects, and they're just a google search away. But to give a short answer. God doesn't have to be disproved, no one has ever been able to prove God's existence, just as no one has ever been able to prove that unicorns exist. Science has proved evolution. Science has rejected creationism, and they laugh at it, and rightly so. Most creationists are uneducated fools who think that, just because they can have an opinion, they get to say whatever they want. Scientists are the educated ones, and they have made these decisions. If you want to disprove evolution, well, get studying, or shut up. Science is not politics. No matter how many uneducated people think that evolution is wrong doesn't change the fact that the educated ones have decided that it's right. If you're too lazy to study the thing you want to disprove, well, tough luck. Cry me a river. Edit, to author: Yes I'm suggesting it's too immature. Why I stay here? Well, I have my reasons.
