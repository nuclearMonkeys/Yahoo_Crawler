	54557 : ["Dance is a form of art which includes a selected sequence of movements of body parts. Some archaeologist believes this art tradition can be traced back to as old as 3300 B.C.  And just as we need a school teacher to teach us the alphabet, we need a tutor to teach us how to dance. Let us take a closer look at what is the main difference between the terms: dance teacher, dance instructor and dance choreographer. Dance Teacher: A dance teacher is someone who has taken formal education in dance from a dance school or college. They are usually more interested in the history, philosophy and culture of dance. For example, a dance teacher can help me understand which dance form originated from which part of the world. She can also be a great teacher in explaining to us the significance of that particular dance form. Dance Instructor: If you ask me, anyone can become a dance instructor. He/She is someone who has learned dance from a dance studio, have exceptional learning capabilities and can relay the knowledge to others quite smoothly. For example, you might be having a local instructor in your area who teaches dance to students, without having a formal knowledge of dance learnt from a school or college. He/She is known as a dance instructor. Dance Choreographer: A dance choreographer is someone who creates compositions, plans and arranges dance movements and patterns for a single individual or group of dancers to dance. For example, just the way we have a movie director who is head in charge of the movie, similarly, a dance choreographer is the one who is in charge of all the entire dancing act as a whole. I hope this answer gave you clarity in understanding the core differences between a dance teacher, dance instructor and dance choreographer.", 7605, "sK1RY4mLaa", -1],
