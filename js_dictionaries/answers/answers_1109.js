	60935 : ["Yep.  I wouldn't even bother making a religious argument against gay marriage.  Its not a matter that would be decided in religious arenas.  There are plenty of secular reasons gay marriage is not good for everyone.  In fact, the only people it would benefit, are gay people.  What ever cost for it, would be divided among the rest of society.  Religious reasons are not the only reason to oppose gay marriage.  There are some, that it wouldn't even be impossible, that a gay person, would agree with.  As long as they were thinking about overall effects in society, and not just their own interests.  In anything on large sociological scales, there is a lot to think about.  The slightest of things can effect on another.  Not necessarily with this issue, but in general, to be ignorant about such things can be of potentially devastating consequences.  One thing to consider about gay marriage, and plenty of other possible matters of the gay agenda, is that they don't just have a potential to cross grains with the agendas of religious people.  Indeed, most of our population is not gay.  They have needs and desires every bit as much as gay people.  It is entirely possible for aspects of the gay agenda to oppose the interests of heterosexual life, when one examines wide and long range effects.  Sometimes, in all honest reality, what a minority might demand, can very possibly be rather selfish overall.  No specific accusation involved in me saying so, especially when a minority is based upon a behavior, rather than race or gender or other things like that.  Behaviors are actions, not a mere classification of people.  Actions, always have an effect. When you base legislation that can and will, effect everyone, on a \"behavioral minority\", you have to be more careful for what it is going to do on the grander scale.  It is extremely and honestly reasonable to consider, that often enough, the gay agenda may demand things that are not necessarily fair or in mind of the necessities and desires of our people, as a whole.  No matter what demand for \"tolerance\" there may be, our species does in fact still reproduce heterosexually.  This is an extremely wide range thing that effects people and the balance of our society.  It is not a thing to take lightly.  It is not impossible, that sometimes, doing what is supposedly right for gay people, can be at the expense of america's youth, and how many of them are allowed to eat or not.  It is simply not impossible that resources rerouted to benefit gays and the framework of their mere desires, can indeed effect other things negatively, and at very least, not be very fair to the rest of our people.  So the answer to the real question, is no,  I don't have to quote a bible verse to show the valitity of very real and true conditions.  My own heart is far too familiar with them to lack the skill of being far more the danger to agendas that do not prove to be truly best, for everyone.", 8089, "8da82103fe0f8016ae2e59b5de8eb5ecaa", 0],

	60958 : ["Hi, It is quite natural that hair frizzes in the summer season, because of loss of moisture due to sun exposure, sea water and pools. However there are ways and means of controlling this issue. 1. The shampoo you are using is good, however i would rather go for a shampoo that is professional and bought from a salon, like professional L'oreal products. When products are bought from hairdressers they will be more intense and therefore will have a better effect on the hair. 2. Frizz is caused by dryness. so for that matter, you need to buy shampoo FOR DRY HAIR, or MOISTURE SHAMPOO. Both shampoos give moisture to the hair, which will help eliminate frizziness. Also, for even more moisture, you should use a leave-in conditioner, which is a conditioner that shouldn't be rinsed out... this helps give moisture to the hair. Normal conditioner can be used anyway after shampooing the hair anyway, before applying the leave-in. 3. to eliminate frizz you should put some hair serum in your hair when it drys. Hair serum is an oil for the hair, which again gives moisture to the hair.  all these are solutions to eliminate frizz. Also, try to keep away from heat! such as the sun and hair dryers. And try eliminate any chemicals on your hair, such as hair dye, and most of all, bleach (highlights etc...) , as they dry out the hair, and therefore increases frizziness!!! hope u found this answer helpful :)", 8096, "SU1HkHs3aa", 0],
	60959 : ["I have frizzy hair too, personally I really like the sleek and shine system by garnie fruties  they have a sleek and shine syrum that really helps as well, but you don't really need alot of it, just use the shampoo and conditioner, and pump one squirt worth of the syrum in your hands, rub them together then run your hands threw your hair, (especially do this before you blow dry) then if there is still a bit of frizz, repeat with the syrum using half a pump, you really don't need much as if you use to much it will become greasy, they also have a wonderful leave in conditioner, if you decide to get this as well, use it on wet hair before you apply the syrum. I have never had any luck with herbal essences, it tends to make my hair even more frizzy and gives it a very strange texure, i hope you take my advise, its deff. worth a shot!
