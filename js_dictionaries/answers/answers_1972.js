If the parents are BB, BB, they cannot have a baby with blue eyes, since all possible outcomes are BB. If the parents are BB, Bb, they still cant have a baby with blue eyes, because the outcomes of F1 are BB, Bb, BB, Bb. If the parents are both heterozygous Bb, Bb, then the outcomes are BB,Bb,Bb,bb and they can have a baby with blue eyes, although the chances are remote.^_^", 9879, "AA10560206", 0],

	104356 : ["Yes.  There is a possibility that one of the parents has a gene of having blue eyes that is not active inside of him/her. The gene can be passed to the next generation and their is a possibility for it to become active. Of course one of the parents needs to have a parent or grand parent or great grandparent, etc. who has had blue eyes.", 9879, "AA11091583", 0],
	104357 : ["Yes. I can't remember any of the terminology, only the processes involved, but here goes my overly simplified version. Each trait (eye color, for example) has two \"alleles\" (think of them as the genetic code that causes eye color). One causing brown eyes and one causing blue. In each person, two allele's can be represented. This could be two \"brown\" alleles, to \"blue\" alleles or one brown and one blue. We say that brown is the \"dominant\" trait while blue is \"recessive\". This means that a person with one brown and one blue allele will still have brown eyes. The catch is that each parent only contributes one of their alleles to their child. So a man or woman with brown eyes can still pass on the blue allele to his/her children (if he has the mixed brown/blue alleles. If both parents have the mixed brown/blue alleles, they will both have brown eyes, but it is possible for both of them to pass the blue allele to their child. In this case, the child will be born with blue eyes, but only if they recieve the blue allele from both parents.", 9879, "AA11095352", 0],

I would recommend looking up local shops and asking them if they apply rust protector on the undersides of cars and go with that.

Plus some shops may have a warranty on the covering and you may get it replaced if it ever rusts through, but that depends on the shop. Good Luck", 9881, "qPhc7jeZaa", 0],

	104363 : ["Interesting question..... you see the apple is stronger than the banana therefore could squash it - yet the banana is smoother and lighter and could therefore move around more quickly, and could cause the apple to slip with its skin.
