	74808 : ["I believe that the President was referring to total federal taxes, not that every single one of the probably thousands of different taxes or fees won't go up. 1. Glad that the tobacco tax increased.  This is not so much a tax, as asking smokers to pay a little more for the costs we as a society have to pay for them, such as medical care for them and those they harm and kill from secondhand smoke.  The federal tax is only $1.01/pack and should be a lot higher, probably at least $10-$20/pack to cover the true costs that smokers impose on society. 4./6. Surtax on investment income and hike in medicare payroll tax only applies to 250k+, or 200k+ for single.  These don't belong on your list. 18. Certainly limiting compensation for health insurance executives to 500k doesn't affect anyone making under 500k.  This doesn't belong on your list. Most of the other 17 items are not so much tax increases as changes in the tax law related to paying for national health care.  For the most part, and for most middle income people, these are fairly small changes and the effect will be minimal.  The only thing on the list that really bothers me is raising the medical deduction threshhold from 7.5% to 10%, it really should be lowered.  This has a much worse effect on lower income people who have no insurance or expenses not covered by insurance.  Rich people will spend a much smaller portion of their income on medical care. In any case, these small changes are nothing compared to how much better things will be when the new health care law fully takes effect.  It is not as good as a socialized medicine plan where we get rid of the HMOs and their 25% in profits, but it will enable the vast majority of people to have health insurance, and will reduce the ability of the insurance companies to deny treatment to those already insured when they become ill.", 8782, "d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa", -5],

Shah Masood was a great man, as far as Afghans go, and was training and arming anyone who would fight the Soviets.  That was a guerrilla war. There were no interviews and aptitude tests, like for a regular army or government job. The resistance was being crushed, and fighting soldiers would have had to have been a bit mad to join up, until the Stinger missiles started taking their greater effect, in knocking down Soviet helicopters. After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan soon fell into civil war, until 1995, when the Taliban invaded from Pakistan. Shah Masood led the resistance from the city of Mazir-i-Sharif, with much greater numbers than the Taliban, but far fewer, and constantly dwindling supplies. The Taliban and Al Qaida were being supplied by PAKISTAN. Shah Masood just had to make do with what he had, in his own little \"Stalingrad\", as his supplies were running out. Just before 9/11, this brilliant man was assassinated by Al Qaida operatives, posing as a TV crew. It was obvious that Al Qaida and the Taliban badly miscalculated the US and world reaction to 9/11. Shah Masood was dead, but Rashid Dostum was not. The Taliban miscalculated the will of free Afghans too. The Northern Alliance still lived.  Suddenly, they got the supplies and support they needed, to throw out the invading Taliban and their sicko friends.  We didn't have many troops in Afghanistan because we DIDN'T INVADE. The Northern Alliance simply retook their own lands back.  After that, most of them returned to their homes, leaving the power vaccuum that allowed the Taliban to partially return.
