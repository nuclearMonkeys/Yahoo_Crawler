I am 27 and i don't buy much in the the juniors, but i find a good deal at stores like gap, old navy, white house black market, and H&M.    These stores seems a bit older, but still trendy and young.  I think it is a really hard line dressing age appropriate, but still trendy.  I definately agree with some of the misses lines being really boring and too young lady, but check out the more designer sections that seem to be a mix between juniors and traditional misses sections.  I know that bigger Macy's or Dillards have these sections.  Dillards can have huge sales so watch for the 50% and 75% off racks and you can get tons of cute, trendy, but slightly older and sophisicated clothes.", 10610, "7f513b6928d491e8fd34faa87694e5fdaa", 0],

	120158 : ["Currently, a bachelor's degree in occupational therapy is the minimum requirement for entry into the field. Beginning in 2007, however, a master's degree or higher will be the minimum educational requirement. As a result, students in bachelor's-level programs must complete their coursework and fieldwork before 2007. All States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the District of Columbia regulate the practice of occupational therapy. To obtain a license, applicants must graduate from an accredited educational program and pass a national certification examination. Those who pass the exam are awarded the title “Occupational Therapist Registered (OTR).” Some States have additional requirements for therapists who work in schools or early intervention programs. These requirements may include education-related classes, an education practice certificate, or early intervention certification requirements. In 2005, 122 master's degree programs offered entry-level education, 65 programs offered a combined bachelor's and master's degree, and 5 offered an entry-level doctoral degree. Most schools have full-time programs, although a growing number are offering weekend or part-time programs as well. Bachelor's degree programs in occupational therapy are no longer offered because of the requirement for a master's degree or higher beginning in 2007. In addition, post baccalaureate certificate programs for students with a degree other than occupational therapy are no longer offered. Occupational therapy coursework includes the physical, biological, and behavioral sciences and the application of occupational therapy theory and skills. The completion of 6 months of supervised fieldwork also is required. Persons considering this profession should take high school courses in biology, chemistry, physics, health, art, and the social sciences. College admissions offices also look favorably at paid or volunteer experience in the health care field. Relevant undergraduate majors include biology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, liberal arts, and anatomy. Occupational therapists need patience and strong interpersonal skills to inspire trust and respect in their clients. Patience is necessary because many clients may not show rapid improvement. Ingenuity and imagination in adapting activities to individual needs are assets. Those working in home health care services must be able to adapt to a variety of settings.", 10611, "None", 0],

	120169 : ["d) As the space probe nears a planet like Jupiter it experiences a gravitational force of attraction. This force causes the spacecraft to accelerate (a =F/m; Newton's second Law ). The acceleration means that there is an increase  in the spacecraft's speed.  This increase in velocity increases the KE of the spacecraft (KE = 1/2 mv^2). The spacecraft continues to increase in speed while it is being attracted to the planet. But, the planet is in an orbit of it's own about the sun and so is on the move. The sling shot effect is arranged so that the planet moves \"out of the way\" just before the spacecraft collides with  it sending the spacecraft hurtling into the space in a new direction (often to another planet or moon) at a much greater speed than it had before. By using the slingshot effect we not only reduce the time to reach some of the outer planets but we can alter the spacecrafts path so that it can encounter  another body in the solar system.", 10604, "None", 2],
