She still has a soother and is almost 18 months And i let her CIO once at 14 months, and she survived it. Again, advice from pple i know and trust.

	121173 : ["lol  That's actually funny!  I was taking a childhood development class in school years ago, and one of the things it specifically mentions is to \"Never tell the child 'wait until your father/mother gets home.\" When the teacher asked us if it ever happened in our homes, the girl next to me said her mom had been doing it for years, but her dad hasn't come home yet.

For instance, I can't say \"Oh my God\" in the presence of most Christians, but they could say things that potentially offend other religions, and an someone COULD make an argument of that being offensive.

It was a kind of totem for ancient Chinese people. They believed that the dragon could live in the sea and fly in the sky, that it controled lightening, rainbow and other natural phenomena. The image of dragon was a mixture of fish, crocodile, snake, cloud, lightening, rainbow and so on. The dragon brought people both disasters and bliss.

	121190 : ["Certainly.  But don't count on it being recognized as great until more like the 22nd century.  It takes time for the value of a literary work to make itself known.  Best sellers are seldom (won't say never) great literature. Then again, we need a clear definition of \"great literature,\" don't we?  Since most people tend to say things like \"having stood the test of time,\" at least as part of their definition, I would not be in a hurry to label anything \"great literature.\"  I would unhesitatingly refer to a great book as such; but \"literature\" is a term of art from Academia, and I don't pretend to know what they mean by it.

	121191 : ["that's a common contention, debated and perhaps even partially debunked on more than a few occasions by some of the greatest minds the Western world has ever produced. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus. Trotsy grappled with something similar, claiming \"ideas that enter the mind under fire remain there securely and forever.\" This is notable here for nothing so much as its utter lack of relevance. General Leon \"Bull\" Crap perhaps summed it up best when he noted that \"the higher a monkey climbs, the more you can see of its butt.\"  If he caught a glimpse of the abs first, it's not obvious from a cursory perusal of his vomit stained journal, written with the burnt ends of sharp sticks that he was rumored to have placed in his nose just to frighten local mud children around the Bugsloggian base where he was stationed, that saved their feces and used them to build a life-sized statue of him, then took turns coming around and futiley effforting to amuse themselves by trying to outwit \"Big Poo Bull.\" By all accounts he and they both failed miserably. But if one expects concrete results from the contemplation of absurdities in the courageous-to-the-point-of-recklessness pursuit of true wisdom, then he/or she likely wasn't cut out for such deadly serious duty in the first place. So pay no heed to these naysaying wags. Find the fattest hen you can and wear it in a shoulder holster.

	121192 : ["Not always. But yes, if people are working their glutes than most likely they are working the rest of their body as well. But there are still some cases in which a person works only their butt but does not work their abs and than can mean they have a tight butt but no tight abs. You have to work both muscles to get both results. If you work only one muscle(like the glutes/butt) than only your glute is going to be tighter.
