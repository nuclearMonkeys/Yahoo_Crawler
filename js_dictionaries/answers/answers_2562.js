Just because France has an aircraft carrier doesn't make them formidable in any way, shape or form. The French would still be speaking German if it weren't for the US, Britain, Russia and the rest of the allied forces in World War II. Japan hasn't fielded an army or navy since getting their butts kicked up to their eyeballs in World War II (even though they are starting to rebuild both again).

Japan was never a great military power... it lost every war it launched on a foreign power (USA, America, China, Korea), and it isn't allowed a defence force in its Constitution coz no-one wants another ww2.

They were a great 80's French counterpart to NWOBHM. Anthrax covered one of their songs, \"Antisocial\", and at different times, both Clive Burr and Nicko McBrian drummed for them. Plus, they sing in French and sound great. I'd definitely recommend them. BA: never BA2: Croatia would be interesting", 11200, "None", 0],
	133954 : ["I am interested to discover what your definition of power is. Maybe if you were capable of spelling and punctuating your question, I may have been able to discover what you meant by reading it. The French have historically proven themselves to be blouse wearing surrender monkeys. It took Australia to bail half of France out of the mess they were in, in ww2. Unfortunately, the majority of Frenchmen conveniently forgot about this fact within a very few short years. More recently they have gained fame by obliterating atolls in the Sth.Pacific, and assassinating members of Greenpeace. The Japanese are still not allowed to bear arms under their own flag as a result of the atrocities they perpetrated during WW2. Admittedly, they have a strong economy, but I would not want to live there, cost of living would be hell. Something you perhaps not aware of, my friend is that Australia's population is only just over 20 million. We have a surplus in our budget approaching $17 billion, and have been very instrumental in peace keeping, disaster aid, and policing in our OWN PART OF THE WORLD. We have free health, and schooling: very little racism, and no political unrest. The UN HDI indicator lists Australia as the 3rd most livable country in the world...

Good things you can compost include vegetable peelings, fruit waste, teabags, plant prunings and grass cuttings. These are considered “Greens.” Greens are quick to rot and they provide important nitrogen and moisture. Other things you can compost include cardboard egg boxes, scrunched up paper and fallen leaves. These are considered “Browns” and are slower to rot. They provide fibre and carbon and also allow important air pockets to form in the mixture. Crushed eggshells can be included to add useful minerals. Certain things should never be placed in your bin. No cooked vegetables, no meat, no dairy products, no diseased plants, and definitely no dog poo or cat litter, or baby's nappies. Putting these in your bin can encourage unwanted pests and can also create odour. Also avoid composting perennial weeds (such as dandelions and thistle) or weeds with seed heads. Remember that plastics, glass and metals are not suitable for composting and should be recycled separately.", 11199, "a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa", 69],
	133972 : ["Grass and hedge clippings are fine.....Just remember No meat, dairy or citrus left overs...eggs shells are fine... Also remember to pop some cardboard in between layers of greens or veg, grass clippings. This helps reduce the wet slop you can end up with instead of firm broken down compost. As a final tip from a Gardening Guru I watched on TV....a natural fluid that helps breakdown the waste is human Urine....I placed about two pints of Urine into my composter and its reducing fairly quickly and appears to be working. I believe it has acid properties that encourage bacteria that helps break down the raw vegetation.....It may sound disgusting but it looks like it does work ironically...", 11199, "None", 4],
