Because of the aid and medicines given to these unfortunate people we have in essence removed the checks and balances that nature needs to keep the population at a sustainable level. Habitats are lost to slash and burn farmers....animals are driven to extinction...etc.. If people in third world countries don't control their birthrate to a size that they can easily manage without relying on aid then their children will starve in the future... Unless aid is used to help people to fend for themselves then simply feeding them through a crisis is only storing up more misery and suffering in the future.", 10962, "None", 1],
