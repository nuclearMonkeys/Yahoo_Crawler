	80515 : ["Here is an OC recap/commentary I read from TVGUIDE.Com. So good. Ps, you can find Smallville's recap on the same site. November 16, 2006: Old Habits Die Harder for Some than for Others  Never thought I'd see the day when Sandy wanted men, and Julie didn't. OK, so Sandy was simply lamenting the fact that he really doesn't have any guy friends. It was cute watching someone as outgoing and self-assured as Sandy get nervous about arranging a playdate for himself. Also fun: Watching Julie get back to her partying bad-girl ways (as opposed to her recent murder-planning bad-girl ways). No sooner did Julie swear off men for a week (“Man drama, who needs it?”) than did we find her dumping gal pal Kirsten and perusing the club scene for younger men. Like mother, like daughter, as Kaitlin also couldn't keep her promise to stay out of trouble for a whole week. (Those two are so much alike, and even resemble each other, that I totally buy them as mother and daughter — much more so than Julie and Marissa.) Now that these two are hanging out at the same clubs, how long before they start dating the same guys? Of course, this would be familiar territory for Julie. Again, I find myself alluding to the infamous Luke and Julie story line of season 1, and thinking about that plot made it hard for me to buy Julie's being so intrigued by her friend's recommendation to date younger men. Julie's been there and done that. But I guess she's not exactly someone who learns from her mistakes.  Much like Julie, Ryan was also slipping back into old habits. Naturally, it was that habit of his that often gets him into so much trouble: his need to rescue people. Specifically, rescuing girls. Initially, he resisted most of Taylor's pleas for help — until Sandy reminded him that helping people is just what he does, it's part of who he is. And really, what was required of him this time wasn't too big of a deal, as he simply had to pretend to be Taylor's boyfriend (OK, her fantastic new lover whom she was simply wild about). At least he didn't have to beat someone up and revert to his other old habit of losing his temper. I wasn't sure how I was going to like the Ryan-Taylor pairing that I had read about in recent weeks. For now, Taylor's extreme perkiness isn't annoying me, and she's cracking me up (“Back to you and your life Ryan: What's your favorite fruit?”). And, surprisingly, she's making me feel sympathy for her, such as when she described how her loneliness had led her to marry her French husband, Henri-Michael. The jury's still out on this pairing for me, but so far, so good.  Also good: Summer's attempts to move on past the pain of losing her best friend. Her opening scene with the off-screen shrink helping her through the five stages of grief was hilarious — even the depression step. Oh, and she did it all in one week! Like Seth, I was initially excited by the idea of having the old Summer back, the one who “loves shopping, tanning and celebrity gossip.” However, unlike with Julie and Ryan, Summer's old habits didn't fit her anymore. The “save-the-planet thing” wasn't a crutch, as she originally thought; she really has changed. And as much as I'll miss the shopaholic Valley-watcher, I think I like the new Summer, too. She's passionate, determined and persuasive. But what does this mean for Seth and Summer's relationship down the road? As they grow, might they grow apart? Guess we'll have to wait and see. A few less important questions: — How did Summer score a dorm room with a walk-in closet?! — Is Providence having an unusually warm winter? Post-Thanksgiving, you'd think you'd see more bulky coats and less short sleeves. — Why does Che play his guitar in the nude?", 9030, "AA12052102", 1],

	80525 : ["Most of my friends on Y/A would probably be surprised at my starring this question. But I loved Michael Jackson, from the time of the Jackson 5 when I couldn't wait for the cartoon every Saturday morning through his branching out into his solo career with some of the early songs like \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" and later of course \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller.\"  But what I'll remember the most are those songs he did that brought tears to my eyes...the songs that attempted to heal divisions (\"Black or White\") and the humanitarian efforts he did alone and with other artists: He had a unique style, awesome dance moves, incredible singing talent, and there will never be another Michael Jackson. He had a knack for uniting/bringing together people of all ages, races and walks of life, and he's still doing it, even in death like here on this thread. I was also impressed with how soft spoken he was and how humble he always came across, even in the midst of superstardom as well as when the world turned their backs on him. R.I.P. Michael Jackson...we will miss you.", 9022, "8pIGQdybaa", 4],
	80526 : ["I'm just slightly older than Michael Jackson, so I was around when his career began with the Jackson 5 and listened to them and other groups from the late sixties into the mid eighties...   Although he did not create the music video, has was among the first to make it mainstream, his thriller video and billie jean helped to expand the usage of the music video to expand record sales.     The talent, the energy and moves both on stage and in the various video created are the items I will always remember about Michael Jackson.      It must be said that those who have great talent and ability  almost always have flaws that are equal to the talent and ability that they hold.  Nearly all the great artists in any venue have had \"character flaws\" , this is natures way of balancing great talent.  No matter what his various personal flaws might have been (and there many), the talent, showmanship and energy will always be remembered.    He was so good in billie jean and thriller (videos) that he became mainstream: Disney had Captain EO at Disneyworld?(which he performed for) for several years and even Steve Martin performed a takeoff on his billie jean video  that was very funny.

And Katelyn, or at least that is how i spell it seeing as that is my name, and her mother made a bet that Katelyn would not get into trouble for a week and that her mom would not get into it with a guy. Katelyn ended up getting a fake id and getting into a club that her mother was at and was dancing with a guy at. Katelyn saw her mom and her mom saw her and then later that night they were in there house eating ice cream. the girl who just moved to oc from france then told the cute guy that works at the mexican restaraunt,played by benjamen makenzie,  that she needed his help so she could get a divorce from her french husband. He reluctantly helped but soon told her that was all he was going to do after she gave him papers in french that he translated antold her no more. Later he saw that her husbands lawyer was not falling for what she was saying and he rushed over and kissed her. The lawyer said that he knew true love when he saw it and walked away. She later brought tortes to share with him and they spent the night eating tortes. I hope that helped and i now think that i am hooked on the oc.

I like them just fine, but don't eat there all that much. Little Tokyo has -much much much- better eats, to me. Good to great ramen abounds (if you like spicy, Orochon ramen is tops, if you love pork, Daikokuya is your place) and Japanese-American greasy spoons are plentiful.
