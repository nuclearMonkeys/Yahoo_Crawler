A LOT of users don't think they posted a violation, but they did. Post again asking \"Was this post a violation\" and include the content that was removed (also any links, images, or updates, as sometimes that's where the violation occurred). . Move your question to Yahoo Products>Yahoo Answers as it's currently in Yahoo Products>My Yahoo and not applicable to this subcategory.

Yahoo never did and Verizon NEVER has explained WHY. Yahoo/Verizon stopped sending out report notice and violation notice emails with hyper links that took you go the appropriate appeal pages more than 2 years ago. Yahoo/Verizon employees do NOT read, monitor or moderate the YA forums. YA users just like YOU are the moderators. Yahoo/Verizon assumes you are intelligent enough to figure out why your question was reported. You really should take the time to READ the YA community guidelines that you agreed to. One person's report very rarely triggers a question deletion. It usually takes at least 2 reports, sometimes many more. Anyone who thinks they ate still a trusted reporter is probably delusional.
