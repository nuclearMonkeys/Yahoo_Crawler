	101839 : ["I'm so sorry about your dream :/ that sounds absolutely horrifying. I would talk to someone that knows how to analyze dreams, maybe someone that knows a lot about psychology, because that doesn't sound like a normal bad dream! I can think of two that have been terrifying. The first dream I think of is this one where my older brother and I were home alone. For some reason, I was sleeping on the couch in his room. We have an alarm system for our house, but we don't use it anymore. The motion sensor still works though, so when someone walks by the sensor downstairs, it lights up. My brother and I were upstairs, so neither one of us were setting the sensor off and it was lighting up. Two seconds later, someone threw a huge bag filled with a dead body up our stairs. The last thing I remember was my brother getting ready to beat this dude down with his bat :/ then I woke up. The second worst dream I've ever had is that the world was ending. All the stars were falling out of the sky, and things were exploding. It was awful. I called my mom at 4am crying when I woke up from the dream. Sorry for typing so much! I guess I'm not the only one with weird dreams :/ haha", 9788, "None", 1],

Ok so here is my worst dream: So i was taking a shower (lol) and after i was done with the shower, i went to my room to change. I gasped when I saw that there was blood all over the house. There were also a ton of bloody knifes around the house. I couldn't find any of my family members in the house. There was nobody. I was alone. Then, I saw this man. I couldn't see his face though, his back was to me. He then faced me.. And his face was black.. just black... no face. I started to cry. The man walked up to me, and stabbed a knife in my chest. I then woke up, and i realized it was a dream. The dream was horrible. I actually cried in real life.", 9788, "il3yxlAjaa", 1],

	101847 : ["I say one of the major impediments to the success of independent inventors is a total lack of understanding of the difference between an idea and an invention An idea is just a problem statement. An invention is a solution to that problem. Ideas aren't patentable -- only inventions are. I do believe now that creative, ambitious people should be discouraged from \"inventing\" things, and instead taught to look for problems and opportunities -- things other people want, and will pay for right now. Inventors, too often, may be creating inventions for which there is no market. When someone mentions a potential problem or we imagine one, our minds race to solve it and we quickly have an invention. Patenting and trademarking are details one can consider when you know, for sure, that you have a saleable idea Hope this helps you Elizabeth-P xx", 9792, "None", 1],
	101848 : ["Hiya pump :) Well i must say you got some fabulous answers on here! People really do love you lol and we are all hoping you get a BFP as you sooooo deserve it! I must say it sounds like you have had like 3 100% signs that you are. 1. Late AF 2. Implantation bleeding (it's only a lil bit) 3. Spotting (the brown stuff Also you said you have had more CM. I so hope to God that you are hunny. I would advise leaving it only a few days more just to be certain. I presume you have had lots of BFNs like me and so i fully understand why you are so reluctant to test. I am 2 weeks late and not done a test lol. Then after the few days i would just not even do a test i would go straight to the docs and ask for some blood tests. They are more accurate than anything and then might also be able to diagnose why your AF is late. I really do hope this is your month hunny i will literally sit here on my sofa with all my fingers and toes crossed!

I am 57 years old and I have COPD  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  This is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. \"Progressive\" means the disease gets worse over time. It also can come with emphysema and chronic bronchitis.    COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus (a slimy substance), wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms.      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD.  Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.      Before I got sick when I could work, I was a server / trainer working at a large restaurant.                  two years before I got sick and I was put on continuous oxygen,  I worked circles around 20 year old college girls, I was always blessed with good health. But I SMOKED CIGARETTES!  Never thinking that this would ever happen to me!  But it did happen to me and I have a lung capacity of less than 40%.  I am always struggling to breathe. I am not use to sitting still and not doing things that I use to do, I still try my best to do them but I can't.   I have to be pushed in a wheelchair if I ever do feel like going anywhere,  I usually don't because I have aged so much and the medicine that I have to take to be able to breathe has had a negative affect on my skin and weight.    I won't go on and on about the reasons not to smoke anymore but please if you want to live a life that is full and happy and pain free then you have to make the right choices in life. and the best choice you will ever make is not to smoke.   Thanks for listening        God Bless you and your friend!  Pat", 9787, "j0ZSb1gGaa", 0],
	101851 : ["Within a few seconds of your first puff, irritating gases (formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and others) begin to work on sensitive membranes of your eyes, nose, and throat. They make your eyes water and your nose run. They irritate your throat. If you continue smoking, these irritating gases will eventually produce a smoker's cough. One of the reasons many smokers prefer menthol cigarettes is that menthol is an anesthetic that masks the smoker's perception of this irritation. Continued smoking produces abnormal thickening in the membranes lining your throat. This thickening is accompanied by cellular changes that have been linked to throat cancer. During the first 0-10 seconds you smoke toxic gases put you immune system on alert and leave a faint brown film over your pearly whites.At the same time, carbon monoxide (a toxic component also found in car exhaust) from the smoke is starting to build up in your blood, limiting your body's ability to transport oxygen to your vital organs.  After 5 minutes your body yearns for another highâ€”even if you're not aware of it. If you frequently give in to the craving, your brain will get hooked and you'll crash into withdrawal when you try to stop smoking.The cigarette smoke is gone, but your body will be mopping up toxic substances for the next six to eight hours. Forever: The cigarettes parting gift to you- gooey brown tar in your lungs.  Even just one smoke at all, especially one smoke a day, is very bad for anyone's health.", 9787, "L5Uoahwgaa", 1],

	101859 : ["Okay so I was in the hospital so all the meds probably inspired this one: In my dream my hospital room was haunted by this little girl. I woke up in the night because I heard someone singing, you are my sunshine. It was a creepy, little girls voice and very high. I freaked out and woke up my mom who was staying with me. I was like, \"Mom do  you here that?!!\" She said yeah but she was still partially asleep. My room had this chair in the corner and and then I saw the little girl  peeking out from behind it. I yelled, \"\"MOM, do you see that?!!\" The little girl laughed and mimicked, \"Do you see that? Do you see that?\" But the second time she said it her voice got all deep. And then her eyes turned all black,no color or whites at all, and she lunged at me. I woke up then, I always have cliffhanger dreams, sometimes that's a good thing and sometimes that's a bad thing. This was probably the scariest dream I ever had. I also had a scary one where I got kidnapped on my school's charity walk, but I woke up just as the guy was gonna get me.

	101880 : ["I rarely have scary dreams, and when I do, I don't really find them ...scary. I recall two, though, because I had them quite recently. The first one involved me sitting in a wheelchair for no apparant reason. My dad and my sister were walking along side me, and we were on our way to mum's house, down a hill. About halfway, a crazy fat man in a blue sweater comes running after me, trying to steal my wheelchair. It was freaky as hell. I know that faces in your dreams are always faces you have seen before one place or another. I just realised who that crazy man was. It's the optrician I went to last time. He has that look of \"constant surprise\" upon his face, but unlike Luna Lovegood, he doesn't look cute, he just looks like he trying to figure out the best way to stick a flagpole through your stomach. The other one was even more strange. Lots of random things happen in the beginning, but at the end, me, my sister and mum's boyfriend are at a restaurant. They have a pool, in which my sister falls into. We tell her to get out, but she refuses to move. She then points to a crocodile mouth sticking up above the water. We call for her to hurry out of the water, but she is too scared to do anything. Suddenly, several crocodiles are on her, biting her, pushing her under water. Jason, mum's boyfriend, jumps into the water, pulling all the crocodiles off of her, punching as many as he can. He gets my sister out of the water, and pushes her over the rope surrounding the pool. I'm about to grab her, but then she transforms into a scarf. I say, relieved: \"Oh, Emma, you always transform into a scarf when you're scared.\" I bring her back to our table, urging her to transform back to her usual self, but she can't do it: she's dead. I run out of the restaurant and find my parents by the entrance. I try to tell them what has happened, but they won't believe me. They convince me that they've been watching the security cameras and that no such thing ever happened. I run back in, and my sister is still a scarf. That's when I wake up. And I start crying. My sister laughed when I told her. It felt so real, and I still get teary just thinking about it.", 9788, "vo8rllmHaa", 1],
