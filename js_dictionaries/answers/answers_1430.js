	77155 : ["I can't believe I have not written a blog on this topic. OK here is the history. In the first century there were several OT Canons in use there was no universal Jewish Canon. The Ethiopian Jews had their Canon, the Sadducee's had theirs, the Pharisees had theirs and the Essenes and diaspora Jews had theirs. Among the Essenes, diaspora Jews and the first century Christians the Septuagint was the Canon of OT Scriptures. Jesus and the apostles quoted from the Septuagint. The Septuagint was and is the true OT Scriptures used by the first century Church and beyond. There was no controversy over this until the Reformation. During and after the Reformation the Protestants adopted the Canon of the OT that was approved at the Council of Pharisees in Jamnia in about 90 AD which was formed to stop the spread of Christianity among Jews. The Deuterocanonicals were not approved because they contained prophetic writing about Christ which the Pharisees wanted to suppress. The Reformers in order to separate themselves as far as possible from Christ's Church adopted a different Canon from the Canon always in use by Christ's Church. Among the Church there was never any confusion over the fact that the Septuagint was the Canon of the OT among Christianity. So, in conclusion, the Jewish Canon you speak of was decided after the formation of the Christian Church in response to the teaching of Christ's Church using the Septuagint. No books were added by Christians or taken away as the Septuagint was the Christian Canon from the beginning. It was the Jews that chose to remove the Deuterocanonicals in 90 AD. In Christ Fr.

Sometimes the blasphemy is overwhelming. I can not imagine someone who claims to be Christian.   The arrogance of such statements can only come from one source which is evil and deception in the world. Its pathetic how you  can take the Bible [ The canon of the Bible was actually confirmed and established **by the Catholic Church** long ago. It's actually a \"Catholic document\". ] THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH GAVE YOU, rip seven books out of it, and think they can turn that very Bible against Mother Church. It shows that there is very much hatred against the Church which was created by Christ and the disciples in favor of man-made beliefs and practices. It shows a lack of fear for God and His commandments that one would bear false witness against His Church. May we all pray for God's mercy for YOU so lost in hatred, so that they may find love and charity.   For those who spread lies about the Catholic Church: their ignorance is their lack of knowledge, their stupidity is their wisdom, and their truth is falsehood.
