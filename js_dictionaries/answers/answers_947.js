Maybe you look like some of Italians neighboring communities. Like india and Turkish I think is right there. And for hundreds of years the locals have mixed that you wouldnt get in the northern areas. They are less diverse and more picky. Because if you are different and a minority and not part of the pack. Youd be a outcast and weak. Then if you were to fit in and be strong with their help. Like people theyd favor would have most resources and stuff like that. Just like the modern day new york types are super diverse areas. So others would get treated baf and they would try to surpress ylu and likley to hate whites. And have a bunch of negative sterotypes and what not. Like most people have ablit each other. Are the Italians white? In my opinion? Sure... Its possible.. Jist unlikely.. Due to how diverse the areas are.. Different from northern though. Or maybe they started off as similar then changed with different cultures and stuff like that. I'm sure they would look pretty similar to otger europeans unless they look like neighboring unwhite charecteristics. Of course thats just my opinion though Idk someone else might think different. Not really a big deal to most people nowadays. Oh yeah.. And being so close to Africa.. And Spain.. Thats probably what he was talkijg about. Some modern day people from that area could probably either look white/European or maybe european/black or something hes trying to say.
