Well, let me put it like this:  I have two friends who, in various stages of their lives, have relied on me to keep going.  Perhaps not to keep living, but to keep going in their lives as we knew them.  I love them, and they love me, and the difficulties we have been through together bind us for life.  I feel like I should be able to tell them anything, without reservation, without judgement, with nothing more than sympathy and cakes. Yet I cannot tell them of the hardest parts of my life.  I cannot.  I know that if I try, I will fail.  And I know that if I weren't central to their hardest moment, I wouldn't know about it. I have never told anyone about the worst day of my life.  Not really.  And I don't mean to. I wish for the day I find someone I can spill all to, but I also know what that wish is: empty.  It will never happen.  Not because nobody will be able to listen, but because I will never be able to tell anyone.   I don't know if that's because I am a man, or because of what I have experienced, or both.  But I know the expectation of 'be a man' does not make things easier.  Particularly when one is desperate.

For a single man to be ACTIVELY seeking, dating women, it can almost be a full time job on TOP of the full time job he already has.  There is a considerable about of planning and actions which must be undertaken.  Then figure in the amount of rejection which is bound to happen.  A guy might have to approach 100 women to get 20 good responses.  Out of those 20, maybe 10 would actually agree to a date.  Of those, only a few might be compatible for a relationship.  Of course, these numbers are arbitrary, but very few men will be automatically successful or compatible with a large number of women.

Further, exactly ONE \"gun-control\" law has ever been upheld as consistent with the 2nd Amendment.

Go ahead and read that again if you missed the point. The Court said States etc CANNOT ban MILITARY-type guns.

I have NEVER heard  a liberal or a Democrat say he thought guns should just be banned.  I hear Republicans say this all the time.  In fact they have to say it even more often, because it's not true. After the Sandy Hook shootings, 90% of Americans and 70% of NRA members believed it was time to do away with the gun show loophole.  The Republicans, of course, had to defeat the measure because they didn't want Obama to get credit for making the country safer. So they killed the bill, saying that Obama only wanted to ban guns altogether, and this was the first step.  I think this really hurt the GOP. This is only one of MANY controversial issues of our time that the Republicans handed Obama on a silver platter.  All Obama has to do is line up with the more popular side, and you can bet your rent the Republicans will embrace the less-popular side, just because they don't want to be on the same side as the Democrats.  This is how it is with gun control, gay rights, legalization of marijuana, war with Iran, etc. etc.--you name it. You can expect Hillary to play the same game.  She's no dummy!

She could have just let the US Ambassador to the UN sign it- but she made a big deal out of doing so in person. So yes- given her way based on passed actions she will. To do so she would have to get the backing of the legislator and the support of the military. The actions of the military are unknown. The US military has asked recruits in the past if they would be willing to disarm the civilian population. I do not know the results of that question or if it is still asked. At present the legislative branch and to some degree the judicial branch of the US government has stood in the way of additional gun ownership restrictions. To attempt to disarm the private citizens of the US is lunacy, so the issue actually boils down to the question of Hilary's sanity. To date no mental competency test is required to hold public office. If it were several of our past presidents never could have run for office much less filled the post. Insanity is not at present a recognized reason to remove a president from office.

If men behaved like women, there would be totally chaos and constant tension between people. - men are vilified for being men.  Probably the worst of all. I think a major flaw with your comparison is that some of the things you complained for women are just examples of the \"bad\" that comes with the \"good\".
