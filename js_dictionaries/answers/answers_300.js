	15013 : ["After the shutdown was announced some of my friends simply gave up and haven't been online since.  The fact that things can simply be shut down for commercial reasons makes me also lose heart, not just for YA but for so many other things that might just disappear at any time.", 2541, "Y1NTL6p2aa", 1],

	15019 : ["PlaySchool / Preschool is very important for every child because these growing years are the times when they learn naturally, and playschool is the best place for them as they learn through involvement in the poem, drawing, games, indoor and outdoor activities. London Kids is one of the best preschool/playschool franchises, so if everyone is looking for the best preschool franchise then contact them.", 2524, "VI2rr7Yjaa", 0],
	15020 : ["Children of preschool age are very vulnerable and easily influenced. So this is a time in their lives when the adults who are leading them, should be very honest, fair and loving.  Not all preschools are like that !!!  It depends on what their motivation is. Maybe they just want lots of kids to make lots of money. Maybe they are sexual predators running a preschool.  That happens way more than you think it does.  You want to know if they focus on academics or not on academics.  I would suggest you sit in on any preschool you are considering, and get a real feel for it", 2524, "hfDohxp5aa", 0],

However, what spoiled this forum was the lack of respect. Those who cause and seek the chaos of drama. Y!A had quite a long run, considering it must be a headache dealing with those who can't behave on a daily basis. Private sector companies, such as this, can change their business direction as often as they see fit. I'll definitely miss all the good and reasonable people that I met here since joining in 2006.

	15037 : ["It's a catchall term like any other. Within \"guns rights\" there are a hundred different opinions about what a \"well regulated militia\" means. \"Immigration reform\" means different things to different people. Many umbrella terms are imprecise and fungible depending on whom you're talking to. So for some this might mean the extermination of all males at birth, for others it might just mean not getting penalized at work for having to stay home with a sick kid. ", 2540, "J3axFJ2Saa", 0],
	15038 : ["If you look from a female perspective you get a different view.  Whether right or wrong they see that because of previous injustices they are not TREATED equally so they feel that special rights are needed to rectify this damage.  I would prefer to stop ALL sexist differentials and start treating everyone as a person.  No matter what colour, race, religion, sex or age.  If this was truly done then all discrimination must gradually disappear.", 2540, "Y1NTL6p2aa", 1],

It also comes across as a bit demanding and high-maintenance, so they may decide they don't want to deal with that. ", 2507, "xif22nwoaa", -1],
	15051 : ["I wouldn't advise YOU to attempt to teach your child at all, as you're incapable of writing a simple question. If you mean how can someone teach their child to read, you'd start by reading to them, right from Day 1.  I don't know what you mean by 'book of education'. I read stories of all sorts to my daughter from when I got her home from hospital at four days old.  She eventually realised that I was getting the words from the pages and I pointed out some letters and told her what sounds they made.  She then started 'reading' from the books simply by remembering the stories.She could read full children's stories by the age of three and books like Roald Dahl by the age of five.", 2548, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 0],
	15052 : ["Reading together is helpful. Letting them pick from 2 or 3 books is one option. For example, Frank Murphy has written some interesting books, and if your children like one, then perhaps giving them their own copy would be special. \"Babe Ruth Saves Baseball;\" \"Ben Franklin and the Magic Squares;\" \"Brave Clara Barton;\"  \"George Washington and the General's Dog;\" and \"Take a Hike, Teddy Roosevelt!\" are the titles of five books he's written.  Children often like to read and reread favorite passages; it gives a sense of security.  Your presence is important; reading together should be a happy time, maybe a reward for helping with simpler chores. Some other titles of similar interest by other authors:  \"Discovery in the Cave,\" by Dubowski; \"To the Top!  Climging the World's Highest Mountain;\" \"Nobody Knows How to Make a Pizza;\" \"Flatland\" by Abbott; \"Thomas Jefferson's Feast;\" \"Lewis and Clark:  A Prairie Dog for the President;\" As for general education, William Bennett has these: \"The Children's Book of Heroes;\" \"The Children's Book of Faith;\" and \"The Children's Book of Home and Family:\" these books are collections of shorter pieces, so choices can be made; maybe reading the first paragraph, and voting to continue with it, etc. Children's ages are often significant, as they are developing quickly. Children also appreciate learning how the world works, so David Macaulay's \"Toilet:  How It Works,\" \"On a Beam of Light,\" \"Eat My Dust!  Henry Ford's First Race,\" and \"Going Up!:  Elisha Otis's Trip to the Top\" are worthwhile. \"Password to Larkspur Lane\" is a good Nancy Drew Mystery; \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" by Lewis; \"The Fabled Life of Aesop;\" \"Good Masters!  Sweet Ladies!  Tales from a Medieval Village;\" \"Winnie-the-Pooh,\" \"A Treasury of Old Testament Heroes;\" and \"The Tom Swift Omnibus #1\" (has the better, earlier novels) are good books.", 2548, "380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa", 2],
