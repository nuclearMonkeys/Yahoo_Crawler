OSU has depth at running back as well, with the top player in florida a few years ago, and two of the top runningbacks in ohio over the last 2 years. USC's Oline impressed me last night. To the idiots above that says OSU never beats quality teams, they are 4-2 in BCS bowls, never playing a Hawaii or other scrub team, and as recent as 2006 beat the number 2 team in the country not once, but twice. Do some research. Yes they have a chance, even with Wells sitting on the pine. OSU was playing 3/4 speed on saturday, so it's hard to say just how good they are. USC looked great against an overmatched Virginia team.", 8855, "ABoo1doVaa", 2],

Regardless of how talented a team you have, you still need to play a real game together simply for timing factor.  ", 8855, "AA10939368", 0],

You'll go blind!\", but  I think, as Voice of Reality pointed out,  it was frowned upon no matter who did it. If there is a stigma  on women masturbating I can assure you that it's not one imposed by men.  Most heterosexual men are quite pleased by the thought and sight of a woman masturbating and  would not want to stifle this behavior.

I'm sure if those who hate Catholics would take a closer look at it's teachings, their minds would change. Many people can't get past the fact that Catholics pray to the saints. Even though every Catholic I know insists they don't pray TO the saints, most people can't understand the difference. I want to convert so badly, my husband is Catholic, and I've decided the Catholic church is the best place for us. I can't, however, because my grandmother and my church, along with the rest of my family, are very anti-Catholic. I'm afraid of what they would say and do if I converted.", 8865, "AA10798094", 2],
	76909 : ["First let me start by saying that I am Catholic, although I am not very religious. This question comes up every now and again.  I feel that Catholic bashers mainly fall into two groups: 1) People who do not know what they are talking about.  Many do not realize that Catholics are Christian, the oldest and largest denomination by the way.  We also do not worship the Pope. 2) People who purposely twist Catholic beliefs and then put down those twisted beliefs.  This is very common, many ethnic and political groups do the same thing to others. The Catholic church has softened its stance in recent years regarding those of different faiths, which includes Protestants and Orthodox Christians.  The medieval church excommunicated (and worse) Protestants as heretics.  My father-in-law grew up in Ireland during the depression.  The Church forbid Catholics from taking charity from Protestant groups such as the Salvation Army.", 8865, "b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa", 1],

	76917 : ["We have everything you need listed below and you will not have to spend a dime to do this. Really read the firs one listed as others will tell you to get Norton Ghost. If you feel like paying for that, well that is your option, but you need not have to.. For real starters this is what you will need; 1) Drive Image XML: (Disk Image Creation - Hard Drive Backup Software)  Can't afford $70.00 for Norton Ghost? Don't know what Norton Ghost is? Hmmm. Well drive images can restore your hard drive exactly the way they were when you created the image. Meaning drive images are the only sure way to restore your computer to the way it was.

The program allows you to backup logical drives and partitions to image files, browse these images, view and extract files. restore these images to the same or a different drive. copy directly from drive to drive and a lot more! If you know what drive images are and you want to create 100% perfect backups then you need to buy Norton Ghost or download this free program. What would you rather spend: $70.00 or $0.00?

But you should use them to take inventories of what's in your computer in case you need to tell a technician; you need to know what kind of graphics card you have and when the last time you updated your drivers was; what kind of hard drives you have installed, what kind of network card, what kind of processor, etc. All this information might seem like 'overload' but it's not. Print it out and tuck it away. And run these programs every month or two to make sure you've got the latest information about you computer.

	76921 : ["I'll admit I masturbate - I do often. I'm in a wonderful relationship, but I have a higher libido than he does, so sometimes i \"lend myself a hand.\" I think it all comes from women not being expected to enjoy their sexuality. Traditionally men had to get it from us, it was the carrot we could dangle to get them to do the things that were important. And the idea that we actually want them to catch the carrot goes against traditional thinking.  I tend to keep it to myself because either I will get attention I don't want. i was more open about it in college, and I received MANY sexual advances from men I didn't want. Like just because I like sex, they assumed i would like it from anyone at anytime. I also got asked often to engage in threesomes or lesbian entanglements because clearly if i liked my own vagina I would like others as well.  That was mainly the reason other women I shared it with reacted poorly too. The assumed I was sexually promiscuous, and would let guys do whatever they want to me. I kind of don't understand how me taking care of my sexual desires in a safe way like masturbation leads people to think I will partake in loads of unprotected and unsafe sex...it seems like there's a misstep in logic there.

	76925 : ["It really depends of the guy. Personally that is a hell no for me, especially because there is a lot involved in sex and I actually think that the couple should really know each other before marry, that includes sexually. Sex is not just you lay down and do it... there is a lot involved! How comfortable both people actually feel with each other, their likes and dislikes in their sexual life....  You may end up marrying a person and discover that sexually you two are so different and although you love each other, you do not enjoy having sex with each other.... and that would be terrible! It understandable to want to wait till both are deeper in the relationship, but from my point of view it is a huge mistake to wait till get married. The only guys that WANT a virgin to marry with are either \"religiously\" thought like that or totally afraid and lack of self confidence thinking you may compare him to other guy's performance. Personal opinion, no black and white but shades of grey. I dont think there is a right or wrong but everything depends of how is your life and what you want of it.", 8862, "Xyfr4xzpaa", 2],

I do not understand this either, why they criticize your faith. I am sorry for it.

Sin is everywhere. The one I think is silly is praying to one of the saints to find a lost object, everytime I hide something from myself, I just pray to God and he helps me find it, I don't need a saint, stigmata is another one, it seems demonic, and the appearing of virgin mary, I am sorry to say this, but demons can appear in any shape and any form, and that why people believe Mary is showing up and that haunted houses exist.", 8865, "None", -1],
