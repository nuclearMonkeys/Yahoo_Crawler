You want to make sure that you're pumping your arms, which helps you accelerate and enables you to have longer strides. Also, probably the most important part about the 100m and any sprint, which everyone here failed to mention, is that you should be running on the top/toe part of your feet. Your heels and lower foot should not touch the ground, as it slows you down and its not suitable for sprinting. In addition, getting sprint spikes like the Nike Rival Zoom S IV or Adidas Meteor are great spikes for $50 that will help you run faster.
