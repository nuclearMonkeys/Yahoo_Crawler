	132538 : ["We suffer from Stockholm's syndrome that is why we like Islam. The following are our rights in islam that we love so dearly: 1.WOMEN ARE DEFICIT IN INTELLIGENCE.   Sahih Bukhari, Volume 3 Book 48 Number 826:  Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: The Prophet said, \"Isn't the witness of a woman equal to half of that of a man?\" The women said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"This is because of the deficiency of a woman's mind.\" 2. HELL IS FOR WOMEN  Sahih Bukhari Vol 4 hadith number 464 Narrated 'Imran bin Husain: The Prophet said, \"I looked at Paradise and found poor people forming the majority of its inhabitants; and I looked at Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.\"  3. WOMEN ARE EVIL OMEN Sahih Bukhari, Book 52: Volume 4, Number 110: Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:I heard the Prophet saying. \"Evil omen is in three things: The horse, the woman and the house.\"  4. A husband has sex with his wife, as a plow goes into a dirt field. The Quran in Sura (Chapter) 2:223 says: Your women are your fields, so go into your fields whichever way you like .  \"If a man invites his wife to sleep with him and she refuses to come to him, then the angels send their curses on her till morning.\" 5.HUSBANDS DEGREE ABOVE THEIR WIVES. The Quran in Sura 2:228 says: . . . Wives have the same rights as the husbands have on them in accordance with the generally known principles. Of course, men are a degree above them in status .  6. MALE GETS DOUBLE SHARE OF INHERITANCE. A male gets a double share of the inheritance over that of a female. The Quran in Sura 4:11 says: The share of the male shall be twice that of a female . 7.A WOMAN'S TESTIMONY COUNTS HALF OF A MAN'S TESTIMONY. The Quran in Sura 2:282 says: And let two men from among you bear witness to all such documents [contracts of loans without interest]. But if two men be not available, there should be one man and two women to bear witness so that if one of the women forgets (anything), the other may remind her. 8.A wife may remarry her ex-husband if and only if she marries another man, they have sex, and then this second man divorces her. The Quran in Sura 2:230 says: And if the husband divorces his wife (for the third time), she shall not remain his lawful wife after this (absolute) divorce, unless she marries another husband and the second husband divorces her. (In that case) there is no harm if they [the first couple] remarry .  9.Slave-girls are sexual property for their male owners. The Quran in Sura 4:24 says: And forbidden to you are wedded wives of other people except those who have fallen in your hands (as prisoners of war) . . 10.A Muslim polygamist may simply get rid of one of his undesirable wives. The Quran in Sura 4:129 says: It is not within your power to be perfectly equitable in your treatment with all your wives, even if you wish to be so; therefore, (in order to satisfy the dictates of Divine Law) do not lean towards one wife so as to leave the other in a state of suspense. 11. HUSBANDS CAN HIT THEIR WIVES. Husbands may hit their wives even if the husbands merely fear highhandedness in their wives (quite apart from whether they actually are highhandedâ€”as if domestic violence in any form is acceptable). The Quran in Sura 4:34 says: 4:34 . . . If you fear highhandedness from your wives, remind them [of the teaching of God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them. If they obey you, you have no right to act against them. God is most high and great.  12.Mature men are allowed to marry prepubescent girls. The Quran in Sura 65:1, 4 says: 65:1 O Prophet, when you (and the believers) divorce women, divorce them for their prescribed waiting-period and count the waiting-period accurately . . . 4 And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months, and the same applies to those who have not menstruated as yet. As for pregnant women, their period ends when they have delivered their burden. >>The one who says that \" she (I) didn't even put the references of the prophet sayings\" is lying or that person is as blind as a bat or chooses to be.", 11132, "8LmFeXfcaa", 3],

They were the truth word of God until they had been changed and corrupted over time by men that lost the true message from God.

Some women are helped tremendously by taking an anti-depressant during the week before their period as it helps decrease the mood swings considerably. The only other suggestion I have is that when she starts behaving this way, calmly stand up, tell her that you are going to leave rather than be treated in this manner and calmly walk out the door and  stay with a friend, family member or get a hotel if you have to until the next day.   If she is not even attempting to control her behavior then this may help her see that it is unacceptable to you and that you will remove yourself from the situation when it occurs.
