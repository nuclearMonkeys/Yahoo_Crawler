	36179 : ["Yes and no... Knockouts in boxing ain't everything. Against chisora, vitali I thought he fought a clever fight and didn't really take any risks. End of the day a win is a win The one thing that hurts both fighters is for me the level of competition of the heavyweights was arguably the worst in history. Vitali beat everyone aside from Lewis and Byrd but the top level weren't great. I also think people overlook his 2 losses, I know there's excuses for both but anyone who mocks AJ for his loss to Ruiz, the same applies to Vitali for Byrd. I wouldn't put him in the top 20 of all time due to the level of competition. Wladimir is similar for me but he was worse than his brother. Again it comes down to his losses. Corrie Sanders was a nobody when he fought wlad. Rahman knocked him out in 7 rounds a few fights prior to fighting wlad. Corrie Sanders made wlad look amateur. That wasn't even close or a lucky punch. It's was destruction. That for me is worse than Aj- Ruiz, Lewis - McCall/Rahman. Then lamon Brewster knocked him out cleanly. Wlad did get better over time but again the competition argument applies. Post that Lewis/bowe/holyfield/Tyson era the competition at heavy was horrendous. When he came up against 2 good fighters, fury cleanly outboxed him and AJ knocked him out. For both, I think put them at their peak even 10 years earlier, they don't get near the top 4 in the world. That doesn't diminish what they achieved as you can only beat who is Infront of you. Ill give credit to both, I don't think they ducked anyone, but they didn't have the opposition to really test them, and on the rare occasion they did, both got beat", 5429, "TdmTjKt8aa", 1],
