The distances involved between stars are HUGE, yes...no question.  But it cuts both ways too--everything we see in the night sky is an image from the past, because the _light itself_ took that long to get here.  Everything we see in our solar system is anywhere from a few minutes to a few years old.  Everything we see beyond--in orbit around other stars--is decades to centuries old at minimum.  We see a lot these days, yes, but none of it is in real time. And we do know that there are exoplanets out there that are way older than our own Earth is, meaning any life present there had a massive head start. Between those two things, it's clear to me that there are at least a few intelligent exo-species out there who are ahead of us in terms of technology and culture, and who might have it in them to pay us a visit.  They might know what it takes in terms of the physics to overcome the huge distances out in space. The only question is: Why would they come here?  It really looks like Earth is at the _small end_ of how small a planet can be and still support life.  They might look at our solar system and think we have the \"right planets\", but that they're all in the wrong places, that Jupiter, Saturn and the like are far too cold to support life. And that's the simple version of it.  Truth is we are more likely to have \"people\" of an exo-species stranded here than visiting voluntarily--maybe they were looking at something else, got smacked by an asteroid or a solar flare and wound up here involuntarily, by accident. If that was the case in the past, it might be far enough back that it would show up in our DNA now, much like it does for the Neanderthals (word has it that for some folks anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of their genes might well be Neanderthal).

No trade at all internationally with the intent of getting rid of all nuclear weapons.

Now for poor old Ahmedinejad's speech in the UN. You have to feel a bit sorry for the guy. Seems everytime the Ayatollah lets him share his bacon at breakfast the poor guy goes off on one. This is a bit disconcerting for the muslims as it allows the world to see what the Islamic religion is really like and all about. Seeing as these people are the muslim worlds leaders and so very devout then it sort of lets you know what their true aim is with conquering the whole world and forcing it into the muslim faith. Afterall it is ok for them to kill or lie to us infidels. Says so in their Qu'ran.  Oh! Before I forget. Don't you Newcastle(UK) police try to arrest me for being racist for what I've written. I don't like most of the Christian, Jewish, Hindu, etc other religions either. More like you could arrest all of them for incitement to kill and murder.

I went to have an abortion because my boyfriend, 29, said he wasn't ready either, even though we live together.  We were at the hospital setting up the abortion, and two days later we canceled.  I thought it would take him months before he would accept it, but it took his maybe 2 days before he started feeling happy finally.  Now I'm 24 weeks and he is so excited and ready.  If you are afraid of the emotional baggage of losing the baby, don't do it.  I was the same way and I'm so happy I didn't get an abortion.  I too have self esteem issues with my appearance.

I definitely hate gaining weight, but I just keep telling myself that when the baby comes out  I am going to work out just like I used to.

	129295 : ["I've noticed a trend here, anyone against abortion is getting a thumbs down. If you've already made up your mind, then do whatever you decide.  Personally, I feel it's morally wrong to force a decision on someone, a decision that could haunt them all the days of their life, while your boyfriend and you may not be together nearly that long. When you have sex, in a committed relationship, you should always know there's a chance that the woman could get pregnant. Your boyfriend needs to own up that it's partly his fault and support you.  This may be the hardest decision of your life. Your baby has started to develop, it's a living organism now. I hate to give this example, but getting an abortion is no different then taking a brick and ending a newborn kittens life.  If this wasn't meant to be, then it wouldn't have happened. Maybe you were meant to get pregnant. Why don't you take an hour and go to the baby section of a store. Check out the cute clothes, the mothers with their babies, the toys.  You're right pregnancy is never easy. Motherhood isn't easy. Single motherhood isn't easy, but I've heard that it's the most rewarding time in a woman's life. You are about to have a baby who's going to be looking up at you with beautiful eyes. One who is already depending on you to support its life. I wonder how many women could kill a baby after they have held it in their arms. Could you? Your boyfriend may be history, but you have friends, family, people who you can rely on. Even us. :) Really do you want to stay with a man who has demanded you kill the child you share together? I say screw him.  I've read the stories of women who have aborted their pregnancies. They discuss thinking, even 18 years later about how their baby would be going to college right now, etc. It will haunt you for the rest of your life. Is that something you can handle?

While you're looking, you can also cite ONE credible (ie not Fox 'news') source that proves Iran is developing nukes. Bearing mind that the USA's own Defense Intelligence Estimate, the IAEA, and the UN all report otherwise. Allow me to explain; uranium must be enriched to around 95% to be any use in a nuke. Uranium that hot gives off so much radiation that the IAEA would find it in no time; you do know that the IAEA inspectors are still in Iran and doing their job, right? Uranium used for nuclear power, on the other hand, needs only to be enriched by about 5% to be suitable for use in a reactor.  Lupines; if you wish to be taken seriously, you need credible sources. I prefer the military and intelligence reports to Congress in April 2010 by Lieutenant General Ronald L. Burgess, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency, Statement before the Committee on Armed Services, US Senate, 14 April 2010; Unclassified Report on Military Power of Iran, April 2010; John J.

Iranian military doctrine is strictly \"defensive; designed to slow an invasion and force a diplomatic solution to hostilities.\" Iran has only \"a limited capability to project force beyond its borders.\" With regard to the nuclear option, \"Iran's nuclear program and its willingness to keep open the possibility of developing nuclear weapons is a central part of its deterrent strategy.\"  Just because Fox news reports something as true, doesn't mean it is true.", 11022, "0vKbUk3haa", 2],
