A woman who normally dresses casually for comfort and convenience will find a special outfit, wear heels instead of sneakers etc. Wearing make-up on those occasions is all part of \"dressing up\". A lot of women avoid wearing make-up regularly to let their skin breath. For others it's an economy. Others just see no point in going to all that trouble. A lot depends on who you are dressing for, yourself, your partner, potential new partners, or for the general public. People have different needs both individually and culturally in regards to the image they present.  My personal angle here is that it's pointless and impractical for me to wear make-up on a daily basis as only my animals would benefit from it. I'm a farmer.

Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me. Matthew 11:28–30  28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.  The answer is still the same, to trust in the Lord your God and not your fellow man, because God is the one who will never waver and will never fail you.  Man's testimony of Him will waver, and it's important to have your own personal testimony of God.

Kids do better in private schools because parents are on their butts every second since they are paying through the nose.  If the government starts picking up the tab for every kid in public school to go to private schools, then the graduation rates for private schools will plummet because the parents are not paying for it.

And for that--I got no answer.  I guess it's just up to the women in question, but as far as I know, it's mostly a matter of sometimes you care how you look, and sometimes you honestly don't.
