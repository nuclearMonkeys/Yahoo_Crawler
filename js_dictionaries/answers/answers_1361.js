	73654 : ["I believe that Sugar Ray Robinson is one of the greatest fighters of all time with more natural skills than anybody in the long great history of the sport and that Stanley Ketchel is perhaps the strongest and one of the most durable and vicious fighters in the history of the sport which makes this a very intriguing match.  As you well know Robinson had problems with fighters who fought with the same style as Ketchel such as Gene Fullmer who beat Robinson twice, Carmen Basillio who beat him once and lost a split decision in the other fight and Jake LaMotta who gave him his first career loss though Robinson beat him the other fights.  Stanley Ketchel for many years was considered the greatest middleweight Champ of all time before Robinson came along and while his method of fighting was crude, it was very effective and if he hit an opponent with his famous shift punch, it was usually lights out.  I could see a prime Ketchel fighting a 1955-57 version of Robinson and winning at least a fight out of series of fights as I consider Ketchel greater than either LaMotta, Fullmer or Basillio and even though I think the skill level of Sugar Ray Robinson would probably be enough to overcome the toughness of Ketchel, it would be a fight because Ketchel would certainly turn it in to one.  In one fight of 15 rounds I have to give it to Robinson but it wouldn't be easy.", 8738, "AA12325046", 2],
	73655 : ["I think the only things that Ketchel had over Robinson was his freakish strength and endurance and his experience fighting against bigger and heavier opponents. But Robinson would have everything else going for him in terms of skills, talent and the will and determination to win. Robinson have also seen the type of Ketchel in Jake LaMotta and Gene Fullmer and he handled those two great rivals well. I think Sugar will also handle Ketchel well after a wild and wooly start, winning by a hard fought 15 round UD at the end.", 8738, "IPKPRL7qaa", 1],

As you may know, war is a great business for those financing it.  The CIA and the government were involved. Both were needed to carry out the thing and also to cover it up so well for so many years. Bush Sr., I think, was not involved. He was in the oil business at the time and not yet powerful enough to be considered. P.S.

You are at a crossroad, and some thing alternative you are making goes to influence you for the relaxation of your lifestyles. I am talking in view that I've had an abortion. I am plenty more youthful than you even though. But I knew it used to be what I desired to do. I do recognize you will have to under no circumstances do something until YOU desire to do it, and will have to under no circumstances simply move with what different persons desire. There are plenty of unmarried mothers in the market who make it occur. If you desire to hold the little one this badly, all I need to say is you'll uncover some way. Plenty of unmarried mothers in the market uncover some way by some means. You will as a rule need to soak up a moment activity or difference your lifestyles come what may evidently, considering that your sales now is not well. Idk. Like I mentioned, no longer a lot to mention. I'm sorry you've got ended up on this hindrance. Things simply occur frequently even though, ya recognize?

That's simply gunna make it extra traumatic on you in the long run. Just permit him move and do what he wishes. You are a powerful lady. You are a powerful man or woman.

	73672 : ["Because routers differ as to details, I can't be specific about how to accomplish these steps, but they're almost all done from within the router's administration web pages. Note: It's best to do them from a computer cabled (even just temporarily) to the router rather than wirelessly, especially since wireless administration will be deactivated by step #1. 1.Deactivate wireless access to your router's administration web pages so only a computer connected via an Ethernet cable can reach them.  This won't affect wireless use of the Internet, just wireless administration. Even if you don't want to leave a computer connected via a cable, leave the cable there for when you need it.  Here are some horror stories of people who didn't: 2.Turn off the SSID (network name) broadcast from the router.  There's no need to advertise your network's presence.  You're not running a hotspot; everyone who should be on your network should know its name. 3.Change your SSID from its current value -- radically.  Just hiding it with the previous step won't prevent people who already know its name from using it, and just adding a 1 to the end doesn't make it very difficult to guess. 4.Set up encryption with an encryption key.  The longer, the better. WPA (if your network and all your computers can support 802.11G) is better than WEP.  WEP is better than nothing. 5.Limit access to only the computers you want on the network via MAC filtering. (MAC refers to unique NIC (Network Interface Card) addresses, not Macintosh computers, and not IP addresses.)  This isn't a defense against hardcore freeloaders -- it's possible to fake MAC addresses -- but it keeps out casual interlopers. 6.Change the range of and/or limit the number of automatically assigned IP addresses (DHCP) to reduce the chance of extra users.  Again, hackers know what ranges routers come from the factory with.  Changing them makes it a little harder to hop on board. Generally, to access your router's administration pages, hook up a computer directly to the router and enter the router's local IP address into a browser's address window.   Here's how to find your router's IP address: 1.Click on the Start button. 2.Click Run... 3.In the text box, type in    cmd and press Enter 4.A black \"DOS box\" window will pop up.  Type into it    ipconfig  /all and press Enter. 5.A bunch of seeming gibberish will fill the screen.  On the line next to \"Default Gateway\" your router's IP address should appear.  That should go far toward hardening your wireless network.", 8729, "FBQZ06vraa", 0],
	73673 : ["what some people have already said... use multiple complex characters in your WPA password... you can also try disabling your SSID broadcast on your wireless... and changing your IP address for your router to something different... enable MAC filtering also to prevent any unauthorized computers logging onto your wifi router... however this will produce alot of administrative overhead... whenever you have a friend over who wants to use the wifi etc... youll have to access the router, figure out their MAC address... type the MAC address into the table etc... what you can do to check if someone else is using your router is check the logs of your router... if someone else has logged onto your wifi you can see if DHCP has issued them an IP address... and see what their computer name is...

Bush wasn't in the CIA during that time.  He was named president of the Zapata Offshore Company, a subsidiary which specialized in offshore drilling, in 1954. The subsidiary became independent in 1958, so Bush moved the company from Midland, Texas to Houston. He continued serving as president of the company until 1964. A simple search would have saved an embarrassment. If any other \"special\" knowledge comes up, verify it first, and take it up with your Congressperson or your local District Attorney.  Frankly, I'm tried of reading this type of ignorant hate speech against Republicans or any other demonized people.  This was a very bad time for me since I worked out of a Congressional office in Michigan at the time as a volunteer and watched JFK do some great things for our nation at a very turbulent time.
