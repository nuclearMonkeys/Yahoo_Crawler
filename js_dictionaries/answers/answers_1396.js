	75414 : ["I would have to disagree.  For all his \"short-comings\", Phillip Rivers has done a lot of things for his team that most QB's in the league haven't or simply can't do. The QB position is the most pivotal position in football, and while many prototypical QB's enter the league every year, not all reach their potential due to their inability to adjust to the NFL.  Rivers, however, has since turned the corner and has become one of the elite QB's in the league. His draft counterparts, Ben Roethlisberger and Eli Manning, have three Superbowl rings amongst them, but neither has reached the level that Rivers has.  As for the '08 season record, it can be attributed to injuries and lack of depth on defense. That and a blown call against the Chargers during the Broncos game. If not for that call, the Chargers would have had a 9-7 record. But regardless, San Diego has made the playoffs in the three years that he's started, compiling a 33-15 record since 2006. The only other QB to take his team to the postseason from 2006-08 is Peyton Manning. That speaks volumes. The best part is he's done this with a receiving corps so ambiguous that most people couldn't name ONE quality wide receiver. Antonio Gates would be the most well-known receiving target, but he's a tight end. Before Vincent Jackson's emergence, Rivers was simply making spectacular throws all over and spreading the ball to whoever was open, racking up a 78-36 TD-to-INT ratio. That means he was threading the needle and is a great decision maker in the pocket. What makes it even more impressive is the fact that as far as arm strength goes, he's got an average arm on him. But, like his predecessor, Drew Brees, he can get the ball where it needs to be and I think that all these options weighed into his massive contract. Had he hit the open market, he would've demanded a contract even bigger than Hanesworth. But ultimately, the contract doesn't guarantee anything. It's the San Diego Chargers front office making a long term investment. Like all investments, they have to diversify their portfolio. This means that fortifying the offensive line and providing quality positional players alongside him will only strengthen their chances of winning it all....", 8805, "596EdbRZaa", 0],
	75415 : ["i agree with you. philip rivers doesnt deserve all that cash, but the chargers are trying to hold people down to get a super bowl ring in a year or two... philip is worth most of the money, but philip wont get the job done in SD, which is sorta his fault because he is not the greatest leader he mouths off a lot, but does kinda back it up so i take that back, but he wont lead the team past the championship cuz LT is no good, sproles cant take all the carries, gates is good but he is a TE... his WR corps needs a good addition to be a better threat. and the defense needs to hold their own too, last season they were bad in the secondary and merriman not in  the lineup every game made the chargers lose 30 sacks!", 8805, "None", -1],
	75416 : ["I don't think it was that bad of an idea. I think he is an under rated qb. A good qb awesome tight end amazing rb decent receiving core and a pretty good defence they could make it to the super bowl. I don't think they will this year. But they should win the afc west for the next couple years. I don't see anyone competing with the chargers in that division.", 8805, "1g83F5Hbaa", 1],

	75418 : ["By your own argument, If I find homosexuality an immoral lifestyle choice, how can the government force me to accept gay marriage, against 200 years of culture and tradition in this country?", 8807, "None", 2],
	75419 : ["Well, you see, here's the thing; I don't care what homosexuals do in private, but they have no business forcing their way of life onto a public unwilling to give it sanction. You do realize that there are those in the homosexual community whose stated goal is not equality but destruction of traditional family, do you not?  If you don't believe me, you can find adequate evidence in many homosexual publications like OUT magazine. Letting the government allow the most freedom possible is chaos, and there is a very violent sect of an old religion (OK I'll say it: Islam) that LOVES taking advantage of those situations and filling the vacuum chaos creates. Edit: Yawn.  THAT argument, again. Black people didn't: black AND white people TOGETHER did.  There's also the FACT that interracial marriage did not attempt to redefine the qualifications on gender, but rather it was to further support RACIAL equality laws ALREADY in place. Here's a nice little comparison:  supporters of inter-racial marriage in the 60's challenged those opposed to show in the Bible where God opposed miscegeny.  Those opposed couldn't do it, because it's not there.  Now, those in support of sodomites attempt to prevent those opposed from using the Bible in defense of their stance.  Tell me, since the 60's supporters could use the Bible in their arguments then, why can't opponents of sodomy use it now?   What part of the First Amendment changed in 40 years?   Why do you insist on suppressing my First Amendment rights? Remember two other things: 1) Slavery WAS argued about in the drafting of the Constitution, and many Founding Fathers opposed the institution, but compromised THEIR morals for the sake of political expediency, and many of them saw their error before President Washington left office. 2)  The Founding Fathers did NOT write the 14th Amendment, but DID write the First Amendment, and there was a reason it WAS written First above all others. Think about it. Edit2: You mean, you think that laws that prohibit sodomite marriage violate the First Amendment?  Sorry not true. Judaism, Islam, Christianity, and other religions ALL view homosexual acts as an abomination (Hinduism is silent, Buddhism forbids sexual misconduct but does not clarify what it means); no one religion is favored over the other in laws that prohibit such marriages.  Ergo, Congress is NOT establishing a religion. If that is not what you meant, I need you to better clarify your question before I can answer.", 8807, "AA11210239", -2],

	75438 : ["Very few people understand that. Real morality is not imposing your belief system on anyone else. Most liberals say that people should give money to people who don't have much. The problem is that they force people to do it through the legislation of taxes, which completely ignores their right to do what they want with their money. Republicans try to play the moral high-ground on issues like abortion or the legalization of marijuana. Actually, the stances that both parties take are either based on sensitivity (morals) or objectivity (science). It seems like when one chooses either, the other chooses the opposite.
