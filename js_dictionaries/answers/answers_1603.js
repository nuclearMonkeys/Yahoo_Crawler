	85815 : ["It makes sense, though \"spring spheres\" sounds a little silly. It's can't be an \"Easter\" event if it's officially sanctioned by a government entity such as a school.

Although they did not purchase the eggs, they provided and funded the classroom in which it took place. Kind of like renting a building for it to take place. I know it seems kind of harsh, but separation of church and state is in the Constitution, and we have to started following it.", 9204, "jPvKOGLxaa", 1],

Even though the sacrifices & stakes were high, the cost of freedom in Iraq now proves worth it. By the way, I don't hate Obama either but I'm highly concerned about his inexperience & his errors & judgments to come, as well as those he's already making.  We can only 'hope' the eventual outcome of his 'change' will be worth the high stakes, sacrifices & cost of it all.", 9208, "3a01c0ab887b9ad9d7b78f85618d8bf5aa", 0],
	85846 : ["Um.. Iraq was a democratic republic originally and had regular elections with real candidates and everything.  It was the United States who used the CIA to topple the government and install the Sunni Regime. Even under the Sunni Regime Iraq had regular elections  where most of the people voted  and there was no major violence.. I will grant that Saddam Hussain generally was unopposed but most of the local elections had multiple candidates and everything.. Women candidates and women allowed to vote.. That would have come in time with no invasion... Iraq has only been a country for a little over 50 years. It took the United states 129 years before women had the right to vote or run for office and it did not take a regime change for that to happen. I am not sure how this is such a big accomplishment. Another thing that probably should be considered is this is under the watchful eye of an occupying army. Success and level of success cannot be determined until the armys go home and Iraq stands on it's own two feet - or not.", 9208, "5zBEU99kaa", 0],

	85858 : ["The reason Nixon removed us from the International gold standard was the Vietnam war.  It will take a little effort to explain. When our money was backed by gold and silver, it had \"real\" value.  After Nixon took us off the international gold standard in 1971, that meant that, from that day forward, our currency was no longer convertible to gold.  One dollar has a real value of...another dollar.  Our government could just print whatever amount of money that it wanted.    The reason why he did it was that we were fighting the Vietnam war and it was costly enough that our government was building debt at an unsustainable rate.    At the time that Nixon removed us from the gold standard, our gold reserves had dwindled to the point that we only had enough gold left to cover a 22% of our debt.   We had borrowed quite a lot from France and other countries to continue the war, and they were demanding their money in gold, not paper.  We just simply didn't have enough gold in our vaults to pay them. When other nations realized that our own country's currency didn't lose all of its value just because it was no longer backed by anything tangible whatsoever, they all soon followed suit.  Why give us real gold for our paper? Fiat money is about like an IOU for monopoly money.  As long as we can use it to buy oil, we're fine.  If they ever realize that our country has nothing to back its money with, and that we have no intention of letting them trade that paper for real American assets, we may have problems.  We had better become energy independent before the third world, especially Opec and Venezuela figure it out. The policy had been used before, with different but equally effective results:  When Adolf Hitler rose to power, Germany was reeling under crushing war debts from WW I.  He untied the German money supply from gold and printed money like it was going out of style.  It resulted in 10,000% inflation for a few months, and families and businesses lost their life's savings, but Germany paid off all of its debts in newly printed money and started over with new currency with real value.  It was able to wage another world war in just a few years.", 9211, "4u5wSbgyaa", 2],
