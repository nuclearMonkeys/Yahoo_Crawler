Several times he has mispronounced someones name or called them by the wrong name. Can you believe he actually once called Margaret Sanger Margaret Singer? He was correct about her being a big proponent of eugenics and abortion and being  the founder of planned parenthood. But how can you believe a guy who would tell such whoppers about her name? One time I heard him speak about Obama's children and the next day he apologized and said it was wrong to bring a politicians children into the discussion. He pointed out that he had criticized others for talking about Sarah Palins children and if it was wrong for others to act this way it was even worse for him to do so and it was hypocritical. Can you believe the gall of that guy? Apologizing when he is wrong. Taking responsibility for his actions. Vowing to work hard to see that it never happened again. The one thing that bothers me is that although I watch him almost every night I have never seen him be factually wrong about something important. He gets peoples names wrong, can't remember exact dates sometimes, I have seen him give a quote and attribute it to the wrong person stop and correct himself and has even failed to accord some people their correct titles. Sometimes he should say Doctor or Reverend and says Mister or Miss instead. I hear a lot of people like you talk about what a liar he is but they never seem able to show a specific thing he has said that is incorrect unless it was trivial. I can't remember any lies he has told that were important so could you please help me out and show me some? I know he is a big fat liar but I am unable to prove it. Maybe you can. By the way, when someone says something that is untrue and later finds out the truth, then says \"Sorry, I got that wrong. Here is what I found out. I was wrong before and this will correct the record.\" This is not lying it is making a mistake. Don't show me his mistakes and claim they are lies.", 8432, "1R2jK5G4aa", 0],

What you fail to realize is that he did not stop renditions and you probably don't even know what that means, so let me tell you it means that they will send the prisoners to other country's to be interrogated/ tortured so that when it looks as if your Obama is helping them he is only letting someone else torture them and do far worse things then water-boarding.

We cannot dig ourselves out of the quagmire we're in in the United States until people like you begin to grow a little maturity and act like adults, and quit believing everything you suck in from the liberal media.", 8429, "GGJ8T6uYaa", 6],
	67681 : ["The issue goes back to the original intent of the amendment, which was to assure citizenship and rights to emancipated slaves and their children. The author of the 14th amendment, Jacob Howard, stated:  \"Every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons. It settles the great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United States. This has long been a great desideratum in the jurisprudence and legislation of this country.\"  The supreme court has consistently ignored the intent of the citizenship clause. I don't think reps want an amendment to the constitution, but for the supreme court to interpret it as it was intended.", 8429, "PL1tsgjVaa", 2],
