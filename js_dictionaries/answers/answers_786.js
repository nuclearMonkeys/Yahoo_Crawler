	43672 : ["What makes you think that the audience here can make any informed judgement on what you should be? We are not you. In the animal kingdom, birds drop their eggs in other birds nests in order that the parent birds will look after it's offspring, leaving it free to mate again. Why should we criticise this behaviour with our human morality. Many animals steal for a living Many humans make a living off the stupidity and gullibility of other humans. Why should I criticize or judge you for doing that too? If that is what makes you happy, it makes you happy. Even if you could predict the future, should you be giving people the future? Probably that would be reducing the human experience to a tape recording: something you've already heard. So, what is the real purpose of a Tarot card reader, if not to tell the future? People have problems. How are you really going to help them? Imagine if someone came here and asked whether they could be an Olympic sprinter, but they were totally fat. We'd all think: power-lifter more like. Yet, if that person said: do you think I could get the world record in the 100 m, we'd be lying to say \"go for it, course you can\", as we'd be thinking \"you can break the world record for a fat human\".. What if you're Tarot card reading pulled The world card? [Nothing can stand in your way, success is guaranteed]... Yeah, except your waste line! Yet if sprinting makes a person happy, why should they not do it anyway? Even if they can't be a professional sprinter!!! So as a Tarot card reader, your reads are sometimes going to fail to make sense. You're going to have to interpret them in such a way as you are helping that individual---even if not in the way they want. What is it that makes a stable living? High constant Demand Low supply High stable profit Any work that has these 3 facets is going to be financially stable. On the other hand, will you find it fulfilling in the longer term? Who knows? If you want to know what other people think, prepare to be judged harshly. If you want to know what to do, be your own judge, do the thinking, work through the process. Be a light to yourself. Read other people's books on it. Research, analyse, strategically plan, implement, operate! Don't think that a business will be like this: I aspire, I do, I win. Business is expensive. There are costs. There are marketing requirements. Without a plan, you are going to fail. Best have more than a plan: best have a strategy---a way of determining how you are going to out-compete your rivals. There are system and structural requirements. Overheads. Employees eventually. When you say: become a tarot card reader, if you become successful, you will only be so successful because you will be only one person with limited abilities to see people. If you want to do better then, you'll need to build the business and employ people. Then it becomes a business proper.", 6307, "TneDU9R3aa", 0],

If you plan to stay in your home for a long time, the impact will likely be minimal as long as the market recovers.

WITH MASS prdioction came LOWER VALUES in a  wat and GM woudl make the SAME MISTKAES over and OVER AGAIN til The GOVERNMENT STOPPED THEM!  >>>WHAT YEAR car are hyou INTERESTED IN HERE! MY RULE of thumb is that PENNZOI LULTRA PLATINUM gives a WARRANTy out to 500,000 miels is VERY VERY GOOD to use! VALVOINE is NOT good to use and has put MORE engeins in the JUNK YARD than ANY OTHER OIL! SYTNETHIC OILS are TEH BEST and REQURIED in many cars! HODNA is GREAT< and so is TOYOTA and SUBARU usually !they AL had GOOD and BAD yars! AND I POREFER OLDER cars thathave ALREADY been RATED for problems and SOLUTIONS< too!

FORD now uses mostly ZF GERMAN trannies and STEERING< jus like BMW and AUDI and many BENZ CARS! JIA and HYUNDAI and LINCOLN and CADDY use them TOO! MOst CHRYSELR CARS NOW use ZF suppliers and there are 27 ZF plants in AMERICA NOW! They SUPPLY many systems to MOST car makers WORLD WIDE! They have the DUAL CLUTCH and SOME CVT trannies! The OTHER big name in TRANNIES is AISIN WARNER of JAPAN They BOTH make MULTIPLE GEAR trannies with SHIFT PADDLES and GREAT strength and RELIABILITY!terh AUDI QUATTROP CARS are SOMETHING ELSE! The RACE version got 555 HP from a SMALL 2.2 liter FIVE cylinder engine, The mso REIALBE and LONGEST LASTING cars MAY be ASIAn and most FORD cars now!

The latter only have to cope with inherent noise from their own electronics and amplification; cassette decks have to cope with inherent noise caused by the tape itself and subtraction of the bias signal, have tracking and head azimuth errors to deal with and still have all their own inherent electronic noise just like a CD player. Compact cassettes also have a fairly low tape speed which limits how much information they can convey. The only cassette competing well with CD are the DAC models.  Compact cassettes were all about convenience, relative durability (compared to plastic discs) and portability.

I also suggest that you phone an insurance agent or broker to get insurance quotes for each vehicle after you've narrowed down your choices to 2 or 3 finalists.  Insurance premiums can vary wildly between vehicles and an insurance quote may help you decide on which vehicle to finally pick. Assuming you're going for a used vehicle, also have a dealer or shop inspect the vehicle you're serious about buying before you finalize the deal.  This is your best protection against being saddled with unanticipated repairs within the foreseeable future.", 6314, "bqLvWpcZaa", 2],
