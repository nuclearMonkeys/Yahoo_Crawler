She has proven herself in my mind by all that she has done for Alaska!! and for all those out there McCain didn't throw her under the bus he simply stated that he would have to wait and see who else would be running before he gave her his vote!!  How the hell is that throwing her under the bus?? It was an honest answer, one that says their is a very good chance that someone better could still be out there, hell maybe McCain might even try again who knows!!  What I do know is our country is in serious trouble, and so many small minded people are unable to see the bigger picture!!  We have a man, that by all rights refused to use his whole name before being elected, you know the Hussein part?!!  I mean come on, if he were a man for the people wouldn't he of had confidence in himself and his ideals and wouldn't he of trusted that the American people would of just realized that his name was just that His name?!  Nope, he did not trust in himself or in any of US!! So he hid!!!

	73894 : ["There's no guarantee that either candidate will solve the economic crisis, however, the economic plans of each candidate do differ in the amount of debt our country will be in.  While both plans calculate to trillions in debt ($3 trillion for Obama, $5 trillion for McCain), it's unlikely that all the proposals from either candidate will come to complete fruition, and thus making the predicted debt much lower.  After all congress is multi-partisan and not everything the future president wants will actually happen. Democrats have a record of practically curing unemployment.  If you look at the trends in unemployment since 1992, you'd see that Clinton brought a dramatic decline in unemployment which remained level (or increasing slightly) when Bush took over.  As we know, employment is good for the economy as there are more working folks that can spend and keep the gears moving. McCain's tax plan does promise the single largest tax cut for a particular bracket between the candidates (the highest tax bracket is the only one that pays the 35% he promises to reduce), but Obama's cuts plan to reduce the income taxes of 80-95% of the nations population. Obama wishes to put a stop to tax breaks for large businesses that outsource jobs.  This means that if your company seeks to run a call center in India, for example, because it's cheaper, that you don't get the same privelages as a company that hires Americans in America.  This is supposed to discourage outsourcing (obviously) and create more work here, as well as help reduce our trade defecit. There's also the cost of the war.  By the time the next president takes office, a trillion would have been spend on the war in the middle east.  The war, thus far, as mostly consisted of protecting Iraqis from spurts of attacks from Al Qaeda, while neglecting the source of their operation in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Obama's stance is that Iraqis should be trained enough to defend their land so that we may go into the countries where Al Qaeda is based out of - so we can fight for America own security. -- Money not wasted in defense becomes money spent doing something useful.", 8754, "VNcxe3Hnaa", 3],
