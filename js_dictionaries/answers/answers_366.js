	19656 : ["I think that conservatives scared way too worked up about formative action which is a very minor thing in American society. In particular, a lot of them don't seem to understand what affirmative action is or how it works. For example, many conservatives seem to believe that infirmity of action involves racial hiring quotas but racial quotas have been illegal since the back a decision in the 1970s. Probably saying that you're not going to engage in some sort of proactive effort to increase representation within your organization is that this can often have the effect of perpetuating underrepresentation. You say that we should hire based on qualifications for the job I'm a witch it's obvious. You shouldn't hire someone who is unqualified or unsuited for the job. But the idea that you can run an objectively unbiased search based on quality is problematic. There's comparatively few people in positions to hire employees who are actively racist and who, for example, would admit to someone that they don't want to hire black people. Most people think they are not racist and think that they are hiring purely based on qualifications for the job. But we still see a lot of problems of bias in hiring. For example, one study created resumes for job applicants. The resumes were identical except that one set of resumes had someone with a stereotypically African-American named like Rayshawn or Tamika and the other one had a Les racially specific name like John or Sandra. The ones with the less stereotypically black named got more callbacks than the other one. Big problem now is not over racism. This was a huge problem in the 20th century, at least until such racism was outlawed in the job market. In the early and mid 20th century you actually have advertisements that said, for example, that African Americans shouldn't apply for certain jobs. You had other jobs which were not advertised as specifically for One race but we're hiring officials would simply refuse to consider someone of another race. That's rarely the problem now. The problem now is mostly to do with implicit bias. People have racial bias he's which they aren't even necessarily aware. There's an old saying that like hires like. People, often unconsciously, will tend to favor those who are like them. So a man, will tend to hire men. A white person will tend to hire other white people. This extends as well to network switch can help perpetuate underrepresentation of minorities. Your idea is that people are simply coming in off the street to apply for a job and are getting evaluated based purely on their merits. But what we see, particularly in more professional jobs, is that there's often informal networks which funnel people into these jobs. People get a leg in the door because they know someone who knows someone. And often, these Networks end up being biased in favor of men and white people. Because the existing power structure is disproportionately white, the social structures which can help people get into these jobs are disproportionately white. So, a hiring professional hears about someone from their church, or social club, or a fraternity brother. These social organizations and networks all have racial bias built into them. So the pool of applicants that you're getting, before you even do anything about whether or not they're qualified, will be misrepresented. You can also get situations where a parent qualifications have Tobias to them. That's a personal example, when I was applying to colleges I had it a vice president of a Fortune 500 company offer to write me a recommendation. Now he did this because he thought I was a smart guy would be a good student. But I only had this opportunity because my parents were friends with him. Other people, ones who might be just as smart, would not necessarily have those opportunities. This is another source of potential bias. Because of pre-existing racial disparities, white people will often tend to have more access to things such as that. So someone may not be any smarter or better than someone else, but they might appear so because of credentialing. All these things are the reason why we need formative action, which is not a set of quotas four different racial groups, but rather of broad constellation of policies and to try and overcome both implicit bias and the lingering effects of Freddy's. The idea behind affirmative action is to try and overcome the structural disadvantages which many people of color suffer from and get them an opportunity to prove what they're worth. The policies used to do this aren't racial quotas, which as I said were made it legal by the Supreme Court decades ago. Instead, they tend to the policies meant to give more opportunity to people of color. An example of this is Texas. They had a policy where the top students at each Texas High School could gain automatic admission to a state-run college. This was a game-changer in terms of admissions because it eliminated structural bias which is built into the system. Now, it didn't matter that there was widespread racial segregation in the education system across the US. If you were the top student in a Texas High School, regardless of whether it was a well-funded elite high school, or a school where everyone was poor, you had an opportunity to go to one of the state-run colleges, many of which are exceptional institutions. There are other policies which organizations can engage in which are meant to get more people of color and opportunity. And we need these because supposedly colorblind and merit-based hiring is not necessarily enough.", 3248, "None", -3],
