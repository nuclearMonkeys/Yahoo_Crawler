I don't think people be shamed or stigmatized for being sexually active nor should they be shamed or stigmatized for not being sexually active.  I do think that people should get sex education, comprehensive sex education that includes much more than \"here is how your plumbing works\" and \"here's how to put on a condom.\" Young people (and a lot of adults too) need some guidance in knowing how to talk about sex, how to say no, how to set and enforce boundaries, how to protect themselves from not only actual predators but also the merely aggressive and/or manipulative, how to resist social pressures.  I disagree with the \"take a test drive before buying\" model. It isn't experience that makes for good sex; it is constructive communication. When two people know how to talk to each other about sex (provide direction and instruction), know how to listen to their partner (accept and act positively on direction and instruction), those two people learn to delight each other. ", 4622, "iz1cNz5Laa", 1],

You state that you have a sexless marriage.. is it also an affection-less marriage? Clearly, something needs to happen. If you allow yourself to feel guilty and low life  and have gone into therapy repeatedly over this desire/behavior of yours then, really, no one has suggested to you that you stop it? Or dive deeply into it?  What comes across here, to me, are multiple levels of self dishonesty. Come clean!  No, I don't see how this man you've carried on a flirtation with for 9 years, despite being a married woman... perhaps he's a married man (?), owed you a phone call to find out if you were OKAY after passionately kissing. There is nothing \"entitled\" here for anyone so I don't think you need to worry about that.  Are you waiting for your husband to die? Some people live decades longer than that. Of course your feelings for him have changed over the decades and the warnings people gave you decades ago about marrying a man 23 years your senior have now proven out to be the case.. for whatever reason. He was a lot older than you when you wed so he likely got tons of warnings from people about this marriage as well. Time for the two of you to have a talk!  Clear out your box of pain, dear.

	30057 : ["At least one of you is childish and is being disrespectful to the other, and maybe both of you are. Here's two ways to fix the money issue. 1)  You both get paid.  You both put your entire paychecks into a joint account.  All the expenses get paid out of that account.  No money comes out that you do not both agree on.  In addition to that, you both agree to an amount that you each get as a weekly allowance to go into your own separate accounts, to use as gifts, personal expenses, fun money, and things that are not common expenses that do not benefit both of you.  This is only good if both can be trusted to not take money out of the joint account that the other did not agree to.  Good luck on that. 2)  If one of you insists that their paycheck is not going into the joint account, here's a fair fix for that. A)  Add up all the expenses for the month.  This is everything that affects both of you.  Gas for the cars to get to work, groceries, utilities, rent, insurance, MEDICAL BILLS, car repairs, taxes, other fees, etc. B)  Add up your total income for the month. C)  Divide your total expenses by your total income. EXAMPLE:  If your total expenses come to $900 a month, and your total income is $1500 a month, then $900 divided by $1500 is 0.6 which means that it takes 60% of your bring home pay to pay your bills for the month. This means that you each pay 60% of your bring home pay to pay for the monthly expenses.  Say that he makes $500 a month. Say you make $1000 a month. 60% of his $500 comes to $300. 60% of your $1000 comes to $600. Add that up, $300 + $600 = $900.  BOOM!  Bills are paid and you each have a fair amount of your paychecks left based on what you each earn. .", 4636, "5P6m4Gs4aa", 1],
