	64044 : ["Spontaneous generation refers to an obsolete body of thought on the ordinary formation of living organisms without descent from similar organisms. The theory of spontaneous generation held that living creatures could arise from nonliving matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular. For instance, it was hypothesized that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust, or that maggots could arise from dead flesh. A variant idea was that of equivocal generation, in which species such as tapeworms arose from unrelated living organisms, now understood to be their hosts. The idea of univocal generation, by contrast, refers to effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related parent(s), generally of the same species. The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by Aristotle, who compiled and expanded the work of earlier natural philosophers and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms, and was taken as scientific fact for two millennia. Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of Francesco Redi and Lazzaro Spallanzani, spontaneous generation was not disproved until the work of Louis Pasteur and John Tyndall in the mid-19th century. Pasteur invented the swan-necked flask to create an environment known not to grow microorganisms. After sterilizing a nutrient broth in these flasks, he removed the swan necks of the controls. Microorganisms grew only in the controls, refuting spontaneous generation. Rejection of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists. By the middle of the 19th century, experiments by Louis Pasteur and others refuted the traditional theory of spontaneous generation and supported biogenesis.", 8234, "XbCHUk4daa", 5],

If everything you are is counting on that promise to be kept and as this being the most important event to take place on the planet, there is no contingency plan in the event they were wrong and were taught to just have faith and believe. Every generation that passes without a fulfilled promise brings a deep fear of doubt. Doubt is a luxury many Christians suppress or hide at all costs. A religion that needs faith in order to exist has is running out of time. With that pressure, two thousand years is an ungodly long time.", 8235, "uLFNU5i4aa", 1],
	64048 : ["There are many OT prophecies about a future Messiah but not one of them states the rebuilding of the material Temple in Jerusalem. The Temple in existence at the time Jesus was born, was destroyed in A.D. 75 (Jesus prophesied its destruction some 40 years before it happened). It had been Herod the Great who built the last Temple in Jerusalem, starting in 20 B.C.E. and not completed until A.D. 64. Every Jew in the land knew that such a wicked man could not ever be the Messiah! So, even if there had been a prophecy about Messiah rebuilding the Temple, it was never Herod the Great (who died in 4 B.C.E.). What Jesus said in John 2:19-21 was a reference to His impending death and resurrection. But the religious leaders who heard Him misunderstood, such was their fixation on literal, material things - they could not see spiritual Truth even when facing and hearing that Truth. They laughed Him to scorn, wrongly supposing that He had prophesied that it would only take Him 3 days to rebuild the destroyed temple. After His resurrection on the third day, they still did not get it.  They don't get it even now. There may be ideas floating around in Jewish circles from after the Temple's destruction in A.D. 75 till now supposing that a Messiah would rebuild their lost Temple and re-establish sacrifices and worship there, but there is nothing in the OT prophecies about Messiah doing that as proof that He is the Messiah.", 8236, "0aN1xIxfaa", 2],

	64053 : ["Original sin is just an analogy for our human nature. That is why we are all born with it. Jesus was meant to be sinless because he had no human father and inherited God's nature, not human nature. Of course the writers did not know any better back then and thought everything came from the man and women were just incubators. Even if a God could contribute, the gene pool would be half God, half human, meaning Jesus would have inherited Original Sin from his mother Mary. You could not even claim Jesus was sinless due to his actions because he did sin several times. He disrespected his parents several times and just like the male writer writing the stories of Jesus had a condescending attitude towards his parents and sometimes even his followers. Certainly cursing a fig tree for bearing no fruit out of season did him no favors either, where the writer was attempting to make a point because all the stories about Jesus are fictional and created from using other sources, such as the Septuagint (Greek translated OT) or Matthew and Luke using a lot of what Mark had written as their source.", 8230, "0jmvVwqPaa", -1],

	64056 : ["The burden of proof is on the people who claim that something is, not the people who claim it is not. Once that's proven successfully, proof burden moves to those who claim that the first proof is wrong and it actually is not. For proving the existence of God scientifically, the burden is on theists to prove he exists. They haven't done that (mostly because the serious theists say it's a matter of faith, not science). So atheists are right that there's no proof of God, and they don't need to un-prove him. The default earth-shape is flat because it looks that way when you're standing on it. Astronomers and explorers long ago proved it's spherical. That moves the burden to flat earthers to unprove the sphere, which they haven't done with laughably-bad pseudo-science. Default for human-caused climate change is no. Scientists have successfully proven that's real, so the burden is now on deniers to unprove it. Which they're failing to do because they're relying on \"fake! fake!\" as their main argument. Both creation and evolution needed to be proven, since the default is that we just exist and aren't capable of looking beyond our existence. Evolution through natural selection is well-proven and observed and experimentally demonstrated. Creationists have never seriously tried for scientific proof, the closest they've come is \"creation science\", which is biblical stories told in sciency-sounding language.", 8226, "bbb51eeb731786c5f1db8432f39fb0a2aa", 2],

At one time all that matter would have been clumped together in one place - if it was matter at that time its density would have created the largest black hole ever and nothing would have ever escaped from it. But it wasn't matter. Matter was spontaneously generated in an energy to matter conversion, and the resulting expansion wave of particles caused the outward bound trajectories of everything in the Universe. There was no \"before\" the Big Bang, because that energy didn't exist in a spacetime continuum yet. It existed as a Nexus - there was no \"where\" else, and there was no \"when\" else. It was both eternal, and existent for only a millionth of a second, because Time did not exist. neither did space and distance.

Detailed description of a temple of Jehovah is also found at Ezekiel chapters 40-47, but it is not a temple that was ever built on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem, nor would it fit there.
