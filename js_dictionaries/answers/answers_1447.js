Many popular sites like myspace and youtube are accessable though.- the xbox 360 doesn't have one *Folding@home- With this program which can be downloaded to any PS3 easily, you can use your PS3's extra processing power while you're not using it for Cancer research by folding and analyzing proteins. *Play TV- Pretty much Tivo for your ps3, a tuner that you can record things with. Though it has only been announced to launch in Europe so far. *Interchangeable hard drive- This pretty much means you can change the size of your hard drive with any hard drive so you can store more things.- you have to buy an expensive MS HDD for the 360 *Built in wifi- Wifi lets you connect to the internet wirelessly- With the xbox 360 you have to buy a wifi adapter for $100, this comes standard in the PS3. *Free Online- the xbox 360 costs $50 per year *Playstation Home- Playstation home is an interactive community of ps3 users where you can play games or meet up with friends and hang out at your virtual home and hang outs, as well as stream live media(releasing in early 08 and is FREE) * Games- For now good games include; Heavenly Sword, Resistance Fall of Man, Rainbow Six Vegas, Folklore, warhawk, lair, Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, Call of Duty 4 Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Motorstorm, Eye of Judgment etc. Good upcoming games are Haze, LittleBigPlanet, Metal Gear Solid 4, Yakuza 3, White Knight Story, Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear online, Heavy Rain, God of War 3, Gran Turismo 5, Final Fantasy Versus XIII, Afrika, Time Crisis 4, Tekken 6, Socom: Confrontation, L.A. Noire, Motorstorm 2, InFamous, Killzone 2, Kurayami, Way of the Samurai 3, etc. Over 300 games will be released by next spring. The PS3 controllers are rechargeable and the x box controllers run on batteries it has great features like the motion sensing remote, the ability to download games from the ps network if u have an account(does not cost money like xbox live) and if u want to play online it is free and u can download game demos off the ps network PS3 can wirelessley connect to a PSP the failure rate of the x box 360 ---33%!!!!!!

First of all, just tell yourself that you will not Argue with them on any thing, and any thing means, any thing, until unless you have developed rational grounds about your faith. Next get into the habit of reading Koran (Quran), even a few verses, on daily basis; in the language best understand. This will infrom you more what God is saying in His Book. I take it for granted that you have read the Bible already, so it will develop a firm understanding about Islam as Koran is no different than Jewish or Christian Books of God. If you are observing daily Prayers at home then you must take care not to disturb them by choosing a place, like your room, where you mighty not be a hindrence in their domstic chores. Moreover, as a Muslim you have to have Kosher / Hallal food, and it they have an objection to that then you can tell them softly to look back to the Jewish traditions & ask them politely to not to have objections on that please. After all, Judaism, Christianity & Islam are all Abrahamic Faiths! Now, when you will be exposed to Koran, you will come to know that God consideres Jews & Christians among the believers, however, Koran clearly states & criticise People of the Book for certain adopted practices which were adopted in Religious Practices with the course of time & that which are considered ungodly by God All-sufficient. If you would be a little informed what is written in Koran then you will be in a position to inform them that there are good things written about them in Koarn. No doubt, God will not spare people who make compeers & assocates to God All-mighty, All-sufficient. At the same time, People of the Book are the People of the Book. PATIANCE is the name of the game here & a test and trial for you to have Sure Faith in One unseen God.", 8921, "4nenRWKYaa", 0],

	78011 : ["Hi Ladybire, I dont want to be rude to anyone but Hanna's answer is the most ignorant,misguided thing I have ever read in my life. Depression like your boyfriend is suffering is NOT reactive. ie He's not reacting to his environment, so telling him he's lucky not to live in Iraq is like telling someone who's had their leg cut off that they're lucky it wasn't their head. Your boyfriend is suffering from a CLINICAL or CHEMICAL depression as far as I can see. Therfore his SEROTONIN levels ( serotonin is the feel good hormone) are low. He probably needs to go on an antidepressant such as seroxat (paxil) or prozac, even for a short time. Counselling would not suit him he needs PYCHOTHERAPY ,which is a slow process of analysis and free associating to unravel the root cause of his unhappiness. He's not alone and he can be helped DEFINITELY. You are right to stay with him as I am sure he loves you and the lack of sex is because of depression NOT anything to do with you. He MUST visit the doctor AND be referred for therapy. I know this as I'm from a medical background (I'm a dentist but like doctors we study pre-med) My brother IS a pyscho-therapist and I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE AND HAD THE EXACT SYMPTOMS YOU DESCRIBE AND they have been helped.

Unfortunately sex drive can be affected by both depression and anti depressant medication, so it is all part of the illness. He would probably appreciate you giving him encouraging and loving hugs as he is likely to feel afraid, useless and very alone.   How to cope as a carer: may also prove useful to you. I would say that you need to keep encouraging him to seek help, I know he has refused so far, but one day he may take you up on the offer.  You could offer to go to see his GP with him if it would help, get him to write down all his fears and worries and the feelings he is having.  Then if he forgets or gets anxious he can hand over what he has written.  The GP won't judge him and will be able to decide what treatment is best to help. Another idea would be to find your local mental health charity: again, you can go with him to offer your support, it might also help him to know that the staff there are much less formal than the health services.  You don't need to be referred by anyone and it only takes a phone call.  They will support you as well and can give you information and may have a carers support group that you could attend. I'm so pleased that you want to stick by him and offer all the help you can, you realise that it is the illness that is the problem and that help is available.  Hopefully you can guide him in the right direction and then he can begin to make his recovery. Take care and good luck to both of you.", 8921, "1y91als8aa", 0],
	78033 : ["Having suffered from depression, the first thing it affects is your sex drive, so I know how he feels. The only way you are going to be able to help him, is if he helps himself and realises that to overcome it, he has to work at it. Once you suffer from depression once, it is more likely that it will happen again, and thats why it is important to keep up with treatment. He might just take time to do this, with some gentle nudging from you. Having depression consumes you so much that you become so self absorbed and to a degree, selfish, so don't be hurt by the way he is acting. I think you are brave, and it's very admirable that you are not giving up on him. Try hard to get him to see someone, even if it's just a councillor - it doesn't have to be drugs. I felt better talking to a stranger because they were removed from my situation, and could give me un-biased help. Good luck, my thoughts are with you.", 8921, "4BKo9Gc9aa", 1],
