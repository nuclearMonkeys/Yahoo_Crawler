	132698 : ["Yoga will be beneficial for your mental health as well as flexibility. It will teach you how to relax in your busy lifestyle. I recommend it. As for cross training, it depends on your comfort level. Personally, cross training is a wonderful idea but when you have a shaky foundation in one martial art, what you build on top of it will also be weak. It is possible to cross train, but I suggest take things at a pace best for you. Unless you want to become an MMA sports fighter, cross train until you drop... but if this is purely for your personal growth, take things slow. I want to add that just because you train in 4 or more martial arts, doesn't make you better. It's like stuffing your face at a buffet without truly tasting or savoring the flavor. So think, which art would you want to excel in to help you as a person? What philosophy behind that martial appeals to you? How does the instructor (very important) teach? Do you enjoy that school more than others? Build a strong foundation, first. Attend to a martial art that best fits you. Take yoga on the side to teach  yourself that not all things have to be tense and fast paced. You must learn how to challenge yourself, yes, but also balance yourself. Then again, if you enjoy cross training for the sake of it, do it if it makes you happy. But this doesn't necessarily mean it will make you better if you go martial art hopping everywhere.  Examples are UFC/MMA fighters. Generally speaking, most of them have a strong foundation in either karate, tae kwon do, muay thai, wrestling, judo, BJJ,boxing, etc. This teaches them discipline and experience. The good and the bad.  So answering your question, I do believe it is too much if you do three or more arts at the same time. But it all comes down to you, I'm just give you the best of my suggestion. Best of training to you.", 11156, "uBrTu7OBaa", 0],
	132699 : ["Strength training is important if you want to pack a mean punch.  Strength is one of the most under-worked factor of martial training and even if you have built the strongest endurance base possible, without absolute strength, you can't go far.  Incorporate strength training in your non-training days. I'd say 3 days of strength and 2 days of MA would be good.  But it would be more productive to train for strength first, since getting stronger is always harder than trying to build endurance (it will come with adequate strength building and your martial arts training). But as many people found out, their love for MA is simply too much to forgo it for a phrase of solid strength training. So go and try to incorporate them both into your regime.  Try starting out on a larger strength base, then slowly adjust your schedule while balancing your recovery abilities. It will take some trial and errors to determine your optimal recovery schedule. If you feel weakened and/or overtrained, adjust your balance and work from there. Good luck.", 11157, "AA10722896", 1],

	132710 : ["Yes.  You can now join up and get a slot for the Special Forces selection course in your contract.  You have to be at least 20 when you join.  You will go to selection after basic training and/or airborne school, or shortly after getting to your first unit.  However, you are not guaranteed to be selected just because you have a slot or just because you complete selection, you are not guaranteed to make it through Special Forces training, and it will be a few months before you actually go for Special Forces training, which takes at least 6 months.  In the meantime, you will be assigned to an Infantry or airborne infantry unit.  If you join the Army when you are under 20, you will have to earn the rank of at least PFC before applying for the Special Forces Selection course.  If you joint he Marines for 3 or 4 years, then when you get out, you can join the Army under a Special Forces contract.  If you are an E-4 or below when you get out of the Marines, you will keep your rank (you will be a PFC or specialist, not a corporal though).  You can also earn rank before you join the Army by going to college.  If you do 6 months, you can come in as an E-2; 2 years gets you E-3 and a 4-year degree gets you specialist.  Of course, there are time-in-service requirements for promotion, so you will not really be ahead of the guys who come in at lower rank.  This is different than the Marines.  Every Marine comes in as an E-1 private.  Also, making E-4 is much harder in the Marines.  A corporal in the Marines is a team leader.  A team leader in the Army is usually a sergeant, but sometimes a corporal or a specialist.  You might want to consider the rangers too.  You can do 2 or 3 years with the Rangers and then volunteer for Special Forces.
