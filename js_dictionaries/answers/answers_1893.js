For example, say I was abusing drugs and the elders found out, they'd talk to me about this problem and would help me in whatever way they could. But if I rejected that help and decided to go against Jehovah God, then of course, it wouldn't be ideal for me to be to be a part of a congregation - the congregation needs to be clean and that is why people are removed from it. It is not a form of torture or punishment, its done because reproach doesn't need to be being brought on Jehovah's name. The 1st century Christians did the same - I can't remember the scripture mind. In regards to the preaching work, the bible gives us instructions to preach the good news and every Jehovah's witness tries - everyone has their limits though! And in regards to what would happen if a whole community was converted, I'd imagine most people would preach to others who aren't part of the faith - if that means moving, so be it.", 9737, "Uj4b2e4raa", 3],

Disfellowshipping - It is for people who consciously get out of line or practice such things they know Jehovah hates and has said not to do. Moses was given the 10 commandments and laws etc and to observe them is like the law of gravity, ignore it and it can cause serious harm to us and others, god is a loving father, so imagine you are a child and you go near fire, the parent might shout or discipline you for your safety, as a child you have a loving respectful fear of the parent not in a bad way but good. If I went to William Hill bookies today and done some gambling they would talk to me about it and go over why it's wrong, what effects it has, why we shouldn't do it etc looking out for me, I'm not baptised yet but If I continued doing it I would lose the privilege of going door to door as an unbaptised publisher I think. We can't claim to be Christians and do un Christian things then associate with them, it will make others think it's okay, brings a bad name on Jehovah and the reason it's their is for our benefit also. It may seem harsh to somebody who doesn't have an insight but we all understand it very well. They aren't overly harsh either, if somebody got reproved or something for going out clubbing and drinking to the point of blackout, acting in a way they are not in control, loose conduct, swearing, shouting and making trouble for people, is that Christian? would god approve? they would probably get their privileges taken off them like answering, ministry, association, but they would stop doing these things and straighten up off their own free will because they knows whats right and wrong and all the ins and outs and the ripple effect these things can have, they would be allowed all privileges back within a few months. If it was something more serious and really bad maybe like 6-7 IDK it depends on the person and the thing, plus how they choose to act after etc. As for the ministry question not too sure, I think older ones and disabled etc help the ones who go on ministry or do visits, home study's and help out where they can, as for the Governing Body IDK but they go by the Bible and justify what they do by scriptures in all things, that's where we get everything, from gods word, you are always free to call in and ask, or write a letter or talk to a witness at the door. We are not Mormons obviously, we can teach you a few truths about Mormons that you can confirm with them like, they are willing to kill other Mormons if the country goes to war! Also the guy who founded it said god gave him 2 tablets of gold with commands, it was in his hand writing and doesn't add up, that's 2 things I know about them off the top of my head. Remember this though, in Noah's time god only saved 8 and in Sodom and Gomorrah only Lot and his family so it's not quantity that is the most important thing but true worshipers that matter to Jehovah. If we Convert a City or something we will work as a team and take t from the scriptures, possibly tour buses for ministry or branch out more, it's gods organization so he will guide us.

	100401 : ["\"So you basically force every member to only have friends and family who are other Jehovah's Witnesses\"  Not true. We do have, and associate with, family members who are non-Witnesses. We also have friendly association with unrelated, non-Witnesses. We are CAREFUL about how much and how intimately we associate with non-Witnesses because the Bible encourages Christians not to be unevenly yoked with non-believers and warns that bad associations spoil useful habits. (2Corinthians 6:14; 1Corinthians 5:9,10; 1Corinthians 15:33) A person cannot be disfellowshipped for associating with someone who wasn't a Witness. Your portrayal of how we practice disfellowshipping does not reflect the whole truth. Most, but not all, of the practices you listed as grounds for disfellowshipping are correct. Masturbation is not grounds for disfellowshipping. Also, a person is not automatically disfellowshipped for doing any of the things you listed. A person has to UNREPENTENTLY PRACTICE these things. For example, someone who commits fornication once and displays a repentant attitude and does not continue in that bad path, would not disfellowshipped for it. We are not quick to disfellowship. It is viewed as a serious measure of last resort after other loving efforts to restore an individual to upright conduct, go unheeded by the individual. \"Not every person's skill set includes being a door to door salesperson.\" True. I'm sure that even God and his Son Jesus recognize this. That is precisely why Jesus promised his followers that they will receive POWER by holy spirit to enable them to preach. The preaching work is not done in our own strength and abilities but in the strength and ability that God supplies us by his holy spirit. (Acts 1:8; 2Corinthians 4:1,7) Also, we receive regular weekly training on how to be effective preachers and teachers of God's word. Even so, preaching ability will vary from one Witness to the next. What is important is that we give OUR best. God is able to bless our best efforts -- no matter how ineffective they may appear to human eyes. \"Are you trying to tell me that ALL early Christians were missionaries?\" Not all were missionaries but all were evangelizers. (Acts 8:1,4; Acts 11:19-21) The twelve apostolic disciples were not the only ones that Jesus taught to preach. (Luke 10:1-16)", 9737, "4kgESJlEaa", 6],

Either way, you will find the answers to your questions about Jehovah's Witnesses if you study with them!

I think your questions are valid and I will do my best to respond. #1 Disfellowshipping took place during first century Christianity as can be seen in the following scriptures: 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 \"In my letter I wrote you to quit mixing in company with fornicators, not [meaning] entirely with the fornicators of this world or the greedy persons and extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, you would actually have to get out of the world. But now I am writing you to quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do you not judge those inside, while God judges those outside? “Remove the wicked [man] from among yourselves.” ======>Notice Paul did NOT say to quit mixing in company with fornicators or greedy persons of the world, but he said to quit mixing in company with ANYONE CALLED A BROTHER who took up these practices, not even EATING with such a man, in other words, socializing. He said REMOVE them, meaning from the congregation. 2 John 9-11 \"Everyone that pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. He that does remain in this teaching is the one that has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. For he that says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.\" ======>John here was referring to those who DID NOT REMAIN IN THE TEACHING OF THE CHRIST, and said not to even greet them, in other words, socialize. Would someone say that early apostles were inhumane, that they treated family and friends horribly for having turned against or deliberately sinned against Jehovah? No, we most likely would not. Don't you think that if the catholic church had stopped re-assigning pedophile priests to other parishes there would not be as many victims of abuse coming out? Why didn't they disfellowship these priests?  One thing you failed to mention in your comment is that we don't COMPLETELY turn our backs on those who are disfellowshipped. There are many of these individuals who attend our meetings and many have been reinstated to the congregation. They are always welcomed back with open arms. Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first. Also, the principle at Proverbs 3:11,12 applies \"The discipline of Jehovah, O my son, do not reject; and do not abhor his reproof, because the one whom Jehovah loves he reproves, even as a father does a son in whom he finds pleasure.\" PLUS, there is a lot more involved when someone is disfellowshipped. It may sometimes take weeks and even months before such action is taken. Someone is not disfellowhsipped \"just because\" and the elders nor the congregation take it lightly.  #2 Field Service. Poopyface, if you were to find out that a catastrophic event was to take place and could affect human's future on the earth, what would you do? Keep it to yourself? No, you would run out and tell others. And after you tell your entire community... Then what? Aren't there more people who deserve to hear? What about using the phone, writing letters, or going on the internet? The bible has a message that ALL people DESERVE to hear, that can save their life. What would happen if we didn't talk about it?  Luke 19:39,40 \"However, some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” But in reply he said: “I tell you, If these remained silent, the stones would cry out.” ======>We cannot and WILL not stop talking about the things we've learned and making known Jehovah's name and letting others know that Christ rules in heaven, and that we believe these to be TRUE. If not us, then the stones would speak out. #3 Mormons. Yes, they may convert more than we Jehovah's Witnesses do, but..... You know, I am not going to say anything negative about them, because I do believe that they are good people and have good intentions. But for how long do they preach? Who do they preac?

	100436 : ["First of all, it is not that easy to get disfellowshipped and it is the person himself that causes his own demise.   Meaning, you don't do something once and you are out.  Everyone one who has been baptized is basically taking an oath that they are dedicating their lives to Jehovah and will uphold his requirements.  Those requirements mean you abstain from many of the things you have mentioned.  Therefore, each one knows what their obligations are and the baptism is their decision. When a JW continues to practice what goes against God's commandments or principles, then they become in violation of the vow that they have made with Jehovah.  The early Christians set the example of what to do when a fellow dedicated Christian practiced wrongdoing: Consider a Scriptural example of disfellowshipping. The congregation in Corinth tolerated “such fornication as [was] not even among the nations, that a wife a certain man [had] of his father.” Paul urged the Corinthians to “hand such a man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that the spirit may be saved.” (1 Corinthians 5:1-5) When disfellowshipped and thus handed over to Satan, the sinner was again part of the Devil's world. (1 John 5:19) His expulsion removed an evil fleshly element from the congregation and preserved its godly “spirit,” or dominant attitude. Before a very long time had passed, Paul urged the Christians in Corinth to reinstate the wrongdoer. Why? It was so that they might not be “overreached by Satan,” said the apostle. The sinner had evidently repented and cleaned up his life. (2 Corinthians 2:8-11) If the Corinthians refused to reinstate the repentant man, Satan would overreach them in that they would be as hard and unforgiving as the Devil wanted them to be. Very likely, they soon did “forgive and comfort” the penitent man.—2 Corinthians 2:5-7. What is accomplished by disfellowshipping? It keeps Jehovah's holy name clear of reproach and protects the fine reputation of his people. (1 Peter 1:14-16) Removing an unrepentant wrongdoer from the congregation upholds God's standards and preserves the congregation's spiritual cleanness. It may also bring the unrepentant one to his senses. I was once disfellowshipped.  Did I hold a grudge against the congregation for doing so?  No.  For I was wrong.  I knew it was wrong for me to continually to have sex with my boyfriend who was not a JW.  I was counseled twice and I tried to not see him anymore, but I continued and was eventually disfellowshipped. It was difficult to go to the Kingdom Hall and have no one greet you.  However, it made me appreciate Jehovah and his commandments that much more. Jehovah said that \"fornicators\" would not inherit his Kingdom.  That is what I was.  Therefore, I knew it meant he did not love me, for the scripture continues saying \"and that is what some of you were but have been washed clean\".  I knew it wasn't the elders that were disciplining me, but Jehovah himself.  (Proverbs 3:11) I did come to my senses and I was reinstated. Scriptural basis for disfellowshipping: 1 Corinthians 5:11-13 But now I am writing YOU to quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. 12 For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do YOU not judge those inside, 13 while God judges those outside? “Remove the wicked [man] from among yourselves.” “The discipline of Jehovah . . . do not reject.”—PROVERBS 3:11. The elders were just protecting the congregation as they are commandant to do as stated in the bible: 1 Peter 5: 1-4 Therefore, to the older men among YOU I give this exhortation, for I too am an older man with [them] and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, a sharer even of the glory that is to be revealed: 2 Shepherd the flock of God in YOUR care, not under compulsion, but willingly; neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly; 3 neither as lording it over those who are God's inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock. 4 And when the chief shepherd has been made manifest, YOU will receive the unfadable crown of glory. How many can say their church follows these commandments?  How many follow 1 Corthinthians 5:11-13?  How many churches can honestly trust that the pastor or whomever are ensuring that their congregation have discipline in place so when new ones what to know about Jehovah, then they can do so trusting we do practice what we preach. No one is perfect, we do sin.  But do we put much effort in correcting ourselves so we can come to Jehovah in prayer with a clean conscience knowing we are doing everything in our imperfect state to follow his word the bible.  There are countless examples in the bible that have been able to do so and Jehovah had to discipline (ex: David and Job) by correcting their thinking.  It was done out of love.", 9737, "lvDrdC8Zaa", 4],
