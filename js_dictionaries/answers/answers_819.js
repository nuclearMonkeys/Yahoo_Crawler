	45551 : ["I don't think it's a vegan diet so much as a carefully controlled diet, along with vitamins, supplements, exercise, and training. Also, when you stop eating meat, that makes you a *vegetarian* not necessarily a vegan.", 6533, "NORoIZIcaa", 1],
	45552 : ["All my meat was vegan.", 6533, "None", 3],
	45553 : ["Your post, and your sock puppet that you gave your favorite answer to is pure rubbish. If you want to be a vegan be a vegan, but don't use your dishonest propaganda to push other people into a diet we will never accept.  I've seen first hand the anemia and weakness it created in previously healthy adults, anemia and weakness that went away within weeks after they took their heads out of their behinds and rejected your stupidity. ", 6533, "2EddmzfAaa", 3],
	45554 : ["Who considers Subway healthy? If you know someone who thinks that, ask them why. I don't consider it healthy, though it can certainly be better than some other fast food options if you choose the right things.", 6522, "E5gaKzCsaa", 2],
	45555 : ["Nutrition of bread depends on what you choose.   You can have a sandwich bowl instead of bread. You don't have to have cold cuts either.   You can have tuna or grilled chicken or just veggies. \"Healthy\" depends on what specifically you choose from the menu.   But in general, Subway is less bad for you than other fast food like a burger and fries. Why do you start your sentence/question with \"so\"?   It makes you sound uneducated.   \"How is Subway considered....\"     Fixed that for you.", 6522, "None", 2],
	45556 : ["I try to, out of respect. I don't really eat that much meat anyways so it isn't hard for me to do.", 6539, "HE8XSehhaa", -1],

	45561 : ["Shhhh. Ignorance and willful denial sustain their illusions, that's how. Animals are farmed to grow fruit and veg and vegans are lying to themselves.", 6534, "None", 0],
	45562 : ["Because people are willing to buy it.", 6514, "EIkJVb2haa", 3],
	45563 : ["because people watch too much junk tv. and that leads to eating lots of junk food", 6514, "None", 2],
	45564 : ["The whole point of veggie burgers is to try to trick us meat eaters into going vegan, and to possibly convert to a New Age worldview. That is a big reason why I won't even try a veggie burger, and especially why I won't go vegan. And I refuse to adopt a New Age worldview.", 6530, "None", -1],
	45565 : ["Your ignorance is showing. Veggie 'burgers' are not always an attempt to replicate beef. Many veggie burgers are simply tasty vegetarian options that can be shaped and cooked in a patty form in order to fit into a sandwich, if desired. Personally, I have no interest eating anything that tastes like meat. Yes, I do remember what meat tastes like. I simply have no interest now in eating it or any imitation form of it. Too bad if that bothers you so much.", 6530, "None", 3],
	45566 : ["Probably grass fed at first, and then finished off in the feed lot by feeding them grain. There is VERY LITTLE different, between grass fed and grain fed .. except that grass fed will generally be leaner.  Less fat, but also less flavor.", 6511, "sMtpQ4f2aa", 0],
	45567 : ["'Dogs and animals'? Do dogs not count as animals? Anyway, dogs are more innocent and probably kinder than a lot of people, though they can be pretty violent and vicious too if they revert to their natural survival instincts. But they are not smarter than humans, they are smart but their brain is nowhere near as developed as humans. I've never heard of a dog driving a car or making scientific discoveries.", 6536, "None", 0],
	45568 : ["Well I wouldn't say people were ever viewed as the most \"savvy\" species, people are the most *capable*. We people can utilize innovation, drive vehicles, and concoct a wide range of things on the grounds that our minds advanced to have the option to. It's difficult to clarify. Possibly one day in 5000 years there will be another species that out-smarts people!", 6536, "Fw5Gkob1aa", 0],
	45569 : ["Well I wouldn't say humans were ever considered the most \"intelligent\" species, humans are the most *capable*. We humans are able to use technology, drive cars, and invent all sorts of things because our brains evolved to be able to. It's hard to explain. Maybe one day in 5000 years there will be another species that out-smarts humans!", 6536, "None", 0],
	45570 : ["Meat eaters eat meat. Vegetarians should just get over themselves and their attitudes that we are somehow less healthy than they are. ", 6537, "AA10411379", -1],
	45571 : ["Not necessarily. If a vegetarian who happens to be overweight/obese doesn't do anything to stop himself from getting Covid by believing in stupid conspiracy theories, not social distancing or wearing face masks, then he will get Covid (or other viruses) and be affected big time by it. And I speak as a vegetarian. All you have to do is just NOT be an idiot!", 6537, "None", 1],

	45574 : ["No difference. If you were juicing them then they would not be as good for you due to the fact that you were removing the fibre, but blending is fine.", 6538, "HE8XSehhaa", 2],
	45575 : ["Why would it be worse? Blending isn't cooking. If the vegetables were raw when they went into the blender, they're raw when they come out of it.", 6538, "E5gaKzCsaa", 3],

	45578 : ["I'm not a fan when meat is served with it's face and eyeballs still intact.    Like when they roast a whole pig and then put the whole dang thing on a platter and stick an apple in it's mouth like a dead pig head is some kind of decoration.", 6531, "None", 2],
	45579 : ["Absolutely not! First of all, if the government makes everybody get a microchip in their right hand, you can be rest assured that it will be the mark of the beast. Yeah, without the mark of the beast, you won't be allowed to buy or sell. You will be completely shunned from society - possibly thrown in prison and executed (according to what the King James Bible says - Read Revelation Chapter 13). But is it worth losing your soul, to gain the whole world? Read Mark 8:36. Also, don't forget the warnings in Revelation Chapter 14, about those who take the mark of the beast. It says that they will drink of the wine of the wrath of God that is poured without mixture, that they will be tormented by fire and brimstone (reference to Hell and the Lake of Fire) in the presence of the holy angels and the presence of the Lamb (Jesus Christ is the Lamb, figuratively speaking, slain for the sins of the whole world), and they will have no rest day or night - the smoke of their torment will ascend forever (that means the people who take the mark of the beast, which is a physical mark, and worship the Antichrist are going to burn alive in unquenchable fire forever and ever). Now, that we got the microchip business out of the way, let's talk about this false redefinition of murder. Murder only means one thing: the unjust, unlawful (violating God's laws, regardless of whether or not it violates man's laws) killing of a human being by another human being. It does not mean anything else. To redefine what murder is is wicked. You might as well be calling God a liar, because by promoting such ideology, that is exactly what you are doing. In 1 Timothy Chapter 4, in the beginning of the chapter, it talks about those who give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. And it applies to the church as well, because it also talks about people departing from the Christian faith. It talks about how they would speak lies in hypocrisy, having their consciences seared with a hot iron (possible reference to being given over to a reprobate mind). They would forbid marriage (which God created and instituted as exclusively between one man and one woman), and they would command people to abstain from eating meat. To answer your question, I'm not on board with what you are promoting. Matter of fact, I'm against it. No, I don't think I'm morally superior. I'm against this, because it is wrong.", 6532, "None", 1],

	45585 : ["There is no such thing as a vegan. Every human life involves the destruction of other creatures. Something as simple as farming grain involves the death of many small animals and countless insects. You eat bread, you're eating death. Drive in a car with rubber tires, you're riding on death.", 6533, "UO9CtirWaa", 2],
	45586 : ["You could make the argument that vegans are equal athletes but not better. You'd be wrong but there are at least a few athletes who have done fairly well as vegans. Most of them though changed to vegan after that had their success.  It's hard to succeed in sports without the muscle that protein provides. And a lack of B12 will cause a huge decrease in endurance. ", 6533, "None", 1],
	45587 : ["Some people think Subway is healthy because they don't deep fry anything (as some other fast food places do). The salads are a healthy alternative to their subs, so in that sense it's healthy-ish.  Of all of the fast food places, I think El Pollo Loco is the healthiest. ", 6522, "Xlr2xG9daa", 0],

	45590 : ["ya, because its the more respectible thing to do. if it makes them sick to there stomach than dont, but if they just dont like meat than its probably fine. you should ask them though", 6539, "0FJahpO2aa", -1],
	45591 : ["I don't really know any vegetarians all around ok to eat with them. In the event that at least one vegetarians incidentally turned out to be in the room, as on the off chance that it was a café or common eating territory, at that point no I wouldn't. In the event that I was really with a veggie lover and I knew eating meat upset them at that point on the off chance that I thought often about that individual I surmise I may.  Actually however, meat is just something single vegetarians don't eat. I truly don't feel that under any conditions I could be tried to try not to eat meat, dairy items, eggs, nectar or anything that contained them, since another person was vegetarian.", 6539, "Fw5Gkob1aa", 0],
	45592 : ["I have no idea why I should. I don't change what I eat when with someone who keeps kosher, or any other specialized diet. I do often order kosher meals on airline flights, because they are really a lot better.", 6539, "98lD3z68aa", 2],
	45593 : ["Almost all vegetables and grains have protein in them! Green peas, quinoa, rice and beans together, nuts and nut butters, leafy greens.. Personally, I recommend staying away from protein powders - they are expensive, and there is, for me at least, some doubt as to our need for so much protein!  Mother's milk has about 6% protein, and it is the perfect food for a baby. In other cultures, some babies are breast fed until age 4 or longer.. and these babies thrive on 6% protein.. you might be thinking, 'well, that is because they are small and don't do much', but the truth is, at no other time in our lives do we grow as much as when we are babies! A baby doubles in size in 2 years.. they are building bone, cartilage etc.. all on 6% of their diet being protein.. a typical protein powder could have as much as 30 - 60 grams of protein in a single drink.. and some claim that it is hard on the kidneys..  Back to the 6% protein - cows, oxen, horses are huge, strong animals who eat hay.. the protein in hay varies quite a bit, with some types having only about 6% protein.. and although we aren't animals, I personally think that this goes to show that tons of protein is not needed to make you big and strong", 6526, "b8wQws7naa", 4],
