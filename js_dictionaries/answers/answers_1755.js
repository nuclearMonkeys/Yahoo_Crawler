Secondly, the issue right here isn't about treason when you consider that Assange is an Australian citizen. the issue right here's about misappropriation of secure elements--in essence, robbery. we may be able to debate even if stealing categorised elements from the State branch must be considered a criminal offense on an ethical foundation, notwithstanding i do not imagine there is any debate that he committed an unlawful action. for my section, at the same time as secrecy is an unattractive medium via which international kinfolk is performed, i imagine is a reality and necessity that could want to be spoke of.

It also printed that China would not somewhat have North Korea's again. Now North Korea knows that we are biding our time till they give way, and they don't have each body to again them up. which ability they have 2 playing cards to play of their deck: submission or aggression. understanding the psychology of North Korea's chief, I somewhat have a feeling they're going to a minimum of play up the stress card a touch more suitable with those files being printed, quite when you consider that they are insulated from invasion with 8-12 plutonium bombs. in short, i imagine Mr. Assange has both recklessly or deliberately endangered the international via making it harder for international kinfolk to be practiced. with any success he might want to be arrested in accordance to some type of misappropriation or robbery idea, and this entire Wikileaks business organization might want to be performed with.", 9479, "LmB9UM63aa", 0],

	93466 : ["I think I can explain the circumstances that effect such situartions sucha s Iran and North Korea quite well.  I apologize that this will be long, but to fully explain things it must be so. First I would just like to clear up a few things that other people have answered so far. 1) Dealing with Iran and North Korea is not a cover up for Iraq and domestic politics.  That is a load of you know what.  Iraq so far has been costly,  but a realitive success when you look in comparison to other nation building attempts around the world. 2) The US, especially under Bush, is not afraid what the world thinks about us.  In the end we are the sole raminging superpower.  We can survive, for the most part,  without the world and they cannot survive without us. 3) Also Russia DOES NOT OWN THE IRANIAN FACILITES.  Iran is in full control of their reactors and enrichment facilites.  THe facilites were built with international support, largely from the US under the Shah, but Russia only made an offer to run the enrichment and reactors so that they could ensure that Iran was not makeing bombs. 4) The United States is not seen as a bully by most of the world on most issues. Yes many countires and persons are still angry about Iraq.  Besides that the US is praised for its aid to the poor, assiatnce to help the enivronmnet, promotion of human rights and freedom, and all important global economic contributions. 5) To answer why N Korea doesn't tell us to give up our WMDS is several fold.  First Kim Jong Il and The Iranian Presidnet are INSANE.  Kim Jong Il claims he was born in a cabin, built with his own two hands.  The President of Iran: The Holocause is a fake and Isreal should be destroyed.  Let their words tell you how far out in left field they are. Second Iran and North Korea could never take on the US. Third since the US is the only contry to have used nuclear weapons they and Japan are the ones who have the most responsiblility to see other nations do not gain access to them. 6) Unforionatly America is the world's mommy.  It is the truth that we are the international peacekeepers.  The only ones witht he political clout, economic and military might to make the world a safer place. 7) Negotiating WAS the first step.  We tried now for 12 years with N. Korea and almsot as long with Iran to give up WMD's. The world must look to stricter ways to accomplish the goal of a non Nuclear Iran or N. Korea.  Also the UN IS A FAILED ORGANIZATION.  Just read William Shawkrosses Deliver Us From Evil and learn. Ok now I will get into my answer. First is is easy to understand the most of the American public, liberals in particular and the world expect negotiations and appeasement.  They see this as the easy way out of a difficult problem.  Let me just get this out there: Appesement is the worst thing that we can do!!!!  In 1994 the Clinton Administration gave N. Korea a free nuke reactor.  I will say Clinton was not enitrely at fault: 1) He was dealing with Kim Jong Il's father who was not insane, and 2) it made sense at the time.  Negotiating is seen as the best alternative to war and military action.  Believe it or not but even Bush is against unneccessary military action.  The other problems in negotiarting are simple world politics.  It has been in the news since the N. Koreans test fired their missiles that China and Russia will not support sanctions against N. Korea.  This is were the UN and negotiations break down.  Political bias towards the well being of their own countires.  Although it is understandable to look after your own nation first; in order for the UN to work the Security Council must fullfill its purpose to put world safety and peace first. Second the US is not in the best military postition to force either nation to stop.  Althought the US has one of the strongest and most advanced militaries in the world.  That only goes so far.  N. Korea's military is 2 million strong and Iran even greater.  Before military acton is to be used the US has to weigh the consequences.  If we bomb IRan several things will happen: 1) Iran will destroy Isreal with any nukes they already possess or least fund Hamas and other terrorist organizations to attack Isreal.  The US does not want to damage its main Mid East ally.  2) Military action will give weight to bin Laden's claims that the US is on a crusade against muslims because the would make three countires we attacked.  An attack against Iran will cause so much ill will we probably do not want to go forward.  3) Iraq; If we attack Iran the Sunni Shitite split will grow and Iran will disrupt our progress in Iraq with attacks and insurgant funding, and 4) Iran has a strong military.  It multi million man armed forces is capable of defending its homeland very effrecivly.  IF the US attacked we would be drawn into a very costly war in money and human lives. Also on the N. Korean side the same holds very true.  1) North Korea may nuke Japan, and then invade South Korea.  Although we have nearly 50,000 men in South Korea; even with the help of the SOuth Korean Armed Forces we would be outnumbered 3:1 easily.  South Korea would be devestated. 2) We do not have the military presence in Asia to fight such a war. 3) The Chinese are greatly agaisnt it.  And unfortionatly the Chinese in part control the destiny of our economy. So there you have it.  The US cannot rely on negotiations but at the same time military action is wrong.  We are simply between a rock and a hard place.   I would like to say that much of my comments are based on hours of reading on the subject and very little political bias.  I do not wish to offend anyone whose comments I critiqued in the beinging.  All I try to do is offer what is the truth. And God Bless America!", 9477, "23fd5deddf59aaca6745a75af0cc8230aa", -1],

Then - if actual force is necessary - the UN should do it. It's time for the US to take a partial step back and let the UN do it's job. Unfortunately, the USA now has the reputation of the aggressor. The \"attitude\" - from Mr. Bush - my way or no way. Our foreign policy is truly at a low point. We went to war on lies.

The development, networking and call center jobs that you touched on are where the focus should be.  Those are decent paying jobs that left for slave labor.  Heavy taxes and penalties on overseas voice and data transmissions would be about the only thing that could even the playing field. Green jobs aren't successful because we can't compete with Chinese companies.  Solyndra didn't fail because it was a bad company.  It failed because it couldn't compete with Chinese solar companies that are heavily subsidized by the govt.  For some reason, we refuse to subsidize anything but the oil and banking industries.  New technology/industry creates jobs far faster than expanding existing markets.  Look at unemployment numbers when the internet was new for evidence. Taxes have nothing to do with it.  Taxes are paid on what is sold here and not what is built here.   Regulation has little to do with it.  For the most part, it costs far less to comply with regulations than it does to pick up and move manufacturing overseas where you have to deal with shipping costs and import hassles.  High fuel costs actually help in making US manufacturing more profitable than imports. Labor costs have a LOT to do with it.  Chinese workers are willing to work for a tiny fraction of what US workers, and US cost/standard of living requires.  You can house and feed a family in China on $2 or $3 a day.  You can't do that here.  You know--you're living it.  Your replacement when the company moved overseas is probably thrilled to be earning 10 or 15% of what you were making.
