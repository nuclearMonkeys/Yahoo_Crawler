Those is generally rather poor quality by comparison to CD quality, which is the lowest standard for any serious digital format (but vastly better than anything before it). Blame the music industry itself - it started trying to dictate the styles of music people \"should\" like rather than publishing all performers and letting people choose. They largely turned away from bands with real musicians & tried to create their own \"property\" acts, performers they had under contract - mostly just vocalists (or actors) singing to backing tracks performed by session musicians. I believe it was partly a reaction to the many \"Supergroups\" that existed 20 - 30 years ago, that could dictate their own terms to the music companies. They did not want to create any more bands that could become independent and powerful, so no (or very few) more \"self contained\" acts, only their fabricated ones. ", 6294, "T5MR7fNHaa", 2],

Bear with me, I'm a white Australian guy trying to navigate this minefield as best I can... A white South African expat is a very different individual from those that are generally known as \"African Americans\" in the context of modern America. The term \"African American\" has meaning in an American context that does not apply to a white person from South Africa.

	43639 : ["When it comes to Gaza, it's important to know one thing: They have a border with Egypt along with Israel. Therefore, Israel cannot completely blockade the Gaza Strip alone, since Egypt will not be complicit with Israelis enforcing their own policies on their soil. That means that Egypt is blockading Gaza as well, for their own reasons.   Of course, that makes it seem like Gaza shouldn't be able to get anything like arms through... but, Egypt's involvement is actually the reason. Egypt's standards for blockade are actually less stringent than Israelis, so the border along Gaza and Egypt is much more porous. They don't monitor it like the Israelis, so Hamas (the governing body/terrorist organization in charge of Gaza) can dig tunnels to smuggle ammunition in. It doesn't help that the border is out of its way and remote for Egypt, so it's harder to man and maintain for them compared to the Israelis who are right there. Also, it's worth mentioning that much of Gazan weaponry comes from Iranian sources, who actually have contacts in Egypt versus Israel who they're at war with. And the Egyptian populace may be more approving of violence (or \"resistance\") against Israelis versus Arab Israelis who have shown to be more nuanced and pacifistic in pro-Palestinian approaches. As for the West Bank, it's kind of the same, albeit with Jordan instead of Egypt. However, it's also worth it to note that Israeli security forces have a better grasp so things like rockets weren't as much of a concern. Instead, it's smaller things that they smuggle in, like guns and suicide bombs in the older days. However, we also see attacks from these Palestinians using things that normally would go in, like culinary knives and cars.", 6304, "hKgjv1Deaa", -1],

Israel is more in the cyber-security business than virus production, but it wouldn't surprise me if an Israeli is producing a virus. Computer programmers worldwide produce them, after all. Profitability for virus production isn't really seen at the corporate or national level, but rather the individual (or perhaps small group), so if you want to blame someone then you'd have to blame someone specific. Blaming Israel comes off as conspiratorial.  The novel virus SARS-CoVID-19 (more commonly known as \"coronavirus\", despite that being a name for a family of viruses) is shown to have arisen in China. There is no evidence of any Israeli involvement in its development, whether that be natural or artificial. When it comes to Israel and COVID, they only make the headlines for being the first to immune a large percentage of their population in an expedient rate. They're being praised for protecting their population quickly, and this is only done because they're willing to spend MORE per vaccine. The profits are in their population's health, not monetary from the vaccine...which isn't being produced by an Israeli company.  I suppose you can say that Israel gets better ROI since their populace is rather profitable and they'll make the money back by living and working... but that's just a sad route just to take in order to demonize Israel. Not everything bad is Israeli, but many people love to blame a convenient scapegoat. More millennia that was the Jews, and people have ignorantly and hatefully displaced the same blame to Israel.
