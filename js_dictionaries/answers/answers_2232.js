As a certified a veterinary technician I can attest that most veterinarians and technicians are highly educated and skilled in surgery. Most vets and technicians do not loose patients easily and try everything known to man to save pets who are in jeoporady.I understand you want to make sure all was done for your pet and a necropsy will determine that.

I am not Protecting the vet, I am just saying that we tend to want to believe  everything is ALWAYS safe.. when its not , People  Die having simple   procedures  Like Liposuction , Dental work, Laser eye surgury  etc.. It doesnt mean  That the doctor  screwed up... a pure bred  like a whippet is a breed  likely to have heart related issues in surgury , they are small dogs and they're hearts beat rapidly , being put under could easily be enough to stop the  heart... All I am saying is  as sad as the story is,all the money IF you won a lawsuit still wouldnt bring the puppy back...Just because  TV shows imply  CPR and Defribulators  can save lives doesnt mean  it always works everytime. In fact in 30 years I've had One  case where CPR worked and hundreds of nothings.. The working case was a 5 yo girl and the others  teen aged and up... I doubt the vet sceamed to get you thinking  this way..", 10492, "25cOWCThaa", 1],
	117385 : ["In my first college composition class I didn't think I would be able to handle the teacher correcting my first paper - I thought it was perfect! I ended up making a glaring error and, of course, accepted her revision. The case of your using \"Ukraine\" instead of \"The Ukraine\", however, does not seem to be a \"glaring error\" so it also seems normal that you would be defensive of it. I like my current composition teacher's approach - he does not \"edit\" our papers in the sense that he re-words them. He only points out grammatical errors and clears up MLA format mistakes. But he lets ME write my paper, and he makes a good point about his method: If your teacher edits the writing of your paper, whose writing really is it? Unfortunately, most teachers do not edit with this mindset. If you justify your position to your teacher perhaps she may not consider the removal of \"The\" before \"Ukraine\" an error. If she doesn't hear you out (but I don't think many teachers wouldn't listen to your argurment as long as you can support it) I would try not to take it personally and either make the correction for the sake of your grade or leave it the way you originally had it for the sake of your argument; that choice would be up to you.

Some places to consider asking for help:  State Attorney General's office, State Veterinary Licensing Board, AVMA (If your vet is a member).  The reason I suggest pursuing this is not because the dog died under anesthesia-it does happen, and it's tragic.  The reason I would lodge complaints is that the vet is flat-out lying to you, and seems to be trying to cover up either negligence, ignorance, or both.  I'm not so sure someone like that should even have a license.  If others have complained, it's possible the licensing board will perform a review.", 10492, "kRO55DHyaa", 4],

Second,  It is well known that whippets and greyhounds are breeds that are highly sensitive to anesthetic and should always be intubated when undergoing procedures - intubation makes it much easier to revive a dog that goes into arrest during anesthesia.  Most vets are aware of this breed sensititivity and take precautions when administering anesthesia.  It would be interesting to find exactly what your vet did. I would discuss what happened with another vet and find out what questions to ask.  None of this will bring your dog back however. The other problem is liability laws are very limited for pets.  You can ask for any money back that you paid to this vet related to this procedure and replacement cost of your dog, but because dogs are considered property, that's probably the most that you can do.", 10492, "8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa", 7],

More and more they are electing to drop \"the\", but old habits die hard.   The English language is constantly in a state of flux but strict teachers and editors are usually the last to accept change.  If something is able to become inflamed, is it flammable or inflammable?  The world used to be inflammable but that was changed for safety reasons.  Is it possible to prioritize a list?  In the old way of speaking, you ranked the list by order of priority.  In those days \"prioritize\" was not considered a legitimate word. So if your teacher is using the traditional country name, evidently she is unaware that the Ukrainian Government has officially dropped the \"the\".  I suspect if you find a reference to this, print it out, and submit it to your teacher, she will be grateful for the effort you took in setting her straight.  With only minor exceptions, teachers everywhere don't mind being corrected by students, especially if you present it in a non-whining, clearly-stated, properly-documented way.

They were the ultimate \"TEAM\", not a lot in the way of star power but they jelled as a team like no other. So the answer for best \"team\" has got to be the Dolphins of '72.

	117430 : ["Replacing One Bad Smell With Another Placing a bowl of vinegar in the room's that are tainted by the burnt smell can help remove the odor. This may seem like replacing one bad smell with another bad smell, but surely most would rather smell vinegar than soot. Also, placing lemon peels or lemon juice in the vinegar can tone down the vinegar smell, this not only replaces the smell but it actually absorbs the some of the burnt odors. If the smell is in the kitchen, boiling the vinegar mixed with water can speed up the process of removing the smelly odors. Two Spoonfuls of Baking Soda In My Coffee Please Okay, so mixing together baking soda and coffee will not get rid of bad smells, but each can work in it's own way to clear the air. For items around the house that could have possibly absorbed the smell simply sprinkle baking soda on them. This method is particularly good for carpets and rugs, sprinkle the baking soda on the carpet or rug, let it sit for a little while, and vacuum it up. The baking soda can be sprinkled on other items that absorb smells as well but items that can not be vacuumed such as curtains will need to be shaken to get rid of the excessbaking soda or simply rub the baking soda out so there are no white spots. To get rid of the burnt smell lingering in the air place coffee in bowls around the house, or in the room that smells, and the coffee will absorb the burnt smell and possibly leaving a nice coffee scent along with it. Barbecue? Believe it or not charcoal is not only great for hamburgers (which could have possibly caused this terrible burnt smell in the first place) but is also a great odor absorber. Lay charcoal out in the room's in which there is an order, by either putting towels down to set the charcoal on or placing the charcoal in a bowl. This is more effective for small rooms, but for bigger areas can be used in conjunction with warmed lemon juice sitting out (or vinegar as previously mentioned) to aid in the process ofgetting rid of that burnt smell. Following these tips, either by them self or used in conjunction with each other, should help reduce if not completely get rid of those pesky burnt smells.", 10496, "pF1LstGaaa", 2],
