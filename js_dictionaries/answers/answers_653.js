Gov. has to convince enuff voters that they are going to burn to a crisp in a short time span. Problem is they have nothing scientific to base it on. Hence all the distortion of data. They also have to smear the multitude of scientists NOT dependent on gov. who disagree with their falsification. Like Dr Soon and a group who wrote to Trump about allowing access to the actual research from government agencies. Everyone who challenges the unproven dogma is immediately attacked regardless of their past record. . I posted this call for open debate a while back. Immediate response on Yahoo was fake Dirac badmouthing this guy Pruitt with personal assaults. Everything in the clip is perfectly reasonable. I dont care if C. Manson had suggested it. The obvious reason for the smear is to deflect from the real issue. \"Transparency\". If the gov is so certain they can prove their case why do they go to such lengths to keep everything secret, just as they did with Obamacare, and every other power grab attempt they make. The part about \"....elevating the status of minority opinion.....\" That is in line with the, also false, data of \"97% consensus\" which we have debunqued right here (and everywhere else). Gopv is trying hard to convince you that everyone agrees, so they cant possibly have open debates. .", 5475, "zbdlJsqfaa", 1],

	36486 : ["It seems like a backwards question, but climate can definitely have an effect on volcanic eruptions. Certain types of volcanic eruptions, called phreatic eruptions, occur when hot lava interacts with the water table, generating high pressure steam. This may be responsible for some of the explosive eruptions at Kilauea in Hawaii and some of the smaller eruptions at Mt. St. Helens. This is an area of active research, so the details are not clear, but almost certainly the level of the water table--an indirect product of the climate in the region--can affect eruptions. With climate change, the level of the water table can be expected to change also, in some cases perhaps causing explosive eruptions, while in other places preventing them.", 5477, "RhM1p6axaa", -2],
	36487 : ["I moved from here to the Politics section of Answers because Global Warming is just one of the tools being used by politicians - specifically Globalist politicians. For Globalism to be accepted by the masses the Globalists need to dream up some Global issues that need to be addressed Globally. Global Warming was an early attempt at finding a Global issue that people might rally behind. In that regard it has been quite successful. Many environmentalist groups have sprung up and they quite happily confuse pollution with CO2 levels. That has led to Global conferences and Global financing and has found a way for the Global United Nations organisation to get involved. The UN was one of the early organisations created by the Globalists. Yes, they think very long term. We saw the ideas of \"carbon\" taxes and credits that were intended to finance the UN to make it independent and self-sustaining. That struggled somewhat. They already have the IMF, the UN's World Bank and the Bank of International Settlement in Switzerland under their control. So, thinking that the climate issue could be political we can now see things like peer review in a different light. Is it a genuine way for science to check itself or is it also a political way to censor some inconvenient views? We know that the Globalists like censorship because it is practised on a daily basis by the social media companies and Big Tech in general. Yes, Big Tech is not only in the Globalist fold but they were also created by the Globalists. You don't think Zuckerberg did all that by himself do you? The Pentagon's Lifelog project that was intended to find out everything about everybody was scrapped - on the same day that Facebook went live! All those selfies were very useful to test out the facial recognition systems that are now available. Same with science funding. At the top it is a political decision not a scientific one. So the research undertaken can be censored right from the start. So, yes, Global Warming is just one of the tools being used by the Globalists to convert the people of the world to their way of thinking and to grab some funding along the way.", 5478, "BkdgZozJaa", 0],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 5473, "None", 0],
