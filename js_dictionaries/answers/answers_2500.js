This injuries also increase their weight usually, because they can't exercise for very long. They end up giving up, which I agree is the WORST option, but it happens. Btw, the first answer I find very offensive. Not all overweight people eat Twinkies. That isn't how they're overweight. Take it from someone who used to live unhealthily and comes from a family with weight issues. My family doesn't eat out, doesn't eat sweets...it's just an issue. Try to be a little more understanding next time. (Btw, you can't get a handicap tag for being overweight. You must have another health issue..a physical one.) Okay--I've got why you said the Christian thing. lol But how does my answer suck? It's true-- you cannot get a handicap tag just for being obese. You must have some other health issue. I mean, I'm answering your question with the truth..I don't see how this is an issue.", 11082, "mNZCMuSpaa", 2],

I hope we get some good results from this research soon because it's been a LONG time coming.  And yes bush didn't ban the research but he banned federal  funding which is how a lot of companies and researchers get their money.

He believes that it is wrong to deliberately destroy human life, in whatever form, for scientific exploration. A lot of people support that belief.  As for the diseases - while there exists the BELIEF that embryonic stem-cell research will find cures, it remains a belief; it's not a fact and it's years and years away from even determining if they can be used.

ETA: CPS cannot take a child away simply because a parent breaks the law. Are parents with DUI charges subjected to such? No. There might be inquiries but to actually remove the child from the parent's care, they have to PROVE the parent is unfit and/or are negligent/abusive. They also have to prove that uprooting the child and separating him/her from the parent would be less detrimental to the child than leaving him/her in the parent's care.
