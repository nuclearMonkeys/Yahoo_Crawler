	116132 : ["\"Only those who are married in the temple and whose marriage is sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise will **continue as spouses after death** and receive the highest degree of celestial glory, or exaltation. A temple marriage is also called a celestial marriage. \" For us, a temple marriage is about more than just location.  It is performed in the holy temple, by one having the *authority* to bind things eternally.  This means that, unlike other marriages which will end at death (till death do you part), you can remain a joined family unit with your spouse and children eternally, if you remain worthy to you temple covenants.  Its a big...big..deal.  And yes, only members can go into the ceremony.  In fact, not only members, but temple-recommend holding worthy members can be in the temple.  So, you would likely see other members waiting outside as well. The ceremony is pretty short.  Very simple. No walking down an isle, no music,nothing like that.  I will link you to a pic of what the sealing room looks like. For me, the idea of loving someone my whole life, to only be separated at death, when I COULD have easily taken advantage of that amazing blessing from God, seems a rather simple choice.  We are taught in the Bible that there is neither \"marrying nor giving in marriage\" in the resurrection. Some interpret this to mean that NO marriage can last beyond the grave. If you actually read what it says, it only says that marriages cannot be performed at that point.  It says nothing of dissolving ones which were joined with Gods power in his Holy Temple.  And if you think about it, since when is God about separating families and destroying bonds??  Its simply a tradition that people got wrong a long time ago and have clung to.  It is not what God ever intended. 1 Cor 11:11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. Matthew 16:19 And I will **give unto thee the keys** of the kingdom of heaven: and **whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven**: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven It seems rather obvious that God is indeed about the man and woman for eternity, and he has provided the necessary keys and authority to perform that ordinance within His church.   Thats why temple marriage is such a big deal.", 10455, "CPGBpUUhaa", 0],

To be married, you must be celibate for a year first at least. Family and friends who aren't 'worthy' Mormons are not allowed to attend the wedding. The bride must wear a very modest and simple white dress, or they will make her wear one of theirs. Each person pledges themselves to the church instead of to each other. They are not allowed to have a civil ceremony for the people who weren't 'worthy' to attend. If you marry outside the temple, you have to wait at least a year to redo it inside.
