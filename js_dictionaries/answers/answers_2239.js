Set aside. Scald milk by heating in top portion of a double boiler until near boil without actually boiling. Stir occasionally as milk heats. As soon as you start seeing milk bubbles forming around the inside edges of the pot as well as some steam rising, add remaining sugar and stir into milk until dissolved. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Slowly drizzle egg yolk mixture into milk while stirring gently with a wire whisk.

	117747 : ["suffering is a human nature.  we have to face some long sufferings.   In Hinduism, suffering is seen as the result of karmic debt owed from a prior incarnation; we suffer through, building up \"good karma\" to balance out what is, ultimately, our own personal fault.  To Buddhists, life is suffering because we desire; this desire must be extinguished by walking the Eightfold Noble Path of right belief, right aspiration, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right thought, and right meditation.  In Islam, suffering is seen as the result of Allah's positive will (\"Verily We have created man into toil and struggle” -- Qu'ran 90:4).   In Rabbinical Judaism, suffering is seen as everything from senseless to positively willed by God to (for some self-described \"Torah-true\" Jews) a result of Jewish disobedience. It's quite a discipline to react to suffering this way! In mental or physical pain? Drop something on your toe? Putting up with a co-worker who is making your life a living Hell? Enduring the constant ache of arthritis? Standing in line at the grocery and hating every minute of it? Spill the milk? Accept these things in peace, and ask God to use them for the good or for a more specific intention close to your heart. This isn't easy to do but it does make the suffering more meaningful and less -- well, less insufferable.   The life is not an easy.  we have to cross many hurdles.  As you pointed out, we should adopt the long suffering and patience in the righteous. Happiness is not a reward - it is a consequence. Suffering is not a punishment - it is a result. In times of trouble or personal suffering remember that you always have the opportunity to make earnest request to God through your prayers for the strength you need to continue.  Taking greates saints like Ramana maharishi, Ramakrishna paramahamsar too suffered, but they did not care their sufferings and blessed the devotees with a smiling face.  Until the end of his life, Pope John Paul II carried out his mission with energy and clarity. The suffering he did not hide in his last years never altered his determination. Every human have some kind of sufferings and i am also one of them.  Suffering will differ from person to person in various kinds.  my suffering is different from others. Finally, Character cannot be developed in peace and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved. thanks for the opportunity and hope this will help you.", 10511, "None", 2],

	117768 : ["Forever.  We should suffer for others and put up with others.  God might even make you suffer for your own good.  Scripture proves it: 1 Corinthians 11:31,32 - For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. ~ Note: To judge ourselves also means to be at variance with one's self, hesitate, doubt. So think about it and be careful of what you do. The word for chastened also means to punish in order to correct by the afflictions of evils and calamities. So if life seems a misery and you're going through extreme misfortune that brought great loss and sorrow, then it might be God at work causing that so you don't lose your salvation. The word for condemned also means to be given judgment against, damned. Surely that means God corrects and punishes us so that we don't go to hell with the lost people. The word world here also means the ungodly multitude, the whole mass of men alienated from God, and therefore hostile to the cause of Christ. So that proves this passage of Scripture applies only to saved people and not the lost people as well. God does this for our betterment so that we don't become lost. If hard times make you depressed knowing the previous Scripture should give some relief because we know its for the good. Here's some more good news: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God - 2 Cor. 1:3,4. Comforts also means to encourage, strengthen. The word tribulation here also means oppression, affliction, distress, burden. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ - 2 Cor. 1:5. Sufferings also means misfortune, calamity, evil, affliction. So that's just like what the chastening of the Lord is in 1 Cor. 11:32. Consolation also means exhortation, admonition, encouragement, comfort or refreshment. So be of good cheer because God will comfort us even though life may be tough. ~ Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation - 2 Cor. 1:6,7.", 10511, "KgGDlXpqaa", 0],
