Once you get to the hospital, they'll take you to a changing room to put on a hospital gown, put you on a surgical table and cover you with a sheet. They'll hook you up to an IV to administer the sedative. Then they wheel you into the operating room where everyone is cheerful and friendly. If you are still awake at that point, they'll ask you to roll onto your left side and make sure you're comfortable. Then you will fall asleep and wake up seemingly in a few minutes. You'll change in the changing room and go home (have someone drive you). There won't be any discomfort from the colonoscopy itself. You'll be fine. Just remember that the doctor and surgical attendants/nurses do this every day, so they know what they are doing and it's no big deal to them.", 765, "34VXCyvVaa", 0],

Harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.  However, \"unwanted\" should not be in the definition as harmonics are sometimes desirable. In audio systems, harmonics are generally discouraged (distortion). In some audio systems (guitar amplifiers, some hi-fi systems) odd-order harmonics are desirable. Radio transmitters, harmonics are not wanted at the antenna terminals, but may be desirable in earlier stages. In digital systems, you want lots of harmonics (square wave).", 767, "HFuI8oVYaa", 0],

There's plenty of countryside to be found, it's jut that if you're from North America, your definition of \"rural\" is bound to be strikingly different from that of the average European. Because the three countries that you listed are so small, they are heavily influenced by their neighbors. Andorra is extremely similar to the parts of Spain that it borders. The people speak the same language, they eat the same foods, and the two countries are so similar that the average person wouldn't even know they'd crossed an international border going from one to the other. Luxembourg has its own distinct culture, but over the years neighboring cultures have exerted a lot of influence. The situation with Liechtenstein is similar. Liechtensteiners speak German, so the ties to Germany and to other German-speaking nations and regions is strong. The quality of life in some of those small countries is generally quite good. Luxembourgers and Monacans enjoy some of the highest standards of living in Europe. Those countries don't experience the same types of problems that exist in larger countries with larger urban areas. There's very little crime or poverty. While you might waste your own time wondering why they exist, chances are that the people living in Andorra, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg are doing a whole lot better in life than you are. ", 755, "None", 2],

I suggest you keep working out, but avoid the gym for a few days before the test. You can take a home drug test a day before to see if you're clean. Starting on the morning of the test, drink a TON of water. You should be peeing clear, and very often. Keep drinking even if you aren't thirsty. You're trying to dilute your urine. When you take the test, pee a little in the toilet before and after filling the cup. The beginning and end of your urine stream have the most toxins. Don't bother with any of those detox drinks.

	4541 : ["Make sure that you have someone available to drive you home after the procedure is done, because you will be very groggy and it will not be safe for you to drive. You're mighty young to be having bowel issues that are severe enough to warrant this. I'm guessing that your doctor is looking for evidence of IBD (which includes Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis) or perhaps for other related problems. The only way that cancer would be a concern at your age is if you happen to come from a family that has a history of hereditary colon cancer, or are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. You will need to eat a soft, bland diet for several days after the procedure. Stay away from soda and products containing caffeine. It's a good idea to eat yogurt and take a probiotic, because you need to rebuild your microbiome as quickly as possible. That microbiome is what allows you to digest your food, but its most important function is keeping you HEALTHY. Around 85 to 95% of the human IMMUNE SYSTEM is in the microbiome of the gut, and anything which damages or destroys that microbiome (the way the prep for colonoscopy will) leaves the host VERY VULNERABLE to infection until the microbiome is restored. That's why you need to make sure that you eat things that contain beneficial bacteria as soon as you can after you have your procedure. Pay attention to what your poop looks like the first few times you go. If it's black or tarry looking in color, tell your doctor about this right away. Likewise, if you have trouble passing your poop, or you hurt, then the doctor needs to know it.", 765, "None", 0],
