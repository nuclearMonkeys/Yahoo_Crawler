	57637 : ["No. People need to stop blaming everything on \"internalized racism\", \"privilege\" and other such language designed to divide people. Firstly, there are black people who are only attracted to white people, white people who are only attracted to black people or Asians, and so on. People can't help who they're attracted to. I presume you're a straight guy: by the same logic, I could say you have internalized homophobia for not being attracted to other guys, but that sounds ridiculous, right? Not supporting BLM and not supporting racial justice are not the same thing. There are plenty of black people who want racial justice, but who can't stand BLM and reject its worldview, the extreme far left politics of its founders, and the violent riots it caused which led to the deaths of many people. Why should all black people like rap music? That is just as ridiculous as thinking all white people should like country music. You seem to be implying that black people should date within their race, listen to black music, and all have the same political views. That sounds a bit like segregation or apartheid, which I'm sure nobody wants to ever return to.

I am forever baffled by humans (of course if exclaiming this statement the exception is myself). People will even reply but are you not human like that will negate the claim.
