However, a good and true friend is hard to come by and is usually there longer than it took to make or spend the money. However, I am wondering if this is a question of money being borrowed between friends, as you know this is always risky, but hard to resist, because we all want to help the ones we love. Hopefully, you will be able to patch up whatever the circumstances are. If I am wrong, and this is a philosophical question as opposed to a peronal question, I still agree. Okay I just read the bottom part of your question, sorry I should have looked at it better. Again still agree with the question. If we lose fatih, then I do believe we lose it all.

I moved from the east coast, to the west coast, lost every friend I had, although I have a job now, I don't have friends, and I have lost faith that I will make new ones, I have lost faith in myself, I have lost faith that I will ever be happy again (due to mental health issues).  I am in the process of rebuilding my faith, and it is a lot more difficult than rebuilding my financial foundation, and means so much more to me.  Ever since my faith has been on shaky ground, work has become bland, loneliness, guilt, low expectations, and discouragement become routine.  I feel like I have lost myself, and now living inside an empty shell of who I was.  It's like my mind is just begging me to do something, but I do not know how to fix it immediately, it's a process over time.  I agree completely that if you lose faith, you lose all.

How do you get experience? By DOING it.  Everyone thinks Obama has nothing to offer. Do you people realize that he has ran circles around Hillary as a Senator? Look up their accomplishments in the senate and you'll see.  What is wrong with having a 'young' president? Obama is someone who understands what it's like to raise a family in 2008. He sees first hand the school systems, the cost, the healthcare issues. Give the guy a break. King Tut was what? 14 when he died? I think a 40-something man is capable of running our country. And if for some reason, he fails us....we get to try again in 4 years. But I honestly don't think we need to worry about it. He'll do just fine. People forget that the president doesn't have the sole vote on everything. He has a cabinet and advisors to tell him when his plan might not work. He's even said he doesn't know everything and he may have to revise his plans. I think that speaks of maturity. He knows he will be learning as he goes and he is willing to admit that he may be wrong occasionally, but he's also said that he will revise until it works.", 9640, "86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa", -3],

I'm in college right now for graphic design / illustration, so I can really appreciate this kind of art. Plus, the album is awesome. I love all their covers/music. All of them have some kind of mystery or something literal that's relating to their music.  2. The Clash - \"London Calling\"  I'm not sure why I really like this cover, but it's one of those covers that you don't even have to see the band name anywhere and you just know it's The Clash. 3. Saetia - \"A Retrospective\" This album cover is very simple like, The Beatles - \"The White Album\". I'm also a big fan of very simplistic and not overdone covers. Sometimes you don't want a big fancy cover and just something simplistic and not right in your face. 4. The Misfits - \"Collection 2\" The cover is one of my favourite skull logos by The Misfits. I really enjoy all of their covers/logos though. 5. Jawbreaker - \"Unfun\"  Cats are my favourite kind of animal/pet, so this cover I just had to say it :) *I have a TON of other favourite covers too, but that would take me all day and would be a very long post.", 9641, "AQAmnJnlaa", 1],

	98161 : ["Weight loss is (on the surface) a relatively simple thing - less calories going into the system than calories going out. You can control both of these elements and it sounds like you have already taken some good steps to getting fit and losing weight. Things you could try, to increase weight loss, include the following: 1) Increasing the level of intensity of your exercise - for the treadmill sessions you should put a moderate amount of incline onto the machine and build this up. Then look to trying a flat/lower incline but with light jogging, and so on. Walking on a flat incline, unless you have any injuries, or are feeling unwell whilst exercising, will probably not have the desired effect, and you should look to push yourself a little. You will get a sense of progression from this as well. 2) Increase the variety of your exercise - you spend a lot of time doing your yoga sessions/your treadmill sessions, but should think about substituting these with some other forms of exercise to effectively 'shock' your body. Too much of the same form of exercise will not yeild the best results. I would say some brisk walks/cycling/aerobic classes/outdoor activity(even playing with your daughter in the park could be good). As it is, you spend enough time exercising each week - it is how you spend this time that counts. Try new things and see how you get on - this also keeps it interesting. 3)In terms of diet, the obvious things stand - try to eat a well balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. Don't beat yourself up for having some treats at the weekend. See it as a reward for the hard work in the gym. It is a very good observation that you make about eating out - that it tends to be the hardest time to control what you eat. In this case, perhaps look to prepare food at home as often as possible (especially during the week). If you are eating out a couple of times a week, maybe this is the best time to treat yourself to what you like. At least you have clear boundaries about your eating this way, meaning you won't be snacking at home too often.  I would suggest speaking to your doctor/gym trainer if you are going to make any drastic changes to diet/exercise - just to be on the safe side.  Hope this helps, and good luck!", 9646, "Rltn95qTaa", 0],
	98162 : ["I guess you meant 'hope'. You can't lose hope. I tried so hard to loose it. I didn't succeed. It's the emotional response. If you meant faith, such as.. 'faith in a god', I completely disagree. It's quite the opposite. Faith in a god makes everything around you seem meaningless, temporary, and not worth your time. Finally : A friend, if it is a friend, you can't lose him. Like.. if someone accepts you for who you are, and always trying to help you, never abandoning you, that is called a friend. And you can't lose him. The only way you could lose a Friend, is if he dies. Money comes, and money goes. Get used to it.", 9648, "HJJpqRmraa", 2],
	98163 : ["The Bible distinguishes between faith and hope.—1Â Corinthians 13:13. To illustrate: When you ask a dear friend for a favor, you may hope that he will help you out. Your hope is not without basis because you have faith in your friend—you know him well, and you have seen him act with kindness and generosity in the past. Your faith and your hope are closely related, even interdependent, but they are distinct.  To build real faith in the Creator, however, you need something else that he has provided. What is that? The Bible—God's inspired Word, in which he reveals his will and purpose. (2Â Timothy 3:16, 17) “But wait,” some will say, “how can you possibly believe anything the Bible says when you see the terrible things done by people who claim to follow the Bible?” Granted, Christendom has a shocking record of hypocrisy, brutality, and immorality. But any reasonable person can see that Christendom only pretends to follow Bible principles.—Matthew 15:8. The Bible itself warned that many people would profess to worship God yet would, in fact, “disown even the owner that bought them.” “On account of these,” said the apostle Peter, “the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively.” (2Â Peter 2:1,Â 2) Jesus Christ said that these ones were “workers of lawlessness” who would be clearly identified by their evil actions. (Matthew 7:15-23) To reject God's Word on the basis of Christendom's record is like throwing away a letter from a trusted friend simply because the person who happens to deliver it is disreputable. Without God's Word it is impossible to build real faith. It is only through the pages of the Bible that Jehovah presents his side of things, so to speak. He sheds light on such perennial questions as why he has permitted suffering and pain and what he will do about the situation. (Psalm 119:105; Romans 15:4) Sarah Jayne came to believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. (1Â Thessalonians 2:13; 2Â Peter 1:19-21) How? Not simply because her parents told her so, but because she took the time to evaluate honestly all the evidence that shows the Bible to be a unique revelation from God. (Romans 12:2) She observed, for example, the Bible's powerful influence in the lives of those who adhere to its principles. With the help of such publications as The Bible—God's Word or Man's?, she also carefully examined the mountain of internal evidence that proves divine inspiration. It is not enough, however, simply to have a Bible or even to believe that it is inspired. “Faith,” writes the apostle Paul, “follows the thing heard.” (Romans 10:17) Hearing the Bible, not just having a Bible, is what builds faith. You “hear” what God has to say by reading and studying his Word. Even young ones can do this. Paul says that “from infancy” Timothy was taught “the holy writings” by his mother and grandmother. Does this suggest that some kind of brainwashing was involved? No! Timothy was not manipulated or deceived in any way. He was “persuaded to believe” what he heard and read.—2Â Timothy 1:5; 3:14, 15. You too can build true faith—the kind of faith described by the apostle Paul in his letter to the Hebrew Christians. Such faith, he said, is “the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” (Hebrews 11:1) Having such faith, you will be absolutely sure that all your hopes and expectations, including God's promise of a resurrection, will be realized. You will be convinced that such hopes are based on sure guarantees, not on wishful thinking. You will know that Jehovah has never failed to keep his promises. (Joshua 21:45; 23:14; Isaiah 55:10, 11; Hebrews 6:18) God's promised new world will be as real to you as if it were already here. (2Â Peter 3:13) And you will see clearly with eyes of faith that Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and God's Kingdom are all realities, not delusions. You are not left on your own to build true faith. Besides making his Word freely available, Jehovah has also provided a worldwide Christian congregation that is devoted to helping righthearted people build faith in God. (John 17:20; Romans 10:14, 15) Accept all the help that Jehovah provides through that organization. (Acts 8:30, 31) And since faith is a fruit of God's holy spirit, pray constantly for that spirit to help you to develop true faith.—Galatians 5:22.", 9648, "bkTFkHnXaa", 0],

Becoming a man isn't something which happens overnight and even those of your peers whose voices have broken: they aren't men yet - having the outward appearance of a man is not all it takes to make you a man...There is so much more to it.   I do have experience of people making me feel hurt. Somebody in a pub tonight made me feel hurt in fact by telling me I needed to relax. I am not a very relaxed person and reminding me of this normally has quite the opposite effect to the one intended - so I came home to get away from superficial, shallow people who give me unsolicited worldly advice .   You should not be ashamed for crying: even grown men find life too much sometimes and need to let it all out. You pretty much have to be a total psychopath to feel nothing: crying is just a release that helps you put your frustrations to one side and move on.   I know it's hard to believe there is light at the end of the tunnel - you just feel stuck with your situation, but you will come through it. Also, just understand that even whilst your peers might be teasing you, most grown-ups realise and accept that this is a part of your becoming a man and so please stop thinking of yourself as a kind of non-person because you're no longer a child and not yet a man.
