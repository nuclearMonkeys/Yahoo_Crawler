I'm partial to the \"Big Bang\" for the universe coming about, then we can blame gravity for most of the rest and probably abiogenesis for the formation of life  Lot of uncertainty, of course, but that is the nature of the Universe. Religion?  I'm agnostic.  You cannot objectively prove that ANY \"god\" does or does not exist.  As for those that think differently, that is their choice.  ALL \"gods\"/religions are man-made, which you choose to believe in (or none at all) is a purely subjective matter.Everyone has a right to their opinion, just don't ask me to live by it. God/devil?  Obvious, no evidence of deities.  Barring objective evidence,there is no reason to believe in either. Life after death?  Nobody knows.  NOBODY.  Anybody that claims they do know is deluded or a liar.

Just because one holy book or another are regarded by their followers as something more than that doesn't make it so. Fact:  When people stop believing in a god, as happened with Norse, Babylonian, Greek and Roman gods, that god ceases to exist.  That allows the people who believe in current gods to say \"Ha!  Those were false gods, we have the true god.\"  But then the same thing happens to their god eventually and the next set of believers look back and say \"Ha!  Those people who believed in _____ (Jesus, Jehovah, Shiva, etc) were sure silly.  We have the real god now.\"", 10405, "s9QBAkcnaa", 1],

For the record: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or Mormon, but I don't authoritatively represent their teachings.) 1:  Creation.  I believe God used methods mimicking evolution and the \"Big Bang\" to create the heavens and the earth.  The study of evolution, a legitimate science by all means, is basically an exercise in reverse engineering.  God is just science we don't yet know. 2:  I believe in God.  As to atheists; we are all His children, and everyone will be given a fair chance to learn of Jesus Christ.  Those who blow off this chance on earth won't be burning in hell;  see 1 Pet. 3: 18-19 and 4:6 for a description of other opportunities to learn of Christ. 3:  Both are real; the devil is in direct opposition to god's plans for the human race, and does all he can to thwart those plans. 4:  Life after death: absolutely.  We are immortal beings in any event, and the atonement of Jesus Christ has secured that immortality for all of mankind. Thanks for your interest.

	114961 : ["Long ago, I owned a 1970 Fiat 124 that had so many problems I was forced to junk it. The junkyard towed it away and paid me something like $25 for it. I see some ads on TV from auto wreckers that will take the car on an arrangement like that, although I think the going rate is around $50 now. That would be an option for you if you're just trying to get the hulk out of your driveway. I was unhappy with the deal I got on the Fiat because it had 4 good tires on it, that were relatively new. I thought it was worth more. I had better luck junking a '72 Ford Pinto (yep, I had one) that was totaled in an accident. All I carried on the car was liability, and the kid who hit me was uninsured, so I was out of luck as far as insurance was concerned. The driver of the tow truck that took it away from the scene got me in touch with a buyer who wanted it for parts, and I got a couple hundred for it, pretty good money in 1979. Aside from the considerable body damage, the engine, tranny, and other mechanical components were in pretty good condition. If I were you, I'd run an ad in your local paper to see if someone is willing to make you an offer on your Escort. You may be surprised. Although the mill is shot, there are body panels, seats, and other components that would still be worth something.

	114963 : ["Between those 2 I wouldn't sweat it much. The manufacturer doesn't go into it, and for good reason, they want people to be satisfied with the car, so they keep it simple and safe. The W is for winter. 5W-30 for example is a multi-viscosity oil. It is actually 5 weight oil, quite light. And it thickens to 30 weight when hot. This makes starting easier in cold weather. But for proper protection that engine needs thicker oil. This is the main reason they recommend changing oil every 3000 miles. The ingredients that cause the oil to thicken begin to fail by that point, and you will be left with the 5 weight base oil, which isn't good enough. Engine age doesn't mean much. Engine condition is everything. Lot's of stop and go is rough on the engine and a little heavier oil can prolong the life. There's a slight horsepower advantage with lighter oil. I recommend, if you make it a point to pay attention, to use straight weight oil, 30 weight, except in winter, where 10W or 5W 30 is a much better option. This is best especially if you're bad about regular oil changes. You'd be surprised how much additional life you can get out of the engine by doing that. If it doesn't have one now, get an oil plug with a magnet. Incidentally, I had about 330,000 on my '81 Delta 88 and a little over 200,000 on my '93 Bravada (which I broke, threw a rod racing one night) 128,000 now on the Blazer, runs perfectly.

In other words, 5W-30 will be thicker when it's hot than 5W-20. My recommendation:  stick with the 5W-20.
