It is permanent, cannot change, and cannot be other than it is.  All Truths of an Absolute nature exist in God.  Therefore God is Love, and God cannot be other than Love. The Soul is an aspect of God, and the Soul is therefore Absolute Love as well.  When the Soul fails to Know this, it is in denial of God, and this is \"like\" God rejecting that  Soul.  But God is Absolute Acceptance, so it is the Soul that is not accepting the Love of God... not God withholding His Love.  God does not reject the Soul, but the Soul may reject God in an intellectual or Ego sense. In an Absolute sense, the Soul cannot reject God because it is an aspect of God.

	107527 : ["I had a very tough situation with my boyfriend of four years.  He thought he was better than me, because I was the more practical of us two, and he thought he was cooler, better looking, more artistic, deeper, and more intelligent...and he left basic things like working, cooking, and cleaning up to me.  For some reason, I love the guy, but we had our issues. I was waitressing, and he didn't have any friends, so he used to hang out at the pub where I worked.  Well, he started talking to a friend of mine, who was a regular there, and she turned out not to be a friend.  They were sort of dating behind my back, as it turned out.  They were not exactly dating, but they were hanging out and very interested. All of a sudden one day, he basically broke up with me, AT THE BAR where I worked.  I just couldn't realize how ridiculous and degrading the situation was.  We had both had a couple of beers.  He presented it matter of factly like, \"we're not going to see each other anymore, okay?\"  He'd made his decision, and he didn't want to talk about it.  (It was DEFINITELY NOT the way I would have approached the situation....I always have to explain and talk and talk and talk.)  Well, we'd lived together for FOUR years.  Then he just said he didn't want to talk about it.  It was the most horrendous thing ever.  It hadn't sunk in that he was after my friend, and even if he was, not talking about it was awful.  So, I think he thought he was going to  hook up with my friend that night.  But she left.  So, I tried to talk to him and when he ignored me, I followed him down the street.  But, he just walked away and wouldn't talk to me.  What a ***!!$@#)(??!  I wanted to kill him.  Then I wanted to kill myself.  It was a very, very deep situation.  I saw my doctor and for the first time in my life, I was mentally unstable.  I needed sleeping pills and thought I could not go on.  I hung around where I thought he was, I wished to see him, but I knew he was bad for me, toxic. Well, I didn't see him after that.  He was just gone.  I tried to e-mail him, and he wouldn't answer.  It wasn't until 2 months later, when he needed to move again, and needed help because he didn't know anyone else in town, that he gave me a call.  Can you F***ing believe it?  I almost didn't help, but I still wanted him, so I did help, and we hooked up again that night.  (I am very ashamed.)  But he said, \"we are still broken up.\"  (He just took the sex.) Then he went away for summer work, and so did I, because we both had seasonal jobs.  I found someone else that it turned out I was beginning to love, even though I thought I could never have loved anyone else but my boyfriend. Just as I was about to hook up with the new guy, the old guy came back to town, called me up, wanted to see me, etc....this was someone who had ignored me for four months, except for that one night....someone I'd known for five years.  Soon, he was calling me constantly, more than he had ever called me before, was more interested in me than ever. I started seeing him again because I just could not resist the new attention.  But the truth was, he did not hold the same mystique that he once had for me, because he was so cruel...the way he broke up and ignored me was forever etched in my memory.  He scarred me. The other guy was sweet, loving, and it took me a while to see that he actually cared about me, unlike my boyfriend. My new guy slowly took the place of the old guy.  The old guy started chasing after me, for four months or so.  And, lo and behold, I got pregnant with the new guy.  So, I officially told the old guy I never wanted to see him again. But, as it turns out, I have a beautiful baby and I am still friends with the old boyfriend.  We have both calmed down.  He is looking for a new girlfriend.  He is kind of obsessed with some random girl he met and talked to over the internet, but he never did hook up with my barfly friend, or any other girl, for that matter.  He just wanted to hook up with the barfly that night, and was actually a decent person for breaking up with me first....although I really wish he hadn't been checking out my friend in the first place...that was horrible.  And the way he went about it...the way he broke up...was excruciatingly alienating.  It was honest, but cruel.  That type of ignoring leaves no room for emotional survival.  He wouldn't have cared if I died that night, or at least, that was how it seemed. Maybe it was just me projecting my sense of loss onto him...or even noticing his sense of loss of me.  I guess it took a lot of effort for him to treat me that way, because in fact, I did mean a lot to him.  But still, he did it, and it was very mean. Long story short, we were so close for so long that we still regularly talk/ hang out as friends today, but we don't plan to get back together.  I am very happy with my new boyfriend, and especially with my baby!! Me: Libra;  Old Boyfriend: Pisces;  New Boyfriend: Capricorn;  Baby:  Libra!!!", 10007, "Kaudz4Msaa", 3],
