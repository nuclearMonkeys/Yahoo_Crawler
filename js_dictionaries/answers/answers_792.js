First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Chipped vaccines = mark of the beast. Sakashvilli and his wife are the heads of human organ harvesting operation during war in Ukraine. They send organs of civilians and organs of soldiers to Israel and America. Someone is hit by car or bullet, then their organs are harvested and sent abroad. mRNA vaccine by Moderna contains *Luciferin* dissolved with *66.6* ml of distilled *phosphate* buffer solution. ...mark of the beast...that's what it is... all vaccines are chipped all vaccines have cells of aborted fetuses in them Police stop you at checkpoint to check if you're chipped (aka vaccinated) Police check the car; let's say 4 people car but signal only from 3; so, police stop it to chip the notyetchipped; signal from 4 now and police let the car go. This is prophecy by saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov. Notice police chip (aka vaccinate) people at gun point in Africa; so, no more \"it's not gonna happen here\" 'cuz it will soon enough, capisce? Police do it on highways or when you leave your city... basically, you can't leave your city unless you're vaccinated; but vaccine = mark of the beast; so, escape now while your city doesn't have these rules; forgive me. Gov't sprays chemtrails so that people feel symptoms of flu 5G will kill vaccinated; just read Georgia Guidestones' commandment of 500 million max population on earth; it fits with Orthodox Christian prophecy of 7 percent of people left Russian Orthodox prophecy also says that there will be unbearable stench in winter. So, there you go. Russian winters are cold.

Once gassed, you will come out to the police van (waiting for you outside) yourself; you will be taken to underground camp to be tortured for adrenochrome. The rest of the people will be secretly (or even openly) chipped when they sign up for food in closed stores AI (artificial intelligence aka demons) will post on your social media as if it were you doing it while you're on vacation; it will even make phone calls on behalf of you; no one will notice that you're missing in action.", 6342, "None", 0],

Her school may have required great deals of memorization, and the teachers were harder on the kids in terms of emotional support. Even in the early 2000s, schools in the former USSR countries used the approach of embarrassing students by announcing their grades publicly (I know this from one person who studied in the US and changed her university when she went back to her country.)

Sure, with a Korean diploma you'll enjoy limited recognition, mostly here in Asia. China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Central Asia - your diploma would be fine there. But are you going to be looking for a job in Thailand or Uzbekistan? If not, get a real degree. People who come to Korea to study Korean imagine that they'll be working for Samsung, but instead they find themselves going back to their podunk villages back in Mongolia or Indonesia and giving Korean lessons to people who are applying to come here to work as housekeepers. You're nearly 30 years old. Most people your age graduated with a Bachelor's degree in their early twenties. You're already a decade behind.

	44014 : ["International schools are very highly regarded as they demand the highest of their relevant country's education standards/requirements. Class size tends to be smaller than for public schools in the home country. Requirements to teach tend to be far beyond those of mere state certification, as for public schools in the home country, including extensive experience & superior recommendations, so teacher quality tends to be very high. The students' parents tend to be very proactive in ensuring their child performs to standards, very supportive of their child's academic efforts, and very involved in a very wide array of extracurricular & cultural activities. The student body tends to be very diverse from a very wide number of countries, cultures, languages, and most students are multi-lingual & multi-cultural. Compared to costs of other private schools, international schools can be a great bargain.

	44015 : ["Can you be more specific? Where are you? In many countries, an \"international school\" is one that kids who are not fluent in the local language go to, to be taught in English.
