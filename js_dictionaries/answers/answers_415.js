Every one of these people were admitted to a survey, inspected clinically and they were researched to evaluate their respiratory, liver and kidney work tests. This is notwithstanding a total blood picture. Air contamination inside these stations was surveyed. The examination pointed toward deciding the contaminations inside and outside the stations and to explore the wellbeing risks of the laborers presented to these toxins. It pointed likewise to check whether it is significant and pressing to supplant the mazout by petroleum gas as a fuel in these force stations. The outcomes indicated that results of mazout have terrible impact on the climate. When mazout is utilized alone as a fuel, it adversy affects the respiratory framework and the liver. There is a requirement for an imminent report to evaluate the causal connection between mazout side-effects and wellbeing dangers prior to taking the choice of supplanting mazout by flammable gas.", 3664, "Fw5Gkob1aa", -1],

	22759 : ["Have you heard about California's situation this past summer? They had to schedule blackouts for many cities not just because of wildfires, but because the clean energy methods they switched to weren't enough to keep up. If I believed that solar panels and windmills were as effective and not harmful to the environment, I would be all for them. But, please, consider this: solar panels contain multiple heavy metals like lead, arsenic and cadmium, which are all terrible for the environment when they end up in landfills. And solar panels only last about 20 years before they need to be replaced, so that's quite a bit of heavy metals ending up in landfills to leach into ground if everybody switched to solar panels. Also, consider this: are solar panel factories powered by solar panels? Of course not. I am not convinced that solar energy is beneficial to the environment, I believe it is more harmful in the end. I haven't done as much research into windmills, so I would be open to the possibility. But what I do know is that most regions aren't naturally windy enough to provide enough wind-powered energy. So; to answer your question, rural Americans are against solar and wind energy because they know that it's not sustainable.", 3665, "cJyT1EAlaa", -3],

They only put them on the south side facing roofs. And usually they don't even need to even cover that entire section. So a lot of the house is not even covered by panels. And plants don't even grow on the house either. Their are so many buildings and structures that panels could go on where there are not plants.

How can Russian Orthodox get some justice? RussianOrthodoxMetropolitanIoannSnychev was poisoned/murdered by Jew Putin (aka Shalomov) because he refused to work for Jews. KGB poisoned Putin; Putin died in 2007; now doubles (who wear latex masks) pretend to be Putin. Medvedev is David Aaronovich Mendel. Jews murdered Tsar Nicolas 2nd's family; Jews bled them for six hours according to ritual. Tsar Nicolas' family was sacrificed by Jews (they bled 6 hours); their remains were burnt; their blood drank; ashes from remains were sprinkled onto 50 hard-boiled eggs (dish called scido Amafreikis) [50 egg shells were found outside the place of ritual murder]. Also, decapitated Tsar's head (which was grey ... hair turned grey when he saw his kids being knifed).. Ritualistic murder... (blood libel is same thing as anti-Semitism ... a lie by Jews to flee justice). Jews came up that Tsar's family was shot. Tsar appeared to warn that whosoever worships false remains will become possessed by demons (this just happened like a decade ago ... maybe less)… Jews collect heads of leaders because they believe in reincarnation. How about Jews coming up with a mocking holiday April 1st because resurrection of Jesus happened on that day? Jews came up with mocking holidays 23 February (Day of Soviet Army) which was capitulation by cowards in Tsar's army… or March 8 (international Woman's day) which celebrates lesbian/prostitute Klara Tsetkin and Rosa Luxembourg. Three biggest saints in heaven (in this order): Theotokos Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and Tsar Nicolas 2nd Four biggest sinners in hell (in this order from the bottom of hell moving up to our level): Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin You could joke that Marx is a bigger sinner than Engels because Marx fooked Engels but how is Lenin a bigger sinner than Stalin when Lenin was fooked by Zinoviev (even by Bronstein once)? Lenin's brain was the size of walnut. He had syphilis. Was alcoholic. Born from incest degenerate family. Was in insane asylum. Wife Kruspkaya was probably lesbian 'cause what normal woman would stay with him? According to Russian Orthodox researcher Grigoriy Klimov, three stages of degeneracy are 1)sodomy (69, anal, oral, masturbation, pedophilia, incest, necrophilia, beastiality, orgies, hand job, bj, even all non-missionary positions between husband and wife, etc.) 2)insane asylum 3)physical deformities in kids (eyes looking at different angles, wolf jaw, rabbit lip, horse foot, different length limbs, etc.) all these accompanied by drug/alcohol abuse Jews have like six times more degenerates than other nations because they don't have monkhood. Jewish degenerates become politicians (or similar high rank in society). In Germany during Hitler time, it was eight times. Hitler, Stalin (aka Jugashvilli which means son of Jew), Roosevelt, Churchill were all Jewish degenerates. Hitler had many Jewish coworkers as homosexual partners. Stalin was expelled from seminary for sodomy. A few centuries ago, angel appeared to Orthodox Christian community and said not to buy from Jews at bazaar because it's sprinkled with blood (something like that) Those were facts… and now for some Conspiracy Theory: Elimination of comments on Yahoo Answers means that Project Pogo is completed.

It does not put out enough power to be dangerous if I needed to \"work on it\". I have a 160 watt flexible panel in my garage, not connected to anything. There is no power going in or out, it is on the ground, hence, \"safe\". I have 15 solar panels on the roof of the house.
