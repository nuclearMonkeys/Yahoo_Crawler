My utility was always badgering me that I am using more energy than average. 50 KWh/day would be about $5 a day and $150 a month.  My bill is much less than that, and it's not just me in the house. More likely this number is including industrial usage. Setting the number at 10 KWh per person, and maybe 30 KWh per household, You would still need about 5Kw of solar panels.

	63966 : ["That's not a question that can be answered fairly, as the number of solar panels depends on the number of sun-hours the panels receive.  In a cloudy city like Seattle, WA more panels would be needed than in a sunny place like San Jose, CA.  How much it would cost depends not only on the material cost of the panels, but on local labor rates.  Finally, if the 50 kW-h figure includes an electric water heater, a solar water heater can displace about 1/3 to 1/2 of that energy with much less area than solar electric. A good indicator of where solar saves money is simply to look at where people are going for it.  Here is one of many maps that you can find by searching for \"solar parity map\":   .  The default settings of the map are unrealistic for a homeowner.  If you are in California, set the install price to $5 / watt.  (In Mississippi, you can leave it at $3 / watt.)  Now you can look at an example.  Look at the table below the map, and you'll see widely varying prices depending on the state.  For California, note that the savings is 7.7 cents per kWh, or about $3.50 saved per day.  That is enough so that a solar company would be willing to install the panels at zero cost, and let you pay for the lease out of your monthly electricity savings.  That calculation does not necessarily work in other states with less sun, or cheaper electricity. Also understand that the vast majority of solar electric installs nowadays go in alongside the grid, and have no batteries.  Even if the solar isn't putting out much because of night or dark days, the grid there for seamless power.  The monthly electric bills are just lower, that's all.", 8222, "AA11562326", 5],
