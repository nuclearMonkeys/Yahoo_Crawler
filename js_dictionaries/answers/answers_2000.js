The biggest mistake is when you try to use a flat iron before your hair is totally dry. 2. Usually a round brush is best. However it may be how you are holding your blow dryer.  You want to use a defuser that helps \"aim\" the airstream\"  and you always want to aim it down the hair shaft, upwards lifts the cuticle and causes that dull and or frizzy look.  3.I love the paul mitchel super skinny line... It's awesome! 4. I had a chi and I loved it (however it was very pricy) now I have FHI which is a knockoff but just as nice I think. 5. N/A my hair is only kind of wavy in some spots. 6. Online or Barnum 7. Yes it can!  The protectant helps and make sure you give the product time to dry, because having anything damp in your hair will fry it!

A paddle brush, like a big square flat one, will work better than a round brush. 3. Try Big and Sexy Power straight and also their shampoos and conditioners. 4. Personally the best iron is the ChI flat iron, but they run about $100. If thats too expensive go to sally's and get something like it. 5. For me it takes about half an hour 6. I get most of my products from Fantastic Sams hair salons but other salons are good too. 7.

It may be jealousy, insecurity, poor self-esteem, or maybe she just hates women in general, who knows.  But she is damaged goods.  She probably can't even help it.  She likely thinks of everyone else as idiots or impositions.  Perhaps this is a self-defense mechanism so that she doesn't have to acknowledge that she's really become what she has.  For all you know, it may have been things from her childhood. She likely considers your father an imposition on her life.  She somehow thinks life would be better if she didn't have to put up with him.  It's not that she doesn't love him, perhaps, but that, not feeling those warm and fuzzies she used to feel, she is wanting something that no longer exists. The BEST thing you can do is pity her, tell her to get help...and IGNORE HER.  That is that thing that will sting her the most.  Tell her that you love her, but that she is in SERIOUS danger of being completely marginalized in your life if she keeps it up.  That means you will not speak with her, be with her, etc.   Very simply, you MUST protect yourself.  If you don't--and this may be what happened to your mother for all you know--you may wind up being just like her one day.  You do that by drawing a line in the sand and saying, \"You cannot speak to me that way ANYMORE.  You simply CANNOT.  I will not be your verbal punching bag, allowing you to make me feel horrible every time I'm around you.\" Say it.  Mean it.  Then, if necessary, do it.  The first time, you may stay away for, say, double the time you are usually away from her.  The next time, go even longer.  After that, communicate ONLY through others (e.g., \"Tell Mom hello, but I won't be coming to Thanksgiving, etc.\").   Sometimes that is the ONLY way to make her see herself.   BUT... But if it is mental illness, you cannot fix it with your actions.  You will simply have to choose whether to stick around in compassion to her...or stay away in compassion to yourself.  But you MIGHT be able to get her some help.  Just my thoughts.  All the best.", 9935, "ofmiiUP8aa", 3],
	105759 : ["1st of all, maybe you think people/parents can talk anyway they see fit each day. Turns out many are abusers. Actually they are not trying to be tough to make you better or help- they are tricking you. This goes for people at school as well. Words are abuse also. There are many types of abusive people/parents. Some ignore you. Some hit the bottle. Some hit you. And some run their mouths and put you down. THEY are sick and feel great by being mean, and thats the only reason they do it. They are wrong about everything. The typical abuser is close-minded, self-righteous and was also abused themself. Use defense and read many sites on verbal abuse etc. People tear you down or give irratating advice  to build themselves up. They have problems. Remember- Abuse always involves some deception mixed in.  Abuse causes pain mistaken as mental problems- Cutting, OCD etc. Psychiatrists commit fraud in that all disorders are only emotions. For chemical imbalances NO test exists. You dont have what shrinks say you have. Dont tell anyone about any so called disorders. They will only drug you. Jesus name and forgiving others who are wrong is important along with avoiding them. Call or I can- Child Protective Services- Transitional housing to age 21- tell your teacher. Dont tell your parents they wont listen. Learn the truth, forgive, and Get Away from them. Read many many sites under \"emotional abuse\" and \"dealing with bullies\".

It is less damaging because you are not getting the direct damaging heat of the blower on your hair to dry it, it looks healthier when you do it that way as opposed to just blow drying it, and it also lasts longer straight.   I just use hair treatments for dry hair.  A favorite is Pantene.  Those hair straighting treatments only work as good as the way you straighten your hair.   so you could apply the best hair straightener treatment, but if you don't straighten it right, it is not going to come out straight.", 9936, "6b4d98fef410949f9d2e3a948b534270aa", 0],
