Nobody knows anything about that game other than the infamous \"simultaneous catch\" (That was called by the actual replay refs, not replacements by the way). But what they forget is we got around 10 sacks that day and we held the Packers offense to 12 points (or I could just complain about the fact that the only reason Green Bay got their touchdown was because of a really bad pass interference call that kept them on the field when the Hawks could have closed it out but I wont complain since we got even) But yes I would like to play the Packers, this time beat the Packers (AGAIN) without any controversial calls (ON EITHER SIDE) and see what the media and everyone else has to say.", 9578, "Ar7tYE6vaa", -1],

I live in the city though (SF) and over here people do things alone all the time and its considered the norm to see people sightseeing by themselves or going to galleries/museums/coffee shops/bookstores/festivals by themselves. I guess it depends on where you live, but honestly why care about what others think? Try meetup.com and find an activity group if you do want to find others with a common interest or hobby.
