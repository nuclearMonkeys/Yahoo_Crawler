	3666 : ["Summary if you already understand KVL: Basically just start by assuming a polarity and then if it's wrong, you'll get a negative number, and then you just flip the polarity. Long version which explains KVL: Take any point on a circuit. That point has a certain potential with respect to the ground. When you go along the circuit, you will experience different rises and falls in potential as you cross different circuit components, but if we make a full cycle then we have to get back to the same potential at our given point. This means that the net potential gain around any loop has to be zero. This is Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, abbreviated as KVL and also known as the loop rule. So, imagine starting at point a and going counterclockwise. You will gain 14 V going across the first battery, then you will gain 6 V across the next voltage source, then you will lose 2 V going across the next source (mind the polarity) and finally, if we initially assume the unknown source is oriented the same way as the 14 V battery, we gain Vx. We can safely assume a polarity here because if we guess wrong, we'll just get a negative voltage, which indicates that we guessed wrong and the polarity goes the other way. So we have that 14 V + 6 V - 2 V + Vx = 0, so Vx = -18 V. Again, don't worry that we get a negative answer, that just means we need to flip the polarity and the potential difference is 18 V with the positive terminal on the right. Hope this helps, and happy new year!", 604, "UyKQe58raa", 1],

	3673 : ["This circuit will buzz as long as  the thermistor's resistance is low, that is the temperature is high..   U2 is a 555 timer set up as astable vibrator. The 555 timer will output a square wave as long as the thermistor's resitstance is low ( temperature is hot). In high temperatures the thermistor resistance drops and consequently voltage drop across it, this turns off Q1. With Q1 off the reset pin on the 555 timer is high, this allow the 555 to output a square wave continuously.. The 555 output ( pin 3) will go high for about 1.4 seconds and low for 1.4 seconds  T high = 0.693(R1 + R2)C which is 0.693(100 k +1k)(10 uF) T low = 0.693 (R1)C  0.693(100k)(10 uF)  Capacitor C will charge from 3 to 6 volts when the buzzer is buzzing When C reaches 6 volts, pin 7 on the 555 will go low causing the capacitor to discharge and turn the buzzer off. C will discharge to 3 volts (1/3 of Vcc which is 9V). When C reaches 3 volts pin 7 will  become a high resistance, this cause C to charge back to 6 volts (2/3 of Vcc) RV1 is a potentiometer that helps set the sensitivity ie how hot the thermistor needs to  be to cause the buzzer to sound.", 608, "ihl0Dsn9aa", 0],

Note that Q1 is also temperature sensitive. You can run the simulation at different temperatures. The values of R2 and C indicate that he 555 chip will pulse at about 1Hz (100e3 * 10e-6 =1), pulsing the buzzer. A 555 chip looses a volt or so from the 9V battery so the buzzer pulse will be about 8 Volts, depending on the resistance of the buzzer.

	3689 : ["A country's geographical size doesn't dictate that country's economic potential. There are a great many countries that have a large land area and a relatively weak economy, just as there are quite a few countries that are rather modest in size that have a relatively strong economy.  Just as there are many ways to do business, there are many different ways for countries to get money. Some people make money selling fish and some people make money painting houses. Some countries manufacture, others receive a lot of visitors, and still others make money from people conducting business there. Russia is an immense country and indeed has a sizable population, but its population is rather low when you consider how large it is. It is nearly twice the size of the second-largest country in the world, but has a population of fewer than 145 million people. That's less than half the population of the United States while China has nearly ten times as many people. Because Russia is so sparsely populated, the infrastructure is nowhere near as extensive or as well maintained as it should be. And while Russia's territory is vast, she didn't exactly win the geography lottery. Russia doesn't possess anywhere near as much arable land as many other countries when the figure is represented as a fraction of the whole. Much of Russia is covered in forests, much of it is steppe, and there are a great many swamps and bogs. It's difficult to grow a lot of food... There are very few roads connecting one part of the country to another - and those that do exist are not well maintained... Most importantly, despite its size, Russia lacks good outlets to the sea. There are few ports, and nearly all of them are located in places that are not well situated in a strategic sense while the others are located in places that make them unusable for part of the year without the need for icebreakers. Russia is certainly blessed with raw materials and is rich in mineral wealth, but there's very little in the way of manufacturing and even less tourism. There's also very little high finance. Nobody drives Russian made cars or uses a Russian made computer. Few people trade on the Russian stock market and even fewer people vacation to Russia. They manufacture a lot of weapons and produce delicacies like caviar, but that's a drop in the bucket compared to what other countries rake in from what they produce. Perhaps in the future things might be different, but it's doubtful that Russia will ever become an economic powerhouse of the first order. ", 601, "None", 4],

	3692 : ["Luck=Moloch.Gov't is killing you with highfrequencyelectricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbrings them up alevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofTheotokosVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell.
