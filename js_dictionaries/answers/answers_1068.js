	58889 : ["What happens if you take your laptop temporarily downstairs close to the router?  If the signal suddenly gets to top whack then the laptop is in perfect order.  The problem is the distance the WiFi signal has to travel to your room. If the signal doesn't improve then the problem is clearly in your laptop. As others have suggested, using a ‘homeplug' system to extend the Ethernet from the router to your room and connecting the unit in your room to the Ethernet port of your laptop will sort out either type of problem. The suggestion of adding another router between the main one and your machine is not sensible.  If it is definitely the WiFi that is weak upstairs and you cannot use the Homeplug route then a WiFi Extender may be the only workable answer.", 8169, "8O3Cfynhaa", 0],
	58890 : ["Judging from the distance, I suspect a weak signal between the wireless router and your laptop. I can think of a few options. 1. Bring the router closer to your bedroom. You'll to add more wiring from the mains (outside?) to pull the router further inside. 2. Attach another router to the existing router then set it up as a repeater or access point. Position the second router close to your bedroom, on the second floor corridor perhaps so everyone there can enjoy it. Again, more wiring. 3. On your laptop, use a USB WiFi adapter with a large antenna with a stronger signal. If your router has detachable antennas, get the same large antennas for it too. This will increase the signal strength between your laptop and the router. The main disadvantage here is you lose a USB slot on your laptop. 4. Get your own internet connection and install it inside your bedroom. Some internet providers supply wireless/broadband modems/routers that don't need wires. You connect wirelessly to the cellsite tower.

	58894 : ["1. Devices know the difference because you will essentially be connecting some wires to the wrong place if you mix and match. Mixing them will essentially create a long crossover cable, and you may have trouble establishing Gigabit or higher speeds. You especially don't want to mess it up if you'll be using Power over Ethernet (PoE).  2. The plastic is not what is changing. It's the order of the wires in the plug.  3. If you are connecting two devices together with no other splices or cables in between, such as a computer to a router, the pinout standard truly doesn't matter. Where it does matter is if you're connecting it to another cable, such as a jack in a wall. You want to use the same connector wiring standard for both your patch cable and the in-wall cable. Look, if you're really confused by this, just think of it like putting batteries in backwards. ", 8171, "bdfOtV7maa", 0],
