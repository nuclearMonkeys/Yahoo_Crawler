	62395 : ["No. Currently, our most powerful lasers are at best capable of shooting down an ICBM over a range of a few hundred kilometers. However, they do this merely by heating the surface of the ICBM to the point where it cannot withstand the aerodynamic stress and breaks apart in the air. However, the space rocks you're talking about are not in the Earth's atmosphere, so they aren't undergoing any aerodynamic stress; they're not hollow metal machines, they're just lumps of rock that don't really care if a small portion of them gets melted; they're far, far more massive than an ICBM; and they're hundreds if not thousands of times farther away. We would need a vastly more powerful laser in order to shoot them and blow them up either from the Earth or from orbit, and the former is actually more realistic since the laser device would be far too massive to put in orbit with current technology and a laser with that much power wouldn't have as much difficulty going up through the atmosphere than a weaker laser would (not only does it just have more energy to pass through, but it would also heat the air more and push it out of the way, making a 'path' for itself through the atmosphere).", 8161, "None", 1],

	62408 : ["I come across homilies all the time that speak to one situation or another.  When I was teaching, I looked actively for easy-to-remember and catchy ways to state common themes. One of the most effective was one I used with a group of difficult students in an alternative setting.  The advice, set up as a poster on the wall, was \"Do not confuse your situation with your destination.\"  These were kids who were in a restrictive and isolated learning environment because they had been fighting, drinking, truant, or in trouble with the law.  That was the situation, but I worked with them to see that their own actions would determine what happened next - they could be in control of the destination to a degree that they could not control the situation. Another poster was a response to the bickering that resulted when children would taunt one another.  I'd point out that their telling me I have purple hair didn't actually MAKE my hair purple.  That one wasn't as \"catchy,\" but it was useful: You can not hurt me with a lie, for a lie holds no real weight. You can not hurt me with the truth, for I seek enlightenment, and truth is the only pathway. When we discussed this one, the kids would say that when someone told a lie about them, it hurt their feelings or made them mad.  I asked why should it, since a lie reflects on the one telling the lie, not on the one being lied about. They said, \"Well what if someone calls you a \"B\" --wouldn't that make you mad?\"  I said it might, but not for long.  After I looked at my behavior I could decide whether or not I was in fact being a \"B.\"  If I was, then I should probably change my behavior.  If I wasn't, then it was the name-caller's problem, not my own.

	62418 : ["This is a phenomenon that has been observed and evaluated. Statistically, there appears to be a 47.3% (+/- 4.4%) higher probability of measureable precipitation within 24 hours after an automobile has been washed than could be explained by chance alone. This also applies to pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs, but there is no apparent correlation to large trucks, busses, or commercial vehicles. Some studies (Sanderson, 2002) indicate that the color of the auto is important in this relationship, with darker colors (black, dark blue, dark green) significantly raising the probability. However, further study is needed to determine if this is indeed the case, and an additional reaserch grant will be needed to fund this important research.  Several hypothyses have been advanced to explain this. The most credible, and the one to which most washologists subscribe, is the Yakahara-Atwood Theory from 2001. In their monumental work \"Effect of Auto Moisture Recycle Effect and Its Effect on Moisture Recycle,\" the authors discuss the events involved in auto washing within specifically defined geographical areas and show, using a stunning mathematical model, that the increases in absolute humidity caused by use of water sprays in an area will result in what they call 'a superattenuated localized moisture imbalance'. This, coupled with a temperature drop of no more that 5.25 degrees Kelvin, will lead, they theorize, to a 'supersaturated auto atmospheric condition.'  In turn, this will result in precipitation.  Other theories exist, but are given little credence, except perhaps that of Murphy, who succinctly states:\"If anything can go wrong, it will.\" Additional reasearch grants are vitally needed to support this basic scientific effort.

	62425 : ["I heard somewhere that the \"apple\" was actually a quince.   I don't usually copy-paste stuff, but this is fairly interesting:  Though the forbidden fruit in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her. This may have been the result of Renaissance painters adding elements of Greek mythology into biblical scenes. In this case the unnamed fruit of Eden became an apple under the influence of story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides.[15] As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. In Latin, the words for \"apple\" and for \"evil\" are similar in the singular (malus—apple, malum—evil) and identical in the plural (mala). This may also have influenced the apple becoming interpreted as the biblical \"forbidden fruit\". The larynx in the human throat has been called Adam's apple because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in the throat of Adam.[15] The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply sexuality between men, possibly in an ironic vein.[15] The idea of an apple being the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil with English speakers may have been helped by the fact that apple could also be a generic word for fruit in Old English,[16] the word being used in various commentaries on Genesis.", 8164, "HVM5aXa8aa", 0],
