So I was exposed to calypso, reggae, 70s top 40, 60s/70s R&B & *some* rock. For me, rock came along a bit later by watching reruns of The Monkees. After that, I discovered the Beatles. Teens- discovered prog rock & still love it. recently- indie rock So I guess now,  my ears are quick to pick up on  (almost) any band delivering melody, vocal harmonies, & catchy hooks, or more complex music that prog rock often delivers.

I listened to more classical in high school, supplemented with a healthy dose of Celtic music (traditional and modern), along with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein before jumping straight into classic rock.

If too much nitrogen is applied to a lawn it causes it to burn, just as if you were to over fertilize it. That is why the grass around the edges is very long and darker than the yellow spot.

	127915 : ["As a kid, I was influenced by my older sister who listened to the Monkees, The Beatles, Gary Puckett & the Union Gap, Three Dog Night, etc.  I do remember songs from the radio like Spill the Wine by War and of course the most played song at that time, American Pie by Don Maclean. However, as a young teenager, thank god for my older brother.  When he would visit home from the army, he would hand me music to listen to.  People like  na, Rod Stewart, The Allman Brothers, David Bowie, Crosby-Stills-Nash and sometimes Young, The Grateful Dead.  I still am very influenced by these musicians today.  My 2nd oldest brother, who always had a strange sense of humor, indroduced me to the likes of Frank Zappa, Fireside Theater, Monty Python (yes, these guys were on albums).  His friends introduced me to Pink Floyd, Herbie Hancock, Yes, etc. As a single mom, I took an interest in what my daughter listened to and believe me that was hard.  She liked a lot of rap and such but as a parent, I had to be active in her interests.  I listened to Eminem, DMX, Insane Clown Posse, etc.  I just wanted to be able to tell her my concerns about that type of music.  How their talk of women wasn't what she should follow.  But I never took her music away.  Zappa taught me that music is expression and expression are words.  If you don't like them, it's okay.  But don't censor! I still listen to the music of the older rockers but my nephew has introduced me to some great bands like Mars Volta, Karate, Elliott Smith and such.  It's fun to discover new musical sounds even though my friends don't like it.  And I have to admit that over the years, I have become a real metal head too.   In closing, I will leave with some words from David Crosby.  \"Everybody's saying that music is love.  Everybody's saying it ya know\" :)", 10952, "e0EG293naa", 1],
