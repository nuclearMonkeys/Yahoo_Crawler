	82560 : ["Obesity. It is a problem in the Western World but is in particular a serious problem for the states. I mean spray on cheese!! How bad is that stuff for you?? A fitter healthier person is more productive, less stressed (Emotionally as well as physically) and can be more beneficial to the community (Able to serve in National Guard for example). The USA is the most obese nation in the world and has an average of 1 in 4 people who are seriously obese. Less Obese people mean more productivity (Less sick days, can work faster/more efficiently), less tax outgoings (Decrease in medical costs), More people available for armed services (Fit, nearly fit enough to pass fitness testing), not to mention many more positive spinoffs for communities, and therefore the nation as a whole. I suggest more education on what is good for you to consume, possible extra tax payments for the seriously Obese (To offset the huge medical bills and provide incentive to not get fat) and possible subsidy for healthy activities like the gym to promote fitness & exercise. I think it is the one thing that is currently holding your economy back and thus you are a superpower, just not a healthy one.", 9108, "None", 1],

The American people still haven't found out the real cost of this new law, the rumbling has began. The evil large corporations that are America are releasing their costs required by law for this monster, and it doesn't look good for the promises of savings.

	82579 : ["(Judging from most of the responses here, a lot of Americans think how you want to live is *their* business, too.) So, back to your question... I think politicians use social & religious issues like red flags that they wave in front of the voters to distract them from the fact that they're living in a crumbling empire. Debt is out of control, the infrastructure of the country is rotting, the shopping mall has replaced the factory of the engine of the economy, millions of people are stuck in McJobs that are going nowhere -- and we're told that our problem is moral degeneracy. I was out of the country when George W. Bush was reelected in 2004. People in Latin America were shocked, they were just simply dumbfounded: \"How could people reelect that guy after he lied to them and dragged them into an unnecessary war?\" It was only when I got back to the U.S. that  I discovered that the burning non-issue of gay marriage had actually been used in the campaign, because it wasn't covered a lot in the foreign press. Which is more important in the minds of voters: letting two people get married, or an unnecessary an unjust war that's killing their kids and costing them billions? I think most people outside the U.S. would be surprised to know the answer... As you follow this year's campaign, notice all the burning non-issues people are talking about? Obama's pastor, McCain's stand on abortion, etc. etc. Voters love this stuff, because these are simple issues they can understand: who smoked marijuana?, etc. And politicians love it, too, because it distracts people from the real issues -- which they don't want to talk about.", 9108, "BOxOdhVjaa", 1],

If you are going to bash a political party, please realize that one party is not responsible by itself.  If you are going to bash Bush, bash Coolidge too, because, like Bush, he oversaw growth and then saw it slip away in October. I also do not believe such economic recovery comes from the top outside of taxes.  Businesses run this economy and the government should realize that. EDIT Reality has a Liberal Bias: Do you really think Bush is responsible for 9/11?  The thought itself disgusts me.  Must I say that a Dutch film director did more to stop the 'Underwear' bombing than this administration?  It was a sneak attack, don't blame it on Bush.", 9104, "ClHAcNACaa", 2],
