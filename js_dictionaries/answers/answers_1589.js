Obama -  A wolf in sheep's clothing leading the lambs (Obamites) to slaughter. The wrong person to put in the White House.

A person that changes his stance or belief to win support.        not a Muslim and now wearing a flag pin.

Then Hillary took a slight win and everyone thought Obama should instantly go VP.  We've still got plenty more territory to cover before anyone says the word \"VP\".

Our media said Obama was winning the primary and failed to mention Dean had tossed Fla. and Mi. votes and with those votes Obama was losing. People like to be on the side of the winner. The media is telling us the world wants Obama as US president to influence Americans to vote for Obama. Obama has been created and made by the same guys who own the media and want a world at war. The people of the world do not want a world at war. Obama said - the danger from Iran is grave, it is real, and my goal will be to eliminate this threat. Since the people of the world don't want world war, and since Obama has said he would may eliminate Iran militarily, logic dictates the people of the world are not in favor of Obama. The statement is media propaganda to throw the election to Obama. Obama is one generation away from being a natural born \"Sunni alQueda\" Kenyan.
