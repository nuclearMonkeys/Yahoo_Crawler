	8355 : ["100000% scam. Reviews are sometimes faked. And anyone can open a website. That doesn't mean it's legit. There's pretty much every single common red flag I can think of just based on what you included: 1. The industry doesn't work that way. Simple as that. No professional production or person hires or auditions beginners or amataurs, only HIGHLY-trained and HIGHLY-experienced people with an impressive resume to back it up. So no legit agency would even consider someone who's a beginner or amateur either. 2. No agency picks up clients through email, phone or fax or whatever. At best they spot (your daughter) at a showcase, where she performs after and while studying acting. But agents almost always get referred to by someone who knows them, someone (your daughter) has worked with and impressed (like a director, producer, an acting teacher or even a fellow actor). For that, (your daughter) would have to network to get someone to agree to refer her to an agent. She'd need something to show (a show reel, a resume with a long list of leading roles she's landed, etc.) One or a few successful auditions is not enough. It doesn't come down to talent. There's much more to it.  3. Legit agencies never ever get paid upfront. They get paid only if and when their clients book a job. They take %. Which is also why they're very picky as to who they take on. They can afford to be because there's far more people wanting to be actors than there are roles. 4. You need to keep in mind that this is show BUSINESS. No one is in this to make your dreams come true, they're in this to make money. Professional productions invest tons and they need to know it's in the hands of people who know what they're doing. They need people who have already demostrated that they can book jobs and work at a professional level. No one has the time to start teaching (your daughter) everything on the spot. 5. That's just not how it works. How it works is, when a new project starts casting, a casting director is hired. The casting director reads the script and then creates a \"character breakdown\" specifying the roles they're looking to fill based on the age-range, looks, ethnicity, special skills, etc. Then they approach the best agents in town, agents they know and trust. The agents go over the breakdown, go over their client database, then submit (send the headshots and resume) to the casting director the ones they believe may fit those said roles. The casting director then invites to audition only the handful *they* believe may fit those said roles. Those actors will then come in and audition as many rounds as needed till only one gets each role. Casting is not done randomly. It's not done for actors, to discover talents, actors come to them when there's something that they may be right for (through an agent). 6. Acting, singning and dancing are 3 different, seperate fields, which require different skills, backgrounds, training and talents, and so they require different agents. By the way, modelling classes is more or less a scam also, but let's leave that for now. 7. Legit agencies don't run classes. That's not their job and, like I said, they only take people who are already highly-trained, from the best acting schools in the country and not just any acting classes. That's how scams make money. That's what they tell you the money you pay is for. Aside from those flags, understand that part of the scam is looking friendly and giving fake compliments to support their lies (\"your daughter is so talented, we'll turn her into a star!\") and  throwing at you big names they represent or work with. Trust me, every single person they see \"gets accepted\" or \"gets a callback\". At the end of the day, it doesn't matter how talented and beautiful (your daughter) may be. If she (or rather her parents if she's a minor) doesn't run her career like a business, like a product to be marketed and sold, it'd be unrealistic to believe any industry professional is going to waste their time and money. You were right to question it. RUN. If you've already paid, for anything, see if you can get your money back somehow and file a complaint with the police. If your daughter is interested in acting, and I mean not for the unrealistic notion of becoming rich and famous, start doing the research with her. Learn all about the business side. Learn about the realities of it. Then, after the Coronavirus, get her into some acting classes. She'd need to make sure she has the talent, the passion for the craft, and the mental and physical capability to pursue a professional career. After that, if she has what it takes, look into good acting schools in the Los Angeles area. Schools where well-known and respected professional teach and successful people graduated from. In addition, she can start building her resume by auditioning for things that don't require an agent, like student and indie films. In addition, she should join or audition for youth or community theater. She could also produce her own projects. She should also take vocal and dance lessons and any other skill she can master and then add to her resume to give it a boost ( like horseback riding, ice skating, martial arts, acorbatics, dialects, etc.) Building a resume that will impress potential legit agents takes about a decade. It takes a huge investement of time, money and work. Understand that. Also understand that until your daughter is 18, most of it will fall on you, the parents. But if you're all realistic about it, becoming a professional actor may be a realistic career goal for your daughter. Note that since the vast majority of professional actors will never get more than a few minor roles, on minor productions including things no one's ever heard of, including theater, your daughter should also get a \"normal\" day job she can do alongside acting. Make sure she realizes all that and is willing to work hard. That she's not just looking to get discovered, to be famous. That she's not in fact in love with the fantasy. That's the difference between a dream and a goal. Make sure she NEEDS to ACT. That's how it really works. Good luck!", 1339, "None", 6],

	8374 : ["I think you're mixing up a couple things here. There have been 3 stimulus payments which are officially called \"Economic Impact Payments\" (EIP) In all 3 cases the payments are structured as a one-time tax credit but the IRS would use the previous 2 years to send out an advance payment before tax season. Then there's an opportunity on your tax return where people can claim any stimulus money they didn't get during the advance payment for one reason or another. EIP#1 was $1200 per adult plus $500 per child under 17 against 2020 taxes. Dependents 17 & older did not generate money for their parents and did not get a stimulus of their own. EIP#2 was $600 per adult and $600 per child under 17 against 2020 taxes. Again dependents 17 & up did not qualify. EIP#3 was $1400 per adult and $1400 per dependent regardless of age against 2021 taxes. this time ALL dependents generated an extra $1400 for their parents (or whoever claimed them). When your tax software asked you about stimulus payments it was asking about EIP1 and EIP2. You didn't get either of those, so you would qualify for the recovery rebate credit (RRC) for $1800 (covers the $1200 and $600 payments). This is just added to your 2020 tax refund. So you won't get a separate payment, your refund is just $1800 larger than it would have been without any stimulus packages. EIP#3 is for 2021 taxes, so it would not have been on any forms or software for your 2020 return. That $1400 check you received was because the IRS just processed your 2020 return, realized you're now independent, and sent you the advanced payment for this stimulus. You're free to cash that check and spend it however you choose, but you will NOT get another $1400 when you file your 2021 taxes next year because you've already received the full amount. Also, it sounds like your parents are telling the truth. $2800 would have been the correct amount for a married couple with no dependents for the 3rd round.", 1351, "Jvx658HFaa", 0],
