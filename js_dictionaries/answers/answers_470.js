When you dog sighs it is an emotional signal terminating an action.

Any dog needs to know where it can go to get out of the kids way,,,like a crate or dog bed and the kids need to know they do no seek out, climb in or touch the dog when it is in there...as most dogs will retreat  to avoid confrontation/reaction, same with feeding, kids need to learn to leave a dog alone while eating... however kids brought up with dogs learn from early on about care, they get lots of excerise and family time together so build better social skills", 4105, "afcLu9YMaa", 1],

Larger dog like the Goldie have never on average lived to be 16-17 years old and I lived through the 50`s and 60`s and most lived to 11-13 years old , more or less the same as they do today, which is on average 10 - 12 according to statistics on the breed. There is always an exception to the rule in every breed and my last GSD lived to be 15 years old , when the average lifespan of the breed is 9-13 years old.  A dogs life span depends on its genetics and if they are lucky enough not to contact a serious disease etc that proves fatal. However I must say that dogs in the past `appeared ` to be healthier overall than dogs of today and certainly suffered less allergies and cancers. But...then again there are way FAR MORE dogs kept as pets now than there were 3-4 decades ago. Also a lot more information about dogs and their care etc, and forums via media and online. So media exposure about them is a lot more widespread. Dog ownership has rocketed drastically over the last 2 decades, spurred on by money making BYB`s and puppy farms who have cashed in on this ridiculous designer dog phenomenon, which results in badly bred dogs that may not live half as long as a properly bred dog.    So it figures that there will be a lot more deaths statistically.

	26056 : ["With cats, a very important consideration is having a high perch to retreat to.  Put a shelf at least in every room that the cat can reach and the dog can't.  Cats can actually enjoy being chased, but they like to escape at the end.   Your dog is likely to be quite reasonable with a kitten under these conditions.  Being a female, she will recognize a kitten as a baby, and won't be too rough on it.  Even male dogs recognize a baby, and are not too rough on them.  So then if the kitten can get away, it should be fine. Before you bring the kitten into the house, you might take a cloth and rub all over it, especially the cheeks and chin, and bring that home to your dog, to get used to its scent.   When you bring the kitten home, talk to the dog about it.  \"Look what I brought you, a cute little puppy.\"  The dog will take its cues from you.  But make sure to affirm the dog's status as first pet.  If the dog is confident that she is first, she will be more eager to follow your lead. And this is important - get your dog tired at least once a day.  Play ball if nothing else, until she is tired.  ", 4107, "54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa", 0],

	26065 : ["When a dog barks and doesn't stop, it is considered a nuisance. It is not really \"normal\" for a dog to bark unless there is something wrong. If you notice other dogs barking, that is because they are also unhappy or worried. Dogs do not draw attention to themselves under normal circumstances. The advice from a dog owner of many years/decades is to keep your dog in the house. That will keep you from having complaints. This is what you want to avoid.The reason a dog will bark while outdoors, is it does not want to be there. Because dogs are pack animals, they want to be with their \"pack\", which is you and your family. The pack takes care of one another and comforts one another. Without the pack, the individual dog is vulnerable to possible threats, and the dog will defensively bark, or simply bark because it is lonesome.In a dog family, if a dog is separated out from the pack, it is considered punishment, and that is because this makes it unsafe for that particular animal. That animal knows it now lacks the protection of the rest of the pack.Keep your dog inside. Of course - when you go and retrieve it from the shelter and hopefully you have already done that! Your dog would be quite frightened at the shelter. If your dog misbehaves while inside the house such as accidents, etc., then cage train the dog until she is house trained. Use praise and treats for that along with the cage. Always use a dog cage in a positive manner, and NEVER as punishment. Hershey deserves to be with you, her family, and that is why she is barking. She loves you and wants to be with you. If you are unable to keep Hershey inside, then find a home for her where the new owners can do that. Hershey needs you and that is what she is saying, when she is barking from outside. She is afraid and wants to be with you. Do not use a bark collar, by the way. That would be terribly unkind to Hershey, who already thinks she is being punished, and feels threatened from being alone. We kept each of our dogs inside. We had one or two dogs at a time and owned: Lab/Shepherd; Lab/Border Collie; Border Collie; Boxer/Pit mix; Malamute mix. Each dog lived to about 16 to 17 years of age, and barely ever barked, except maybe someone coming to the door.", 4059, "p7ZdohGTaa", 8],
