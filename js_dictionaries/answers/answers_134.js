They're both super sexy though if you ask me. In Andrew Brannigan's case, there were those stories of women having spontaneous orgasms reading his work, and of course no one can forget about the spate of people immolating themselves because they felt as though they'd never be as good as him, but I'll disregard that here and say that MAYBE I'd rank him between Louis-Ferdinand Céline and Nabokov, just my opinion.  No mention of Hemingway or Steinbeck? I mean, you've covered the \"manly\" angle with Brannigan and Céline and London and McCarthy, so I guess that's okay. You also left out the wonderful Murakami. Word on the street is that Brannigan's Korean wife hates Murakami, but because of his time in the French Foreign Legion he and his kids discuss him without her knowledge, which is intriguing.  Also, what about Bukowski and Fante?  You're obviously a genius, but not Brannigan/Céline level genius. ", 1097, "None", 0],

	6742 : ["There's a quote that is attributed to Einstein (he didn't actually say these words but rather expressed the idea a little differently and, ironically, not as simple as the concise quote*). I usually hate these fake Einstein quotes but this one is relevant to your question, not because it's from Einstein (more or less) but because of what it says: \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" The point of non-fiction books, especially popular science, (I assume this is what you are talking about) is that those reading them learn things. If you read such a book but don't encounter anything you didn't know already it was a waste of time for you to have read it (if you read to expand your knowledge on the topic discussed). That's not necessarily the book's fault; it could also be that you are already well-educated on that very topic. Most things can be discussed on various levels of detail. You wouldn't subject a 5-year-old asking you questions about the world to university-level lecture (I hope you wouldn't). At the same time, one expects more substance in a non-fiction book than what you would explain to a child (unless of course this is a book targeted at children). Authors of such books have to make judgment calls of how complex, how detailed, they want the book to be. If they present the material in too complex a manner, they might lose their audience; if they \"dumb it down\" too much, the book might not be interesting for those who buy these books to educate themselves further. They need to find that sweet spot in the middle - which of course doesn't exist because every reader is on their individual level. Many books therefore start with some basic concepts before they tackle the real meat of the book in order to get those unfamiliar with the field to a point where they will benefit from that new information. They will still lose some readers along the way; or those readers will hang in there till the end and realize that they haven't quite understood everything but will nevertheless come away with a rough idea of what the author wanted to tell them which is much better than where they started. The book \"A Universe from Nothing\", written by theoretical physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss is great example. Before he talks about the book's actual topic (how the universe could have arisen from nothing), Krauss first explains concepts that are necessary to contextualize his theory. The book gets increasingly complex as you would expect when dealing with such a topic but I think that most readers would benefit from reading it, even if not everybody will fully understand all of it. Finally, let me comment on what you were told. Frankly, I don't think it's accurate to sa that you don't understand something if you can't simplify things. Some things cannot be simplified. Or rather, each simplification is a further misrepresentation of how things really are**. I would go so far and say if somebody is (only) capable of talking about a topic in the simplest terms, they do NOT understand them. From personal experience, I will say that when you try to teach others, when you try to explain a concept, it is then when you realize how well you understood them. There is the concept of lies-to-children**, a pedagogic approach where you deliberately misrepresent something in order to teach a subject; as the understanding of the student grows, those \"lies\" can then be reduced approaching the real understanding of how things work. Now, the purpose isn't deceit; this technique is used get students gradually to higher levels of understanding. We do this intuitively. And, I would say, it makes sense to do that.If you are asked what shape the earth has, you might say it is round, or spherical. If you say that, without fail, some smarty-pants will say that the earth isn't a sphere but a spheroid! But that isn't true, either. Because of the heterogeneous distribution of mass in the earth, it's gravitational field isn't equal which influences its shape so that it is \"shaped like a lumpy potato\" as the New Scientist puts it***. But even that isn't entirely true, either. You might be familiar with the question \"How Long Is the Coast of Britain?\" which is the title of a seminal paper by mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot that discusses what would later be called fractals. The idea is that as you \"zoom in\" the coastline becomes longer and longer. But even that view doesn't fully capture the physical reality. One could perhaps argue that one cannot assign any shape to the earth because at a fundamental level, all matter might be effects of quantum fields that do not have a precise boundary at all. The nature of matter is still not fully understood but you don't need to get to the level of quarks (or even superstrings) - just \"looking\" at atoms alone is sufficient. Atoms aren't those solid balls that some chemistry molecule models make them look like; they are more like force fields. They do not have a proper surface. So any object made out of atoms (such as the earth) will not have a surface if you zoom in far enough. But of course, while this is far more accurate than saying \"the earth is round\", it is often not really helpful to think in these terms. It is unnecessary complicated in most contexts. That's why you start teaching children orbital mechanics but far simpler models, even if they are technically wrong. They are \"true enough\". Almost everything is a lot more complex than can be expressed in one simple sentence but usually it doesn't really make sense to dive deep into all aspects. Again, it is a judgment call at which level, to which depth, an author wants to discuss a topic. All of these things make it that most books are longer than they would be if they presented their topics in the simplest possible ways. Of course, some authors are better than others; if you have the impression that a book keep rehashing previously presented information then either your understanding of the material is far superior to what is expected from the target group or the book is just not well written. *  **  *** ", 1093, "fgRkfYcoaa", 1],
