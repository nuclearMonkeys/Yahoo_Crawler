All that I was, was in the flesh, all that I am today is because of you and I know you will finish your work as you have always been faithful in your promises. Thank you Father for creating me, ……..Jesus, for the cross, and  not leaving us alone, but gifting the Spirit to those who receive.

Although I miss the Koran connection, since it is my understanding that the Koran (the spelling that Yahoo Answers spell check seems to approve of) was written Circa 700 AD, (CE if you prefer, as the Jehovah's Witnesses like to use)  Apostle Paul's writings teach a great deal about what it means to be a Christian. Giving thanks is very important. Although I would never propose to sit in judgement of that for which you need to ask forgiveness. Only you and God know what you may or may not have done that is sinful.  But it would not hurt anyone to be a little more grateful each and every day for EVERYTHING. Even the things that happen that we do not understand. Perhaps Especially those things. because the things that challenge us the most are the things that teach us the most.

Just as a 12 year old is not ready to handle the responsibility of a newborn.  I am sorry that parents try to discourage this activity by acting like it is evil, I think they are trying to protect their children as best as they know how.  Parents should try to instill self control, because as you have pointed out, human want to do things before they are ready.

	90802 : ["Contact legal aide in your area for FREE legal advice. They're in the phone book. If you can't find them look up the American Bar Association office near you and call them. They can direct you to one. Agencies are required to maintain documents for 7 years, with few exceptions. The mortgage company you are dealing with doesn't sound like they WANT to cooperate and will need to be MADE to cooperate. Legal aide can help with that. If the mortgage company has the documentation to tell the IRS your loan was forgiven they HAVE to have the paperwork to support it. File a legal claim (and suit) against the company subpeonaing all documentation (SDT) regarding the loan including the documents supporting their claim to the IRS that the loan was forgiven, not foreclosed on. Call the mortgage company and make an appointment to see the manager. Don't deal with some schlub clerk. When they ask what it is regarding simply tell them it concerns a foreclosure and that you'll wait for the manager, then wait. Don't loose your cool when you're dealing with them either. You're on the loosing end. If you're not satisfied with the results of your face to face with the manager find out where the parent company is and call the manager there. As for copies of the documents they sent to the IRS and the supporting documents showing that it was a \"forgiven loan\" and not a foreclosure. You may have to pay copying costs for those. If they're not forthright and willing to help you call the parent company and speak with either the manager, or president if you can determine who that person is. If they're local make an appointment to see that manager or president. If they're not local conduct a phone interview with the manager or president. They HATE complaint calls and usually jump down someones throat at the offending office. Especially if they're wrong. What happened to your records? Didn't you keep the purchase sale/foreclosure package?Were you the only ones involved? Do others have copies and do you know how to contact them? If it was a \"scam\" did the local media report on it? What reporter wrote the story and what documentation do they have? Will they share YOUR information with you? Were the police involved? Did they take a report? Were arrests made? Are you named in the report as victims? Do they have any evidence you can subpeona? The police purge documents starting at 5 years after the close of the investigation, so call them right away if you think they were involved. You'll have to pay for those reports too. If there was a criminal case then what court did it go to? The District Attorney's office has documents as well, including the disposition of the case. The police will have their case number (different than the police number) and the court keeps paperwork forEVer. If you can't find any documentation to support your claim, and are forced to pay, often the IRS will negotiate a settlement. You will need help to do that but it's usually cheaper than paying the whole amount. If you can't do that they will accept payments. Set up a payment schedule and pay them over the next few years. That's better than trying to pay it all at once. The IRS doesn't go away. Ever. They're like a bad penny. Don't put it off. Be bold when you're dealing with them and ask questions, make requests, but don't be rude or get angry. If you think you are being railroaded after your audit tell them you want to go to court. They HATE going to tax court, especially for such a small amount. They'll deal. If they won't deal, get your facts together, a cronology of events, who, what, when, where you were contacted regarding the foreclosure, any documents you can locate and an attorney. You NEVER want to go to federal tax court without an attorney or at least a CPA. Federal judges are gods. Or at least they THINK they are and they have little tolerance for people not familiar with the system. The system is more important than the product. Good luck.

If you settle with the credit card company by paying part of what you owe in exchange for them dropping the balance, the unpaid part would be income taxable to you in the year it was forgiven. If you don't pay your credit card bill they could sue you if they thought it would be worth the trouble.  If they didn't and charged off the account it would not be income to you because you still owe on the account even though they are not trying to collect.", 9375, "None", 1],
