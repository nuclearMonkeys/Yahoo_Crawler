Some people have cancer that they don't know exists.  People have dental caries they don't know exist . . . and the severely mentally ill don't even know they are psychotically deranged.   With those ideas in mind, then perhaps in such an unknowing, ignorant way, you could be a pawn of Satan. However, you're going to have to go with reality, personal experience, logic and what you know in the present time.  There are no widely accepted tests to test for being a pawn of Satan.  If you asked a physician, especially a psychiatrist and persued this with fervent and sincere expression, you'd likely end up with something else --- some sort of psychiatric diagnosis. Currently, you can only go with your senses and logic.  Now, let's go back to saying you are a pawn of Satan.  If God works in mysterious ways, wouldn't Satan also work with elements of mystery?   Don't you think that you would be a more EFFECTIVE spawn of the devil if you believed in him (it/her) whole-heartedly?  Or what if your perception of the devil was a positive image? I know you're not SERIOUS here, but what if you substituted other things you were worried and/or concerned about?  Wouldn't that lend you be being a paranoid person?  If your crowd/audience is a group of often very rigid thinking, then wouldn't you expect to receive similar responses time and and time again?  Please excuse the crudeness of the following, but if you marry a gorilla isn't it ludicrous to complain about the stench of bananas?  In other words, if your audience has many Christians with fixed opinions and judgments then wouldn't you expect them to voice ideas that reflect their beliefs including statements that reject anything that opposes their strong sense of identification with thier faith, religion and/or the Bible?   Could not some of the people who accuse you of being Satan's pawn be counterfeit Christians?  How much stock, if any,  should you put in those opinions?  I say you have to consider the source and not go by once source alone when gathering facts that support your questioning -- that would be akin to uses a Bible as the source for everything.  Your view would become biased and only seen through one lens.", 9239, "9QyrW2iCaa", 0],

If one doesn't exist then the other wouldn't either. Therefore, how could you be a pawn of Satan? However, if you are willing to acknowledge the existence of the two the Bible does say that Satan the Devil misleads people and blinds the minds of people.

They have tried to take away the Tribute of a gifted POP ICON LEGACY. It is the not just the usa but the whole World that mourning and truly know of MJ WORTH. MJ has made this world a more caring and inspiring place to be. MJ traveled the WORLD with his BRILLANCE. They ALL LOVE HIM. Even if he was from the USA. The united states, multi billion media empire has made it's BILLIONS on Michael Jackson.fame,fortune,defamation and multilating his character and his,Life.Thier LOVE-HATE relationship has made many of the MEDIA MOGULS BILLIONS.Trillions. MJ had what people wanted.\"FAME FORTUNE\" The USA MEDIA has made there negative personal feelings perfectly clear to the rest of the World .Trying so hard to dismantle his legacy. What MJ strived to build. Instead of Celebrating MJ Accomplishments. The media has choosen both in the past and present to show thier true integrity? They have created more negative media against MJ. A bunch of Jackals or ***'. Adding chaos to a already heartbreaking situation. You and others say they are disgusted by the coverage. I would tell you to LOOK in THE MIRROR. How could any sane person deal with all the NEGATIVE BS from the media. MICHAEL dealt with it in Life and now Death? MJ, made his own perfect world.Like many many recluse celebrities. His beautiful home was invaded and degraded by some racist prosecutor. Possible Racist Police Force (remember Rodney King). This public legal servant who helped the alleged bloodsucking victim to steal millions from MJ. Actual facts of the case were misconstrued. Embellishing most of the findings/evidence.Even after the settlement. This same public legal servant then out right persued MJ through his legal career aiding other so-called blood sucking victims. No one seen MJ as a victim of his wealth. Wealthy people have a valid right n reason to protect themselves n familys no matter if they are BLACK or WHITE with what ever means possible.One of the findings used against MJ. Was a so called secret room for MJ a \"SAFE ROOM\" for others? The threats against himself n his children were not taken serious. Why wasn't he allowed the same safety and dignity as his wealthy neighbors. Many unnamed PERVERTS with PERVERTED MINDS from the LEGAL and MEDIA profession could not function, exist, or rest if they did not pry, accuse, misconstrue the facts, even fabricate, and manipulate against MJ. All in the name of a \"headline story\" of the tv, tabloids. internet. MICHAEL has done allot for the USA. He has brought many people of the world together. He has done this and more than the people that sit on Capital Hill who have the audacity to point their fingers HYPOCRITES and call MJ names..Did they forget thier croony Larry Craig,n the likes of him? All of you that hide behind your political titles, media, and legal professions titles are a bunch of baboons some bought n paid for. Unlike MJ, who actually earned his money HONESTLY. He gave of himself physically, vocally,his energy was not of this world. He gave Financially to the sick, poor, people in need. He earned the title of \"HUMANITARIAN\" first. Long before allot of celebrities today who have been public ally recognized for thier humantarian selfless accomplishments. But not MJ, all the GOOD DEEDS and MUSICAL BRILLIANCE is being cheapened and walked on by a few racist rednecks who wear suits. If it makes you sick don't watch it. What makes you sick to actually know there are real people like MJ. Someone who actually does deserve to have his LIFE CELEBRATED. for his Accomplishments. I know it is hard to believe. With what the World is becoming today, nothing but HATERS n GREED. I think the rest of the WORLD are seeing just how BIASED, RACIST and PREDJUDICE  the USA Media and Justice for all really are. I would like to disect allot of these HATERS each one of these media muts such as Anderson Cooper, All FOX FOOLS, and REP. KING. What happen to David Carradine who is a admitted P-------. all of his wifes admitted his life style. Is his life strewn all over the media? No because..The Carradine Family threatened to Sue Anyone. I think MJ's family should also think about sueing LA County and Media seriously.

	86735 : ["Well, dear, without knowing details it's hard to answer, but I will give it a shot from my intuition. It seems like you are only trying to please other people. You seem to judge yourself based on what others want from you and that brings only sorrow because there's not a single person on the Earth who is ever going to be good enough if they judge themselves that way. I wouldn't be too afraid of your thoughts of harm on other people. The simple fact that it upsets you should be encouraging. In your mind you feel that everyone has wronged you and since you see no signs of retribution from the universe, you imagine it. That's normal and it's ok. Just don't act on it.  It's hard for me to give you suggestions because I'm unfamiliar with how it actually is in your culture and society but I think that your failure in passing exams has nothing to do with your ability. I think you are perfectly capable of passing but you feel so much pressure that you can't remember everything you need to remember. You say you have turned to many religions and you mention Buddhism but I would take another look at it if I were you. Buddhism isn't really a religion - there's no \"supreme being\" to worship - it's a lifestyle. Buddhism is the path to enlightenment (freedom from suffering) through releasing attachment and it applies to anyone, regardless of their religion. Studying some of the basics of Buddhism can help calm your mind and get you more focused. With more focus you'll be able to study and actually remember what you've studied. Right now your brain is too busy worrying about everyone else. Stop worrying about what others may think of you. If the alternative is locking yourself inside, it really doesn't matter what they think anyway. I know it's not easy to just decide one day that you don't care about what others expect of you, but when it does happen, you will feel wonderful. Just remind yourself that no one will ever be able to please everyone so you aren't expected to either. Study because you want to get a degree and get a job, not to please your parents.  When you start feeling too overwhelmed, stop everything and do something that makes you happy or calms you down. Once you feel better, start studying again. Trying really hard to study when you're worried about other things just makes everything worse. Slow down, take your time and remember: you are the only one you have to live with for the rest of your life so you have to take care of yourself.

But if i'm gonna be dragged to another country by parents in search for a better life, then i decided the old ways are nice to know, but i wasn't dragged here to follow the laws and ways of the old country, that is the past, not the future!     I happen to be more than aware of the way those things play on some ppls mind, night and day, obsesive thoughts you can't shake, like a neon sign that just keeps rotating over and over non stop, i know how they wake you in the nights.     You my friend, have been put under enormous pressure, you are being seen and treated like some barganing chip, being turned into a bragging point, a my son's better than yours, a cushion or pension for your parents old age. This is sooo wrong, it is abusive to think your child \"owes\" you something for bringing you into a life you \"never\" asked for.    You do not own your child, he came through you and is only your to care for, he was created by god and belongs to god. He will love, support and honour you in old age out of love and respect, if and only if, you have taught them these things by example.      And what is happening to you is a pitiful example.       I realize they may think they're doing the best for you, but religions and the \"old\" ways, have been flawed by with selfishness and ulterior motives. Many ppl who claim to be religious pick and chose what suits them from holy books, same goes for the way they interpret scriptures, etc. You reading the same scripture may well interpret it totally different. And all holy books teach tell of being humble, taking pride in the most menial of jobs, they also speak of parents and old age, but non demand that you shower them with material possesion and cash.     We are equal in the eye's of god, but we are not all equal in birth, mind and body. The difference between a doctor, lawyer, judge, etc is that they are what is called \"book smart\" meaning they can retain and store info, better than others, but in other fields or facets of life, they are as dumb as snails. No matter how hard one tries or is presured they can only do their best, trying to the point of unhappyness and depression will \"not\" change a thing but your mental health and not for the better, so allow no one to push you to the point of no return.        The old ways are slowly changing and the old ones must learn to accept this.      You need to learn to put your foot down, tell them you've done your best and find the a career that suits you, your abilities, learn to accept who \"you\" are and try to find what you \"are\" good at. That is where happiness and success lie.       You might also consider and work towards immigrating, Canada has many many jobs, programs, educational services and loans to help students get good educations, upgrade and improve their educational statis. Your grade will probably be up to par. You should consider this, or come as a forein student.       I think the break away would be wonderful for you. And i know you would love it here.        But most of all, we see your mental condition for what it is, nor do we judge those who need help. In this society many see psychiatrists and psychologists and it is seen as very normal. We all have problems now and then, especially with these family situations.        Best of luck and i hope this has somehow gotten through  to you and helped.
