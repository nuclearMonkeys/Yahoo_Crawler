	5608 : ["It's normal to experience traumatic stress following a disturbing event, whether it's a traffic accident, plane crash, violent crime, terrorist attack, global pandemic, or a natural disaster like an earthquake, hurricane, or flood. You may feel intense shock, confusion, and fear, or feel numb or overwhelmed by a host of conflicting emotions, sometimes all at once. And these emotions aren't limited to the people who experienced the event. Round-the-clock news and social media coverage mean that we're all bombarded with horrific images of tragedy, suffering, and loss almost the instant they occur anywhere in the world. Repeated exposure can overwhelm your nervous system and create traumatic stress just as if you experienced the event firsthand. Traumatic stress can shatter your sense of security, leaving you feeling helpless and vulnerable in a dangerous world—especially if the traumatic event was manmade, such as a shooting or act of terrorism. You may feel physically and emotionally drained, overcome with grief, or find it difficult to focus, sleep, or control your temper. These are all normal responses to abnormal events. Often, the unsettling thoughts and feelings of traumatic stress—as well as any unpleasant physical symptoms—start to fade as life gradually returns to normal over the days or weeks following a catastrophic event or crisis. But there's also a lot you can do to assist in your recovery and better come to terms with the trauma you've experienced. Whether you lived through the event itself, witnessed it, were an emergency responder or medical worker, or experienced traumatic stress in the aftermath, there are plenty of ways to calm your nervous system and regain your emotional balance. Signs and symptoms of traumatic stress Whether or not the traumatic event directly impacted you, it's normal to feel anxious, scared, and uncertain about what the future may hold. Your nervous system has become overwhelmed by stress, triggering a wide range of intense emotions and physical reactions. These symptoms of traumatic stress can range from mild to severe and often come and go in waves. There may be times when you feel jumpy and anxious, for example, and other times when you feel disconnected and numb. Emotional symptoms of traumatic stress include: Shock and disbelief. You have a hard time accepting the reality of what happened, or feel numb and disconnected from your feelings. Fear. You worry that the same thing will happen again, or that you'll lose control or break down. Sadness or grief, especially if people you know died or suffered life-altering consequences. Helplessness. The sudden, unpredictable nature of the violent crime, accidents, pandemics, or natural disasters can leave you feeling vulnerable and helpless, and even trigger anxiety or depression. Guilt that you survived when others died, or feeling that you could have done more to help. Anger. You may be angry at God, governments, or others you feel are responsible, or be prone to emotional outbursts. Shame, especially over feelings or fears that you can't control. Relief. You may feel relieved that the worst is over, that you weren't as badly affected as others, or even hopeful that your life will return to normal. Physical symptoms include: Feeling dizzy or faint, stomach tightening or churning, excessive sweating. Trembling, shaking, experiencing cold sweats, having a lump in your throat, or feeling choked up. Rapid breathing, pounding heart, even chest pains, or difficulty breathing. Racing thoughts, being unable to rest or stop pacing. You may also have difficulty concentrating, memory problems, or confusion. Changes in your sleeping patterns. You experience insomnia or nightmares, for example. Unexplained aches and pains, including headaches, changes in sexual function. Loss or increase in appetite, or excessive consumption of alcohol, nicotine, or drugs. Dealing with traumatic stress Just as it can often take time to clear the rubble and repair the damage following a disaster or traumatic event, it can also take time to recover your emotional equilibrium and rebuild your life. But there are specific things you can do to help yourself and your loved ones cope with the emotional aftermath of trauma—and find a way to move on with your life. Remember there's no “right” or “wrong” way to feel. People react in different ways to trauma, so don't tell yourself (or anyone else) what you should be thinking, feeling, or doing. Don't ignore your feelings—it will only slow recovery. It may seem better in the moment to avoid experiencing your emotions, but they exist whether you're paying attention to them or not. Even intense feelings will pass if you simply allow yourself to feel what you feel. Avoid obsessively reliving the traumatic event. Repetitious thinking or viewing horrific images over and over can overwhelm your nervous system, making it harder to think clearly. Partake in activities that keep your mind occupied (read, watch a movie, cook, play with your kids), so you're not dedicating all your energy and attention to the traumatic event. Reestablish routine. There is comfort in the familiar. After a disaster, getting back—as much as possible—to your normal routine will help you minimize traumatic stress, anxiety, and hopelessness. Even if your work or school routine is disrupted, you can structure your day with regular times for eating, sleeping, spending time with family, and relaxing. Put major life decisions on hold. Making big life decisions about home, work, or family while traumatized will only increase the stress in your life. If possible, try to wait until life has settled down, you've regained your emotional balance, and you're better able to think clearly.", 938, "Pwqi7n4uaa", 1],

Travers studied Eastern philosophy long before creating \"Mary Poppins\".  When she (post-\"Poppins\") wrote about her philosophical studies, the critics mostly dismissed it as a vanity project by a children's book author. King understands his place in the public imagination.", 920, "xkHtn1FEaa", 0],
	5642 : ["In 2003, the National Book Awards granted its prestigious annual Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters to author Stephen King. Yale professor and literary critic Harold Bloom was not impressed. “He is a man who writes what used to be called penny dreadfuls,″ Bloom told The New York Times when King was announced as the winner. ″That they could believe that there is any literary value there or any aesthetic accomplishment or signs of an inventive human intelligence is simply a testimony to their own idiocy. ″⁣ That's just one example of the many times King's writing chops was criticized. In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, the author shared his strategy for dealing with criticism: Just keep on writing. (He claimed in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview that being insulted by critics like Bloom doesn't bother him because their opinions are “elitist.” However, he said that some painful jabs at his professionalism do hurt.) “I still remember in The Village Voice somebody did a long, debunking piece about my writing. There was a caricature of me eating money that was flowing from my typewriter,” King told The New York Times Magazine. “I thought, Oh, it's so dispiriting when you work as hard as you can and you see something like that. [But] I kept my mouth shut. I kept my head down and kept doing the best stuff that I could.” An insult by playwright and author Irwin Shaw was also discouraging to hear, King said. “When I started, I was seen as a genre writer, and that's pretty much what I was. I remember going to a literary-guild party around the time of ‘The Shining.' Irwin Shaw was sitting in a corner, very gouty and very flushed. He had a cane and was wearing a blue suit. He looked morose. He looked at me, and this sneer came over his face, and he said, ‘Oh, look, it's the lion,' meaning the literary lion,” King said in the interview. “I shrank because I love that guy's books. I still do.” King kept writing. ″[...] I think I basically outlived a lot of the bad critics,” the author continued. “Now, I won't be around to see the final tally. Most writers who are perennial best-sellers drop dead, and their work falls off the list. They just disappear.” Like King, Jeff Bezos believes that withstanding criticism and soldiering on is a critical quality for achieving success. “One thing that I tell people is ... if you're going to do anything new or innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood,” the Amazon founder said in an interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner, published by Business Insider in 2018. “If you cannot afford to be misunderstood, then for goodness' sake, don't do anything new or innovative.” Sam Altman, Open AI CEO and former Y-Combinator President also agree: “The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion,” Altman wrote in 2019 in a blog post. “If you don't believe in yourself, it's hard to let yourself have contrarian ideas about the future. But this is where most value gets created,” Altman explained. (It's as important to take feedback productively, he said.) Altman recalled Elon Musk giving a SpaceX tour to him “many years ago” and talking about manufacturing rockets — “but the thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars. I left thinking, Huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like,” Altman wrote. King's long and storied career has paid him back handsomely. In 2019, King was the fifth wealthiest author in the world, netting $17 million, according to Forbes. But ultimately, King says he can't be sure of the legacy of his work — beyond a prediction that his scary clown in the “It” series will be remembered. “I don't know what will happen to my stuff when I die, but one thing I'm pretty sure of is that Pennywise will be around,” King told The New York Times Magazine. “The rest of the stuff may disappear, but 200 years from now, people will say, ‘Pennywise is really scary.'”", 920, "Pwqi7n4uaa", 1],
