Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 783, "None", 0],

You could definitely do it, and it would not be hard for most people, but it would still be needed. I'll give you a real example: video games. Many, if not most, video games give the player a choice of view, whether through the \"eyes\" of the character, or from a viewpoint behind the character.  Many of the games I have played will force a rear-view perspective when riding a horse.  However, I usually take the first-person perspective in games (I look at the world as if through the eyes of the character).  The first few times that I played games where that third-person/rear-view perspective got forced when riding a horse ended up with me unable to control the character/horse very well.  Eventually, I learned how to deal with the effects caused by the different perspective. I am certain that players who always assume a third-person perspective (view from behind the character) would have had no issue learning how to control a horse in a video game.  They would, instead, tend to have difficulty adjusting ot the first-person perspective.", 789, "WbVE1cXKaa", 1],

	4651 : ["There are basically two techniques. Regeneration and optical amplification.    Regeneration involves detecting the signal with an electronic output transducer, recovering the digital data and then sending it out as newly generated optical signal. Optical amplification keeps the signal in the optical domain but uses scientific electronic magic to boost the optical power of the signal. I have no idea how it works. Since regeneration goes back into the electronic domain there is the opportunity to do data management functions  - error checking etc. The recovered data signal is synchronised to a new clock, re packaged and made as good as the original output but at the cost of quite a lot electronic processing Whereas, pure optical amplification just boosts the optical signal. Thus, for a very attenuated signal there are noise issues with keeping the boosted signal within a acceptable data eye.", 787, "jB2Z6uxhaa", 0],
