The Messiah will be a very great king, he will achieve great fame, and his reputation among the gentile nations will be even greater than that of King Solomon. His great righteousness and the wonders that he will bring about will cause all peoples to make peace with him and all lands to serve him…. Nothing will change in the Messianic age, however, except that Jews will regain their independence. Rich and poor, strong and weak, will still exist. However it will be very easy for people to make a living, and with very little effort they will be able to accomplish very much…. it will be a time when the number of wise men will increase…. war shall not exist, and nation shall no longer lift up sword against nation…. The Messianic age will be highlighted by a community of the righteous and dominated by goodness and wisdom. It will be ruled by the Messiah, a righteous and honest king, outstanding in wisdom, and close to God. Do not think that the ways of the world or the laws of nature will change, this is not true. The world will continue as it is. The prophet Isaiah predicted \"The wolf shall live with the sheep, the leopard shall lie down with the kid.\" This, however, is merely allegory, meaning that the Jews will live safely, even with the formerly wicked nations. All nations will return to the true religion and will no longer steal or oppress. Note that all prophecies regarding the Messiah are allegorical. Only in the Messianic age will we know the meaning of each allegory and what it comes to teach us. Our sages and prophets did not long for the Messianic age in order that they might rule the world and dominate the gentiles, the only thing they wanted was to be free for Jews to involve themselves with the Torah and its wisdom.[5] PS  I believe that Martin Luther's hatred of Jews had little to do with the Talmud and more to do with the fact that he had originally felt that the \"real\" reason that Jews didn't \"wake up\" and recognize Christianity as the completion of Judaism was Christians' use of violence and torture and generally bad behavior towards Jews. He reasoned that if he was \"nice\" to Jews and explained Christianity, we would convert.

Krishna's main advice is selfless action is paramount -- the dharma of duty. When one performs his duty to God in a selfless manner for the good of all that is when he can forge a much closer relationship than when he only sits and reads scriptures or just does penance or rituals or makes donations. It is in reaching out to God when in the midst of fighting for what you believe is right, your Dharma that is when you can come closest to God.

	105114 : ["An inspiring questin and nice thoght provoking answers. I shall also like to share some ideas to which I was exposed in several discourses I attended. Sri Krishna was all along with his cousin guiding and helping him in several ways, but he didnt give the eternal truths through Geetha till after his surrender in the battlefield, praying for guidance to tackle the overwhelming moha. So Arjuna became the ripe person to receive the eternal message from the right person. King Dhridrashtra was not yet ready for it. Also, Arjuna did suffer setbacks even after the initiation into yogic truths, when he lost his valiant son Abimanyu, wherefore the Lord interceded in the true spirit of the Gurus who redeem their disciples repeatedly when they stray into delusion. The episode has lessons to us. We seek spirituality only when we fail in worldly challenge and that the deliverence lies in problems of sorts. Did not Queen Kunti pray: Lord, a person born in great family, with all prosperity, fame etc would not think of reaching you (Janma Aiswarya Srithar Sribhihi ye da maana madah pumaan..) so give me problems ever, so I may not lose sight of You in the Nivrithi Maarga (Renunciant's way).. And God does not give the message even to an eligible person until the latter is ready to receive the message.. The King had to wait till the war was over, to find all his sons gone and Blessed Vidhura to come and guide him to the forest..!  Gandhiji said that he lost his earthly mother who guided him all her life long ago but in all times of distress he turned to Geetha who played the mother to him to guide ever since.. Yes, one would find the right guidance from the words of the Lord when one tunes to Him for help! We are verily in the state of the deluded King most of the time.

Dhritarashtra, whose ears were puffed with the blind love for his evil son Duryodhana, kept negging Krishna for this. Take the example of two pots, one is open and second is covered with a plate......when it rains........the second will remain empty and the first will be filled with water. The pot of Dritarashtra's mind was covered in the plate of Maya and PutraMoh(unfair love for son), so he couldn't get the essence of geeta while Arjana had been filled with the AtmaGyan coz he he has become KrishnaMay.
