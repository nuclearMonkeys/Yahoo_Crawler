	81565 : ["Given you are young, it is likely that you could find a less expensive policy. The best answer to your question is to contact a few health care insurance companies and ask them about private policies.  (Also check with some independent agents who carry multiple lines of insurance.) Also, a lot of insurance companies offer \"temporary\" health insurance for a six month term, and they may offer a renewable option.  These policies are stripped down, but they will cover you for a big claim. Health insurance IS very expensive, and nobody is profiteering over your situation.   I have no figures on the number of people dropping out of COBRA, but people drop out for lots of reasons, such as: - They can't afford the premium - They can get coverage through their spouse - They want to play the odds - They will simply go to a charity hospital if something happens", 9070, "1pUiedTEaa", 1],

When I got home, I did some research on the drug.  I was shocked at all the people that had complained about lexapro causing them to gain weight and the doctors denying that it would.

There is also an airport closer to Long Beach in Orange County called John Wayne Airport, but there are time restrictions on when you can fly into that airport, no flights in or out after 10 p.m.  Another option is to fly into Las Vegas, NV and rent a car and drive to CA, flights to Las Vegas are usually cheaper than flying into CA.

	81580 : ["I am an employer.  My employees are given the option of group health insurance.  They only have to pay 25% of the premium.  That is anywhere from $45 - $55 / month.  They can add dependents, but they must pay the whole premium for dependents.  Believe it or not, more of them opt out than opt in for that group health insurance coverage, and it is good coverage.  I think they are crazy, but I am not going to push it.  I guess some of them just prefer to take their chances for maintaining good health or just don't mind having to go to the county hospital or local clinic for health care.  I know one or two are dependents on their spouse's plan. For a family of four healthy individuals, our group coverage is about $16,000 / year.  Yeah, and our broker tells us each year, there will be an increase in health insurance costs for the upcoming year.  That has been the trend for the passed 15 years.  It's disgusting!   All decent insurance companies / coverage is comparable.  -but, yeah, for a 28 y/o, you can find minimum coverage for only catastrophic events and pay $200 / month or $2,400 / year........you have to shop around or find a broker to do the shopping for you.", 9070, "dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa", 0],
	81581 : ["The idea of \"much better\" is relative.  If you were to compare similar policies in the group coverage market and the individual coverage market, the individual coverage market is much more expensive.  However, yes, you can save on premiums by lowering your coverage limits and picking up a high deductible policy (say no coverage for the first $2,500 and then 80% after that, etc.).   About 20% of employees at large employers opt-out of coverage...however, there are a number of reasons for this, such as covered by a spouse's plan, just plain don't want the coverage (usually younger employees), etc.", 9070, "qBCGH52haa", 1],

A man and a man, a woman and a woman, your friends' family, mom and brothers/sisters, dad and brothers/sisters. I really don't care. But I don't think a family should always be a man and a woman. Besides don't they usually get divorced more then their kids are all messed up etc? I think that sometimes same sex parents are better for a kid. The kid will learn that family isn't always a man and a woman but people who care about each other and their kids. And the kid will understand sexuality better. Maybe. School- I hate school. The kids are so loud and annoying. But this year I guess I got lucky but not so much all those years before, though.... Anyway, all the kids have diarrhea of the mouth and always question the people who don't. They never listen and complain over the STUPIDEST things in the world. Even if the teachers explains the problem 50 million times there's always five people who are like \"Whaaaaaaaaat??\"  Someone always talks out and gets the whole class in trouble. Then there's at least 1-2 guys who always need attention, so they act out and talk out during class any chance they get. Now subjects and class. I think we should learn current history and or other countries' history. I remember learning about other counties' history and it was so, SO much fun! Now this is my second year learning American history and I hate social studies. I'd say if we're going to learn American history we should learn about what happened to the Chinese, Spanish, NATIVE AMERICANS, Black people etc. I'm tried of learning about slavery and how ****** up the south was. I knew that before even learning American history! They need to teach something else. Like, I don't know.... BLACK HISTORY?!  Gym- I don't think we should take showers. I just can't imagine getting naked, running across the room, have water mess up my hair for the rest of the day and then have a little towel that can barely cover my boobs. I'm glad I still have a year to go. I also think they should have other things students to do, like if they have asthma or who really, really suck at sports. Like read a book, work on HW... Honestly, I don't we should even have gym. The girls never do anything and someone always gets hurt. Religion- Religion has been getting on my nerves lately. All I hear is God, Jesus and The Lord. It's really annoying to me now. What about the people who don't believe in God or believe in something else? All I wish is that people stop talking about God and how he makes and does everything.
