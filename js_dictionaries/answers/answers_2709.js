	141293 : ["I can truly TRULY understand how you feel. Im a girl, but my appearance would be very girly/feminine, but inside, im very manly, and i act manly despite my feminine appearance. I have ALWAYS ALWAYS wanted to be a guy, and I think in a guys way and sometimes i would dream of having an actual penis and having my own kids, and be called a FATHER instead of a mother. When i think of weddings, i never think of myself in a white wedding dress, but in a suit or tuxedo instead, looking at my beautiful fiance walking down the aisle. I can tell you, if i actually am given a wish, ANY WISH at all, it would be to be reborn into a handsome guy (cos to be honest im a pretty girl, not trying to brag but yeah). I love the idea of building and bulking up my body and I HATE wearing bras. Like having those male pecs, ive always wanted them, along with broad shoulders etc and a small chine goatee. But my sanity knows that is it really worth it, to change who i am? Im happy with who i am, i just wish that i was a boy but i know that it would be too difficult if turned into a male. I would have to change my WHOLE identity and there is a chance of losing my friends and family members that i am close to. The reason why you're scared of it, is because like me, you dont want to feel alone. You dont want to be felt like a freak, and ending up not loved because of societies construction. As much as i am courageous, i am scared of judgement. Even though everyone calls me a man, and knows of my manly side, i sometimes embrace my feminine side as well, because i know that I can never change it and that i want to keep my happy. Its basically our responsibilities to our family, and the societies perspective that holds us back from making the decision even though we truly desire to be males. Soon i want to cut my hair short though, boyish style. I dont want to look liek a butch, but to be honest i wont look anything like a butch even if id id cut my hair short. Id probably look like a cute gay guy and be mistaken for a guy. LOLS the irony.  But whatever you decide, you have to look in the long term, not just the short term. Because your change, will be irrversible and its going to stick. Make sure its what you want o do, and dont hesitate to do something that makes you happy. Btw im 17 too and i have a girlfriend who i consider extremely sexy and very feminine.  I sort of wish i was a guy for her, because i know she sometimes is scared of how society reacts of lesbians etc etc. Im a pansexual, so i love personalities, not a persons appearance. Hoepfully in my next life, and hopefully in yours, we'll both be guys or we'll both be in bodies where the gender is what we truly desire! Goodluck :)", 11497, "0xc2YXMBaa", 1],

	141319 : ["There is one important difference between what this person went through, and what Transsexual people go through.  When a Transsexual person kills themselves, suicide (the act of desperation) ends their life.  What this person did, cutting off their limb, was an act of desperation that saved their life.  The person who commits suicide to avoid their pain is a coward, and in the process hurts all the people that loved them.  A person who dies because they don't have the courage to do a self-amputation would not be thought of as any less of a person by those who loved that person. When I reached the end of my rope, I was prepared to commit suicide.  I had tried everything I could to make my life worth living, but everything always collapsed and I was left with nothing but the gender dysphoria.  I had everything all planned out... the method, the time, the place.  I'm a meticulous person, so I'm sure it would have worked.  What stopped me was when I started to write notes saying goodbye to my Sisters.  I realized the pain I was feeling was nothing compared to the pain I'd be causing them.  At that moment, I experienced grief and sorrow at a level I never imagined was possible.  I just couldn't do that to another person... even to end my own suffering.  I figured at the very least, I'd at least try and share my gender issues with someone before I ended my life.  So I told the therapist I had been seeing for many years, and at that point I realized that I was going to make it.  I was going to be okay.   From that day on, a little over a year ago, life has steadily gotten better and better.  I've been Transitioning step-by-step, accompanied by many wonderful friends (some right here in Yahoo! Answers) who have given me guidance and advice almost every day.  The internet has been a godsend.  I look towards the future with a sense of anticipation and excitement now.  Life is no longer something to just \"be endured\", it's something to be embraced, and to rejoice in.  I actually like who I am now.  Yes, there have certainly been some challenges, and some days that have seemed almost impossible to get through, but I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  I've gotten so much positive support from people around me, that I can't help but be a little angry at myself for getting so close to the point of no return.  I can't believe I allowed so many ridiculous fears to keep me from seeking help for so long. The only frustration I still occasionally feel is that I live in a world that has made my medical condition so stigmatized that it makes Transsexual people too ashamed of their condition to seek help.  That's the one thing I wish I had the power to change in society... to make it so that being born with Transsexualism was as unremarkable as being born with a cleft lip.  If we could just get it so that everyone born this way was treated from childhood, there would be no need for people to grow up the way I did, hating themselves and seeing suicide as the only way to find peace.  I think in time, as doctors and parents become more educated, we are going to see more and more diagnosis and treatment in childhood, culminating in the removal of this condition from the DSM, and the condition finally being covered by medical insurance as other developmental birth conditions are covered.", 11497, "nH4gjGmRaa", 3],
