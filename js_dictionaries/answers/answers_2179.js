	114729 : ["I'm 40 weeks and 2 days now and don't mind one little bit that the peanut is still happy to be in my womb! For one thing, I truly ADORE being pregnant with this little person, uncomfortable as I am by now. For another, I know that my baby is good and healthy, waiting until the right moment to be born and taking all the time to be fully prepared for life outside the womb. In the meantime, I've been able to fully prepare. So, no, I don't mind being 40 weeks and I won't mind being 41 or even going to 42, though I want to hold and see this little person so bad. It will happen when it happens and I just enjoy every minute of these special last days with my unborn baby. I have to say, I am very organized, but only because my nesting urge totally kicked in during the last couple of weeks, ensuring that my house is really clean, dinners have been cooked and frozen, and everything for the baby is ready (having a home water birth). But like I said, that only happened in the last month. Without that urge, I don't know if I could have gotten so organized because it's so uncomfortable to move around! Some women never get it, but I have really enjoyed it. It might hit you all of a sudden. Maybe you should just focus on the most important things right now, like getting a car seat. As for the other things (washing baby clothes, packing your bag), you can do that over time. Doing them might be just what you need to help you get more organized, if that's what you want. But no, I don't blame you for not being in a hurry about it. It's a nice change to know that someone else isn't freaking out at the end of pregnancy. Just enjoy it! Best wishes!", 10397, "None", 0],

I do however have the car seat. You might want to start looking for one, since that is a necessity. I have the cot and blankets and all that as well... but i have no washed any baby clothes. I think you should just it when you feel ready!", 10397, "sbedPdLDaa", 0],

I don't think you're weird at all, but since your due date is so close i would pack a small bag with at least the basic's (jammies, extra blankies, and your shower/bath accessories).  of course, you cannot forget the baby's outfits, and accessories either, unless you have someone that will be brinign them up after you have the baby - that is helpful too to designate a friend, family member to either pack or pick-up your bags from hospital, that way you don't have to feel so overwhelmed about them.

Ralph Lauren (etc) will only ever allow their brands to be purchased at their own suggested retail prices (in other words, rediculously expensive) and set their own sale prices to control who their customers are. If they want to remain a fancy label they have to maintain a fancy price.  Macy's is under contract with them, so Macy's is their *****.

	114771 : ["Ignorance isn't a justification of the law. Anyone can claim ignorance in any case, therefore it isn't acceptable in a court of law. There is no way of proving you didn't know what was happening either. Even if James tries to take full blame and leave you out of it, which would make his sentencing harsher so i doubt he would. But even if he did, it's still rarely accepted in a court of law.  The problems lies in that you always need to be aware of what your right hand is doing. You wanted lots of money and wanted to try to remain ignorant of how you came by it. I can't imagine anyone thinking this was a deal on the up and up. Certainly a court of law won't believe in it either. I don't know many who would believe you, scammers aren't known for their honesty.  That James hasn't been charged with this fraud doesn't mean he soon won't be. Doesn't mean you won't be as well.  The victim of the scam has the right to sue both you and James, especially once he is finally told about your part in it. You can be sued for much more than what you earned off of the scam. You are not safe from being charged with fraud or sued for fraud. You are just as responsbile for the buyers loss.  I'd hire a good attorney and have them on retainer. I'd do it NOW, before the police come to your door. You might say something that will be used against you in a court of law, something innocent that could get you convicted. An attorney will tell you how to handle everything properly in the event the police come to your door, even if they don't have plans for arresting you. ", 10398, "QIQNzE11aa", 0],

You may be held jointly and severally liable - means you could be stuck with the entire bill (but since you don't have the money, you may not).

	114773 : ["Possible?  Try 100% certain, if you don't use a condom.  To minimize this, nice people make sure to empty their bowels before anal sex.  Some people even do enemas.  But cleaning out the bowel completely isn't really possible, which is why it's very important to clean off his penis before you move on to other sexual activities. To minimize pain on anal sex, take your time.  Use plenty of a heavy-duty lube (spit or semen WILL NOT WORK.  I don't care what it shows in porn, that is simply inadequate).  Try inserting things *smaller* than a penis at first to help relax and stretch you out.  It may help if you have an orgasm before you try anal.  Pain (not necessarily discomfort) should always be a sign to stop. Tan lines are pretty much a matter of preference.  My husband digs them... other guys don't.

I would agree with the person who said to send him a text/e-mail/message basically saying \"Sorry for last time, want to just go back to doing things the normal way?\". That gives him a chance to acknowledge that neither of you enjoyed it without having to actually talk about it.
