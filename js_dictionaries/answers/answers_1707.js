You could put a few sprigs in a vase and gently \"cup\" the bunch like you would fluff pillows. You could make Mini mint pillows to go under furniture cushions. You could infuse some in vodka or white vinegar and use as a room or fabric spray. Perhaps some naked stems stuck like reeds into a small vase of olive oil. If you prefer buying something \"over the counter\", I would recommend something of the mint variety. Also, you could peel an orange, or a tangerine in the room, and twist some of the peel to pop the capsules and release delicious fragrance.

Not meat by-products and not meat meal, meat.   Also, the food shouldn't contain any of the cheap fillers that dogs can't digest and are often the cause of food allergies - corn, wheat, beet pulp and sorghum.

	91036 : ["Yes, the process is the same as when seaming two pieces of carpet together.  It will match like a seam if done to professional standards. Since you are planning to take pieces of carpet from one section and place it elsewhere the wear should be reasonably the same.  Make sure that you keep the orientation the same as most carpets don't look the same when turned 180 deg.   You will be using a special hot melt tape (glue goes up) and a carpet seaming iron to melt the glue before the carpet is pushed into it.  You only have a brief time to do this before the glue gets solid again.  You might want to practice on some scraps before you start.  These tools can be rented at a nearby tool rental store.  It is not hard and certainly a lot easier than stretching or cutting the edges of a carpet.   Before you get started do a little research.  There are references in some other answers but none of them is on point.  Some of the sites below will get you started.  Two are about installing carpets so pay attention to the part about making the seams and the third site is for carpet irons to gve you an idea of what it looks like.  The last site is to show you what carpet seaming tape looks like.", 9385, "L8zmQS8Jaa", 1],
	91037 : ["Your older dog is not your child, he is a dog and he probably loves having the other dog for company.  You got this new puppy 10 months ago so she's certainly not a baby puppy, she must be almost 1 year old.   Since you are home for such a short time I think the older dog would be lonely without the younger dog.  Most dogs like their own species for company.  You would soon know if he didn't like her, if that was the case you would come home to bloodshed. At the age the younger one is now, and she has been with you for 10 months why would you need to do 'the new mommy thing'?  That time is long gone. If for your own reasons you don't want to keep the younger one then be up front about it.   Don't use the excuse that it's because of the older dog who sounds to be quite happy with the situation. Why did you take on the pup 10 months ago if you had no time to spend with the dogs anyway? Dog ownership is a voluntary commitment for the life of the dog.  Some people seem to think dogs are disposable items that you take on until you get sick of the responsibility and can't be bothered with them anymore. Cute little puppies are adorable and are hard to resist but we should never take them on unless we can provide a permanent home for the rest of their lives.", 9386, "2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa", -1],

My dog jake is like that and i give him some oil and his dry skin is rare to none now.  It will take time but you should notice a difference.  In truth you should bathe a dog once a week to every two week.  depending on the breed, size, age, and hair length of the dog. THere are a lot of minerals in water that can dry out skin not just dogs but people too.  So if you are using the wrong soap it can be getting rid of important oils in dogs fur.  Shampoos for humans arent always great for dogs.  Because of how much oil is good or not good is different you take too much away you get dry skin.

There may be something that she can't tolerate). One breeder swore by using baby shampoo and conditioner. Also, if you take her to a groomer, find out what products they use. Bring your own and make sure they use that. She may have developed an allergy or condition. Call the vet, describe the symptoms, and see if you should take her in. Our shih tzu has a condition where he can't tolerate even one bite from a flea. He scratches and goes crazy and destroys his skin in the process. We have to use special medication from the vet.

The main short-term manifestation that we're seeing isn't straight-line warming, but massive instability of the weather patterns.  You'll get horrible winters in the NorthEast and flooding in the South and meanwhile the Southwest has been in a drought sine 1999.  While all this is happening, the icecaps have measurably melted. We're in for strange, severe weather with extreme variations in temperature, and this is just the beginning. The word \"warming\" refers to an overall trend that's going to take place over decades or centuries, over the entire globe.  You can't draw any conclusions from the bad winter you're having in your hometown, this year .

Seriously, there's was nothing sunny about that place. ;) I had to look it up...a dale is a valley...nope, there wasn't a damn valley there either.  There are some places that warn you that they are bad though. One of the most dangerous neighborhoods in San Francisco is called \"Hunter's Point\". It is a very clear message that if you pass through there, keep your doors locked and your windows up. If you get out and ask for directions, you aren't very bright.  On the flip side, one of the most crack infested, high crime neighborhoods in SF is called \"The Tenderloin\".  The reasoning for that is back in the day the whole area used to be totally plush, with nightclubs and hotels and people like Frank Sinatra would come there to entertain. So they considered it the tenderloin, comparing the city to meat and this was the best part. :) But let me tell you, there is nothing tender about the Tenderloin anymore. ;) Am I off topic?

If you can't appropriately care for your dogs (ie: attention, proper training, socialization, etc), then finding him/her a more appropriate home may be the best for everyone.  They shouldn't have to be neglected just because you took on too many responsibilities at once.  Another family may be in a better position to spend more quality time with the dog and offer an adequate amount of exercise and mental stimulation. Just remember that dogs are pack animals though.  There's no reason why your older dog would necessarily be \"jealous\" of the pup.  They probably get along just fine.  They BOTH need human interaction though.

As long as the dogs aren't constantly fighting or are aggressive with each other then you shouldn't worry. While you are at work it is good company for dogs to have each other. I think two dogs are better than one. (only if you can afford two and can provide the same quality care to both). Don't cry, the older dog will adjust and by this time next year you will notice that they will be great friends.  My dogs fussed at each other all the time at first,  now they are inseparable. However they do get jealous from time to time. It is just dog nature. You have to give equal love and attention, and not allow them to act up. Note: my dogs took a few months to make friends good enough to trust them together alone. I had considered rehoming one of them at one time because she was more difficult than I anticipated. However I worked with her. I was frustrated at times, but I am glad I waited it out. She is an exceptinal dog and well behaved. She went through an awkward stage. Give the newer dog a chance.

She just needs some more training, so I don't know if you can afford a trainer for her.  These are hard times and you have to work to survive, and school is tough right now, but it will get you to a much better life.  I think you need to tough it out because I think these dogs are just as important to you as you are to them.  Maybe you can get a dog walker or doggie day care, but I really and honestly think it would be a mistake for you and them to let one or both of these dogs go.  Hang in there, school is not forever, and you are very smart, he will be stressed and miss her, so get her a trainer or a dog walker or maybe someone in your family can help with them.
