	259 : ["It's not legal to operate an unregistered car on a public street. That implies you can't park an unregistered car on a public street.  So, the answer to your question is \"No.\" But, if the parking place you have in mind is private property, you might be able to park it there. You would need the property owner's permission. You would also need to have it delivered there, as  in towed or trucked there. If the car is registered by the seller, the seller or agent of the seller could drive it there.  There might be restrictions on how the property may be used. You might not be allowed to keep the car on your front lawn, but you would be allowed to keep it inside a garage, for example. You should be able to buy and own a car if you keep it on private property. So, the question you need to ask is \"Do I have to have a driver's license to register a car?\" That answer depends on where you live. If you live in a state where you do not have to show a driver's license to register it, you could buy the car, register it, and have someone else drive it. You would have to work out something with an auto insurance company. (People who hire chauffeurs do this.)  If your state requires a driver's license to register a car, you can point out you will own the car, but someone else, and not you, will be the driver. Most people in the United States learn to drive before they own a car. They study rules and how to drive. Then they get a learner's permit. They get driving lessons in high school, from a driving school, and/or from their parents. The schools and parents typically own the cars. A learner's permit allows you to drive if you have a licensed driver in the front passenger seat.  Basically, teaching yourself how to drive isn't allowed. They get their first car after they get their driver's license. ", 22, "k7hBT7MGaa", 5],
