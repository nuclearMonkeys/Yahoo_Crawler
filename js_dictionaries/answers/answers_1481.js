I thought \"Get a life!\" Then feminism emerged and I thought, \"Thank God!\" Then it became clear who was running the show.  Left-wing academics who had nothing but hatred for men, revenge, and preferential advancement on their minds. I quickly became as anti-feminist as I had been pro. What is left of the movement is more properly described as \"L*sbo-feminism\" and is as passe as Communism - women of a certain age waging war against an enemy that can't be bothered to invade.
