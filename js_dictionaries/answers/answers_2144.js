Either type shouldn't be owned by someone not willing to provide expercise and mental stimulation.   As for the 2nd question.   I person no.  I have only run into a handful of Doberman owers  all who appeared suited to the breed.   On line all the time.  Both on YA and on Doberman listservs you get people who are to soft to own the breed and have dogs that will show teeth or growl to get their way or are otherwise just not undercontrol in ways that are very much owner issues.

	112984 : ["I have a male Australian Shepherd and a female Australian Shepherd-Ibizan Hound-Malinois-Mix. In my opinion no-one who is not willing to spend at least 3-4 hours outside on walks in every weather should own one! And no-one that is to lazy to think of some job for the dogs.  And YES I met a couple who owned two Australian Shepherds. When they told me about it I only could roll my eyes! They never had a dog before... Got two male puppies from the same litter... and ended up VERY unhappy because: \"they need so much attention and exercise... they started fighting each other when they turned about 18 months... they need so much training... they always want something to do or they find something to do themselves...\" I just thought: 1. Someone didn´t do their homework here. NEVER buy a dog just because of it looks! 2. What breeder is so stupid to sell someone who never owned a dog an Australian Shepherd from a working line - let alone 2 males from the same litter. (Yeah, I know the answer. A BYB who wanted to make some money...)  About my female: No-one should own a dog like her that has no experience with shy dogs. Aussies tend sometimes to be shy around new people and situations and Ibizan Hounds do too. She has it from both breeds plus that she is a rescue from Greece that must have been mistreated. So life with her never gets boring and every walk is an experience for itself. Most of the time, when she is on leash, she wears a halti because when she is really afraid of something (like for example umbrellas) she just wants to get away from that situation and I don´t want her to run in front of the next car. It works rather good and she is much calmer when wearing it. I think the mix she is should better not become a breed. Don´t misunderstand me: I really love her but for most people she would be too much.  The worst case of \"definitely got the wrong breed\" was a guy I once met, who was dragged along by his Alaskan Malamute. The guy was about 5feet6 and his dog at least 30inches. The guy was stating that \"if I would have know that they are pulling that much and hard I would never have gotten one\"..............", 10329, "788sif5baa", 3],

Some people think the aesthetics of caligraphy or a character overrides the lack of cultural/personal connection to the artwork. I don't think one necessarily has to be of that culture to appreciate the artwork--but there's a difference appreciating chinese art enough to get it tat'd on you and just picking a chinese character off the wall in a tat parlor. I don't see what makes getting a random word like \"love\" or \"strength\" more effective by putting it in a language you've never spoken a word of.  However, I have a tattoo in latin across my stomach, but that's the original language of the quote, and it's pretty famous and the translation is easy and universally agreed upon (Julius Caesar \"Veni, Vidi, Vici\").", 10331, "eEznnpnVaa", 0],

Some people who think that Dallies aren't good with children Don't allow them to be inside with you. Don't persevere through the puppy stage People who don't bother to socialise them with other animals, children and people Buy them from puppymills or BYB's who don't BAER test Dalmatians require a firm assertive owner who can set boundaries for them early on.  Also one who enjoys walking, running, biking or hiking is a must, whatever the weather.  Otherwise they'll pull the wool over your eyes so fast and start ruling the house, instead of you.  They can become quite destructive without consistent training and regular exercise. I have met somebody who owns a Dallie and shouldn't.

When I did see them take her on that walk, I had Domino out with me at the front of my house (on a leash of course).  As they came past, Tori lunged and barked and carried on at Domino.  I scared me a little.  I asked them why she was like that.  They replied \"Oh, she met a dog once when she was a puppy and she didn't like him, so we didn't take her out to meet other dogs again.\"  Tori is very overweight and lives in the backyard 24/7 and I don't think she's trained very well either.

	113005 : ["The obvious person who shouldn't own a Sheltie is someone who is afraid of grooming a long-haired breed or who cannot handle shedding. Now, I say obvious, but I still remember someone coming on here because their St. Bernard got 'too big', so you just can't tell with some people. I'm sure there are plenty who think Shelties are 'hypoallergenic', 'low shedding', or who, for whatever reason, don't need to be groomed. People who cannot keep up with exercise also shouldn't have a Sheltie. Shelties aren't Border Collies or Aussies, but they can hold their own exercise-wise (which, by the way, I love). Shelties are fairly obedient and easy to train, but they are smart as a whip. They'll obey you, but if you don't pay attention, they'll find their own way around things. Shelties need a strong leader, as they are often very shy. They don't often challenge their owners, as they are not nearly as dominant as most breeds out there, but in uncertain situations, they need someone they can look to to make sure everything is okay. They also need a fair leader. They are usually very willing and eager to please, but WILL NOT respond to harsh punishment or training. Not to say they need rainbows and butterflies and that they cannot deal with correction--but they *do* need someone who can keep things fairly fun and positive, and who can understand when correction is needed and when it is simply easier. Shelties are barkers--someone who either cannot handle it OR control it shouldn't have this breed.  **I don't know many with this breed at all, to be honest.
