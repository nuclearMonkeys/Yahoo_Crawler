	96933 : ["I'd recommend a Subaru Legacy or Outback wagon. Might be a little more $, but very reliable, very spacious, AWD for all the mountain passes. and gets 26-30 on the freeway for gas mileage. City not as good but sounds like you'll be doing highway miles mostly.  You can also find an Outback Sport for much less that is still a wagon so spacious, but not quite as big so better gas mileage and less $. Still AWD too which is always good. These are both also very reliable cars I have an 05 Legacy wagon that my girlfriend and I have slept in several times comfortably at parties when we were not safe to drive. I'm 6' 200 lbs so theres room. Couple sleeping bags and we were good to go because the seats fold down completely flat", 9604, "syjxMRhmaa", 0],
	96934 : ["The meaning of Trossevin come may come from a profession, such as the name \"Carpenter\" which was given to woodworkers. Some of these craft-based family names can be a profession in some other language. For this reason it is good to understand the country of origin of a name, and the languages spoken by its progenitors. Many names like Trossevin originate from religious texts like the Bhagavadgītā, the Quran, the Bible, and so forth. Commonly these family names are shortened versions of a religious phrase such as \"Favored of God\".", 9600, "U2mCryFJaa", 1],

Elane, for example, or Melane... Delaney is another one... Or maybe you could name your child after a famous road like Abbey Rue or Rue Abbey or Brooke Lane, because I am sure there are different roads with this name throughout the world:) The name Rue means road in French, which is another option:) What about naming her Patricia Wae?

	96938 : ["I work at a Lexus dealership, and the ES350 is a pretty nice ride.  The engine has a nice snappy acceleration, and a good amount of power.  It also rides and handles great.  The inside materials all feel like exceptional quality, and the dash has a unique styling to it.  The stereo system rocks , and the seats have cooling and heating.  The Toyota Avalon, on the other hand, is also a very nice car.  I have only driven one once or twice, and is somewhat similar to the ES350, but if you want a car that feels great and drives well, the ES350 is for you.", 9602, "c479977bd0678f178337c56004da2752aa", 0],

	96958 : ["People might make fun of me for saying so, but look at the new Hyundai Sonata. It's a nice car and they have the best warranty you can get these days. 10 years or 100,000 miles.  You can't beat them for the value. You get alot for the money.  Older hyundais were piles of junk. In the last 5 years or so Hyundai has really come full circle and they are making some pretty decent cars these days. If you read any of the automotive magazines you will hear the same thing.  I personally like Hondas. I have had several and they all have taken me well over 100k miles without any major issues. In fact my last accord had 236,000 miles on the odometer before I sold it.. it still ran great.  Toyota's are also good but they tend to be a bit more \"squishy\" for lack of a better term. They are not drivers cars. The susepensions are soft, the brakes are spongy and there isn't all that much steering feel. But... they are comfortable and reliable and are good on gas..  Hondas are just as reliable and economical but tend to be a bit more stiff. They handle a little better, have stiffer braking and have much better steering feel. It depends on what you are looking for. Some people prefer the comfort and some prefer a more sporty feel.  I would stay away from american cars.  They are all struggling to turn a profit these days and there is a reason for it.  People say buy american... what does that mean? GM is a huge multi-national operation with headquarters all over the world. Your GM could be built in mexico.  Same is true for Chrysler and Ford as well.  Most hondas are built in the US.  So the idea of buying American has lost it's meaning. the big automakers are truly multi-national corporations.", 9604, "e1ec036988398a4d89da52072850d37daa", 0],
	96959 : ["I think the new Dodge Caliber (replaced the Dodge Neon) is a sweet car, MSRP starts at 14K. Remember to negotiate down from the MSRP and not from a dealer markup! Some try to get you to negotiate between the dealer markup and the MSRP-- but you're still overpaying. You want to pay LESS than MSRP.  Focus has a $2500 rebate right now and MSRP starts at around 14K as well.   Remember you probably wont get the highest value for your trade in-- dealerships rarely do give you top dollar.
