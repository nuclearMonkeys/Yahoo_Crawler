Smartphone cameras on the other hand aim to make whatever scene is in front of it look as clear as possible on screen for an app to capture it. This is one reason why the point-and-shoot camera relinquished its hold on beginner photographers. The phone makes everything easier. Given those, camera manufacturers will continue making cameras the way they do. Even with the new generation of point-and-shoot cameras, the focus is still on control. The mere fact that someone who doesn't know much about photography but buys an expensive Sony RX100 instead of depending on his phone is already controlling the size of the sensor he prefers to shoot with. Those in the know understand fully that given an adept camera, they can get far much better photos than any smartphone out there.  So why not put the automated technology of smartphones in a camera? They already did and continue doing it. Samsung showed the camera-world how to make a smartcamera and then dropped out from the race completely. Sony integrated smart features to some of its models. Nikon and Canon are making it easier for users to connect their cameras to a network or the internet already. Cameras are evolving. The other way around is a bit more difficult. The trend with phones is to make them smaller and thinner to the point of bending and flexing them. Real cameras need bulk and space for its parts, some still mechanical. Blame Physics for those needed dimensions to make it better but don't worry. Engineers will always find a way.

The most obvious difference between the BM & Sony is that the BM has a 2.86 smaller sensor, thus it will produce 2.86 stops more depth of field than the Sony.  The use of a Metabones Speed Booster will help here, and when coupled with a fast f/0.95 lens, the difference in DOF is likely not to be a concern.  The problem, however, is that AF performance often suffers (greatly sometimes) when using adapted lenses.  For those who need continuous AF tracking and that shallow DOF look, this can be a dealbreaker.", 6927, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],

The accuracy of an image is completely dependent upon the focal length of the lens used to make the photo.  So regardless if the image is flipped or not, it may or may not be accurate at all. The human face looks symmetrical, but it really is not.  It's hard to notice the difference when looking at other people's faces, but when looking at your own, then it is rather obvious. Thus, the most accurate rendition of the human face must be taken with a lens around 43~50mm which has a perspective very close to the human eye.  The image must not be flipped, too. Since smartphones use very wide-angle lenses (equivalent to about 24~28mm in full-frame format), they produce a lot of wide-angle distortion.  This distortion is similar to that of side view mirrors on your car or motorcycle.  For this reason, there's a sticker that reads \"Objects are closer than they appear.\"  In a photo, this distortion causes the human face to look wider (i.e. fatter) and the chin, nose and forehead to look bulbous.  This is why no one should take a closeup photo of people with a smartphone. Mirrors can be made to make people look taller and skinnier or shorter and fatter.  Anyone who's gone to an amusement park has seen their reflection in those fun-house mirrors.  It's common for clothing stores to have mirrors that make customers look thinner to improve sales.  So unless your mirror is very flat, it's not accurate either.", 6939, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],

Like a hammer, cameras are simply tools designed for specific tasks.  If you go to homedepot.com and do a search for hammers, you will see that there are a bunch of different kinds.  There are roofing, framing, and sledgehammers to name a few.  Just like these hammers, cameras are designed for specific users with specific needs.  The entry-level models like a Canon T series, Nikon D3xxx series, Sony A5xxx, etc... are designed for the most common types of photos that the average non-enthusiast consumer would likely want to make.  Other models like the Nikon D850, Canon 70D are designed for sports/wildlife.  The Canon 5DS R and other high-megapixel cameras are designed for landscape shooters and/or those who need to make huge prints.  Cameras like the Canon 5D Mark IV, 1Dx, Nikon D6 are designed for pros like photojournalists who shoot all sorts of stuff ranging from sports, social events, wars, to rope cutting events. Your needs and budget will dictate which model will be best for you.
