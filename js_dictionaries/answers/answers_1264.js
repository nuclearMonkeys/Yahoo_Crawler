	68749 : ["I think the time has come to ban greyhound racing.  I have yet to hear of a single operation that treats the dogs humanely.  The sport itself is not the problem as these dogs love to run; it's how the dogs are used and treated - it follows with the hardness of the gambling industry it's associated with. No way greyhounds as a breed will disappear.  There are too many people who love the breed.  We have a greyhound group that comes to our small community every year and people love to come and see them.  Many are retired racers and the owners would never have any other breed.  If there were no more rescue greyhounds, they would get them from breeders.   My mother-in-law has a pet whippet.  This breed is not used any longer for commercial racing and yet it is still around.  So are all the other sighthound breeds.  So it's a stupid comment.", 8473, "8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa", 5],
	68750 : ["I've noticed many answers that jump right into something they know nothing about.  The owner of a race track has NOTHING yes NOTHING to do with the quality of animals being raced nor do they have any knowledge of how the animals are being treated.  This is because the racing secretary is in charge with that side of the track.  Often times the owner doesn't even frequent his track.   Many tracks sponsor (publicly and privately) rescue organizations for retired racers, be it horses or greyhounds and these rescues will still be overfilled with these animals if you ended racing.  What will happen to that funding?   I've known several people who have had active racing greyhounds and their dogs are treated marginally better than some people's kids.  The same goes with horses.  Perhaps instead of focusing on BANNING (hello, isn't this America?) racing, stricter legislation should be put into place to help maintain a decent quality of life for these dogs.", 8473, "F03UbGA3aa", 1],
	68751 : ["This is an extremely emotive topic and while I have nothing to do with the racing game, I do own two retired racers through an adoption program..  As to the track owners comment, greyhounds have been around since ancient Egypt, so while you may see a decrease in the breeding numbers ( which may not be a bad thing) I doubt this beautiful animal would disappear. More and more people are  becoming aware of them and their amazing qualities as a pet through the tireless work of adoption programs world wide. Like all industries there are good and bad within racing and there always will be despite much being done in Australia to 'clean up' the racing industry.The majority of owners/trainers do care for their animal otherwise they are not successful on the track. It makes sense to look after the animal. Certainly greys don't have to race/run to be happy but they DO love to run/chase and love to race (chase). It's what they are breed to do.

	68768 : ["Personally I prefer horse racing.  With greyhounds, there isn't really any way to tell who's better, unless you see who poops or pees before the race, so in my mind, it's pretty pointless.  I have also heard how they \"dispose of\" the \"bad\" racers.  It's awful.  Greyhound racing isn't a sport, like horseracing, and, although you can win money off of it (gambling), even that has been waning lately.  There doesn't seem to be much interest in it by gamblers, which means there really isn't a point to do it. *Patiently awaiting the thumbs downs that come from that* ADDITION:  I don't think the breed will die out because there's no racing, it just won't be exploited.  There are many people that love the breed, so the good breeders just need to get back into it.", 8473, "AA11026827", 0],
	68769 : ["I have seriously been thinking when we have the extra room adopting a retired greyhound racer.    I'm in support of banning it as well.

	68770 : ["I am absolutely against Greyhound racing.  I am against anything that exploits animals for human profit and/or entertainment.  If people had any idea how the dogs are treated, I think most everyone would be against it.  Then again, some humans see animals as lesser creatures and are perfectly fine with very cruel treatment of them.  Puppy mills get away with things you only imagine to be in horror movies.  I can't count the number of times I've heard the phrase, \"It's ONLY a ______!\" (Fill in the blank with dog, cat, etc.)  Animals feel pain and misery just the same way we do, yet some people have no problem causing this pain and misery.  I can imagine the uproar if someone said, \"It's ONLY a child!\" when presented with a case a child abuse.  Both animals and children are defenseless when it comes to adult humans, yet apparently animals do not deserve the protection that children do.  I wholeheartedly disagree. Anyway, back to the point - yes, I am against Greyhound racing.", 8473, "AA10245205", -1],
