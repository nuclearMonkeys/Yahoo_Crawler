If money was so tight that I could not afford a phone solution (even a prepaid cell with limited minutes), I would have to cancel the trip. There is no way on hell I would leave my wife by herself without a phone or any money. Your husband obviously made an unwise decision, but you must realize it was just a mistake. You can believe he was wrong and try to convince him if you want, but staying mad at him for it will not likely benefit your relationship. I suggest you let him know this is the last time you will accept something like this and that there will be consequences for future negligence -not out of spite but rather to help him understand the importance of the matter, regardless of his opinions.", 11132, "None", 1],

So there should have been some compromise.  Maybe your husband should have made everything was stable before leaving such as fixing the tire on the car or maybe suggest to get a USB to hook up a house phone to the computer in the event you need him in an emergency.  Being that none of this was done your only other option is to maybe ask a girl-friend to stay with you that has a cell phone this way you are neither alone nor lost with out a phone.  Im sure any woman will understand your predicament.  Forgive your husband because he is a man and men don't consider the \"what ifs\" so they assume everything will be fine.

	132332 : ["Since you have previously shown your antipathy toward evolution and learning what it actually involves, it is probably pointless for me to give serious consideration to your question. Nevertheless I will try. Organisms evolve to fit their environment. Once they fit in their environment, they do not evolve into something else unless the environment changes. Present-day monkeys fit into their environment quite well, so there is no pressure for them to evolve into something else. What makes a species evolve into a new species is a change in their environment. The environmental pressure of the change brings natural selection to bear. If a species is too specialized to adapt to the change in the environment, especially if the change is extreme, it invariably becomes extinct. Present-day monkeys, apes, and man all had a common ancestor a long time ago. Sometime after that, humans and apes had a common ancestor separate from the monkeys. At some point, a separate population of the common ancestor of humans and apes found itself in an environment that was different from the original environment and it evolved to fit in that environment--very likely because of a change in climate that caused a part of the original tropical forest to become open grassland. It was that population that evolved into humans. Apes are partially bipedal, and the common ancestor was also likely partially bipedal. Improvements in that trait were selected for in the population that branched off from the common ancestor since bipedalism proved to be an advantage in that new environment. Other traits were also selected for and eventually modern humans developed. Other populations of the common ancestor remained in the tropical forests, so any changes that occurred with them just were to fit in their environment better, and became the great apes of today--the chimps, gorillas, and orangutans. There is considerable evidence that humans evolved from a common ancestor with apes. Here are two sites with some of that evidence.", 11135, "sdS6tLTPaa", 3],
	132333 : ["1. We didn't evolve from monkeys. We evolved from a common ancestor with the apes. 2. All evolutionary changes are, are adaptions. That's it. Let's say there were Chimps in Africa and Chimps in Europe. Let's say there was a climate change in Africa. Sooner or later the Chimps in Africa could be considered a different species after enough evolutionary changes occur. The ones in Europe would still be changing at a normal pace. 3. We won't evolve back into anything. I have no idea where the hell you got this delusion from.", 11135, "None", 4],

	132338 : ["This is one of the only times I've disagreed with \"Bonny\".  I do think it was inappropriate for a FASHION magazine.  It does have racial undertones and does perpetuate the image of the beastly, hyper sexual (possibly dangerous, which excites a lot of white women, who are the primary purchasers of this magazine btw), aggressive black male and the soft, sweet, innocent white woman.  I'm a huge Lebron James fan and I know he IS a beast on the court, but this wasn't a Sports Illustrated magazine cover (which would have been appropriate to illustrate his dominance in the sports world), its basically a fashion/women's magazine.  I personally believe it was an very shrewd and intentional marketing strategy.  I believe they KNEW it would be met with controversy, but not enough to be considered down-right racist, an I'm willing to bet the sales are THROUGH THE ROOF, as a result.   Let's face it, white America DOES NOT want to see a large, studly black man with his massive arms around THEIR standard of beauty.
