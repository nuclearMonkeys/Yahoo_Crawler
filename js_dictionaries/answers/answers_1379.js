You can't believe both things...they are diametrically opposed.  The thing is...Christians believe, somehow, that Jesus ushered in a great long period of perfect peace.  I'm confused.

My GySgt couldn t believe what I  had just done and thought I had somehow cheated on the qualifying (he was standing right there and watched me shoot!).  So I was ordered to redo the qualificaion and the results were pretty much the same.  I was then ordered to have an eye exam and I tested as having 20/8 vision which as you know from reading this thread is very rare.  Many years later I had to have 2 major back surgeries and for several months after I needed heavy doses of morphine to control the pain.  After coming off the morphine I noticed my vosion wasn t nearly as acute as before and a trip to my eye doctor reveled that the extended use of morphine had actually ruined my close up eyesight and I needed to wear glasses.  My distance vision had changed slightly but I was still able to read freeway signs long before most people could even SEE the letters on the sign much less actually be able to READ what the sign said.

	74589 : ["Read Mark S. answer very carefully. edit: I should have put this first: Since all of Judaism remains messianic to beleive what God promises regarding the Davidic messiah, no, of course believing Jews do not observe   or any Christian holy day. Christianity is not Judaism and is antithetical to it. Jewish messianic belief is intact and unaltered by the New Testament messianic belief. The New Testament belief is not messianic judaism despite the identity theft of name.  You reveal you have no understanding of God's covenant with Israel and absolutely no love for what Jews really are or for our right to be Jews and or/for Judaism when you write this \"As a Gentile Believer I have a love for the Jewish people and a understanding of what God is doing with the Jewish people. Since I have come to know Christ (age 17 and now I am 32) I have had a deep respect and appreciation for the Jews and their ways, I mean Jesus was a Jew! So why dont Christians , when they come to know Christ, stop following the pagan ways and follow the life Jesus lived and follow Torah and celebrate the other traditions that Messianic Jews do. \" If you had a genuine respect for Jews you would not admonish us to violate Torah by imposing worship forbidden by God's commandments into Jewish observances.  Jesus being a Jew is no more reason to violate the Torah of Judaism than it would be reason for any Christian to disrespectfully claim that if a group of NON Christians decided to worship Satan and call it completed Christianity that made Satanic worship Christian. You cannot follow the Torah if you believe in the doctrine of the New Testament replacement theology that redefines almost everything about Torah and Judaism to impose antithetical concepts about the nature of God, and the nature and role of the Davidic Messiah..to the nature of humans and our relationship as humans all equal before God.  Believing Jews await what God promised in the Davidic Messiah..but our faith and our eternal covenant is intact and fulfilling without his presence in the world. The world is evidence we are not in a post messianic age. To help you understand why no Jew in the world who believes in the Jewish messianic belief adheres to the New Testament replacement theology and tounderstand from a biblical perspective read    and tolearn more Rabbi Federow has also come out with a book titled Judaism and Christianity: a Contrast. Hanukkah is a festival that celebrates a victory over religious intolerance and an attempt to assimilate the Jews out of existence with a form of worship very similar to what the Christian evangelical movement hijacking the name of Judaism and misappropriating Jewish observances today does! You couldn'[t DISHONOR the purpose of the festival of lights of Hanukkah any more egregiously than to tie worship of or through Jesus to Hanukkah ..well imposing ANYother religion's worship or deity into Hanukkah is a violation of it.  The festival CAN be respected as a celebration of religious freedom..by all people, but it does not honor any OTHER religion. see these past answer to explain the purpose of Hanukkah and to help you understand why what you ask does not show any deep resepct for Jews to BE Jewish and honor our eternal covenant with our Creator.     All believing Jews DO believe in God's promise of a messianic age and it is BECAUSE we believe that we could never abandon that for what the New Testament has to offer..(not all Jews believe that it must be an individual)  Now that I've sincerely tried to help you understand that your admonition to impose Jesus worship into Judaism is not respectful you can understand why ****you recognized beforehand your post would be offensive.*** with your disclaimer.  You still have an opportunity to educate yourself on this matter and learn just how contradictory the two religions are if you do the comparative analysis for yourself.
