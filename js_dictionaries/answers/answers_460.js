	25308 : ["Purpose of Wisdom Teeth According to the Smithsonian Institution, hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago, our wisdom teeth were meant to help us chew. They allowed early humans to grind away on tougher food items when our jaws were wider and could accommodate our last molars. Today, it's a different story. Over time, we've developed smaller jaws — which often means less room for the final molars to erupt.What Age Do Wisdom Teeth Come In?Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last of the permanent teeth to make an appearance. They typically will erupt for most between the ages of 17 and 21.According to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, they show up during your high school and college years — but wisdom teeth start growing at a much earlier age, usually 7-10 years old. A study from Imaging Science in Dentistry notes the entire process takes years and is unique:The tooth calcifiesThe crown begins to formThe root developsAnd finally, the teeth emerge through the gumsMen typically see their wisdom teeth before women. And it's usually the upper molars that are appearing first.Signs of EruptionAccording to the Oral Health Foundation, it's possible you could experience some pain and discomfort as your wisdom teeth breakthrough. Fortunately, that should cease after the tooth and teeth have fully emerged. Some don't experience any symptoms at all. If you experience soreness or pain, over-the-counter pain relievers or gently swishing warm saltwater in the mouth usually does the trick.Do This 60 Seconds Dental Trick Before Going To Bed Tonight To Rebuild Your Teeth And Gums And Get Rid of Tooth Decay", 3997, "hgsLKiq5aa", 0],

Their purpose, coming in when they do. Was to push the teeth and fill in the gaps lost  during the teen/young adult years. Some have the room for them to come in without any issues. For others they will push the teeth to close and cause issues. That is provided they come in properly in the first place. For myself, I was 23/24 before they gave me any issue.
