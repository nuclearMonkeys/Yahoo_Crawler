	26385 : ["Depends on how much money you (or your parents) have to spend and how much time you're willing to devote to your pet. Since you're just a kid, you probably have school and other, more important things to attend to and that's only going to become more of an issue the older you get. I'm also going to refrain from assuming anything about your ability to be responsible or not - the other answerers have done enough of that already. So how about some rats? Rats are very good pets if you're looking for an animal that's interactive and trainable, but not so high maintenance that you're going to be overwhelmed with having to walk them, socialize them .etc. when/if you start to get busier with other things. Feed them a good lab block (a pellet/kibble type food for rodents, found in most pet shops) as the base of their diet and then offer them a variety of different 'human' foods to keep things fun and interesting for them. Raw, fresh veggies are kind of the holy grail of things to give them, but pet rats can eat just about anything you can with very few exceptions. Just don't feed them too much junk food or meat. This is a good guide. In case you don't read it, the gist is: raw beans are poisonous (cooked are fine), the seeds of fruit that humans don't normally eat are poisonous (so no apple seeds, orange pips or peach pits, but the fruit itself is fine), green potatoes are poisonous and the skin and seed of avocados are poisonous (but the actual fruit is fine). Male rats should also never eat mangoes or oranges in any form, but girls can eat them no problem.  Keep them in a decent cage with another rat of the same gender for company. A lot of websites overcomplicate things and state that they need a specific size or type of cage and I personally disagree with that. Just use some common sense when you select a cage: the rats need to be able to get away from each other AND have enough space for their toys, hides, bowls .etc. If money is an issue, you can purchase a rabbit or guinea pig cage instead (they're larger but for less money) and have one of your parents help you secure 1/2 inch wire mesh (home depot and similar places will have it) all over the cage so the rats won't squeeze out of it.  Aspen wood shavings, shredded newspaper and pricier paper-based beddings like carefresh are all decent options. Clean the cage once weekly, but check the cage daily for uneaten/hidden food and spot clean areas they poop/pee in a lot. Toilet paper rolls are nifty chews, too. They also appreciate hammocks, hides (either purchased or DIY, such as an empty tissue box), tunnels (either purchased or DIY, such as cut PVC pipe), little willow balls and many, many other things. No wheels or exercise balls, though. They are very sociable once they get used to you and they can be taught to do tricks. The below link lists only a handful of the many things they can be trained to do: They need to be given at least ONE HOUR of your attention everyday, but you don't have to actually play with them during this time if you aren't up to it for whatever reason. Ratproofing a room and sitting down to do your homework, read, play a video game .etc. while they're loose is OK as long as you listen intently to what they're doing and the room is not escapable without some very persistent, prolonged rattie shenanigans. Ratproofing is as follows: make sure they can't chew on any wires or eat anything that's going to make them sick (cleaning products, soap, medicines .etc.) and make sure they cannot find their way inside of or under any furniture. Block or patch up any holes/openings anywhere they can fit their heads through (if the head fits, the body follows) and you're pretty much set. I also find if you give them things to do while they free roam, they're less likely to bother with trying to get out in the first place. Examples of things for them to do: Pea fishing -  Dig box -  DIY maze -  They'll be amused by any sort of cardboard box or thing to hide in, as well as blankets or towels piled up on the floor for burrowing, too.", 4151, "DSnkjNXJaa", -4],
