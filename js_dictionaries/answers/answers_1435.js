	77418 : ["That sounds about right for a real speed with that advertised speed. Keep in mind that the advertised speed is just to your ISP, so if you go any further, it will be slower. As with most things, the advertised speed is also the best that it can possibly be, not the normal speed. That said, you can try the following things to get your speed a little faster: -Make sure your cable modem is attached to one of the two cables coming off of the first split of the cable line coming into your house. Every split of the cable means less speed. - Secure your wireless network. If the neighbors use your network, your network will be slower. - Try the following site for a reliable speed test. It also allows you to compare your speed with other people's speed from your ISP, and even see the speeds people are getting on other ISPs in your area.

	77429 : ["Well done in losing the weight so far. It's great you are making an effort!  Firstly I would say that it would be important to have a chat with your doc first regarding doing strenuous exercise right now, obviously I can't see you to gauge how big you really are/were but when you are quite badly overweight (if you were) there is a small but serious risk of heart problems from over exertion and diabetes too which could be a problem when your blood sugars drop in exercise. Providing all that is fine, which I'm sure it is. I would say take it nice and slow for a few weeks and get a nice base level of fitness built up and condition the body slightly to punching exercises. I was always fit but even as a teenager I rocked up at the boxing gym, got smashed then couldn't move for days!! And don't worry bout being a noob either. It's part of it. I used to get battered when I started! I'd buy a Punchbag to begin with, do a nice daily slow jog then hit the bag for a while and let your shoulders get used to it. Then pop along to your nearest amatuer boxing gym. They are all levels of fitness that go, fat guys, girls, kids etc. It don't matter so don't let that worry you. No one will throw you in at the deep end. Do what you are comfortable with and just stay dedicated. don't worry bout push ups and all that stuff, your too heavy just now-same reason why bodybuilders can't do pull ups! All that will come in time.  You can safely and healthly loose 2lbs a week just by changing your diet too and I'd recommend paying attention to that. 5 or 6 small high protein meals a day are the way forward as it keeps your metabolism high. Eat things like chicken, tuna steak, fish etc with plenty veg, salad and fruit. This is the hardest thing to stick to! It's the key to weight loss though!  After a few months you will be fitter, lighter and ready to start sparring. Your coach will handle all that and if it's any sort of gym they won't just throw you in with champions! You will learn in your own time and at a level that suits you. So to summarise! . Take it slow, spend a good few weeks just jogging and punching . Head down to your local gym. Don't stress and just have fun . Sort the diet out-its the most important thing . Get sparring and start having a few amateur fights. And remember that boxers like buster Douglass and James toney regularly got up to obese size...but they lost the weight and still remained competitive.
