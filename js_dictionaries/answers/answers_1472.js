But that doesn't mean that you will have a bad experience, all i know is that they take a more \"natural\" approach at pregnancy and at times leave you to feel confused and unheard.  What I do know about losing your mucus plug is that usually you lose it in 1 or 2 pieces, not multiple over a period of a month, but that doesn't mean its not possible.  What you explained you saw in the toilet after your nap does kind of sound like a mucus plug though.  And the back pain could be early contractions.  Its good that the contractions you are having in the front aren't painful, but it does concern me a little about your back pains (although that could just be from the extra weight you are carrying).  My suggestion would be to contact a obgyn if your midwife continues to ignore your concerns.  It doesn't make much sense that she is basing the babies weight on you and your husbands height like you said.  I do think it is very possible that you are further along than she thinks.  I would suggest to maybe go visit a doctor at least once to see what he/she says, it wouldn't hurt.  Is your midwife supervised by a doctor?  Im pretty sure they are by law suppose to be now a days.

	79266 : ["Actually you have it a little wrong. About 300,000 years ago, humans brains began to be like they are today due to a change in how we synthesize omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.  This allowed our brains to have much more of the \"right\" fats needed for developing a large number of neurons.  This is in contrast to Neanderthal who did not have this gene. About 70,000 humans were reduced to only a few 10,000s of thousands of people, potentially by the Toba disaster.  It is clear that this population bottleneck weeded out the \"dumbest\" of the humans.  However, humanity was unable to spread worldwide at that time because it was the middle of an ice age. About 12,000 years ago, the glaciers began to melt and homo sapiens left Africa.  Genetics show that humans discovered and bred with Neanderthal as well as two other less well know proto-human races.  About 9,000 years ago, humans in China, India and Arabia started the widespread planting seeds instead of following herd animals.  They have been planting seeds for 20,000 years before that in Africa, as well as domesticating the dog.  The reason it became widespread ~9k years back is because the glaciers had retreated far enough for the world weather patterns to begin to stabilize where they are today.  This development of agricultre lead to EVERYTHING we have today, from a written Bible to iPads. It was impossible to develop farming 300,000 years ago, because our brains were not smart enough. It was impossible to develop farming 70,000 years ago, because we didn't need to.  We lived in a lush garden of Eden with plentiful game. We DID develop farming 9,000 years ago because we NEEDED to.  There were vast lands, but the newly smart hunters (us) kept killing all of the game.  We did this because the new, very,very smart humans (us) killed a lot more of the wild game than the Neanderthals ever could.  When we killed all the game, we had to figure out a way to feed ourselves. But hey, instead of believing that, we can always believe that some dead Rabbi 4,000 years ago wrote down the story of how the world was created in 7 days.  I mean, maybe God used to do miracles in the ancient past but now we're not good enough - right? OR-  Christians can adapt like I have.  I can believe in Science and God, AT THE SAME TIME.  It's really quite amazing.  I just decided, \"Hmm, maybe the Bible is a bunch of allegory, instead of facts?  And what is really important is living the life that Jesus laid out - loving our neighbor and being open minded.\"  But hey, maybe I'm just going to hell for it too.  I'm leaving that up to Jesus to judge me.", 8976, "8hrOUr1Naa", 2],

	79272 : ["Two years and a half years ago, Cane shows up in town from Australia, and he worked as a bartender at Indigo when Neil first opened the place. He supposedly came to town looking for his birth mom, and he went online to one of those chat rooms for adoptees and shared his story with other people online. Well, Amber Moore, who was also fairly new in town at the time and looking to rub elbows with the rich and powerful people of GC, heard about Mrs. C's nightmares and memories of the baby swap, wanted to help track down this missing person, and got into the same chat room that Cane was posting in, read his story and found out he was in GC, and somehow she met up with him and realized he was Neil's new bartender and possibly Jill's long lost son (the baby that Kay switched). Once everything unraveled, Cane was discovered to be Jill's real bio son, and the dead Phillip3, who perished in a car crash in 1989, was the baby that Kay had put in his place. There was supposed to have been an exhumation and DNA test done on the dead man in the Chancellor grave at Kay's estate that proved he wasn't Jill's son, but recent developments say that there is no record of such a DNA test ever taking place. Also, after Cane became settled into Kay and Jill's lives, Kay offered him a job at Chancellor, which he turned down at first, then accepted later on. Shortly after taking the job, he made a suspicious phone call to someone name Langley (the man he claimed was is uncle in Australia), and told the person on the other end that he was in and that they had to practically beg him to take the job. The phone call or Cane's association with Langley was never revisited until Cane and Lily's wedding day, when Cane was alone in the church and he had a flashback to the phone call. That one flashback confirmed or at the very least suggested that Cane is not who he has been claiming to be for the past two years. Nina Webster, widow of the \"late\" Phillip3, has been in town ever since Kay and Murphy's wedding, and from the get-go, she's has a really bad vibe about Cane and that he could be a fraud. Since she is also a writer by profession, she spoke to a movie producer who wanted to make a movie of Mrs. C's memoirs and who wanted Nina to write the screenplay. Since the baby swap/long lost son/grandson story was such a big part of Kay's life, Nina wanted to include it in the screenplay. However, everytime she tried to interview Cane about his past and the woman he thought was his mom (Violet Montgomery), he became very evasive and almost unnerved, which only heightened Nina's suspicions that he is not who he says he is. So, she is now probing further to find out who Cane really is, in addition to trying to find out more about her dead husband, since there is a possibility that their son, Phillip4, could have a genetic disease that he may have inherited from his dad.", 8980, "gEd1jlOEaa", 2],

Once it is out the only thing separating your baby from the outside world is the cervix and membrane, so cleanliness is important.
