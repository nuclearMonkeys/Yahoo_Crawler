	1271 : ["I'm afraid you're the one who's confused.  There's no such thing as a \"non-specific antibody.\"  Each antibody is specific for a particular antigen.  At any given moment you have antibodies circulating against any number of pathogens--both those developed against viruses you've been previously exposed to, as well as against viruses for which you have been previously vaccinated. But as long as there is no ongoing invasion by one of those pathogens, then the amount of any one type of circulating antibody is not very high. If you are infected with a pathogen for which you have antibody \"memory,\" then yes, the immune response will crank up and specific B cells which produce the appropriate antibody will preferentially proliferate, and for a time, the specific antibody they produce will predominate in your system, and outnumber all other antibodies that are specific for different pathogens. But as the infection is brought under control and the pathogen is dealt with, then the response ramps down, because most of the active plasma cells (the B cells that are secreting antibodies specific for that particular pathogen) die off--all that's left are the memory B & T cells which stick around in case there's yet another exposure to that same pathogen. That's the way your body makes antibodies, whether it's in response to an actual infection or to a vaccine.  In very rare cases, ANY vaccine may result in an autoimmune dysregulation, for reasons that nobody really understands very well, but that is possible with ANY vaccine, not just the ones for C-virus, and again, it's extremely rare. With these mRNA vaccines, the only real dfference is that it's our own cells that are producing and releasing antigen (the so-called spike protein) encoded in the injected mRNA, instead of directly injecting that antigen. But that mRNA does NOT stick around for long. RNA  in general is highly labile and is degraded quickly in the cell. That's part of its normal job--our own mRNA is just a disposable, working copy of a gene, that only sticks around long enough to have some protein translated off of it, then it's rapidly destroyed.  Same with these mRNA vaccines--cells pump out spike protein, then that mRNA gets chewed up.  Meanwhile the spike protein floats around and antibodies are generated in reponse to it.  And as long as those antibodies were generated in a T cell-dependent manner, then a long-term cache of \"memory\" B cells will exist, ready to crank things up if the vaccinated person is exposed to the C-virus. But like any other memory B cells, these remain quiescent unless the specific pathogen against which they were generated makes an appearance.  If you've been vaccinated against SARS CoV-2, but you never get exposed to it, then you will still have memory cells that lie in wait. They may never get called upon, in which case you'll have a small \"club\" of COVID-19 memory cells that just sit around doing nothing for the rest of your life.  Or some infected person coughs in your face, in which case you're off to the races.", 214, "5183e4343a3b662ae1a4d68f375ccc5aaa", 1],
