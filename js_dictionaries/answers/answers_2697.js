You've only been together for a month, give it time...take things slow and really get to know each other and understand each other so you can fall in love with him.  I told my current boyfriend after 6 months that I loved him on his birthday, I wasn't completely in love with him but I was falling in love with him and knew the feeling would come very soon because I felt like he was the only person I ever wanted to be with and I never wanted our relationship to come to an end.  So take it slow, let the feeling come naturally and say it whenever it feels right because you don't want to feel guilty about it when you really don't mean it.", 11479, "b9Cw25WVaa", 0],

Love is more than what you say, it's what you do!

After talking to IRS yesterday they told me basically the same of what I can see above: things are being delayed about 1 week, so we should be getting refund by 2/21. But she also said this could be sooner. This has nothing to do with something wrong in the returns, she said my return was not even processed yet. I guess it is really just a delay due to huge number of returns eFiled, and they use the 9001 code to indicate that those returns are a bit late. I read that IRS has upgraded the systems to try to detect identify theft frauds, so I'm wondering if this delay may be a system issue and not only due to the number of returns. Anyway, it looks we should get our refunds pretty soon, hopefully not later than 1 week from the expected date. If someone has new news, pls post here. Thanks !", 11476, "kHenq8MFaa", 0],
