	13268 : ["Wanting fame is the worst possible reason for getting into acting.  Real actors – people who have talent, intelligence and the right personalities to become professionals – aren't even slightly interested in being famous.  It's a shallow, silly dream for naïve, rather superficial kids. Only try to be an actor if you just love to act – and would do it even if you could see into the future and knew for sure that you would never ever get a big role in anything. Typically, getting to the point where you might get signed by an agent and get a real audition for a paid role takes at least seven years.  It also takes huge talent, determination, dedication and incredible luck. But most actors will never get more than a few odd days' paid acting work a year, in small roles, in small productions.  They never become known at all - definitely not famous!", 2213, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 1],

Improve and acting classes are great therapy, but I should warn you that it could also cause the opposite result where it ruins your confidence and even sends you into deeper depression. There's a lot of (constructive) criticism and pressure involved, or you might realize you're not as good as you thought you were, or the audience (your fellow group members/students and teacher) might not laugh. I don't know you, but make sure you can handle something like that. See a therapist and see if they recommend it at all.", 2215, "None", 3],

	13301 : ["If you're interested in acting, it's never to late to start!  Acting can be a fun, creative outlet and a way to meet people and make friends.   But fame is a terrible reason to go into acting, regardless of your age.  Most actors never become famous, and fame is temporary.  There are far more \"has beens\" then there are famous actors. Since you enjoyed acting in high school, try starting with some acting classes.  You can also look into community theater in your area.  Often they have open auditions that anyone can go to.  You can even try getting together with others and make your own short film for fun and to see what's all involved.  You need to figure out if you really love the craft of acting - auditioning, analyzing a script, building a character, memorizing lines and blocking, rehearsing, taking direction, working with a cast and crew as well as performing.  And you need to see if you're good at. Understand that more professional acting is a business.  There aren't a bunch of open auditions that anyone can go to.  For most professional work you have to be invited to audition, usually through an agent.  And you can't just hire an agent, it's more like they choose you.  Attempting a professional acting careers basically starting and running business where you are the product being marketed and sold.  In addition to craft of acting, you need to understand the business end of things: casting (agents, casting directors, breakdowns); legal issues (contracts, unions, taxes); marketing (head shots, resume, show reel, website, social media) and networking.  It's a huge investment of time, effort and money with no guarantee that you'll ever get a single role, let alone be famous.  Scams and rip offs prey on people who mistakenly think people are just \"discovered\".  You need to be able to make good business decisions for a professional acting career. So maybe for now just focus on learning and growing as an actor locally.  Then research the business end of things to see if that's the right move for you. Good luck.", 2213, "4dIdBbOhaa", 1],
