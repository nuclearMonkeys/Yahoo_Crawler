	4026 : ["Re. your update, I speak a couple of European languages and I've never heard what you describe.  I'm also in fairly close touch with my family back in France.  Not saying it's untrue, just that it's not as obvious as you suggest.", 668, "P8dIznazaa"],
	4027 : ["On Earth, we have a rather dramatic transition from gas (our atmosphere) to solid (the Earth's crust). That sharp transition creates a medium in which we can easily move through the air but receive enough resistance from the solid that it can support us -", 668, "None"],
	4028 : ["What is your temperature? Ninety-nine point eight bananas? I am being facetious for an important reason. You MUST give a unit when quoting the value of something. If your temperature was 99.8 °C, you would not have that temperature because you would be de", 653, "kz04oBhsaa"],
