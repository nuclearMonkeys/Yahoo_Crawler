	4006 : ["Yes, a resonant circuit has a very low reactance for excitations at it's resonant frequency. So it can oscillate or form a low resistance path at its resonant frequency. You have the right idea on modulation. There are two common methods of modulation, FM (frequency modulation) which changes the frequency in response to the modulation frequency and AM (amplitude modulation) which changes the amplitude of the carrier wave in response to the modulating amplitude. FM and AM are the commonly used types of modulation you'll see on most ordinary radios. When they are processed in a radio, the modulation is \"stripped\" off the carrier and amplified and send to a speaker for sound production. ", 671, "VUdaZUpwaa", 0],

	4008 : ["Resonance is illustrated on a trampoline. If you provide the force at the right moment, the amplitude increases to instability (too high). Frequency Modulation (FM), Amplitude Modulation (AM) is how information is on a radio wave. ", 671, "AA12295435", 1],

	4027 : ["On Earth, we have a rather dramatic transition from gas (our atmosphere) to solid (the Earth's crust). That sharp transition creates a medium in which we can easily move through the air but receive enough resistance from the solid that it can support us - we can stand on it. On Jupiter there is no such transition. Instead as we work our way down through Jupiter's atmosphere it just keeps getting denser and denser. Eventually the gaseous hydrogen becomes liquid hydrogen. We keep descending and it becomes denser and denser until that liquid hydrogen becomes a super hot liquid metal. If we kept descending, we likely would eventually come to a solid core. But the interior pressure on Jupiter is millions of times greater than on the Earth. The heat and pressure would have destroyed us and our spacecraft long before we got to that core. The extreme density of the liquid would have made it impossible for us to even propel ourselves towards the core.", 668, "None", 0],
	4028 : ["What is your temperature? Ninety-nine point eight bananas? I am being facetious for an important reason. You MUST give a unit when quoting the value of something. If your temperature was 99.8 °C, you would not have that temperature because you would be dead before it got that high. If it were 99.8 K (i.e. kelvin) you would be dead before you got that cold. I am going to guess your temperature is 99.8 °F. That is a realistic value for that unit of temperature measurement. I would consider your temperature ever so slightly raised. On its own it would be no cause for alarm. A one-off temperature reading, like most one-off physiological measurements, is fairly meaningless. For it to mean more others would need to be measured. Of course, most of us do not possess the means of measuring their physiological parameters. So, what is more important than a one-off reading is a series of temperature readings. Then you can see if your temperature is going up or down. Your temperature could be that high simply because you have got that warm for some reason and your body's cooling mechanisms have not yet brought it down. As well as checking your temperature consider if you have other symptoms. perhaps you do have other symptoms. Presumably something gave you reason to take your temperature unless you simply have Victor Meldrew syndrome.", 653, "kz04oBhsaa", -1],

	4031 : ["I shall assume you mean England although many people use 'England' when they mean the UK.

	4036 : ["..And just a FYI, lead-acid battery cells are 2 volts each.  You can not have a 9 volt lead acid battery.", 658, "WqRctcQ7aa", 1],
	4037 : ["the amount of energy stored is per battery and is irrelevant of the connection, as long as you don't short them out. Changing the connections, series, parallel, or some combination just changes the voltage and available current ratios. The energy stored remains the same. Note that lead acid batteries come in multiples of 2.1 volts, eg, 6.3, 12.6 volts. 9 volts is not possible. 4 - 9v batteries with 10 amp-hour capacity each (for simplicity) can be wired: all in series, you get 36 volts and 10 amp-hour all in parallel, you get 9 volts and 40 amp-hour series/parallel, you get 18 volts and 20 amp-hour    note that each comes to 360 watt-hours, 120 per battery, which is a measure of energy. PS, 4 in parallel versus 2 parallel sets in parallel is the same thing. 2 parallel sets in series is listed above, series/parallel. same as 2 series sets in parallel. Note that there are possible problems with wiring batteries in parallel. They have to be identical, and have identical state of charge, else you have one discharging into another and possibly damaging one or both. series connection can require care when charging.", 658, "8Y7LQ6TGaa", 2],

	4049 : ["It is neither actually. Pakistan is an Indian country. Pakistan is in the Indian Subcontinent, making it Indian. However it borders Iran and is a Muslim majority country, so it has aspects of Persian and Arabian culture. So Pakistan is an Indian country with Persian and Arabian influences but it would also be fair to say that Pakistan has its own unique identity. ", 650, "eMwWgLxraa", 4],
	4050 : ["To be fair it's very difficult to actually prove that any external world exists. Kant proved that the existence of an external world can be proved by the known existence of two external points, but getting those two points is virtually impossible due to the undeniable possibility that we may not be able to trust our senses, a la Descartes' demon from his Meditations. However, George Edward Moore provided some relief from this kind of question with his \"Two-Handed Proof\" which claims that the existence and correct perception of his two hands should be taken as a postulate until proven otherwise, and under this assumption the existence of an external world is guaranteed by Kant's proof. This  doesn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is an external world, but it does provide a reasonable argument that the burden of proof should be applied the other way. In all seriousness, I looked at the coordinates for Albert Park in Auckland for about the top 5 search results, and they all gave answers within a few arcseconds, or about 500 feet at most if my math serves me, and a lot of that discrepancy is likely due to different ways of picking a point to measure. Any discrepancies in the exact location of New Zealand on different maps are likely due to differences in the projections used to make the maps, or even just the general quality of each map. And although this isn't enough to prove that New Zealand is real, I hope it's at least enough to defuse your specific concerns. (and yeah i know you're probably just shitposting, hence the whole nonsense about the proof of an external world, but i figured i should actually answer the question just in case)", 677, "UyKQe58raa", 0],
