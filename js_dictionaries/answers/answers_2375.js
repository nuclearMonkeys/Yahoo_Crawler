You should do many Friends, you just have to say something to them, start a conversation with any person. You should be stronger and leave you fears.... I know your Young but in this age you have to learn how to stop being alone, Friends are important because they are going to be your Friends or our classmates forever in your school. Ok, if you get away ... No. But. My opinión is to start a conversation saying \"what´s your favourite song?\" or \" what´s your favourite artist (s)?\" or maybe \"what´s your favourite subject?\" And after this you share your feelings, after they say whatever thing, you pay attention and analise.

	124584 : ["This is the one thing I agree with Obama on. The people on the operation floors across the nation don't care about someone talking to their mom about what the girl down the street is doing or what the doctor told them, etc.  As the first poster said, if you're having phone sex, yeah, they'll probably listen for entertainment purposes.  Unless you are talking about doing harm to someone or to a government (US or foreign), your phone call and/or Internet records are going to be passed over.  No one cares. Edit: You know, after 9/11, when the Aug 01 memos came out talking out terrorist attacks, Bush was criticized for not telling the American public about them.  Now, Bush is criticized for trying to scare the American public because he says terrorist are still trying to hurt Americans and we need to monitor them and their activities.  I think I'll err on the side of caution and keep my head out of the sand. Free Thinker - I didn't give you a thumbs down because you said we should follow the constitution.  I gave you a thumbs down because you said:  \"We live in the United States of America, we are not terrorists nor do we practice terrorist measures. Surely you would not suggest we embrace our enemies ideology's\"?   We do have terrorist in our country.  The ones that pulled off 9/11 were living in our country.  And I vaguely remember something happening in Oklahoma City and Atlanta, but maybe those events were just nightmares for me.

OR 2.  offer an alternative punishment in place of going to the party.  An extra week's grounding, extra chores that you really hate to do but will help out someone else in the household out.   Get creative and they just MIGHT let you go to the party.   Pestering, whining, crying, begging  and comparing yourself to other siblings will just keep you grounded--but you know that already.", 10795, "f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa", 1],

There was one person who spoke to me during the classes, because he's met me before...but we were only that, classmates.  I took the free time alone to my advantage, I sat down with my laptop and began writing novels and stories (I want to become a writer someday).  One day after lunch, i was sitting next to a trash can (I know, depressing) and a girl, older than me, walked up to me to ask me where the library was...so I told her.  Turns out that she was in my English class, and I never noticed her.  We became friends since then, along with my classmate who've seen me before.  Even though she's not my BEST friend, i don't eat alone now, lol.  What I wanted to say with all this lecture is, that you will meet someone who will become your friend...soon.
