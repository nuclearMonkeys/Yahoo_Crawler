So let's say the ambassador of France walks up and shoots some random person in the face.  The ambassador is not immune from detention & arrest, so the local police put him in jail.  The ambassador claims diplomatic immunity.  The state department requests France waive his immunity.  If France declines, the police have to release him.  If France waives his immunity, he can be prosecuted.  Also, the ambassador can be charged in France, under French law, for the murder.", 1571, "None", 0],

Subversion (from the Latin word subvertere, 'overthrow') refers to a process by which the values and principles of a system in place are contradicted or reversed, in an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, authority, hierarchy, and social norms. Subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and, \"the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols. Following penetration, and parallel with the forced disintegration of political and social institutions of the state, these loyalties may be detached and transferred to the political or ideological cause of the aggressor\".[1] Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk, cost, and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency. Furthermore, it is a relatively cheap form of warfare that does not require large amounts of training.[2] A subversive is something or someone carrying the potential for some degree of subversion. In this context, a \"subversive\" is sometimes called a \"traitor\" with respect to (and usually by) the government in power.", 1575, "ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa", 0],
