	60098 : ["Tessa, allow me to answer the last question first. Yes, Wicca IS real. Wicca is a Religion and as such, we give honor to BOTH a Goddess and a God (although there are exceptions to that (Dianic Wicca, being one)). We also acknowledge the Divine as being manifest in the Natural world around us, which kind of gives non-Wiccans the impression that we worship Nature. It is not Nature that we worship it is the Divine, and nature is only the conduit through which we do so. Wicca do not worship idols, we worship in front of statues (again there are many exceptions to this as well (Green Witches come to mind)). Christians do not worship the cross, they worship what the cross represents, it is precisely that same principle in Wicca. We conduct our ceremonies during the full moon (some also the new moon), and eight Sabbats which are spread out over the year (What many Wicca call the Wheel of the Year). These celebrations re-live certain phases in the life ages of the Gods and Goddesses and are done in commemoration of these Divine events. The Wicca recognize the existence of good and evil as inherent is ALL things, everything and everyone has the capability for BOTH (Even the Divine). Evil therefore, is an integral part of everything and one can not have one without the other. The key to this is balance, Wicca hold the concept of balance to be one of the core principles of the universe and al which exists. So, to answer your first question, there is NO being which is totally good or totally evil, only the intent of the individual determines whether a thing or an action is for good or evil. Therefore, as there is NO being assigned the nature of total evil (ie, a devil) it is impossible for us to worship such a being. NOw, as many member of Judeo-Christian-Islamic Faiths are so fond of stating in unequivocal terms, \"if you do not worship the god of light and love, then you are worshiping the devil\". They fail to realize that in order to worship anything or anyone, then worship MUST be the intent. There is no such thing as unknowingly worshiping anyone. We can NOT worship a concept which does NOT exist to us, therefore we do NOT worship the \"Devil\", as the \"Devil\" is NOT one of the Divine being concepts which exists within the Faith system of Wicca. It is as simple and direct as that. Does this make sense to you? Brightest Blessings, Raji the Green Witch", 8061, "None", 0],

	60107 : ["Cashelmara, excellent exegesis on 2:Tim 3:16-17.  It clearly does not say what Protestants since Luther might wish it to way.  It says that scripture writers were inspired, and that the scripture is \"profitable,\" which means neither infallible nor sufficient. As further background, \"scripture\" at this time meant the Old Testament.  Most of the New Testament had not even been written, much less accepted as canon by original Christians.  Paul is telling us something about the Old Testament that should be apparent to all modern readers:  That while inspired, the Old Testament can't be taken at face value.  Jesus clearly recognized this when he made statements like that recorded in Matthew 19:8: \"Jesus replied, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.'\" Original Christians and their modern heirs recognize that the Word of God is not the Bible, but Jesus Christ himself (John 1:14: The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us).  Our knowledge of the Word of God is not restricted to a book.  If a book were paramount, Jesus would have written one. Instead, he taught by oral word and example. The exaltation of the collected writings in the Bible over the full revelation of Jesus in scripture and in the faithful tradition of the Church to which Jesus entrusted his revelation is a sort of idolatry.

The Books of the Old Testament were put together by the Hebrews in the Septuagint (ca 300 B.C.), which includes the seven Books called \"Deuterocanonical\" by Catholics and \"Apocryphal\" by Protestants, and was the Old Testament used by the Apostles.  Tradition: the teachings which the Church has preserved and passed down from Christ, His Apostles, and the unanimous teachings of the early Church Fathers (1 Corinthians 11:2, 2 Thessalonians 2:15, 2 Thessalonians 3:6).  Magisterium: the teaching authority of the Church under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The teachings of Catholic hierarchs have three different levels of fallibility:  Extraordinary Magisterium Ordinary Magisterium Authentic Magisterium For the Holy Spirit was promised to the successors of Peter not so that they might, by His revelation, make known some new doctrine, but that, by His assistance, they might religiously guard and faithfully expound the revelation or Deposit of Faith transmitted by the Apostles.  Our Lord founded a Church (Matthew 16:18-19), not a book, which was to be the pillar and ground of Truth (1 Timothy 3:15). We can know what this Church teaches by looking not only at Sacred Scripture, but into History and by reading what the earliest Christians have written, what those who've sat on the Chair of Peter have spoken consistently with Scripture and Tradition, and what they've solemnly defined.

	60110 : ["The Four Noble Truths 1. Life means suffering. 2. The origin of suffering is attachment. 3. The cessation of suffering is attainable. 4. The path to the cessation of suffering.   1. Life means suffering.  To live means to suffer, because the human nature is not perfect and neither is the world we live in. During our lifetime, we inevitably have to endure physical suffering such as pain, sickness, injury, tiredness, old age, and eventually death; and we have to endure psychological suffering like sadness, fear, frustration, disappointment, and depression. Although there are different degrees of suffering and there are also positive experiences in life that we perceive as the opposite of suffering, such as ease, comfort and happiness, life in its totality is imperfect and incomplete, because our world is subject to impermanence. This means we are never able to keep permanently what we strive for, and just as happy moments pass by, we ourselves and our loved ones will pass away one day, too. 2. The origin of suffering is attachment. The origin of suffering is attachment to transient things and the ignorance thereof. Transient things do not only include the physical objects that surround us, but also ideas, and -in a greater sense- all objects of our perception. Ignorance is the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things. The reasons for suffering are desire, passion, ardour, pursuit of wealth and prestige, striving for fame and popularity, or in short: craving and clinging. Because the objects of our attachment are transient, their loss is inevitable, thus suffering will necessarily follow. Objects of attachment also include the idea of a \"self\" which is a delusion, because there is no abiding self. What we call \"self\" is just an imagined entity, and we are merely a part of the ceaseless becoming of the universe. 3. The cessation of suffering is attainable. The cessation of suffering can be attained through nirodha. Nirodha means the unmaking of sensual craving and conceptual attachment. The third noble truth expresses the idea that suffering can be ended by attaining dispassion. Nirodha extinguishes all forms of clinging and attachment. This means that suffering can be overcome through human activity, simply by removing the cause of suffering. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of Nirvana. Nirvana means freedom from all worries, troubles, complexes, fabrications and ideas. Nirvana is not comprehensible for those who have not attained it. 4. The path to the cessation of suffering. There is a path to the end of suffering - a gradual path of self-improvement, which is described more detailed in the Eightfold Path. It is the middle way between the two extremes of excessive self-indulgence (hedonism) and excessive self-mortification (asceticism); and it leads to the end of the cycle of rebirth. The latter quality discerns it from other paths which are merely \"wandering on the wheel of becoming\", because these do not have a final object. The path to the end of suffering can extend over many lifetimes, throughout which every individual rebirth is subject to karmic conditioning. Craving, ignorance, delusions, and its effects will disappear gradually, as progress is made on the path.", 8068, "JvmosWUKaa", 3],

	60131 : ["While I believe there is divine inspiration in prophesy that is not recorded in the 66 books of the Bible, I believe that all such revelation will support the teachings in the Bible  and not be contrary to it, nor should any teaching from a heathen source be viewed as being inspired. The Roman Catholic Church has for example borrowed the concept of its Rosary from the Hindu Prayer beads, and uses repeating the same phrase over and over, this is contrary to the Scripture Jesus taught Mat 6:7  But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. The Catholics repeat the same words over and over, and incidentally most of the rosary is homage to Mary, not to God. Jesus addressed that, While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, \"Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.\" But He said, \"On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God and observe it.\"\" Luke 11:27-28 If you are a hearer and observer of the Word of God you are more blessed than Mary! Jesus said so! Another point that Scripture makes clear and no revelation can contradict is that we are all saints, not just a few dead people, as the Pope says,The Pope says only very special dead Catholic people qualify to be called \"saints\". For example, Pope John Paul II could not make Mother Teresa a saint (official canonization) until after she was dead. The average Catholic in the pew is never called a \"saint\" dead or alive! In fact if a pew dwelling Catholic started calling himself a \"saint\", he would be rebuked by the parish priest! The Bible states that \"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus\" Ephesians 1:1 So did Paul only write to dead people? And how about to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Romans 1:7 God is the God of the Living Luk 20:38  For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. Mar 12:27  He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.
