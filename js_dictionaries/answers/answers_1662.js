Mys 3yr son and my daughter will be with a sitter for those hours and ADORE her. My other two sons, who are 7 and 9 are in school. When my older two were little, I taught full day, grades 2, 3 or 4.  I love teaching and it is a much easier job to handle compared to some others when you have kids at home as well. Getting home around 12:30 allows me to also still do the mom thing, take care of the kids, the house, make dinner etc.  My husband makes a very decent salery and we really don't need mine,  but I work to give us an extra boast and because I love it. I get grief about it ALL THE TIME.  \"Why do you work if you don't need to?\"  \"Why did you have kids if you're just going to work?\" \"You're self centered.\" Please. 3hrs a day isn't going to make an impact. The baby will be sleeping two of those and my 3yr son is in school 3/5 of those days.  I'm not leaving someone else to raise them. I just don't quite understand why I should completely 100% give up my career because I have children. I can do both and I enjoy doing it too. Best Wishes =]", 9307, "tuyM5k0zaa", 0],

We couldn't afford daycare even if I was working full time but it wasn't really about that, it's the fact that we didn't want him in someone else's care. I'm now going to enroll him into a age appropriate program after the 1st of the year 2 part time days a week. I feel he need's the exposure to being around other kid's, doing activitie's and learning. I have no family or friend's around me and I've actually only been away from my son a few times just for a couple of hours in his whole life.  I think he will benefit from this program and so will I. I love the fact that I have been home with him all this time and it will be hard for me to put him into this program but I know it's the best for him. I want him to be able to experience things that I can't provide in my home or simply going to the park. I want him to get excited about going and seeing some new face's. My husband is great as well, he will do things around the house when I'm gone because he feels he should be doing something when I'm away. He cooks sometimes and never complains to me if I slack a little.  Anyway, I feel so bonded to my son and I love the age he is now! He is so loving and fun. I'm glad that I've always been here for him and I've experienced everything with him. It makes me feel good that he knows as well that we both as his parent's have been here for him everytime he needed something.

	88771 : ["Dont feel like that sweetheart, you'll never be a burden to anyone. When a guy loves a girl, he'd do anything for her, and you sound like such an incredible girl that it'd only be a matter of time before some lucky guy sees the beautiful, smart, grown up person you are. No matter what you can or cant do anymore, you're still the same wonderful person inside, and thats what someone's going to fall in love with, you, not what you can do. I beleive everyone has one person out there they were always meant to be with, and for me, I was lucky enough to find mine. Unfortunately, that didnt work out, but I did, and still do love her so much for the person that she is, that it really wouldn't matter if she was in a wheelchair or anything, she's still the girl I was meant to love, no matter what body she's inside, and I would, and will love her till the day I die, regardless of anything. When you find the guy you were meant to be with, nothing else will matter to him than the fact that he's met the girl he was supposed to spend his whole life with, it wont be any great inconvinience for him to help you reach things off the top shelf in the grocery store when it means he gets to wake up every morning next to his soul mate and the love of his life. In the face of true love, nothing else matters, as long as you've got eachother. Sex isn't so important to guys when they get older, guys around your age, its all they think about, but when guys start thinking a little more maturely about it, then its not the be all and end all of everything. There are plenty of other ways to share intimacy other than sex, there are plenty of other things you can do to express your love for eachother. And seeing as my relationship I was in with the love of my life was a non-sexual one, I can honestly say that the greatest levels of intimacy and closeness can be reached without even having to get naked, so long as you love the person. And you could adopt children, or use a surrogate mother, or who knows in this day and age, but there'll be ways for you to have children when the time comes. You've gotta understand too, that guys are naturally providers, its in our instinct to want to do things for the girl we love and it makes us feel good, its not like a chore or anything, we love the chance to make life easier for the girl we love, so when you find your guy, I'm absolutely positive that he wont mind helping you however you need, not even the tiniest bit. As for meeting guys, all you need to do is be confident and upbeat, which you already seem to be, much more so that anyone else I know would be in your position. There's nothing different to a decent guy about a girl in a wheelchair if she has the right attitude, which you do. As long as your positive, which you are, and dont let it hold you back, then guys will see right past it. People in wheelchairs often go through life acting like a victim, and you have every right to because its awful whats happened to you, but its really admirable to see the people that rise above their bad luck and live full, fun lives none the less, and you seem every bit smart, positive, bright and bubbly enough to do it :) Dont ever give up on yourself sweetheart, dont ever think you dont have a chance, you're still the same beautiful girl you always were and no accident can ever take that away from you. xoxox", 9308, "None", -1],

My son is nearly 7, and up to when he started school I had a very well paid job in the City of London.  I don't miss it at all and feel honoured and grateful that I am able to be at home for my family, as well as have a bit of time on my own and go to work. My other half doesn't do ANY housework, but that's probably my fault after 15 years of doing it all, and stopping him doing it if he ever tried because he wasn't doing it \"properly\".  How I coped with a City job, a baby and running a home, I still don't know (I'm still struggling now, without the job!) and I take my hat off to you!!!  I think you will probably find it easier once your children start full-time school, although finding jobs that will fit in with school times is hard - I suggest you get straight in with the PTA as soon as they start, as that is how I got mine!

If you notice, horoscopes vary greatly from place to place, but the trends of the signs not so much. I wonder why? The thing to remember though is that they are just that. Trends. It doesn't mean you will be like that, only that you have a higher possiblity of being something like the sign says you are.

It is very rare to find a good one even in India where everything is based on consultation with an astrologer.  Weddings, engagements, house moving, office opening, chosing date for caesarian birth, planting of crops, etc....  I witnessed a lot of middle of the night weddings, even 3 am in the hotel, because it is based on the astrologist's calculation so that the couple would have a blessed life together.  Its not only the horoscope, they read star signs and had to undergo years of training.  Just like Chinese feng shui.  There are lots of feng shui masters but how many really predict accurately?

There is a difference because I highly doubt if you are paralyzed from the neck down that you could have the ability to be typing on a computer right now.

Being the history buff that I am. I know a lot about historical figures. I am not sure if you heard of her, but Frida Kahlo Rivera. A Mexican revolutionary and artist (painter) was married to Diego Rivera who is perhaps the most well known painter of the N. American continent. Anyways, she suffered a debilitating bus injury early into her 20's. It was believed that she would never walk again and would be paralyzed forever. She was able to regain mobility and could walk. Although, that injury remained with her forever in life because she was always the guinea pig to many quirky experiments to see if she could regain the ability to walk again. It messed her up and her condition worsened as she grew older even though she could walk. She lost the ability to birth children. However, that was then in the 1920's-1930's. Imagine with the advances in science of today how much easy it would be to regain the ability to walk if you are not fully paralyzed. Also she found Diego Rivera and they were married for life and both of them were highly promiscuous and had multiple partners as they cheated on each other, but oddly enough with all that cheating going on w. both of them they stayed together forever and regarded themselves as soul mates.", 9308, "None", 1],

	88799 : ["I think staying at home is wonderful if that's what works for your family and if working works for your family then that's great too. However, I think the kids of working moms have a few advantages. For one, they learn independence. They learn that mom and dad will not always be around and so they learn how to cope. These are very important skills for kids to learn before they go off to school. Working moms also have an advantage because they have time to themselves (even though they are working still) but their work is sort of \"their thing\". Stay at home moms really don't have much that is just theirs because they spend all day with the kids. Also, I don't see the point of being a stay at home mom once the kids go off to school.
