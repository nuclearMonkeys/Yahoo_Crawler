I take comfort in the fact that she was pampered and well loved for almost 19 years and that she was a very happy cat.  The end was fairly peaceful (preferable to a lot of cats' deaths such as being hit by a car for example - which was always a huge fear for me) and she is no longer in any pain or discomfort.

II got her when I was going through a divorce.  She was my first cat.  I always viewed her as a gift from God.  I spent lots of money to try and find out what was wrong with her...more than I could afford.

I have pictures of her and remember the good times we had. You may find it morbid...but once I got the remains of Pumpkin I felt better.  I don't know why...but I did.  If your cat was your only cat...you might consider getting another pet.  This helps fill your time.  Of course...it will never replace your lost love one, but having something to nurture can take up time and energy and let  you focus on happier things.

Cry all you want, just let it out.\" So we tend to hide our pain in public, and even around friends and family. Here is a website that I found very helpful:   - they have the Rainbow Bridge story, and other inspirational readings there. They also have support forums and chat. In chat they do the \"Monday Night Candle Ceremony\" which is a beautiful memorial service, that might do you a world of good to participate in. Even if you can't make it to the chat room when they are holding it, the text of it is online so that you can read through it and light the candles by yourself if you choose to.

If that doesn't work you could try some other form of expressing your grief. Give it time.
