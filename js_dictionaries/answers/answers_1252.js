I am well aware of the \"implied powers\" loophole, however, the power of the creation and issuance of currency is expressly given to the Congress through the Treasury (not a private corporation) in the Constitution.  \"Implied powers\" does not necessarily completely overrule the already existing clauses of the Constitution.  Otherwise, the Government could use \"implied powers\" to get rid of the First Amendment, or anything else for that matter.  Your lawyers argument is dubious at best.   Also, it is not only a question of what is \"legal\".  It is also a question of what is Morally Right.  No legal argument is ever going to convince an aware individual that it is morally right for a small group of private individuals who are in no way answerable to the people to control our entire country's money supply, and therefor, our entire economy.   Such power is NOT designated by the Constitution, because it completely bypasses the checks and balances of Government designed to maintain power in the hands of THE PEOPLE.  The existence of the Federal Reserve is an affront to the Constitution because it is a FINANCIAL DICTATORSHIP, which surpasses checks and balances, as Alan Greenspan has ADMITTED. But please, go on chasing ambulances and quoting your legalese, and see how far you get in convincing anyone of the Fed's legitimacy. \"The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank...sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.\" - Carroll Quigley, member of Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), mentor to Bill Clinton, quote from “Tragedy and Hope”, 1966 ////Dutch, Apparently you have trouble reading.  I said the power goes to \"Congress through the Treasury\", meaning the Treasury is the Vehicle by which Congress coins money.  The Federal Reserve IS NOT the Congress, and Congress has no oversight in the Fed's operations, therefore, it is Unconstitutional. Also, you keep quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, which is a court case from 1819.  The Federal Reserve DIDN'T EVEN EXIST UNTIL 1913.  Are you one of those dense lawyers that always gets their clients sent to prison?  The case has NOTHING TO DO with the Federal Reserve.  Please show me any text from that case that uses the term \"Federal Reserve\" in it. The case had to do with \"implied powers\" and states rights verses the Federal Government.  But as I have shown, implied powers has very little to do with the Federal Reserve, because it violates the Constitution on several levels. And yes, I know quite a bit more than you about 9/11 (and obviously the Fed), but that's a debate for another time.  You can't even get your facts straight on the Federal Reserve, and the Fed issue is simple.  How does it feel to have your weak arguments shoved back down your throat by a \"trailer park resident\"?  You're in way over your head!  LOL! ////Wow, what a mature response from Mr. Lawyer when he knows he's beaten.  Is this how you act in court when you lose?  Are you SURE you're a lawyer?  LMAO! If a decision by Government impedes the Constitutional rights of the people, then it is ILLEGAL.  Period.  The Constitution is the prevailing law over all others.  Why do you think Andrew Jackson called the 2nd U.S. Bank an \"engine of corruption\" and then shut it down?    BTW, the Federal Reserve is an ENTIRELY different entity from the second U.S. Bank, with a different structure, far more power, and NO oversight.  Again, please show me any text from McCulloch v. Maryland that mentions the FEDERAL RESERVE.  I'll be waiting........... //////LOL!!!  He ran away......!!!", 8439, "UnXCTJUkaa", 6],

Now unless the parents don't mind their children have such inappropriate relationships, then what can you say? No parent in their right mind would accept a child at the age of 11 have sexual relationships with one another child, unless they are at the lowest rank of stupidity and carelessness.    Also another thing you should consider despite the fact that children as young as eight are expected to cook, look at all the hazards that they can put themselves into,  how can we trust them to behave orderly without an adult to supervise them?
