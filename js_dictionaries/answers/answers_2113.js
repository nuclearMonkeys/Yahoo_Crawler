If you look at history, you'll see this is exactly the sort of thing (current corporate disregard for workers) that created a need for labor unions.

	111430 : ["Have to agree with most here. I work for the largest Food Service company in North America. Problem does not lie in companies profits. (this is a union Myth)  Middle class suffers because of unions, greed, over taxation .... Everybody thinks they should make more money. But if my local grocery store or big box store has to pay more money for no-brainer jobs, I in the end pay more for food, clothes, entertainment etc. Since when did they become career jobs, they are supposed to be stepping stones for students going to school or college, or people just looking for something to do when retired. Also in the middle class we believe in consumerism & drive the price of goods even higher. If we are really suffering we should quit going out, get rid of cable/satellite, drive less, limit cell phone use to minimum. Stop the have it now rage. Quit blaming big business. Its our own fault.", 10188, "a8QisVr9aa", 0],

	111437 : ["Well. Where do i begin?! I think that rangers fans are predominantly racists. They have allegiances with the far right and many are nazi sympathisers. They are from a close genetic background, i.e. Inbred, and they hate catholics just because they fear the true religion of christianity. Jesus said that, not me. There is only 1 church.  They hate republicanism because they think it's just a catholic thing, when it's not. This forces them into a position where they have to condone and support the royal family and the empire, even though it's this very family and empire that has screwed them and all their generations throughout time, just like it has done to the catholics. They think they are so different and yet they are so the same.  They hate socialism because they think this is a catholic thing too. They are that deluded it's sad to say.  We as catholics are taught to forgive and show understanding. However, with these neanderthals it is a task that even Saint Peter would struggle with. To be honest i pity them and their delusions. Let them think that they are the people i say. It gives me a rye smile each and every time i hear it. God bless Celtic and her people.", 10174, "None", -2],

	111448 : ["It would take a great deal of work on your part. The most important factor would be awareness. You always have to be on guard when speaking, always.
