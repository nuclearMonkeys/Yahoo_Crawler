I'm stuck on the following problem: A car drives at a constant speed around a banked circular track with a diameter of 127 m. the motion of the car can be described in a coordinate system with its origin at the center of the circle. At a particular instant the car's acceleration in the horizontal plane is given by", 8963, "None", -1],

If the \"Vt\" means lower-case v with subscript t, that means \"tangential velocity\" and the units could be m/s or any other velocity units. If the \"Fc\" means F with a subscript c, it could mean centrifugal force, whose units would be newtons or pounds. If the \"ac\" means lower-case a with subscript c, it could mean centripetal acceleration, units m/s^2 If the W means omega, sort of a small, rounded w, the units are radians per second, and the name is angular frequency.

Radius = magnitude (r) = sqrt ( (three.70 m)^2 + (1.60 m)^2 ) = 4.03 m we can to find the circumference of the circle the particle is journeying in making use of the radius. Circumference = 2 pi (radius) = 25.3 m for the reason that the interval is the period of time it takes to traverse the circumference, the speed of the particle is speed = circumference / period = three.09 m/s because the particle is travelling clockwise, in unit vector notation, v = - three.09 m/s (unit phi vector). In case your instructor desired the unit vectors to be of the Cartesian coordinate method, we convert the (unit phi vector) to i and j. Denote phi making use of O. (unit phi vector) = - sin (O) i + cos (O) j where O = arctan (y/x) therefore, v = [3.09 sin(O) i - 3.09 cos(O) j ] m/s where O = arctan (y/x) Hope this helps!", 8963, "None", 0],

They make their way to the local lodge, where cranky, tyrannical \"Papa Doc\" is clearly running the show. The largely unsympathetic adults are slow to realize the true nature of the nasty little brats; by the time they do, it's definitely too late. ... Those viewers who might be frustrated with the ambitious, nuanced approach to the material for the first two thirds are sure to find their patience rewarded with the climax as the children find creative ways to dispatch their victims. We know as soon as we see that Papa Doc has piranhas for pets(!) that they're bound to turn up later, and so they do. Bear traps, axes, spears, and the proved combo of gasoline and matches will all play a part. The fact that these are children is always maintained. These aren't adults in kids' clothing; they truly act their age although one odd and interesting touch has one of the tykes always playing the part of a novice nun.", 8966, "ZyGyDLsDaa", 0],
