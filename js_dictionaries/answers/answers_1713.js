As to why the opera lady didn't win, I can only speculate that many people were turned off by the gratuitous mentioning of her cancer every time they talked to her. Grandma Lee was awesome, but her humor might have appealed to a large group of voters. As for the spastic tap dancers and the guys beating on trash cans...I thought they sucked.

Restaurant/bar/owners/managers will do one of two thing when hiring a new bartender: 1)  They'll hire someone with prior experience 2)  They'll promote a server. Your best bet is to get a job as a sever and try to work your way up.  This is an entry level position and you'll learn valuable customer service skills. A bartender's dictionary is always a good idea to keep on hand in case you forget how to make a drink.  And, they will train you if you get the bartender promotion.

	91340 : ["Well the most important thing is what Bud Hibbs as stated regarding this collection agency, and I quote \"Asset Acceptance Corp has earned the distinction of one of \"AMERICA'S WORST COLLECTION AGENCIES\". They lie, steal, cheat, misrepresent, file bogus claims, create phony documents and commit perjury in the court system JUST to increase their bottom line.\" You may not even have to pay this debt as it may be so old it is too late to take legal action. BUT, if you agreed to make a settlement, then you reset the state statute of limitations and it is now too late. They record all phone conversations to prove a debtor has made acknowledgment of owing the debt. Use a cashiers check or money order only to pay off this debt. As others here have stated NEVER SEND A PERSONAL CHECK as this gives them your routing number and account number and you can not trust these people. MOST IMPORTANT: get this agreement in writing BEFORE you make any payments.  They could come back for more (this is the reason why you do not use a personal check) and take it from your account.  Also request the debt be paid for deletion of the entry on your credit report.  They do not have to do so, but try anyways. FYI most collection agencies pay anywhere from .02 to .20 on the dollar for the debt.  You can also try for an even larger discount!

	91341 : ["Before you start cutting checks: How old is this debt and have you confirmed that this debt is within the statute of limitations? There is a statute of limitations for credit card debt, which is the amount of time that they can successfully take legal action against you for the debt. This time period varies for each state. You can find this time period for your state by going to the link below and looking under \"Open Accounts.\"  If your debt is older than the time period listed for your state, they can no longer defeat you in any court action because the debt is  time-barred. ...If this debt is outside the statute of limitations, you don't have to pay it. ================== If the debt is still within the statute of limitations: Don't make the mistake of simply cutting a check to whatever collection agency has the debt for the charge-off and assume that your credit rating will be magically restored...Doing so will not remove it from your credit reports. It will simply be updated to a \"Paid Charge-Off,\" which, while slightly better, is still a seriously derogatory item. Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a charge-off, whether paid or not, can remain on a consumer's credit reports for up to seven years. If you're going to pay off old-charged-off debt anyway, then you might as well negotiate the lowest settlement you can possibly get, being that the negative charge-off notation is going to stay for 7 years on your credit report anyway. You have to be VERY careful in this effort...Mail them a vaguely worded statement like: I am willing to settle this matter for 25% of the original amount. This is in no way an admission of this debt, but rather an attempt to settle this matter. Your firm must send me a written agreement on your company's letterhead that you will accept this amount as \"payment in full\" and that is issue will be settled. Upon receipt of this agreement, I will mail you a money order for this amount.", 9398, "5BTKscZraa", 0],

Best bet is just to get your foot in the door and take any job in any restaurant and go from there. You can usually go from server to bar back to bar tender. I was even a cook they let tend bar once in a while. Also, get the Boston Bar Tenders guide and study it because that gives you all of the basic/classic drinks. Don't worry about the \"hip\" drinks just yet. Those are going to vary by place anyway and you could drive yourself crazy because there are so many!
