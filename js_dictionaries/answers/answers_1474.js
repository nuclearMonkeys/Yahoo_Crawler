	79387 : ["My friend told me about smarter potty training using The Potty Stool.   I was skeptical the stool would make a difference but I never would have guessed how well it works! I think it really helps boys to learn to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations. With The Potty Stool, boys can use the toilet standing up. I realized later that my kids really wanted to imitate what they saw adults doing and they were very determined to mimic correct toilet use. I like that I don't have to use or clean a floor potty and I love that my kids are safe and never have to touch the toilet with their hands! It cuts potty training in half because they do not have to be retrained to start and stop using a potty. The best part is that kids use it for years. Hope this helps you.", 8979, "None", 0],
