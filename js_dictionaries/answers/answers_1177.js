	64345 : ["Professor Hawking is not totally wrong. He identified the need for infinitely dense tools in the algorithm of The Invention. But he misplaced them somewhat, I think.  String theorists are not totally wrong either. They identified the need for infinitely thin tools. And while their imagination should be applauded, their theory is mostly wrong, it looks like. I think there are only four dimensions.  Dark matter is infinitely dense and is the regulator of gravity in The Invention. Dark matter can also be called blue runes.  Infinitely flat runes are the regulators of antigravity.  You can call them red runes.  They are called red runes and blue runes because of the way they function. Red runes between two objects increase as the two objects become more red-shifted relative to each other. This increases the force of antigravity between the two objects.  Blue runes increase between two objects when those two objects become more blue-shifted relative to each other. This increases the force of gravity between the two objects. There are many other kinds of runes that regulate space and time. For example you have infinitely thin runes which connect quantum particles to space, I contend. All these runes are part of spacial physics.  Spatial physics has not yet been discovered by scientists. (Human scientists üòÅ). I believe we must discover spatial physics and understand it in order to travel faster than light. The scientists of today understand that matter cannot travel faster than light on its own power. But they also understand that space can travel faster than light.  There have been instances when matter appeared to travel faster than light. One time was at the collidor in Italy or Switzerland or wherever.  Neutrinos were recorded going a little faster than light. This has been explained as a recording error due to something not being plugged in. But perhaps those neutrinos became red-shifted enough relative to other objects to allow the force of antigravity to push them slightly faster than light. Neutrinos are weird too. Perhaps they are kind of a hybrid of spatial and quantum physics.  I don't know. In another instance, gravitational waves were apparently recorded going slightly faster than light, however scientists did not appear to make a big deal out of this. Perhaps there is something I don't know. But gravitational waves are not matter, I contend.  They are regulated by blue runes. But, like I said, I don't know. I am fumbling around in the dark. Dark matter, get it? üòÅ", 8249, "p36B4PXoaa", -1],

The 84 also comes with more apps by default, and it comes with a cable and software so that you can connect it to your computer.  It's a little pricier, but not by too much.
