	102344 : ["Drawr is partially right, It is all about ice shift times.  It matters when you score the goal in relation to the time that you have been on the ice.  If you score a goal after being on the ice for 5 seconds you are going to stay on the ice.  If you have been on the ice for 30-45+ seconds you are definitely coming off the ice.  If you have been on for 20 seconds you are probably coming off the ice so your shift doesn't get extended to 60+ seconds.   It also matters what is happening with the opposing team, if they put on fresh players or a better line the team who just scored is probably going to follow suit.   Matching lines in hockey is a huge strategy, if your 4th line scores against a fellow 4th line.  the coach of the team who got scored on is going to take off his 4th line and the coach of the team that just scored is going to follow suit.  In some instances they may not even get back on the ice.", 9807, "5NeGtjTnaa", 1],
	102345 : ["Often its that the player was on the ice long enough to need a line change anyway. Other times its a match up thing where the visiting team changed players so the home team's coach will put out the line that matches up best. Often times you will see a guy stay out if he is not tired. Its no reward to be left out playing if you are gassed and will not be effective.", 9807, "Iod5edCSaa", 0],

	102347 : ["I would definitely suggest finding another doctor.  I went through 5 psychiatrists over a period of about 3 years before I was correctly diagnosed and given medication that works.  I've been on about 8-10 different anti-depressants.  Most had a really negative effect on me, and I was only on them for a short time.  Right now I'm on Effexor, and my sex drive with it is A-okay.  I've been on it for quite a while now and it works well for me.  The only other one that didn't have negative sexual side effects for me was Wellbutrin.  I took this 2 different times, once for about a year and then after about a year of trying others I went back to it, but then ended up moving on to something else.  I found that the effects of Wellbutrin wore off after a while, and it was pretty much worthless.  That is just me, though.  Medications work differently in people since our bodies all respond to things differently.   Definitely definitely look into finding another doctor.  It could make a world of difference! Also, maybe consider counseling?  If it's the stressful situations in your life that are mainly keeping you depressed, a combination of medication and therapy might be the answer.  I was really lucky to find the therapist that I did.  He was the first person to correctly diagnose me and refer me to the psychiatrist who agreed with his diagnosis and prescribed medication for it, medication that actually works.  It's nice to have someone to talk to about the things in our lives that keep us down.  Even for me medication isn't enough.  It helps control the chemicals in the brain, but it doesn't change what's going on in life.  A good therapist can help you learn how to deal with it all, get to the bottom of what's really keeping you down, and help you learn how to live life better.", 9808, "cb312f300707db2324933dd956aed7c4aa", 2],

	102388 : ["\"Dr\" Frank is wrong, Mirtazapine is NOT an SSRI anti-depressant.  It is a tetracyclic antidepressant. Mirtazapine leaves your system very quickly after your last dose, making withdrawal abrupt and the risk of withdrawal side effects greater. You should go along with your doctors advice anyway, but I agree with him/her.  15mg is the lowest dose of Mirtazapine that is effective, so coming off it shouldn't be too bad even more so if you haven't been on the drug very long. I doubt you feeling more alert has anything to do with your half tablet dosage but the fact that when you were on a therapeutic dose you were getting the side effect of being drowsy (common with Mirtazapine) as you stated.  Now you are taking a dose that is ineffective and probably not doing much at all, so you're not experiencing the side effect. You may as well not be taking any Mirtazapine at all, as your doctor has advised.   Let your doctor know that you are concerned about these depressive symptoms and your treatment now you're coming off Mirtazapine.  There is evidence to suggest that several anti-depressants can help with anxiety.  Your doctor can reassure you and advise you of your options.", 9808, "ouzrDPaSaa", 0],
