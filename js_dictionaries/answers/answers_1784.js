But I do not walk down the street having a conversation with myselves - even though we are the smartest person we know! LOL Actually, most people have an inner monologue, and do not need to verbalize every thought. I don't think your actions necessarily mean you are crazy, but maybe just a little lonely. If you want to continue talking to yourself and not get stared at, wear a blue tooth headset and pretend you're on the phone :-)", 9528, "8c4a38a8ce3faf7a19cef1661742500daa", 0],
	94903 : ["Talking to oneself is a form of taking mental notes, the sound of voice serves as a remimder and is much more effective than a \"mental\" note, it is also a very normal thing to do, especially as we get a little older. People will often ask me while at work what I said,  I simply tell them to pay no attention, I am simply talking to myself, the most interesting person I know--that usually gets a chuckle and they forget that they were thinking I had dementia", 9528, "cca818758f54a5dfe78bc95caf14a2edaa", 1],
	94904 : ["This is completely dependant on the High Priest & High Priestess.  It is not uncommon during an initiation for the new member to be openly told in front of the other members some of the coven secrets so it would be unlikely that guests would be welcomed.  You will just have to wait and see, its a minimum of 5 years away because you will not be able to become apprentice to a  coven until you are 18 and the study takes at least a year.", 9525, "FAx5XNE3aa", 0],

Those who would share them are oathbreakers. Take nothing they say seriously. NO reputable coven would initiate someone of your age. And when you're old enough to be initiated, the coven in question will inform you of what is permitted or not permitted as far as guests are concerned. Not all covens practice skyclad. Skyclad worship is, in fact, typical of Gardnerian and Alexandrian covens and others of their lineage.

	94906 : ["If you want to do your initiation skyclad and your friend is uncomfortable, it would be more appropriate for you to do it on your own. Besides its a ceremony to dedicate yourself to You and your Path/Deities. You don't need an audience. (And its dedication if you're a solitary, not initiation). You should never do something you're uncomfortable with when being a Wiccan, nor should you force someone else to do something that makes them uncomfortable, and this would include making him/her watch your ceremony. If they want to be at your ceremony, perhaps wear a robe. Just because you're a Wiccan doesn't mean you can't be respectful to others.", 9525, "NxL4C1DMaa", 1],

Leo loves social stimulation and loathes darkness and boredom - it's the bright lights for you! You have a commanding stately bearing and were born to lead. You love teaching others and tend to be very good as an educator or politician. You tend to be fixed in your opinions and difficult to sway or dissuade. You are vulnerable to flattery and tend to be over-theatrical sometimes. You love life and love having everyone else depending on you. You like a good old gossip. You tend to be extravagant and should watch out for your tendency to gamble. You feel that as the king of the zodiac that luxuriousness is your natural state and you don't go in for half-way measures.

	94949 : ["Yes, that is a good time to run 6 miles in. If you want to add a lot of miles to your training, the rule of thumb is to add no more than 10% each week. This is a sustainable way to add miles to your training, i.e. you should be able to do this without your body collapsing from fatigue. So if you ran 20 miles this week you can run 22 next week and then add another 2.2 miles and run 24.2 miles the week after. Also make sure to give your body some recover time. You can do this by alternating easy and hard days. Your body should respond better with a long run, then follow up the next day with a short run. Instead of running 5 miles every weekday, try a run of 7-6 miles one day and then a 3-4 mile run the next day. Pick one of your weekend runs to be the longest of the week. This can be a run of at least 60 mins. The 10% rule is good here too, the week after a run of 66 mins. will work. Variety in hard runs is good for your muscles too. Substitute a hilly run on a hard day or run a fartlek. Run at a faster pace for a minute or two and then jog for the next min.
