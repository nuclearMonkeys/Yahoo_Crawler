The trophy was re-named in his honor and was given to amateur clubs exclusively until 1906, when professional clubs could compete for it. In 1915, the top two professional leagues agreed to play for the Stanley Cup.  The NHL came about in 1917, but the Cup did not become the de facto championship trophy until 1926.  Contrary to public perception, the NHL does not own the trophy. The trophy is held in trust by two Canadian trustees, who have a long-standing agreement with the NHL for the leagues exclusive right to use it.", 5196, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 3],
