	33366 : ["Marino. His arm and superhuman release should have translated into a lot more success.  Sanders maximized his talent.  Yes he was \"boom-bust\" but his \"boom\" was better than any RB's I've ever seen, past or present, and his \"bust\" was often due to his Lions teams having ZERO passing game to hold defenses accountable. He easily could have been the NFL's all-time leading rusher had he not retired early.", 5090, "YplQR9eDaa", 0],

	33371 : ["no because there have been all sorts of mitigating circumstances,  not least losing our central defensive pairing more or less all season..then this  pandemic, teams not having fans at home especially what our fans would of potentially been like this season, all play a part albeit a small one......but you hear pundits who know the game always say \"fine margins\" because it is fine margins that often decide games, when it's slight ly more than a fine margin, like i believe it has been for us this season, then logically unpredictability rises  and assurance diminishes, If it was fine margins before to win game after game like we did, that suddenly it becomes much more of a lottery now, but hopefully this is tempory though nobody yet knows how good those missing links will be when they return, i'm just hoping nothing much has changed, and we can get back regaining that belief and confidence, so as to just swing those \"fine margins\" in our favour..that's how we amassed such a tally last season, and why Klopp has stated a few times, there's no guarantees in football, no matter how you play or who is playing for you LFCYNWA", 5079, "UY8ny1vFaa", 0],

	33376 : ["The chances of Watson's career tanking due to the current allegations is quite likely, only because the number of women continue to grow seemingly each day. This isn't to say that he could never play in the NFL again, because there was a sexual assault allegation against Ben Rothlisberger in 2009. However, he has since continued to play in the NFL. Not all allegations lead to the expulsion of NFL players, but we have seen other NFL careers (e.g. Ray Rice) that was derailed due to inappropriate behavior.  The only thing that might halt the damage done to Watson's career is if he settles out of court with every accuser. However, even if that occurs, he may likely have a stained reputation that could haunt him in terms of his public image. If it becomes enough of a problem, the Texans may likely want to release him, but at the same time, it really isn't to their benefit to do so because they would have to eat the salary that they owe him. I think it is more than likely that he continues to play, but that his public image is ruined. ", 5098, "XLXncQu9aa", 2],

	33390 : ["They better earn their current wages first. Tbh Aces that story sounds like a load of bollocks and might be a rumour put out to cause more problems for Liverpool. I wouldn't read too much into that. No idea why you guys can't score goals btw. Salah, Mane, Firmino fit all season. Jota in his defence was firing before the injury and has just come back so I'd go easy on him at the moment. I don't get it really. You can talk about the defence but against the lower teams Fulham, Brighton. WBA, Burnley you've only conceded once in the recent games against each of these guys. So what's the excuse for Liverpool not scoring 2 goals and winning games 2-1?  I know it's disappointing but Liverpool fans should not let this season dampen their mood because you guys have won the CL and the league now for the first time in 30 years. You'll just have to hope it's a once off season and things will be right next season.  Btw congrats to Stevie G on securing the title, and to Defoe as well one of those players I've had a massive soft spot for over the years. It's only Defoe's second trophy as a player, I think for his talent he deserved a few more! ", 5075, "q1BX2eXuaa", 4],
	33391 : ["The players are not enjoying their football at the mo and the results reflect that. They could all do with a holiday methinks. Teams in the Premiership are like prowling Lions. There are no bad sides in the whole league and if they get a scent of blood they will go for the throat so it is a vicious circle that might take the return of significant player/s or a bit of luck in a game to get their noses in front early to give them a fairly vital adrenal kick.", 5075, "None", 1],

	33395 : ["Yes, they do, or more critically, they will notice when you do NOT exist.  I have been on a team and team members do know that they represent people and their hopes and dreams, and they are as happy as you when you win big, and as sad as you when you lose big.  Why does it work this way?  Because the team is a representation of the people.  Why are humans so obsessed with group identification and my side versus yours?  Well, that is a completely different question.  The predilection exists in humans, and is an aspect of the social animal that is mankind. In a larger philosophical sense, sure, the team and the player is not me, and there is no reason I ought to feel any identity with that/those team member(s), yet we do.  We all do it.  I just wonder what you think of as your \"team\".  You would be a very, very unusual human to not identify with some group that is your \"team\". You might decry it as useless and naive (at best), and you are right in a way, for sure, yet I am almost certain that you do it, because you are human, and that is what humans do.", 5092, "WbVE1cXKaa", -1],

	33398 : ["I live in Houston so our local news covers this a lot. Watson's attorney, Rustin Hardin, reported today that one of the woman had previously demanded $30k from Watson to keep quiet after the two had consensual sex. Still, that's only 1 out of 16 accusers.   There's also a rumor that Jack Easterby (VP of football operations for the Texans) has targeted Watson with these lawsuits to lower his trade value and force him to remain on the Texans, or alternately to force Watson out of his NFL contract would would save the Texans tens of millions of dollars. I don't buy this though, because it makes no sense that the Texans would destroy their most valuable asset.", 5093, "9YYyXzRBaa", 1],
	33399 : ["Firstly it's never a 'Logo' it's the 'Badge'. (Crest is acceptable) I didn't know they adopted the Liver Bird first.  I love the symbolism and history behind Club Badges/Crests. I think it goes back to collecting Panini stickers as a kid. Also when you go abroad on holiday and see someone sporting a footy shirt. I always check out the Badge first to see which club/country. Especially useful when it is a 2nd or 3rd kit. Badge knowledge always useful. Back to Everton's badge I associate with that tower they call it 'Rupert's Tower' You can still see it in Everton Park(and is the most unimpressive building) Anyway being born or schooled near this tower depends if you are Red or Blue.
