All my teenage years I spent obsessing over my body and my appearance. I had acne and I thought I was fat (I wasn't). I starved myself thinking if I was skinny boys would like me. Still didn't get any attention because I was so shy and awkward. I'm 19 now and starting to like the way I look. Hopefully this is something you'll grow out of but you may want to see a psychiatrist. You could be depressed or have BDD like someone else mentioned. I know how horrible it is to feel ugly, and know there is nothing you can do to change your appearance short of plastic surgery. It sucks big time. But eventually you will start seeing the good in your appearance. I did. I think being a teenager when you're not pretty, thin, and popular with a great home life is instant hell.

Beauty's in the eye of the beholder,for all you know someone might like you but just doesn't have the balls to say anything.Don't even talk about suicide you know nothing about pain thats the honest truth. @B.

Just try to relax and keep that in the back of your mind when you feel like you are about to have a panic attack. If you want, you can always go to counseling b/c They have have certain techniques that will reduce the amount and severity of your panic attacks and depression. Life brings good and bad days so just take it one day at a time.

	97144 : ["I was put on klonopin for the panic attacks but got addicted. I was told that I had Generalized Anxiety disorder. They tried me on at least 8 different antidepressants over a 10 year period and it made me manic, hyper, gave me insomnia. They told me those were just \"side effects\" and to try to get used to them. Finally, I got the correct diagnosis of Bipolar II which closely mimics anxiety disorders. The tip off is the fact that Bipolar II's usually can't tolerate antidepressants alone without the help a mood stabilizer. That's what kept throwing me into the manic phases. Once I was put on a mood stabilizer (lithium) and the doctor was treating me for the right disease, I got much better.", 9611, "493063d6139840a25805427e0c89ce9aaa", 0],

	97150 : ["Virgos don't tend to be more critical on anyone than they are on themselves. They are very critical, not just to ppl they don't like. It's not a sense of power, but more like if an argument/debate/fight is going on, they can play dirty with words & like having advantage over the other person with likely legit reasons or things you didn't think they knew. As far as unseen flaws go, Virgos are keen to details & are very meticulous by nature. They know their own flaws more than anyone else or are quick to notice them, & in others as well. There is constructive criticism & destructive criticism. I am more than happy to receive constructive criticism, but only am likely to give it if it doesn't hurt feelings. If a Virgo is destructive, there is a reason behind it that most likely involves the other person really upsetting them or a build up of feelings blown out of proportion if bottled up. It can be directed at the wrong person, they may not mean what they say, or may even apologize later. Virgos definitely use clever or foul word play to their advantage & can be quite cruel. A Virgo strength is their words. It isn't that we get a thrill or feel powerful over someone. It's more like a fighting tactic or defense mechanism.", 9614, "3pX1LzUQaa", 6],
