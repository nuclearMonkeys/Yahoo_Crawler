If you have your mare have a foal, then there's the chance of the mare not making it through the birth, and then you'd end up with a sickly and weak foal who might not have got its first drink of milk from its mother.. so from my point of view buying a foal would probably be the best idea, depending on how confident you are on whether you think the mare will come out okay. But if you buy a foal, ask the owners if you can take a look at the foal's dam and sire. You don't want to buy a foal and realize that it's not what you really wanted or if it's not of good breeding. So request to examine a foal's sire and dam before purchasing a foal if buying a foal is the path you end up going down. Also ask the owners for any information they can possibly give you about the foal and it's parents, family tree, etc. Try to get all the info you can so you can be familiar with the foal and what feed, etc., will work best with it. Hope this helps. And good luck with your decision! .. and velcropap, a colt is a foal - just a different gender. also, the asker explained that she wants both, but can only have one, so she wanted to know what would be the best decision.

Foals are cute, and although you can pick its bloodlines, you cannot guarantee it will have a good attitude or be sound. In all of your questions, you sound very young. I would suggest waiting until you are older to commit to a foal.So again, I suggest buying a 2-4 year old and being able to train it yourself or with someone alongside of you.

	69523 : ["Hey guys, the key to the problem is he's POSTing to a CGI on the backend (as evidenced by the parameter action=\"id.cgi\" in the FORM) Escaping the special characters is the problem (which is why CGI is discouraged as a backend - typically with PHP a preferred solution.) A possible solution can be found here:  You can also use Javascript's escape() function prior to POST .submit() to transform the special characters on the front end so you can use the usual parser on the CGI backend (but then you have to figure out how to unescape those characters on the backend - and how to do that depends on what you're using on the CGI backend.) If forced to use CGI, I always prefer Python.  But in most cases, that's like killing flies with a cannon.  As a result, many CGI back-ends tend to be perl since it's much lighter for straight text processing. If I recall correctly, the O'Reilly book on HTML recommended *against* using CGI if you can avoid using it.  ASP, JSP, PHP, almost anything else is preferable - esp since CGI can become a major security hole if you put too powerful a processing capability behind it (like Python) XD", 8517, "None", 2],
	69524 : ["Different areas have different animal control laws.  But yes, if they do not have a warrant you don't have to let them in - however, they WILL come back with one and then you must let them in or be held in contempt of court.  Some areas allow you to have over the limit if you apply for a special kennel license.   Others make no exceptions.  Not cooperating won't really benefit anyone, as once you are on their radar they may be back unexpectedly (and with a warrant).  Prior to their getting there, why don't you call and explain the situation and see what your alternatives are.  This is really considered a zoning violation and as such, civil disobedience is not a defense, and that is rarely a defense anyway.  Even non-payment of parking tickets (once considered an act of civil disobedience) can get you thrown in jail.  And sometimes it's the Heath Department who comes - the limit to a number of pets in a household is generally one of public health and not one of animal welfare.  And the Health Bureau generally has a lot more power than AC does.  Animal feces (like from dogs in a yard) and even indoor cat hoarder situations are a public health nuisance, and not taken lightly.  Yes, I know your cats sound clean and cared for, but that is not always the situation, and they will investigate.
