Never a great way to start a negotiation with \"You're unreasonable\" or anything like that. For example, if you feel like you should have an extension on an assignment, you wouldn't start with \"Its not fair that you won't give me an extension.\" Better with something like \"I think an extension on the assignment would be reasonable and here is why I think that....\" And if you learned something along the way, add in what you learned (I will ask for extensions ahead of time, or whatever) Also, I think it never hurts to say something at the end like \"The decision is of course yours and I will accept your decision, but hopefully you can consider my request.\"", 6416, "f3d506f1430fab32d23ae661f4553e41aa", 3],

	44716 : ["First of all, for the person who said that this incident is a case of \"kids being kids\"- Attitudes like that one have gotten many, many people HURT AND KILLED over the past 30 years or so. That kind of thinking is one of the reasons WHY we keep seeing school shootings, in fact. Every major school shooting we've seen in the US, from Columbine clear through Parkland and beyond, was motivated by one thing and one thing ALONE: A desire for REVENGE, for some act or ACTS, whether REAL or IMAGINED, on the part of the person or people doing the shooting. One of the ways that shooters like Nicky Cruz (the Parkland shooter) end up like they do is because incidents like the one that Andera has asked about here get ignored or shoved under the rug, and dismissed as though they were nothing. This is SERIOUS, and it needs to be taken seriously. It's a clear example of BULLYING- one that was serious enough to result in a child being hurt- and it sounds to ME as though the school is basically ignoring it. You aren't wrong, Andera. If this were my daughter, I would be furious with the school, and there would be some heated conversations between me, the principal, the teacher or teachers, and if necessary, the district superintendent. And the boy who did this to my daughter would be facing a long suspension- AND a mandate to get some counseling and help so that he can work through whatever issues he's dealing with without putting any other child (or ADULT) at risk. And I would give the school just SO LONG to cooperate with my demands, or they'd be hearing from my attorney about a possible LAWSUIT. Of course you don't want your daughter to grow up thinking that it's okay for another child to act that way towards her. NO parent wants that, at least none that I've ever seen. But unless this behavior is addressed immediately, and the boy in question receives a strong punishment, it will happen again- and the next time, it will be MUCH, MUCH WORSE. Bullies don't \"go away\" when they are ignored. They ESCALATE their behavior, because THEY LEARN, QUICKLY, that they can GET AWAY with whatever it was they did, and that their victim won't fight back. I'm a survivor of years of bullying and abuse myself, so I know what I'm talking about. So the cycle of bullying and abuse will continue, and it will get worse and worse, and worse- until the day finally comes when the child (who may and most likely will be a teenager by then) finally SNAPS. At that point, the end result is usually a PREVENTABLE tragedy of some sort- whether it's suicide, or something like a revenge related shooting. I've been watching this cycle happen repeatedly for the past 25 years or so, and it's always the same. The shooters in every case are motivated by their need for revenge, because most of them have endured YEARS (and in the case of the Columbine shooters, close to a decade) of abuse, bullying, and mistreatment by their peers, teachers, and the officials at their schools, who often have their heads jammed so far up their rear ends in DENIAL about what is going on and what these kids are dealing with every day of their lives that they are staring at their tonsils from the rear!!. It can even be argued that they are as much victims as the kids and adults that they KILL or have killed, in fact- but no one pays much attention to this reality.  Instead, they focus on something that is totally irrelevant, such as the misguided belief that a lot of political types have that banning guns is the way to stop a school shooting. IT ISN'T, because these shootings AREN'T ABOUT GUNS or GUN ACCESS. Instead, they are about things like MENTAL ILLNESS, developmental disabilities like Autism, BULLYING, and how America treats its children and teens who have the misfortune to be BORN WITH or to develop any or ALL of these problems while growing up. And the fact is, America treats its mentally ill and developmentally disabled citizens and non-citizens like SH*T most of the time. Banning guns isn't the answer to stopping school shootings. Neither is restricting the rights of law abiding gun owners and gun purchasers. Arming teachers isn't a solution either. Putting cops in schools? No. That's bad for multiple reasons, starting with the message it sends, which is that students are to be viewed with suspicion and not to be trusted under any circumstances. In other words, they are guilty until proven innocent, no matter what, when it should be the other way around. There is only one real way to end the cycle of violence in America's schools, and that is to address the real causes of  these horrible shootings: the mental illness, the BULLYING, and the TOXIC CULTURE that exists in American public education, primarily at the high school level, but which also exists in the primary and middle grades. That starts with NOT IGNORING incidents like the one that Andera has written this question about. Attitudes like \"kids will be kids\" and \"kids must learn to fight their own battles\" do NOTHING to help in situations like this one.", 6440, "None", 2],
