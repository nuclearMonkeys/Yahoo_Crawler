And then add the fact that u seem to have forgot what YOU were like at that age...ALL UN-COOL. What did you \"roar\" into the school lot in while blaring Metallica? A Prius? Probably. Every cool person I have ever met never even used the word cool, they just are. Of course every child thinks daddy is cool, my kids thought I spun the world when they were kids. Dude, yer an old geeky dork, deal with it. When he realizes he ain't cool either in a few years(takes after dad) you two can be un-cool together. Until then why don't you learn to screw an old 'big block Cuda' together and an old 'pan or shovel' to go with it. (Google them) When he does come around you might  have a shred of real cool to show and he will be pissed that he found his lost friends hanging out with you.", 10079, "I8Nyfer2aa", 0],

Mine doesn't even bother saying goodbye to me anymore when he leaves the house for school and he's only 9. Just remember that your son is trying to work out where exactly he fits into the world. This doesn't mean he loves you any less; it's just that he's looking into the future and you want things to stay like they were in the past, which is understandable but not fair on your son. Allow him to grow and always be there for him. In time, you guys will be best friends and the relationship will change direction again. And when he's older he'll be able to look back and remember all the wonderful times you two had together and how \"cool\" his dad was. You never know. You may be the \"coolest\" grandfather in the world by then.", 10079, "NFGQrCybaa", 1],

Don't take offense to any of his comments, his hormones are racing at 100 miles an hour, and he doesn't know the difference between when you're try to be 'cool' and a father. Try working on being a father, and not trying so hard to be his friend. Start telling him firmly your wishes, not just trying to compromise with bribes to get through to him. When he's older and high school peer pressure has passed, he'll come to realize that having you as a dad is one of the best things that's ever happened in his life. Friends will come, friends will go, but you'll always will be the one that sticks. Don't worry, this is all normal.

	109125 : ["Wow I'm sorry you feel this way. I'm 15 myself, almost 16, and I can tell you that it's just a stage that basically every teen experiences through puberty. I've been through it, some of my friends are going through it and it's completely normal. As you get to high school, things begin to change. There's this sudden pressure of being 'cool'. Now 'teen cool' can be interpreted as doing whatever the hell you want whenever, wherever. You have no parents to control you and you're independent.  I used to look up to my mom before but when I was around 14 it was really different. I would never go anywhere outside of my house with her because I was embarrassed to be seen with my mom. It's not that my mom was embarrassing, it was just the fact that everyone, especially the ''cool' kids, had their own friends and can hang out with them without any parental control. It's actually kind of stupid but that's how school is. Now I've grown out of it, I hang out with my mom all the time and a lot of my friends tell me that I shouldn't but who cares, I can do whatever I want.  Your son is still maturing and there will be a lot of pressures coming from school and friends. It's normal but everyone grows out of it, some take longer than others but it does happen. I can tell you that you're still his hero but he's way too caught up with fitting in and being 'cool' that he's hurting you without even realizing it, just like I did with my mom. You're a really cool dad, I wish my dad was like you lol, and your son knows that. Once he's matured, he'll realize how amazing you are. He'll look up to you because at one stage in his life, being 'cool' won't even matter anymore. All I can say is wait and good luck! :)", 10079, "None", 2],

He's going through a process of becoming a man and one of the aspects to that is being independent. There's nothing more childish than seeming dependent on your parent. Even if he's \"seen\" with you hanging out that's enough to seem like a kid again, and that's the last thing he wants. This will get better once he goes to college and comes to terms with you as a friend and father and less of a \"dad\" if that makes sense.", 10079, "f6YzBmQ9aa", 7],

Perform well and you will get accepted. Other than that, the only other thing you can do is to join your school's Choir/Chorus, Band, Drama Club, etc.  Be careful with band, however, because a lot of schools allow band to interrupt your normal courses which could cause you to perform poorly in school.
