Also I would use a gentle oatmeal based shampoo for sensitive skin. Follow up with some conditioner. If your dog is getting stinky in-between baths, use some bath wipes.  Sounds like your dog is suffering from dry skin. There are a couple solutions for this. One - you can start adding beneficial oils to your dog's food, like salmon oil, for example which is rich in Omega 3. But that can tend to be expensive (you can order from pet websites or might find it at the petstore). Another thing you can do is buy Vitamin E gel capsules, then break open the capsule and pour the contents over your dog's food. Within a week or so you should see a difference. If not take your dog to the vet - it may have a skin allergy or condition. TIP: Try using head and shoulders .

I don't know what kind of food you feed your dog and maybe you can just put the oil on the food you're feeding.  Some people feel that you have to feed Innova or some other high priced food to get the best nutrition, but my dog lived a long healthy life and the expensive foods did nothing for his dry skin.  Only the Nutros with oil added to it.  You can use Olive oil or Vegetable oil, it doesn't really matter, just pour a little over the food and mix it into the dry food until the bites are coated evenly, but not pooling at the bottom of the bowl.

Plus they'll keep records for you to let you know when you need oil and tranny fluid changed or checked. If you haven't changed fluid, then you also might need a new tranny filter, go ahead and get it, assuming you have an automatic tranny. If it's a manual transmission, you don't need a filter. You should have tranny oil changed about every 50K miles. Even tho' tranny fluid is special in that it cleans the tranny metal parts extremely well, once it starts to get old and dirty looking, like yours is now, then it can't clean the parts as well as before, and then the tranny starts to wear. some will even change the tranny fluid at 20K, because they want to make sure that the tranny will last as long as they own car, because it can cost up to $1000 to put in new tranny if old one breaks. But if you stick with 50,000 miles change of tranny fluid oil, you'll do fine. Besides, I think it takes a few thousand miles to condition the tranny fluid to work at its best. Let EZ lube handle your oil changes, too. They'll also check your antifreeze, and can change that when needed. They will also contact you when it's time to get various things done on your car. They're great at reminding you. it takes lots of pressure off yourself to have to remember getting them done. It's more important to make sure the engine oil is changed regularly--- every 3 mo or 3,000 miles---because that's what will keep the engine running best and longest, if you keep the oil fresh as is needed.", 9945, "6Yd3fd8Taa", 0],

	105983 : ["14 Seconds flat. Here's a little more info: Two American automotive icons set the world afire when they debuted around 1964, went through some questionable stages and recently have emerged better than ever. Can you name them? We're sure you'll agree that the Ford Mustang is one. Who could forget the Pinto-based Mustang II? Hopefully, we all can — not exactly a high point in that car's history. But the powerful, retro-styled 2005 model is anxiously awaited by many pony car fans. And the other icon? That would be the Pontiac GTO. When introduced as a high-performance version of Pontiac's Tempest, the GTO won American enthusiasts over with its combination of good looks, manageable size and pavement-scorching V8 power. The GTO was the first muscle car, a midsize car sporting a big car's engine (in this case a 389 V8), a firmed-up suspension and visual tweaks such as hood scoops, fancy wheels and chrome dual exhaust outlets. Competition, bearing names like Roadrunner, Charger, 442, SS396 and Torino Cobra quickly sprouted in rival showrooms like so many dandelions on a springtime lawn. The GTO, like other muscle cars, eventually fell victim to ever-tightening emissions regulations and horsepower dropped as quickly after 1970 as it had risen in years before. By 1974, the sacred GTO moniker was reduced to being affixed to Pontiac's Ventura, a clone of the Chevrolet Nova. That \"Goat's\" source of motivation was a 350 (5.7-liter) V8 that put out an admittedly respectable-for-the-day 200 horsepower. Still, this didn't come close to packing the punch of an old 389 with Tri-Power (triple two-barrel carburetion) that could scare the daylights out of an unprepared passenger. After 1974, there was no more GTO and all us car guys with 93 octane running through our veins never thought we'd see another one (at least not one worthy of that hallowed badge) ever again. Well, here it is 30 years after that dark time (and on what would be the GTO's 40th birthday) and we're road testing a Pontiac GTO. And we're glad to say that, for the most part, this is a worthy descendent of the old Goat. Scoping out the new GTO, you may think that Pontiac's using the body stampings from Volvo's recently departed C70 coupe. The general shape, and in particular the roof pillars, side windows and character lines are so similar, it's uncanny. But no, it has no Swedish ties. It is, however nearly a full-blooded Australian. Essentially, the new GTO is a rebadged Holden Monaro. We're sure many of you are thinking, \"Hold on a minute, what the heck is a Holden?\" Well, mates, we don't blame you a bloody bit for not knowing — even most car enthusiasts wouldn't have a clue. Holden is a General Motors division in Australia, and the Monaro is the division's modern-day muscle car. When Pontiac decided to bring back the GTO, it could've done a lot worse than choosing this Aussie relative, which happens to be powered by a Corvette V8 that drives the rear wheels. Although resembling a handsome European luxury coupe isn't necessarily a bad thing, many have expressed disappointment with the GTO's style. Those expecting twin scoops and a tach on the hood and old-school Rally wheels at the corners voiced comments to that effect, the most common being: \"It doesn't look like a GTO should.\" Of course, since it's been over three decades since the last \"real\" GTO rolled off the line, what the modern-day successor should look like is anyone's guess. Also a mystery is the use of two third brake lights, one on the rear shelf and one built into the rear spoiler. This aesthetic faux pas makes it look as if the rear spoiler is a dealer-installed option, but it is actually standard equipment. When it came to the cockpit, opinions were more unified. Displaying a combination of high-quality trim, attractive but not gaudy style and fine build quality, the interior was given high praise all 'round. A pair of genuine well-shaped buckets in back offers nearly as much comfort and support as the first-class chairs up front. A button on the outboard side of the front seat will power it (albeit slowly) forward to let a passenger in or out the back. Although we were generally impressed with the cabin, there was a smattering of complaints. The doors are heavy, something that will make Firebird owners feel at home, no doubt. Even the glovebox door shares this trait and if your passenger doesn't watch it she may end up getting a whack to the knee that'll make her feel like Nancy Kerrigan after that infamous incident involving Tonya Harding. \"Why? Why? Why did they make the glovebox door so heavy?\" One eagle-eyed staffer noticed that the metallic trim was comprised of both plain and tinted aluminum, a needless expense that had us scratching our collective heads. And a glaring turquoise-colored \"MPH\" indicator is constantly illuminated in the face of the speedometer. It seems to be there to point out the obvious and remind the driver that, yep, those numbers represent speed in miles per hour. This may seem like a petty gripe, but the retina-searing display doesn't dim when you lower the instrument lighting. Additionally, the power windows' \"one-touch down\" feature is overly sensitive, as they would almost always \"express down\" when the button was pressed lightly. This is a problem we've experienced in other GM vehicles, notably their trucks and big SUVs, and although it's not a big deal (just quickly hit the button again to stop the window's motion), it's still annoying. OK, enough about power windows already. This car is all about the power under the hood. With 350 horsepower and 365 pound-feet of torque, the 5.7-liter, \"LS1\" powerhouse runs through either a four-speed automatic (which our test car had) or six-speed manual gearbox and on to a 3.46-to-1 limited-slip rear end. Traction control is standard and a welcome feature for those who have to drive in inclement weather. Seventeen-inch, five-spoke wheels wear 245/45 BFGoodrich performance tires and even when the traction control was switched off, they did a great job launching the GTO off the line. Forget about trying to put down this new breed by comparing its performance to its ancestors (\"Back in my day, my stock GTO ran low 13-second quarters on bias-ply tires!\" Yeah, right, and when I used to walk to school, it was uphill both ways.in the snow!). Blasting from zero to 60 in just 5.5 seconds and blitzing the quarter-mile in 14 ticks flat means a 2004 GTO will simply embarrass nearly any old Goat you could name. When we discovered that we were getting an automatic car, we were at first a little bummed. We car nuts tend to love shifting gears ourselves, but we found it hard to criticize the performance of the GTO's automatic tranny. GM automatics tend to be among the best in the world, and this one upheld that lofty reputation. Upshifts occur smoothly and with barely a pause in acceleration when you've got your toes in the carpet, and downshifts happen with the snap and precision of a military salute. And with such a broad spread of power, the four perfectly spaced gears are plenty. Kinda makes us wonder why certain high-end German carmakers think they need six or even seven speeds in their automatics. Still, an automanual setup would be nice, and it's ironic that it isn't offered in light of the fact that Pontiac actually presented this feature back in the 1960s. Anyone remember the old Hurst Dual Gate (also called \"his and hers\") gear selector that allowed ratchet-style manual shifting of one's GTO? Or are we just showing our age? When it comes to hauling down all that mass (we're talking 3,700 pounds), the antilock four-wheel disc brakes are just as capable of arresting the GTO as the LS1 is at flinging it down the road. Anytime you can stop from 60 mph in under 122 feet, that's pretty darn good, and the GTO pulled down a best of 121.1 feet. Doubly impressive is the fact that this was the third out of three back-to-back panic stops, which indicates that the easily modulated brakes obviously had no problems with fading under hard use. Scanning over the chassis specs, the '04 GTO looks great on paper: four-wheel independent suspension, variable-assist power steering and those sticky tires promise a good time for twisty road traveling. On the street, we appreciated the luxury carlike ride quality, and when pushed a bit, the GTO seemed to handle predictably and respectably, despite a fair amount of body roll. But when driven more aggressively, the car felt heavy and the steering felt a little slow and numb. Running through the slalom at our test track cemented these impressions. Honestly, we expected a firmer ride and sharper handling. This is nothing that a little suspension tuning (such as stiffer shocks and springs) and parts bin scavenging (a quicker steering box) can't cure. We think that Pontiac should offer an optional sport package and for old time's sake call it the Judge option. We can almost see the commercial now: \"Here comes da Judge, and it's ready to set any road straight.\" With a list price of around $33 grand, some folks think, \"That's a lot of money for a Pontiac.\" Their mindset tends to be that the new Goat is a replacement for the Trans Am (which in a way, it is) and until they actually see the car, figure that it has mediocre interior materials, some cheesy design elements and a solid rear axle (as opposed to a more sophisticated independent rear end). The reality is that the '04 GTO is well built, boasts excellent fit-and-finish, has a world-class powertrain along with an Indy rear end and comes loaded with the exception of a sunroof and a navigation system. In fact, the only option is the six-speed manual transmission (at $695), though we would like to see Pontiac offer those other two features mentioned above. If you want to shop around for other true four-seaters that can run with this Pontiac, you'll be visiting BMW and Mercedes-Benz showrooms and be looking at $50,000-plus window stickers. So is this transplanted Aussie a Pontiac GTO? No, not if the chief criterion is that it be born in the U.S.A. — though it is a product of the General. But definitely yes in the sense that it's a midsize Poncho with a tire-smokin' V8 that can show its taillights to most anything else on four wheels.", 9945, "AA10802905", 0],
