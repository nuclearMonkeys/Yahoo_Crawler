Try out different hair products from the drug store (they are very cheap here, so you can get more for you buck). If you want to splurge \"CHI silk infusion\" has helped tame my hair.  If your lucky sometimes the have it at Marshalls otherwise you can find it online or at a beauty store.  Use tiny amounts otherwise your hair will become too oily.  Also, try washing your hair at night, let it air dry, don't sleep on it wet. Usually by the next day the \"frizz\" has gone down.\"  Also on Youtube search for hair tutorials. Lots of great hair tips there. Anyways, what I wish someone had told me was that every person has to find the right combination for themselves.

Furthermore, krav gives very little in actual martial training, good luck getting any moves off on a legit karate black belt. You can say what you want, \"we have eye gouging\" or \"we have groin shots\", it doesn't change the fact that karate has all that and then some. Brazilian jujitsu is nothing more that ground focused judo, which is a \"traditional\" martial art. The martial arts such as karate and taekwondo do in fact work, and there are people out there that can prove it to you. Whether it works for you doesn't change the art's effectiveness.", 8099, "None", 4],
	61035 : ["A-lot of effort, time, sweat, blood, and bruising. Was it difficult o yeah, especially when I went from a black back to a white bc I was taking a new art. Yes there were injuries.  I took Tae Kwon Do when I was 10. I had a good teacher and he taught practicality. Once during a sparring match I did a \"tornado kick\" and my foot landed wrong and I twisted it very bad. I just ignored it but it never healed right. Now my right foot is knocked to the side a bit. Doesn't effect my walking, running, or kicking, it's just weird. After 4 yrs in Tae Kwon Do I earned my 1st Dan.  After that I heard of Bujinkan Ninjutsu and decided to take that bc who wouldn't want to be a ninja right? Wrong. Master Scott taught violent fluidity with extreme practicality. He erased every false idea or expectation/perception I had on Ninjutsu. He would say \"Violence is to be met with better violence\", bc fighting is violent and I began to see who devastating martial arts could be. He taught in a way similar to hardcore kajukenbo and it was almost like a mix between Muay Thai, BJJ, and Judo, but it wasn't, it was ninjutsu. After 6 yrs of hell lol, I earned my 1st Dan in that.  I thought I was happy with what I learned until I was told about AKBAN Ninjutsu. It's like ninjutsu mixed with MMA. So now I have been taking that and it is very demanding. Look us up at www.akban.org. We go over everything. Standup, ground, grappling, clinch, weaponry, firearms, basic to advanced first aid, swimming, etc. We focus on superb fitness with a perfect cardio, stamina, and strength to weight ratio mix. It takes about 12 yrs to qualify for a black and I currently have about 8 or 9 yrs to go. My previous training from bujinkan greatly helps though. We also learn technique from Muay Thai, BJJ, Krav Maga, Judo, Hapkido and other things to make us very well rounded. Our motto is No Shortcuts. I am currently a Green Belt Lvl 4 and have been in the art for 3 yrs.  When I was 19 I started MMA. I was considered amateur for 2 yrs until just this year. I am now fighting semi pro as a flyweight. Yes... I am short :(  But I don't want to go pro. I plan to go back to college, bc unfortunately where I live, no one gave a **** about my associates or the years of experience I had to go with it... grr. So now I am going back to get my bachelors while teaching at my gym in the future as a full instructor instead of just an assistant and privately training.  So, yeah, it has been a long hard road and I still have along way to go.", 8099, "None", 1],

I use my Lea Journo La Forme Styling lotion (curl definer and enhancer) and Mirroir Glossing Cream (glossing cream to help frizz) religiously. After finding these products I tossed my mouse and hair spray all together. They will keep your curls beautiful all day without the frizz or the white flakes or stiffness you find with mouse and hair spray. All you have to do is put some all throughout your hair after you shower and let it air dry.  Also, the glossing cream will help repair your damaged ends. They are both AWESOME products.

	61044 : ["The most important thing is dedication and consistency.  A lot of people start martial arts thinking about how quickly they are going to get a black belt, and burn themselves out by the time they get to yellow belt, if they even make it that far. You have to love the art or you won't make black belt.  If you are working with a serious school that isn't just trying to churn out belts and make money, it is going to take time and effort.  Sometimes your instructor will make you do things that seem boring and you will wonder why you are doing it.  Other times the instructor will have you do things that you don't think you will be able to do.  This is all part of the process of learning discipline and overcoming your own beliefs of what is possible or not possible for you to accomplish. In my 10 years of training I have never broken anything.  I have had a serious sprain due to doing a movement incorrectly, and I have had serious swelling from taking strikes in a fight, but nothing that has prevented me from wanting to continue training.  However it is a very physical sport so aches and pains do come with the territory to some degree.", 8099, "None", 0],
	61045 : ["It honestly depends on the quality of the institution. There are a lot of \"belt factories\" out there that care only about getting your money, having you take a \"test\" (go through the motions), and they give you a belt. Steven Hawking could get a \"black belt\" at these places. A far better school would not CARE how much you've paid. You will be rewarded only by how hard you work. My Tae Kwon Do school emphasized stretching and preparation. Pulled muscles are a real possibility. The most likely injuries come from tests (if given at your school) involving board or brick breaking. I've seen a lot of broken hands.", 8099, "PtRmhxU9aa", 0],

	61050 : ["I strongly doubt it. Although Kobe does have the tendency to handle the ball more often than his teammates, it doesn't really do damage to his team. And of course, Kobe really didn't have much choice, back in 06-07. He just had to have the ball or else, the Lakers wouldn't have much chance winning games.  I gotta admit, Kobe does sometimes handle the ball way to much. But that's not always considered as ball-hogging (unless he does it excessively and affects his team's performance in a bad way, especially when he has too many turnovers). At least he has improved his ways now. I don't think people who are calling Kobe a \"ball hog\" know what they're talking about. Or maybe they're just being narrow-minded and just can't accept the fact that Kobe is one the best. The more they criticize, the more it gets pathetic.", 8098, "None", 1],
	61051 : ["I went through the same experiences as Karate Dave and Ray H. I did not get a Black Belt, I was burned out with hardcore training after the first 9 years. I also was not very good at memorizing katas. Yes, it took a lot of effort to go back to train week after week, when the majority of the training consists of beating other people for real and other people beating you up for real. No gloves or protective equipment was allowed. Mats were not allowed back in the 1980's because there are no mats in a street fight. We had to throw each other onto bare floors. Kajukenbo is not really technically that difficult. It just took a lot of motivation to continue going through brutal and painful workouts, with a high injury rate. I got smashed up a lot. Everyone in a Kajukenbo class gets smashed up due to the dangerous training methods we agreed to participate in. Fortunately I have no broken bones. My joints are OK.", 8099, "ERqRrTNoaa", 0],

I have lost track of the number of times I have broken toes( 8 I think), fingers( 5 or so), or my nose( 5 or 6 times), and ribs once or twice and various sprains, bruises and such.  I hold dan rank in three styles including Kajukenbo which is notorious for it hardcore training and hard contact sparring. Martial arts and Martial sports are contact endeavors, there will be the occasional injury. That does not mean it is all pain. In a good class the injuries will be held to a minimum, the whole point is to be able to train and be healthier as well as learn a sport or life protection ( depending on the focus of the school). If you are injured you cannot train. WTF Taeknowdo requires chest and head protection as well as hand and foot pads for sparring but eventually is full contact.

	61060 : ["A slightly better way to compare is to look at assists per 36 minutes.  If you look at that, LeBron had 6.9 assists per 36 minutes, Kobe had 4.9. Yes, that is a significant difference. LeBron is a forward, Kobe is a guard.  You expect LeBron to have more rebounds, because he's taller and plays closer to the basket.  By the same token, you expect Kobe to have more assists.  But he's way behind. The other factor is the quality of the players surrounding them.  Kobe has Gasol and Bynum and Odom to pass the ball to... all competent players, perfectly capable of making a shot if given a decent look.   Any one of them is better then anybody that LeBron has available when he makes a pass. When you consider those two factors...

	61071 : ["I've been studying since 1980 - 33 years now.  The training seems to change every so often, depending on the trends.  When I first started, it was sport - but hard-core full-contact, and a bloody nose and broken finger were common.  No sparring gear.  Then the trend, to reduce injuries, was to use foot and hand pads.  That took getting used to, since using foot gear used to consist of a cotton sock with toe and heel removed, and a pad added for the shin.  That meant reduced surface area on the foot for many kicks, and on a linoleum floor, that was always a risk for slip and falling.   Then the trend to have padded floors was added, and that meant more grip on the feet.  No more falling and slipping, but a twisted ankle and knee were very common. In time, we added head gear and hogu (chest protector).  Yeah... try doing a roundhouse or front kick without getting the chest gear jammed in your throat.  So that took getting used to, as did the logistics of tying them on: it required help of a partner, which doesn't seem like a big deal.  But when you're used to competing alone, that was all of a sudden a huge problem.  Now they use velcro and easy snap-ons, but that wasn't originally available. All through out my training, the trend was increased competition, fueled by the Olympics.  This was all the rage, just like now MMA is all the rage.  With this rage, TKD schools sprang up on every street corner, and it seemed like the instructors were getting younger and younger, and the older ones were always ex-military Olympic coaches.  Nobody seemed to want self-defense, and the folks who were in TKD for awhile got put to the side to make way for the incoming kids who just wanted to compete.  The kids were now the bread and butter of every instructor. It was originally taboo to leave a school and go with another.  That was grounds for having your father executed, it seemed.  But with places springing up everywhere, few holding traditional values, the Age Of The Contract was born.  Suddenly, it was a rite of passage to see how many schools you can bounce to and fro.  Which is what I did, I bounced.  And I occasionally got lambasted for it, saying I must only \"serve one master\". I finally settled down, earned my black belt, and continue to train.  It's not taboo anymore to cross train, and I train in Aikido, and also, I am a guest at Karate schools from time to time. I believe that it takes wanting a black belt to realize that having the belt is meaningless without the knowledge.  For those who see black belt as a goal, that's fine.  Just know that it's not the end of the journey, and if you focus solely on the belt, you miss out on the really important - and fun - stuff.", 8099, "tinXiBOZaa", 3],
