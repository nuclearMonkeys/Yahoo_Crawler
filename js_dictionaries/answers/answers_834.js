	46299 : ["  On average yes it's more expensive, which is due to having to first meet certain criteria, followed by the fact that generally speaking organic vegetables are more land usage intensive, than the non organic. The price can range depending on first with the farm and the local market. It will generally range from as being little as ten cents a pound, to well up over a dollar a pound. As an example broccoli, the non organic can run two nineteen cents a pound, and organic as much as two dollars sixty nine cents a pound.   But it can also cost more depending on whether or not it's from heirloom seed stock. That also can drastically affect the value, especially with heirloom seed sources. As those usually will also carry generally a higher premium for the seeds. So that's also another point that can determine the overall pricing for organic versus non organic. It's become more now of a way to get money for the same basic food items, than they would otherwise normally draw, because it plays a big role with general marketing demographics. Even those with the most refined or sensitive palettes, haven't been able to discern any small difference in taste from organic to non organic, and again the same where the overall nutritional value is concerned.", 6602, "MD1FznnXaa", 2],
	46300 : ["Really depends on where you live. If you live close to the organic farms, it may be nearly the same price as other local produce. The further it has to shop, the more its going to cost, especially out of season produce.  Co-ops and farmer's markets tend to have reasonably priced organic produce, especially if it is grown locally. Unless you actually know that the source is an organic farm, you may be paying more for a lable as found in a few farmers market stings. ", 6602, "pCTN3G3oaa", 1],

At all. And I was paying for it every month. And there was nothing it was giving me… except, presumably, fun factor. But it wasn't fun. It was about as fun as going to the supermarket to buy groceries. You don't do that for fun, you do it because you need groceries. Perhaps coincidentally, you also pay for groceries, just as I was paying for this subscription. I realized the reason I was still playing was because I was paying… and I was paying because I was playing. Seemed really crazy to me once I thought about it. There were some people I played with at times, and I liked chatting with them, but I didn't need to be on WoW to do that. And all this other stuff- raiding the same place again and again, running instances again and again, etc. were all pretty boring. I also came to the realization that in the amount of time I had spent playing this game, I could have done so many other things that were a whole lot more fun or, for that matter, necessary or rewarding. So I quit. The reactions of most of those folks I mentioned ranged from incredulity to dismissal. Yeah- that guy? He'll be back. I didn't come back though. Not even on free weekends. This isn't to say WoW sucks and is boring, but like any other game it gets to the point where the excitement and fun of it really tapers off. I hit that point with WoW, but I do still play other games here and there. Just not because I have to justify what I'm paying into it. If it gets to the point where it's not fun, I drop it and move on- or just do something else that is fun. Maybe you have gotten to that point with video games in general. Could be you just burned out on it from way too much gaming. It happens, and you may or may not get over it. But the point is, if it's not fun anymore, then don't do it. And don't miss it either; there's no point. Go do something you enjoy instead.", 6588, "jygvLzIwaa", 0],
