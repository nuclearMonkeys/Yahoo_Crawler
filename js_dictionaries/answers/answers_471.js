The dog must get far more aerobic-type exercise than you are providing, and it must be a daily thing.   (If you don't understand the term AEROBIC please look it up.) b.) High energy dogs also tend to be highly intelligent and they REQUIRE mental stimulation (aka mental exercise) as well as physical exercise, if they are not being WORKED doing what they were BRED to do. Working dog are meant to be problem-solving dogs. 2) Can you bring a kitten into the home (after KNOWINGLY having an adult cat, she mercilessly tormented)?  Reply: HIGHLY UNLIKELY.   a.) What was a RAT Terrier bred to do?  = To KILL rats.   b.) How DIFFERENT do you think a kitten or cat looks from a rat?  (Wolf rats are esp LARGE, btw.)  It was not a special situation with THAT cat, the dog was acting on BRED-IN instincts and a kitten is even less defensive, than an adult. You either need to re-home the dog, or get past the idea of any type of cat, or small furry pet.  Why not make lemonade out of lemons & get more active with this dog - doing things like agility, tracking, nose-work, barn hunts, terrier trials, lure coursing (all actual AKC sports).  These activities will not only help DEPLETE the high energy, but will provide mental stimulation - that seems to be \"missing\" for your dog.", 4107, "v2MrWQimaa", 2],

	26110 : ["I don't understand how animal control can come out and take the dog without issuing warnings to you first. If the landlord has warned you about excessive dog barking, that would be a different matter.  Animal control had permission from the property owner/caretaker to remove the animal. You might be able to get the dog back with no fine but chances are slim.  They at require you to take classes in dog care and to go over the city/county/township rules to make sure you are aware there is a problem as well as how to resolve the problem.  Not all solutions for barking dogs involve a shock collar, that solution is for lazy people that want an instant cure to the problem they created with their laziness and lack of proper training for the dog in the first place. Why is it that lately you have allowed the dog to bark 24/7?  Your neighbor is correct about it being a nuisance and most cities have a barking dog ordinance in place that does make it illegal for dog owners to leave their dogs barking non stop all night. Did you ever wonder why  your dog suddenly started barking every night?  Is the dog sick? Cold?  Hungry? Bored?   Normally dogs don't bark just because they like the sounds of their own bark.  They either need or want something and they are trying to get anyone's attention.  Maybe they are desperately lonely or maybe there is something that is hurting their ears. You will have to change something about the arrangements you have currently with the dog.  Check with your mom to see if she will allow the dog to be inside at night, that may be one possible solution to your problem.", 4059, "None", 7],

Second (if allowed) what does the lease say about complaints about barking?  Surely you were to have been notified (in writing) if the dog caused a problem and (expected to either FIX the dog ISSUE or re-home the dog) withing X number of days. If your dog was not running loose - was it contained in a fenced yard or was in your apartment....?.  If INDOORS, =under WHAT LAW, did Animal Control operate (including a total lack of SEARCH WARRANT) to enter an apartment (premises) to SEIZE your dog?  Normally, Animal Control can WARN you (for something like nuisance barking) but cannot take a dog unless.... its life is in danger from say lack of water, lack of shelter or severely unsanitary conditions (like standing in is own waste).  So DO TELL...... what else..... are you, not TELLING US about this \"supposed\" situation?
