I didn't do any of the work when it came to potty training, I let them take the lead. When they showed interest, I helped. When they weren't interested, I backed off. I never pushed them into it at all. The older 2 were completely trained by 3 and the 3rd son by 3 1/2. None ever had a accident after they decided to be done with diapers. The only part I played in the process was to praise them like crazy when they did go in the potty and to not say anything when they didn't. I didn't want to scold them for going in their diaper because how am I to know if perhaps physically, they just couldn't hold it.  I think it's better to have them do it on their own rather than to have a parent pushing them. But that's my opinion and what has worked for us.", 8979, "Bd9btsYkaa", 1],

	79306 : ["It takes boys longer to potty train, I know, I had three to potty train. Since he was trained earlier, he will catch the drift of it when he's ready. My middle son was nearly three when he was completely trained. It just takes time & lots of patience. Maybe when he starts using the potty chair regularly, & is staying dryer longer, you could buy him some pull ups or some big boy's underwear with cartoon characters on them. That might encourage him to use the potty more often. I agree with you, he needs to sit when using the potty chair. Maybe giving him one of his books to read would encourage him to use the potty. Make that the bathroom only book & offer it to him in the bathroom only. Give him lots of praise when he goes on the potty & if he doesn't go while sitting on it, hug him & tell him what a big boy he's getting to be. That's music to a little boy's ears.

	79322 : ["One person wrote, \"My other friend had her son go pantless for a weekend in the house.\" That is precisely how many families I know in the Chinese community do it.  It takes 100% of your attention and your child must show signs that he is ready.  We used a similar method for a few hours at time around the time we expected that he would need to pee. LA Parent Magazine once recommended not making too big a celebration when they pee or poop as it can add pressure for them to perform. I agree and moderate praise worked well for us.  LADIES - Standing up to pee -  it is easier. Take it from a male's point of view. It was also easy for me to demonstrate to him. No cherrios - no candy (bad habit) - no toys. Between the age of 6-12 months my son sat on the small toilet as part of a morning ritual and went #1 and #2. It became habit and routine. Of course he was not really trained and used diapers. After age 1 this ritual became more difficult and we did not push it. At age 2.5 my wife decided that it was time - we introduced underwear and within a few days he was trained with occasional accidents as all kids have. He still used diapers/pull-ups at night but by his 3rd B-day he used underwear at night. One male cousin was fully trained at 2yrs and another at 2.5 yrs (both in Chinese household) and both were trained over 2 or 3 days.  ** One of the biggest advantages and one of our incentives of early training - many preschools will not accept children who are not yet trained.", 8979, "fYRDy3h4aa", 0],
	79323 : ["If you are only looking to lose a small amount of weight I would recommend doing some light cardio (ie: walking, riding a bike around the block a few times, etc.) at least 3-4 times a week for at least 30 minutes at a time. Not only will you probably shed a few unwanted pounds but also start to feel better. I'd also recommend a more protien and less fat in your meals to curb your appetite.  I'm not sure of your height but I am thinking with your weight you should only be consuming about 1,400 calories a day.

Her filling out is most likely due to the fact that her hormones have come into kick start for the onset of puberty, that's perfectly normal lol, she may start to get conscious of her body appearance but there really isn't anything to worry over at all. There is a book published by Usborne books and its called \"What's happening to me?\" Its about £7 or £8. There is a pink one for girls and a blue one for boys, it explains to children from age 9-12 years of age the issues of their own body from puberty and about the opposite sex as well as drugs, diet, feelings, friends, parents and other topics. I've found it to be a very valuable resource and my son who is 10 is not in the slightest embarrassed about any of the issues raised in the book, he asks alot of questions in relation to the book, and feels happy to be in the know rather not know.

	79333 : ["The first person who replied \"kind of creepy\" is a jerk. She must not understand what a real dad is supposed to be like. With that being said, I have a daughter who is also almost ten years old and a little overweight. She has commented on the exact same thing so I know how you felt when she said that!  I don't lie to my kid, so when she asked if she was \"chunky\", which is what another kid had said to her, I told her that she was just a little and that it was okay b/c everyone is different. I then told her that what is more important than her weight right now is a healthy active life style. She sometimes says \"mom does it look like I'm getting skinnier?\" and I just choose to ignore her or sometimes I may say yes, it does. It's extremely hard to know exactly what is the right thing to say but at their age, if you tell them they aren't a little overweight, they know that you are lying- b/c they understand image now and they can look in the mirror and know they are overweight. It sounds like you are a good dad and if she wants to go to the gym with you, let her go! This is such a weird age and I see it more and more everyday. I wish you luck though and I guess we both will figure out what to do sooner or later! Good Luck and as you said, love her no matter what!!

	79334 : ["All youngsters are exclusive, however from individual expertise...I've a 2year ancient close to three we simply introduced the potty chair to him to get him the inspiration that that's where you go to go potty. So everytime he goes into the toilet he takes his diaper off and sits on the potty. We by no means push it on him. I dont bother with the pullups considering he already knows to take the diaper off to move potty. Unless your child is potty expert and wishes the additional defense over night, i would not trouble with the pullups. But that is my opinion. You will see the indicators when he is capable.

	79335 : ["Every child differs and you just have to be patient. The biggest thing is making sure you tell/show them how important it is to you that they go in the toilet. Now every child differs and you just have to try different things to see how they react. Then just wait and pray for the day they start going themselves. Be careful in strange places they might not be comfortable. Our daycare provider actually lined em up every couple of hours and told them it was time to go potty. He didnt have any accidents at her place. You may also want to try taking them potty with you. Tell them you are going potty and explain what you are doing. Kids are curious and copy catters in their process of learning. They crave any knowledge you bestow upon them. Our son quickly learned how to pull down his own pants, pull himself back on the toilet, holding himself up and going. Our biggest mistake was getting pull ups, cause that just put him back in comfort of peeing his pants. Small rewards can help too.

	79347 : ["Hi. This was my biggest parenting fear for my two sons. They are now 3 and 5. The first child is always pretty hard. The second was super easy. You need to make his time around the potty the absolute best thing he can do with his day. Tell him that it is time to visit his potty. Get him some cheap little toys. Tell him that when he goes pee pee on his potty, that makes the potty feel happy. Then, give him a little toy or a treat that he likes. May a HUGE deal out of it the first time he goes.....call daddy at work, grandma and grandpa, friends, etc. Two years old is early to train them. I waited until 3 for my first son to start. My youngest started on his own and never needed help. He was trained at 2, but it was so much help to have his big brother doing it, too. If he starts to get bored with the new toys and treats, you have to get more creative. We got our son a talking and singing potty chair. (Walmart, $40) When he goes, there is a sensor and the chair sings and flahes lights! You do realize that you will need to use diapers at night, right? There is no way a child this young will go all night without a diaper. They don't have that Urge to go yet programmed into their brains. Just make sure when he gets up, he puts on underwear/pullup. We took our kids to the store and let them choose what underwear they wanted....cartoons on them and stuff like that. Tell him that if he is a big boy and goes potty, you will let him pick out any type of underwear he wants, cause that's what big boys do. Just praise him. Also, keep in mind that some kids are very slow to train. Don't get discouraged and never make a huge deal out of it if he doesn't want to use the potty on a particular day or if he pees his pants. It is a learning process....sooner or later, he is going to realize that it is better to be clean and dry, then to be wet.", 8979, "4550d1a6940c14994a272912d8cd6de4aa", 1],
