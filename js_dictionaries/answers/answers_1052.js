	58079 : ["\"How come if a man and woman have consensual sex after drinking and both later regret it, he's considered a rapist and she the victim?\" Because universally, women have a much higher sexual value than men do.  Nobody denies this, and nobody, most notably feminists, care to equalize this either.  So the entire society works towards protecting and elevating the sexuality of women, while they fear and increasingly criminalize the sexuality of men. Men and women are different.  And nowhere does anybody deny this when it comes to sex and sexuality as is so obvious.  But we are supposed to pretend otherwise when it comes to other \"political incorrect\" realties where men are valued much higher than women.  We all know the game.  But we just shut up about it because its not worth speaking openly about it in public.  Truthfully though, there can be no gender equality when we only really care about one side of the equation. .", 8052, "aSm9xSn3aa", 3],

If your uncle and aunt is willing I would have them to contact a reputable team of paranormal investigators in their area for a consultation. Most groups are not for profit and are easily found on the web. They would be most willing to come out since it would be able to further their research to do so. I will say that eventhough you had bad dreams, the likelyhood of there being something there that is inhuman and will hurt you is minute...its been going on for a long time and no one has been hurt yet. Now to your sisters home. Same rule applies. The only thing I would add is that in the case of most real hauntings, it might not be the house so much as it is the property surrounding it. When the Higher Power created this place called earth, he only made so much real estate. Happiness,sadness,tragic events etc have been played out on all land.

	58088 : ["There's no evidence that feminists are responsible for circumcision or false rape accusations to any degree more than non- feminists.   Given that men must surely know more than women about the effects of ( male) circumcision, if you are looking to place blame at anyone's feet then it should more reasonably be men who are accepted as most responsible for allowing it to happen to their children. How would a woman be expected to know what it does to a man? Again there really is no evidence how feminists feel about this although seeing as bodily autonomy is a big thing for feminists, it is highly unlikely that feminists, more than non-feminists, would agree with male circumcision. As for false rape accusations, I think they are much less common than actual incidences of rape.

After all, EVERY feminist gives the classic definition of feminism.  Even radical feminists do.  But too often it's only brought out to stop the critics of modern feminism from speaking out against the misandry and critical theory aspects of feminism.  Which is strange, because that ideological stuff has nothing to do with basic equality and classic feminism.  So why do all feminists SAY they believe in equality, but they all support the radicals and misandrists? .", 8053, "aSm9xSn3aa", 3],

When one woman a fortnight is killed in a domestic dispute it is taken as serious.  When several men a day take their own life via suicide it never reaches the news.  When assessment procedures were changed to favour females in schools claiming that the reason more girls were not continuing was perceived discrimination, yet now that more girls than boys complete the education and they also are given higher grades the claim is that it proves girls are better.  No mention of the active discrimination that is still perpetuated.
