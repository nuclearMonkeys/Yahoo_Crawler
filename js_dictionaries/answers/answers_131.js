People keep telling me to have confidence. I have some attributes that would make people to have confidence. Like, I have professional job earning enough to be within top 1-2%. but, I see what I'm lacking (I'm not tall, I'm not handsome, I'm not strong, I have almost no sense of humor, I can't speak well, I'm not smart, I have no leadership, I'm not fun to be with, etc...) and when i look at what I'm lacking, it's very difficult to have self confidence.  I guess, if I have everything and have no iniquities, I would probably feel confident. I know some people keeps telling others to just have confidence. But, how can you have confidence when you don't feel confident? You can pretend you are confident for an while. But, you tend to go back to the way you are.  So, probably, it's the way you were born with. Or maybe parents constantly complimented you and boosted your confidence when you were little. ", 1041, "ytJOMWTQaa", 1],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 1075, "None", 0],
	6565 : ["The SECRET to longevity on EURO cars is very simple! Every 100,000 miles ALL THE FLUIDS must be REPLACED  and the BRAKE FLUID must be FLUSHED and refilled every 2 YEARS! CHECK your COOLANT LEVEL and realize once again that it MUST BE CHANGED as they update the chemistry. Your CAR sounds like it has a BAD THERMOSTAT which is NOT very pricey but use ONLY A GENUINE VOLOV can call 1-800-ALL-EURO and have one sent to you at a discounted rate! POWER WASH your engien as well ! It is getting OLDER and the space between the RADIATOR and the AC CONDENSER will be full of DEA BUGS< DEAD GRASS, TWIGS and ROAD KILL and maybe even MICE or RAT nests and feces! IT will improve cooling a LOT! YOU  MAY need to remove the UPPER RADIATOR Support with i simple HAND TOOLS to get access! USE GUNK ORIGINAL ORANGE engine cleaner for this! It is mostly diesel fuel! LEAVE the engine RUNNING while you clean EVERYTHIGN under the hood! If you have been using VALVOLINE a HIRRLBE OIL that creates SLUDGE< TAR, VARNISH WAX and COKE as it hardens, you will need a SLUDGE REMOVAL chemical like LIQUI MOLY sludge remover! BEGIN using PENNZOIL ULTRA EURO as it CLEANS as you DRIVE and removes the baked in SLUDGE inside the engien with EASE! It is made from NATURAL  GAS and NOT crude oil WAX< ASH or TAR like other oils are! IT MEETS the HIGH VOLVO Standards for Oil choices and carries a warranty to 500,0000 miles with PROOF OPF PURCHASE!

THERE is a GENTLE cooling system cleaner ALSO made by LIQUI MOLY< one of the GREAT German suppliers! YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO REPLACE THE HEATER CORE< so use the PROPER COOLANT and a GENTLE cleaner> PRESTONE is WAY too harsh! WHAT OIL have you been using??? EUROPEAN CARS require FULL EURO SYNTHETIC with certain SPEC NUMBERS ONLY! LIQUI MOLY , AMSOIL< TOTAL ENERGY OIL and PENNZOIL all make one for you! USING A PENNZOIL Oil filter is a GOOD IDEA as it is NOT made from paper, but from SYNTHETIC FIBERS! >>>If your BRAKE FLUID is VERY VERY DARK R BROWN it is a DEAD FLUID! it is an ESTER compound that ATTRACTS moisture from the AIR! When it darkens it is a DEAD FLUID and particles come out like LIQUID SANDPAPER!  IN TIME this TOXIC fluid will; begin to et your BRAKE HOSES< and LINES< the MASTER CYLINDER< and ABS PUMP seals and scratch the CALIPERS! YOU DO NOT WANT THAT!!  It can even cause SHRIVELING of the seals and LEAK internally!  ANYWAYS that is THAT! IT is time to DRAIN and FILL the trans fluid as well as it will start to get FUSSY when loses it's FRICTION COEFFICIENT! HOPEFULLY you have a reliable ZF transmission in there along with ZF steering system!  ASK at 1-800-ALL-EURO for more help!   had HIGH WATER CONTENT in the COOLANT< ice may have DISTORTED the THERMOSTAT and now you must replaced it!
