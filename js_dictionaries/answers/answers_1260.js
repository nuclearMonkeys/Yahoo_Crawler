This will remove dead skin, allow for a closer shave, and prevent excess skin blocking the follicules and causing bumps Moisturise afterwards. With a gentle moisturiser. This will help stop the skin becoming dry and irritable.  When you shave always use shaving cream or really really soap up your legs to allow a smooth, soft shave.

Get a sharp razor (not dull or over-used), and not the disposable kind. Also, the more blades, the better. 5.) Shave in the direction opposite of hair growth 6.)

	68545 : ["It boils down to the constant \"war\" in this country that is not highly publicized, but it exists.  It is the war between the races.  We are not supposed to have prejudices, we are not supposed to be racists, yet when a black against white or the reverse type of crime occurs, the subject comes up again and again. I wonder if Zimmerman can get a fair trial in that community?  If I were his legal counsel, I would be asking to have this thing moved away from an area where it has already been highly debated and he has been already found guilty by the liberals and blacks who live in that area. I'm very sad that in this day and age our nation still is thinking this stuff.  When will a person be a person and there not be a label like \"African American\" or whatever mentioned when we hear of anything on the news, etc.  I'm tired of it and why does it matter?  When people are labeled by the media, immediately the stereotypical images appear and people respond.  If it is a description of a missing person, yes it matters, or a person who just robbed a bank and they are trying to get us to help apprehend them, fine, but otherwise our media and everyone else shouldn't be attaching labels.  I think those labels contribute to bad feelings and foster them. I am trying to understand Zimmerman's use of a weapon.  We were not there to hear what was said and see how this kid appeared when he was approaching.  I cannot judge if he was correct in using his firearm or not.   I am an NRA trained gun owner and I was told to reach into my concealed carry purse if I am in a parking garage or less populated parking lot going towards my car and to put my hand on my gun in order to be able to pull it out if I feel threatened.  We all know there are car jackings and a female alone in the darkness of a deserted garage could be a victim.  I do reach into my special compartment in my purse when I am alone and walking towards my car.  If someone were hiding between the vehicles, I would be able to quickly move into a self defense stance.  Would I be the one in court if I shot someone?  Probably.  But, I wouldn't shoot unless I had to, but who is to say what that \"had to\" means to one person and then to another. This guy might have over reacted, but he shouldn't be in jail for life if he did.  Being on trial for manslaughter is what I would say here and if he is found guilty a half way house so he can still work and community service is what I would recommend.  I probably would go as far as to take away his privilege to own a firearm as well. And, if I were him and I were found innocent, I would move as far away from those predators who are after me as I could possibly go and never look back.", 8466, "AA12212403", 0],

	68549 : ["Only three answers so I actually read them instead of skimming them (most people incorrectly use \"scan.\"  Scan means to examine closely, line by line, point by point, letter by letter if need be.)  Had someone else given you a good answer, I would have gone on.  I have weeks of unopened email that the Yamster would not let me open, now I am playing ketchup. You fit the term \"healthy insomniac.\"  I have gone for months on three hours a night with four to six fifteen minute to half an hour naps scattered throughout the day.  Unfortunately, right now I seem to be on the opposite side.  Short version: had a female stalker that tried to kill me twice, but it was what she did when she was NOT violent that left me with pretty severe PTSD. Nothing ever bothered me before, but looking back, I experienced a severe trauma that lasted for close to two years. Medication was recently prescribed for a condition I kept saying I did not have (anxiety) but family talked me into trying it. Now I am trying to recover from the trauma of medication that was vastly unneeded.  And I am left still dealing with still not having anxiety.  ;-} But back to.  Unless you are atypical, you go through sleep cycles of 90 minutes.  If you cannot get at least three contiguous cycles, you need to set an alarm so that you will complete one or two full cycles.  If you have ever been awakened and felt worse than when you went to sleep or felt as though you were in a dream, it was because you were awakened in the midst of a sleep cycle.  If you cannot get even one full cycle and you are sleepy, you might be better off staying awake for a while longer.   Can you power nap?  I can, literally, go to sleep, be dreaming and wake up on my own in three minutes, feeling greatly refreshed.  I did not know I could do that until I was about 30, and then discovered it accidentally.  But if pressed, I can go for 2 or 3 days with no sleep at all, then 5 minutes sleep about every hour will keep me going for anywhere from a couple of days more to as many as five days. Then I crash for 10 to 12 hours.  At least I could do that when I was in my thirties.  Once, in an emergency situation, I worked for almost 60 hours straight operating some dangerous equipment and had no problem staying alert.  Had I ever had any doubts, emergency or not, I would have shut it down and then shut me down for a while. Supposedly you do not \"catch up\" on missed sleep.  Instead, what happens is you go more quickly through the lighter stages of sleep and spend longer in \"REM\" sleep, the deepest stage.  (REM is Rapid Eye Movement.)   Supposedly you cannot dream when you are not in REM stage, so my dreaming and waking up in less than 180 seconds indicates I almost instantly went from awake to REM and back to awake.  But I suspect that the belief you dream only in REM sleep one day will be proven false.  Could visual, auditory or tactile hallucinations be nothing more than dreaming when you are awake? But though it is claimed you do not catch up on sleep, as far as nutritional benefit, does it matter if you dissolve a vitamin tablet in water and drink it, or take it and drink the water later?  To me, getting a higher percent REM sleep is getting the same amount of sleep, just getting it concentrated.  There have been enough studies done that would leave me believing that going even a few months occasionally less sleep would cause no harm, as long as you feel rested and refreshed.  Each person is different, but I think you have nothing to worry about.", 8462, "rxStqficaa", 3],

To those who wrote that their machine does not make a good loaf of bread:  chances are you didn't know that just putting the ingredients into the machine does not guarantee a great loaf of bread.  After all the ingredients are in and the machine starts to mix things, you have to check it a few times and make sure that the dough is not too dry or too wet.  Add a little water or flour at a time until you get a decent dough.  It takes a couple times to get it right.  One other factor is humidity, which can ruin a loaf. Do I love my machines?  Oh, yes!  I have 3.  The oldest one is used now just to make dough that I bake on a heated stone in my oven.  I do own a recipe exchange list for all sorts of bread recipes - machine, food processor, mixer or by hand.  I also teach bread making, and I love to share bread recipes. There is absolutely nothing like the wonderful fragrance of bread baking (except having a warm slice shortly after the bread leaves the oven...) My dream is to one day own a Zorushi, which is supposed to be THE best bread machine on the market. I try to encourage people to not give up on their bread machines, but to hang in there.  You just need to have good ingredients and be willing to work at it a little bit. One of my family's favorite breads is the Carpatho-Rusyn Paska.  I took my late mother-in-law's recipe and adapted it for the machine.

They're on the side of the 1 percent. When the Occupy protests were first starting, they deliberately allowed protesters to cross the Brooklyn bridge, then did a mass arrest of hundreds of people.
