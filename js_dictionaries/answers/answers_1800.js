	95731 : ["I would try to trade McGahee away for a replacement like Portis,Lynch,or Jacobs.  These guys are the guys I think of as similar value.  If you have to start 2 RB's try and get someone who shares carries this week off FA like Chester Taylor, Derrik Ward if they are available.  If not look at injuries.  Miami's RB is out for the year, go for his back up if you can I think his name is Chatman or something like that.  Also Watson of the Bengals has been playing for Rudi Johnson, so if Johnson is out again he would be a good bye week replacement.  As far as the WR situation, that is a bit tougher.  I think Engram and Crayton are like low end #2 high end #3 WR's.  If someone is in the same boat in your league you could try a trade combo with McGahee.  They alone aren't hugely sought after.  Again look at FA here too.  You could pick someone up like Ike HIlliard, or K. Watson, Brandon Stokley.  These guys are all playing fairly well and would make nice replacements for you.  If you had to give up one of the 2 I would let go of Crayton.  Drop another player if you can to get the 2nd wide out replacement.  If none of this works you will have to bite the bullet this week and learn for next year.  If your record is good don't kill yourself over this week.  Just do the best you can.  See what happens.", 9560, "Mf2a8RWLaa", 0],
	95732 : ["Hmmm. Tough spot.  I guess I  would try trading Norwood for a mid-level RB. OR drop him and pick up Jesse Chatman, if he's available in your league (the new Dolphins starter.) He should be better than Norwood this year, at least. The other two you should hold onto for sure.  For your WRs, I'd drop Bobby Engram or try to trade him for a low-level WR. His production will drop soon once the hurt Seattle WRs come back.  So that leaves you ... still needing a RB and a WR?  Try dropping some bench guys, even if they're good, I guess, and picking up guys off waivers. If you can't, I guess start trading your starters.", 9560, "GrUegc64aa", 0],

Who else is on your bench?  Crayton has more upside potential, but Engram is the #1 choice for Hasselbeck (I bet you like his stats the past few weeks!!)  Is your question just for this week, or for the season?  Drop someone else on your bench first with exception of maybe Norwood.  Atlanta just lost another O-line player...", 9560, "aNtleikcaa", 0],

	95745 : ["Deciding between the 4 names you gave, I would without a doubt select Steven Jackson. There are questions with all 4 of those names, no doubt about it. Brady and Jackson are coming off injuries, Manning has lost Harrison and has a new staff coaching him, and Gore has yet to live up to his potential since his dominant rookie season, But I would select Steven Jackson because plain and simple he is a top 5 RB in my opinion behind AP, MJD, Turner and Forte. Why? Well for one, he IS the St. Louis offense and everything is run through him. Getting touches is never a problem. Secondly, he is one of the top average scorers in fantasy football. The problem is, he usually misses 2-3 games a year because he's injury prone. However, if worst case scenario he only plays 14 games, you can guarantee those 14 will be high production games. Also, he gets a lot of receptions. Not as many as the best receiving backs like MJD or Slaton, but in PPR leagues it definitely boosts his value. Gore also is a good PPR RB, but he has a lot of below average games, will play on a team that wants to pass more, and he never reaches the potential of other 1st round picks. Stay away. I just don't think you should select a quarterback. There are so many good QB's this year there are 8-10 guys outside of Brees, Brady and Manning that I'd be more than happy with and confident I can win a championship. Aim for Rivers, Rodgers, Warner, Romo, McNabb, Schaub, Palmer or Cutler in later rounds so you don't have mediocre RB's and WR's and you still get a QB who will put up similar numbers than the top tier guys. A combo of Steven Jackson and Aaron Rodgers sounds a lot better to me than Peyton Manning and Ronnie Brown.", 9559, "JfyaF8jlaa", 1],
	95746 : ["I think if Brady or Manning are their you take them.  There are only about 3 or 4 elite QBS in the entire league the drop off in points scored is huge after Brees, Brady, Manning.  Depending on scoreing the next best QB could score  80 to 100 less on the season thats roughly as much as 7 points a game difference.  With the 8th pick  you will miss out on many of the elite RBs and unless their is run on WR in your draft their are few WR I would take in the first round. So I think it is sound judgement to take a top QB.", 9559, "p8N47wuxaa", 1],
	95747 : ["You can drop Norwood, but I def would not drop LJ or Willis, And if you drop TJ Hous then you would be making a big mistake, Boggy Engram is my least favorite WR or your list, but if Terry Glenn comes back look for Crayton performance to go down.", 9560, "None", 0],
	95748 : ["Here's my positional ratings (I will give the overall team rating at the end of this answer): QB - Matt Schaub is a great QB, and he would improve your team so much more if you also had Andre Johnson for QB-WR connection. You don't have Johnson, but he is sure as heck not required with Matt Schaub. There's no \"package\" here, it'd just be nice to have him. RB - Jackson+Jones-Drew=Great team. I'm assuming these players were picked very early, for a 10 team league, I don't understand how you were able to get these guys and Reggie Wayne. WR - These are 3 1000+ yard WRs, always the thing I look for when I'm drafting in this position. Nice job. TE - I would take Winslow above Cooley and Daniels, look at the 2009 stats: Kellen Winslow: 884 Reception Yards, 5 TDs Chris Cooley: 332 Reception Yards, 2 TDs Owen Daniels: 519 Reception Yards, 5 TDs You see here, not much 2009 competition, and I believe the stats will be similar this year. K - Mason Crosby and Shayne Graham share the kicking for the Ravens, Crosby is a little better. DEF - Steelers possibly the best rushing defense of them all. Bench - Jones will not be starting this year, but he may be taking the goal-line carries, but with the Chiefs, there may not be too many. Lots of RBs I see, you need a different position in here, your starting RBs are already good enough. For TE, I would take Winslow and Daniels, as you could see in the TE statistics above. Here's my rating of your roster: 8/10 for a 10 team league. Good job, change your bench a bit, though! Good Luck!", 9560, "vK9Lhlfkaa", 1],
	95749 : ["You were doing great until you hosed your roster depth with all these wasted TE picks! After the top elite like Clark and Vernon Davis, most are interchangeable, and you would have been better taking better depth picks at WR/RB. In a league this small, there were tons of great WR options in later rounds - guys like Johnny Knox, Golden Tate, Jacoby Jones, etc. On TE, it honestly doesn't matter which one you take. Daniels has the most upside if he stays healthy, but if you don't like the risk, just take Winslow. There are always top scoring TE's who come out of nowhere each season. Last year, it was Celek and Fred Davis. But the main point on TEs is that there are always about 3 elite ones, and then the next 15 have like 25 points separating them over the course of the season. Also with only 3 WRs on your roster, you need to get busy! You're correct that Boldin is toast on the island.", 9560, "Ohcyim3Kaa", 1],
	95750 : ["They're trying to move Larry Hughes, but he has multiple years left on the deal. If the Nets really offered Bobby Simmons, they were stupid not to take it, because he has a shorter deal. I don't think he can be moved. Noah and Thomas will generate slight interest, Thomas more than Noah, but they can't get anything significant back for them. The movable pieces are Gooden and Hinrich and they can definitely get some value for either or both of those guys. They need a big man with post skills badly. The Kings have had their eye on Gooden for a few years now, but with the emergence of Jason Thompson, I don't think they'd trade Brad Miller for Gooden now.", 9561, "UaSFuT59aa", 0],

	95758 : ["Depending on how your point system is set up the TE won't get you nearly as much as an elite WR.  That said ...is Johnson putting up elite fantasy numbers?  Not exactly.  It has been seriously feast or famine with him this year.  But you still have to agree that he has a ton of potential.  Whereas you replace him with Holt...that's a downgrade in my opinion.  You have Favre at starting QB.  And Kitna seems to be the better backup/injury replacement choice then Young.  So really you would have to give up the second piece of your very solid WR attack to gain a lesser back up QB and a TE that even on his best day won't score more points than CJ's okay games.  My vote? No trade.  But if he is willing to give up a very solid RB and Crump or Holt...now we're talking.", 9564, "54uO1wLCaa", 0],
	95759 : ["I think this is a pretty good trade for you, you aren't going to take a huge hit at WR since Holt is playing pretty well and will play better with Stephen Jackson getting back into the mix.  You would upgrade at TE and QB but I don't see it being a huge upgrade at QB.  If I were you I would wait until after this week that way you miss Holt's bye week and get to use Chad instead.

	95760 : ["I really like Aaron Rodgers this year,and I don't think there will be a large drop off to him from Brees,Peyton,and Brady.Rodgers will have MORE freedom to throw the deep bombs this year; so that also boosts G.Jennings value..But with the 1st pick I'd take L.FItzgerald (DUH), Randy Moss (He's CATCHING Brady's passes,after all.),Andre Johnson,and my RB pick would be Chris Johnson; the FASTEST RB (period).CJ will see see his touches/passes drastically increase this year;he will even lineup at WR at times,when Lendale White is in at RB. Bottom line: Take a top tier WR,or RB; then target Aaron Rodgers later. ~g0()d LuCk!~ BTW-How many teams are in your league?

	95777 : ["I remember this trade from a few days ago, and I'd say any trade that nets you Foster in a 14 team league is probably a good one. But...here is your problem.  If you're gunning for the playoffs, you need to think ahead. And the biggest issue is lack of balance.  You can't plug MJD into a flex spot for the rest of the season.  There will be matchup problems and also nobody knows when he'll start and how he'll look.  Best case scenario is week 12.    The reason I'm saying all this is you need to leverage your strength there, and it may even mean a downgrade of AP to someone else who is startable.  But start with MJD.  You're correct that in a league this size there will be teams desperate at RB.  So start there.  Bowe is a decent (not great) WR1 in a league this size, but there's all sorts of risk.  That team and its HC is circling the drain, and there's no telling what they'll do in the last few games.  They could drag out Stanzi for a trial run. So you want to focus on WRs who are on teams that will be in it to win it til the bitter end.  There's no team right now running away with its division, which helps.  Here's the stats on receptions (it includes TEs, so you'd ignore those):   Find a team that needs a startable RB and go from there.  Try a 1-1 trade, which is very fair.  But if that doesn't work, you may need to do a combo deal where you give up AP and end up with someone like Bradshaw, but you also would want an elite WR as part of this.  Obviously, don't do any trade where you get Antonio Brown or whatever.  You'd want Jones or Cruz in return.  Also, be careful about overvaluing Mike Williams.  They've had a couple of dream matchups, especially Oakland last week.   They have a somewhat tougher matchup this week, and this will be a trend as they go on.  This is still a run=-based offense. The other lesser trade you might want to think about is getting Ben Tate.
