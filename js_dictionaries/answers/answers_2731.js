	142396 : ["Do you know if the church has a website? So many things vary from parish to parish, so if they have a website you should take a look and see if it'll answer some of your questions. Normally they'll have a section telling you what to expect... one thing that's for sure is that it'll be beautiful :)  If not, here's a really good website that's really helpful.  Here's another one, it's not Orthodox (it's byzantine-rite Catholic) but the liturgy of the 2 are pretty much similar:  Just remember like the person above said, you can't receive communion if you aren't Orthodox... but you can take the antidoron offered  .  ^ here's the text to the liturgy (in english) ... If you don't understand a lot of Russian, does the church offer an English liturgy? I'm not sure if they will have a prayer book with translations, but personally,  I think it'll be easier to follow along and just observe what others are doing. :)  Of course it's good to read the text before hand.  They will probably notice that you are a newcomer, and I'm sure you'll be welcomed and won't mind if you're not always sure what to do or what is going on.  To answer the rest of your questions:  It will probably last up to around 2 hours, unless it's a special feast day.  As for standing, it really depends on the parish again. Most likely you'll be standing most of the time on a Sunday. Some churches have pews, others don't. And some churches with pews don't really use them. They will generally have some sort of seating for people who are unable to stand for a long period of time. So if you find that you're having difficulty standing you can sit.    Not all churches require a skirt and head covering...  actually most in North America at least, don't *require* it  I'm assuming that the church you'll be attending does since you mentioned it, and I have seen churches that required wearing skirts, and head coverings (and no lipstick!).   You don't need to cover all of your hair though. The most typical type of head covering looks like this though: ", 11536, "qcCy3MOZaa", 0],

That sentence does NOT contain all the informationyou need, that is, it doesn't have height.  The NMEA sentence you should use is GGA. You can use the RMC sentence but you'll have to make an assumption of height.  That can affect your conversion to XYZ.

Using GPS technology and electronic map technology combined together in an electronic device, a Satellite Navigation system can be used to navigate your way from point A to point B by providing a set of directions, often using the simplest route So based upon your question, what you are really after is a Satellite Navigation device.

That passage is for Timothy, a preacher, to use to determine who to select as overseer, not as a preacher. The overseer needs to be able to teach, that is, able to pass on instruction, but not necessarily be a weekly preacher.  I believe the verse's emphasis is \"one wife\" as opposed to several wives, as several posters pointed out. Preaching depends on gift, not on marriage: 1 Cor. 12:28. There is no reason why women cannot be preachers--they just are not allowed to assume leadership over men in a church setting. Many women are gifted speakers/preachers.

Preacher is a term that has had the meaning changed drastically since Paul wrote the admonitions. Today we use the term to describe a pastor or similar position in our modern day. Wasn't it Agabus in Acts that had 7 daughters that were prophetesses? We need the Word of God preached. The gospel of the Kingdom is what its all about. Whether women or men preach it matters not to me- as long as it is powerful, given in purity, and in truth. In Matt ch 5 ( the beatitude's)  those encouraged by Jesus to live as real disciples were not excluded because they may be female. A preacher in John the baptists day and our day are 2 different things. I say let the women preach. Have you heard Beth Moore or Joyce Meyer? Can you say they are not ordained by God?
