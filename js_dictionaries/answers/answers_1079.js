	59437 : ["In his book \"The Jesus Puzzle\", Earl Doherty demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jesus Christ is a fictional character. No such person ever existed. The notion may be shocking to the general populace, but it is not a new idea, and has been endorsed by a minority of scholars for over a century. The best evidence comes from the Christian writers themselves. The New Testament epistles and most of the non-canonical literature until the mid-2nd century show a resounding silence on the earthly life of Jesus. No teachings or miracles. No references to Mary, Joseph, the disciples or the holy places, such as Bethlehem, Nazareth and Calvary. No trial or details of the passion story. And so on. Scholars try their best to explain this phenomenon, but this degree of silence from so many writers over so many years has one and only one adequate explanation: the writers ignore Jesus's life on earth because they don't KNOW of a life on earth. Jesus Christ started out as an entirely divine being, just like all the other gods in all the other religions of the day. The idea that he lived a full, human life was a later development in Christian mythology which gradually caught on, proved to be popular and eventually became standard orthodox belief. Another problem with the traditional view of Christian origins is the wide diversity of expressions shown in the early Christian record. These are unlikely to have stemmed from the life of a highly-revered human founder. \"Rather, Christianity was born in a thousand places, in a host of different forms, growing out of the broad, fertile religious soil of the time.\" (Page 139). Doherty considers (and refutes) the various attempts people make to prove a historical Jesus, including the infamous forgery in the writings of historian Josephus and the handful of vaguely-phrased epistle passages which, on the surface, have a \"human\" sound to them, but in fact can apply equally to divine beings. The author has a website, and I have put him to the test by discussing his work on the Web with people who are far more knowledgeable on the subject than I. Most disagree with Doherty's views (sometimes throwing tantrums in the process!), but when they try to present a convincing argument to the contrary, they can't do it. They don't even come close. At best, they will nail him on an insignificant technicality. Too often people read the epistles with gospel-tinted glasses. The Great Silence is carefully examined, but the book offers much more. There is a lot of general education material which is great for the average reader. We get an introduction to the philosophies of the time, such as Platonism and Cynicism. Doherty closely examines the lost document of Q and considers the similarities between Jesus and the competing savior gods, such as Attis, Osiris, Dionysos and Mithras. He describes the universe as perceived in those days and the spiritual realm where Jesus and the other gods operate. And we are treated to several passages which managed to escape Christian censorship and show without question that the authors do not have in mind a human Jesus executed under Pilate. Doherty is a fine writer, is very well-read and does not depend on sources of dubious reliability. Now, there IS one significant hurdle which the author may never overcome. It's not deficient arguments, but rather human nature. For scholars to admit that Doherty is right means to admit they've been under a monumental misconception for their entire careers. Time will tell whether they have the courage and dignity to do this. Read, learn and spread the Good News to your friends! If justice is served, this book will change the world.", 8043, "5b84f3f83c8db8327232437b61765a8daa", 2],

	59442 : ["The only real measure of how to tell a good religion from a bad religion is by the number of people it's followers have slaughter in the name of beliefs of that religion. Please don't get me wrong. All religions are usually very well intended. Be nice to others. Don't do anything mean. Peace, love, blah, blah blah... They mostly all have similar messages. But those sentiments are usually reserved ONLY for those who follow the exact same beliefs. Heaven forbid someone should have a different viewpoint or belief. In instances where differing beliefs confront one another - especially when there are mitigating political circumstances like desire for land, resources or access to marriage - bad things inevitably tend to happen.  When such political situations arise, religion is often employed by those in the political power as a tool to fire up the troops. \"They (meaning whoever owns the land, or rights to the resources) are trying to take away your right to believe what you want to believe! They are trying to end our way of life! Get 'em!\" And the atrocities ensue. As I said, all religions are mostly well intentioned. It really isn't the fault of the religion, per say, when these atrocities occur. It is the responsibility of those who manipulate the religion, whichever title they choose to label themselves with. But, it usually isn't those leaders swinging the sword, or pulling the trigger. So, at times it is very difficult to differentiate the followers from the faith. So, I guess the answer to your question is this: The good or bad of your religion can be judged by how easily it can be manipulated by others to do bad things. No religion is without it's dark little secrets (with the possible exception of Buddhism*).", 8052, "QVKWVValaa", 1],

	59448 : ["Every religion today most likely has some aspect of an ancient belief in its philosophy or practice, but to say that one particular religion is the oldest is naive. The reality is-- we do not know. We have no basis for comparison. Most reference books list Hinduism as the oldest world religion. This is probably because Hinduism has the oldest recorded roots, which lie in Dravidianism. Dravidianism is estimated to have been practiced around 6,000 to 3,000 BCE and as such predates the Sumerian, Egyptian, and Babylonian cultures.  Final thought: If one really thinks about it; isn't agnosticism the oldest spiritual structure?

	59449 : ["It's generally considered to be Hinduism. Edit:  I should expand on that! Basically, we have historical evidence for elements of Hinduism being practised at least in 2600 BCE.  The oldest surviving text is dated to at least 1100 BCE.  This is older than Judaism, and thus older than Christianity and Islam too.  Other Eastern religions are also more recent in origin.  We know of no other organised religion that is still practised and is definitely older than Hinduism. Now, it's certainly extremely likely that some belief systems practised today go back further than Hinduism, but they lack the kind of written history that Hinduism has, so dating them is harder.  In any case, Hinduism  is certainly the oldest major world religion. Oh, and for those of you who suggested Christianity: We KNOW it's not Christianity! Anyone with the slightest sense of history is aware that Judaism is older!!", 8044, "e77321da1ccb8c6435c70fd1482cd10faa", 2],

People wake up from dreams and are physically shaken...traumatized, scared, sweating, they scream in dreams, etc. Daniel had dreams that were so overwhelming that it made him sick: Daniel 8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it. The spiritual dimension is real, and all around us. Your soul / spirit sees and lives in that spiritual dimension, and when you dream it is often your soul / spirit that seems things. Your five senses are magnified many times over in the spirit. For example, in the natural dimension you can have poor vision, but in the Spirit you can see with 10x more clarity than normal. That is makes heaven and hell so much more powerful. The joys of heaven are many times more pure and joyful that anything you can experience here on earth. On the other side, the terrors of hell are also experienced 100x more clear and vividly. There are demons scratching, biting and even raping women there. They use evil tools to torment them. Your brain cannot imagine what they see and feel. But if you go to YouTube watch the videos of Mario Martinez, Mary Baxter and Bill Wiese it will give you an idea. They explain how much vivid and real everything looks like and feels like. With all this being said, I am praying and hoping that you will repent of your sins and ask Jesus to wash you clean. That is the only way to avoid going to that place. He loves you very much, and he wants a very close and personal relationship with you. Seek him. I have seen blog posts from women that He has taken to heaven and back, like Tara Dulin, and like you said, the wonders of heaven are so vivid, pure, awesome beyond belief. She explains that. Whatever you do, never ever cross the bridge to eternity without Jesus Christ.
