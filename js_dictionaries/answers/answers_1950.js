If you were not, then I hope you will realize what a serious situation this is and NOT one that you should conjure up. According to your above two questions, less than 24 hours before you posted about the rape (this question I am replying to as well as in another category:    ) you were making out in his room and his parents got home before anything could happen.  If you were that scared, why would you have put yourself in that situation again less than a day later?  And, in those two questions you said your parents did not know about him (but here you say they know but do not like him). And of course, four days ago you were posting about telling a friend you like him (no mention of a boyfriend of a year at all).   I highly suggest you take up a hobby.
