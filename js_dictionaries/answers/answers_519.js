	28953 : ["No, I don't think so. Most trainers/owners want their horse to go just fast enough to win, to reduce the risk of injury and to save him for future races.  In the Belmont, Secretariat's owner said \"let him run.\"   He responded with a THIRTY ONE length victory and a world record time of 2:24.00.  That's a full 2 seconds over the next fastest, Easy Goer with 2:26.  It's also the fastest time for any 1.5 mile race on any track in the US. His Derby and Preakness records are about a half second faster than the competition, IIRC. Sure, it'll probably happen someday...  but I doubt I'll live to see it!  Once they move to artificial surfaces, anything might happen.", 4489, "nIskOkn2aa", 2],
	28954 : ["Easy.  MLB never signed off on releasing players for an Olympic tournament.  Any sports being added have buy-in from leagues/national federations on releasing players.  Rugby sevens got buy-in from World Rugby and they created a 'window' for participation (and not scheduling any event opposite an Olympic tournament).  Golf got the professional tours (PGA Tour, European Tour, LPGA Tour, Ladies European Tour) to work with the International Golf Federation and create a window.  In both cases, both sports agreed to send their best players (yes- several potential participants in the golf event backed out over Zika virus concerns). Then there's MLB who never signed off on shutting down over the Olympics (the NHL shut down in 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014; they didn't shut down in 2018 but will shut down in 2022 and 2026) or sending players over for an Olympic tournament (scraping a bunch of minor-leaguers isn't close to enough).  The IOC wants a 'best on best' event, and until baseball agrees to this, it's not going to happen.  ", 4498, "Pc0QjrQ4aa", 0],
	28955 : ["Yes, because breakdancing is done throughout the world, while baseball is only an American sport, though it is also played somewhat in Canada, albeit Canada only has one major league team-- the Toronto Blue Jays.  People in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America don't play baseball, most haven't even heard of baseball. If they have, it's only because of seeing it depicted in American movies. Baseball is as totally foreign and as unknown to the rest of the world as cricket is in the United States.  Breakdancing, though, is done pretty much everywhere and there are already worldwide leagues and international competitions in breakdancing where countries from around the world send teams who have won national championships to compete. I mean, haven't you ever wondered why the only teams that ever play in the World Series are American?", 4498, "None", 0],

What is more, Japan has no available hospital beds for corona patients any more. Not for Japanese citizens. Not to mention beds for foreigners. Day by day, increasing number of Japanese are left untreated at home. They say Japanese government is covering the actual number of corona infected Japanese by stopping to track close contacts since the middle of January. They simply gave up, so that people without corona symptoms don't take corona tests. This helps decrease the total number of corona infected Japanese. In japan, there are only 2 to 3 percent of hospitals currently struggling with corona. All the other hospitals are private hospitals, and the government cannot force them to treat corona patients. They are protected by the law.", 4499, "None", 0],
	28969 : ["Babylon on seven hills = Moscow. Whore of Babylon = Church that worked for Commies (Sergian heresy). Orthodoxy = the only true faith. 70 million were murdered.

Modern documents are from Satan; burn them. To escape mark of the beast, hide within a small group (10-15 people); no documents; no electronics so that you won't be tracked.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 4508, "None", 0],
