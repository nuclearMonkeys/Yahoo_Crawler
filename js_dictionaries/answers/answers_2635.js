	137577 : ["There's a reason the fans chant \"best in the world\" wherever Danielson wrestles.  Danielson is this close to surpassing Chris Benoit and the Dynamite Kid on my list of greatest all-around in-ring performers of all-time.  IF Danielson has ANY weaknesses, it would be his relatively small size.  But that is pretty well mitigated by the fact that he mostly wrestles guys near his size (and not those 275-300 pound monsters in the WWE).  Danielson doesn't fist-fight his opponents; he doesn't need to.  Those \"educated\" feet of his more than make up for it.  I \"ding\" Kurt Angle for his terrible brawling skills (he almost always gets out-brawled by everybody), but Danielson's kicks, elbows, and forearm strikes can equal any brawler's punching and kicking.  If there is a \"flaw\" in Danielson's \"act\" it's that he is a wrestler, not a \"character\".  How that will go over in the WWE, I don't know.  The WWE fans love their \"characters\" and may not take to Danielson if all he does is \"wrestle\", best in the world or not. Once Danielson arrives in the WWE and is officially not an \"indy\" wrestler anymore, Richards might very well take the top spot as the best indy wrestler in the world.  Richards is the next, uh, incarnation, of what was started by the Dynamite Kid, then Chris Benoit: a tough as nails technical marvel who could fly, brawl, and was fearless enough to risk his own body to hit a particular dangerous move that would hurt his opponent.  Richards is fantastic but he still has a little way to go to surpass Danielson (especially in the submission department; Danielson seems to have no end to the number of submission moves he uses).  Neither of them are particularly interesting on the mic, but Danielson is a little better at promos. Danielson will probably have the better career when all is said and done.  If his WWE career doesn't work out, he can go right back to the indys and reclaim his number one spot as the \"best in the world\", main eventing all over the world.  He is a legend without having been in WCW, WWE, or TNA.  Richards doesn't have the charisma Danielson has.  Everybody is impressed with his talent and skills, but Danielson is the more likable man. Bryan Danielson is my second favorite wrestler in all of wrestling (after AJ Styles).  I'm becoming more impressed with Richards each time I see him but he's not in my top ten (yet). NWQ:  Rudolf.  I'm a sucker for, uh, red noses.", 11358, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 5],
	137578 : ["It's kinda tough comparing Davey Richards to Bryan Danielson. Because Danielson for a number of years has hardly ever failed to deliver in any match he's been in. Even though he's had pretty proficient competition in the ring for the most part i think Danielson brings out the best in his opponents with his competitiveness and work ethic which is why he has so many great matches against several different opponents and he has been doing it consistently for years now and with Danielson leaving the independent scene and people proclaiming that Davey is the guy that will take Danielson's spot as the new best wrestler in the world then he certainly has some big shoes to fill.  But everything i praised Danielson for being i think Davey Richards has those same qualities and he's been proving to people for the past year how good he is with all the MOTYC's he's been in not just tag action with the American Wolves but he's been performing tremendously in singles matches against the likes of KENTA, Shingo, Kenny Omega, Austin Aries, and even the American Dragon himself Bryan Danielson. And with Davey only being 26 i can only see him getting better as time goes along. Before Danielson left ROH he said on several occasions that he felt that Davey Richards had surpassed him as a wrestler and Danielson himself was the guy that proclaimied Davey Richards was the best wrestler in the world. Davey Richards right now i believe is a better wrestler than Bryan Danielson(including mic skills) his promos have been great and straight to the point as of late but time will only determine if Davey Richards is worthy of being called a better wrestler than Bryan Danielson compared to him in his prime.  It's hard to say who will have the better career. Danielson is the man credited for putting the highly acclaimied Ring of Honor promotion on the map and Danielson's name is not only well known in the American independent scene but he also has established quite a name in Europe, Mexico, and most notably in Japan where he was the first American wrestler to win the prestigious GHC Jr. Heavyweight Championship. Davey Richards has a bit of a name in Japan as well because of his several tours with NOAH and Dragon Gate and he is starting to get a number of big matches against top Japanese stars (soon to be facing Jushin Liger) he is also going to be co-owner of the upcoming EVOLVE promotion that has the potential to be just as big or even bigger than ROH with him and the man that was behind ROH's best years Gabe Saplosky running things and with all of the talent exchanges ROH, Dragon Gate, and EVOLVE all promotions that Richards works for has going with a number of overseas promotions eventually it will lead to more international dates for Richards because he's a big name on the independent scene and he will have a chance to match or even surpass Danielson's name on the international circuit. Time will only determine who has the better career when it is all said and done. Danielson and Richards are 2 of my favorite wrestlers in the sport today but i've always been more appealed to Davey's style although both are similar in the ring Davey's has always seemed more exciting to me.

	137581 : ["I think WWE will air these vignettes for a few more months, before Awesome Kong actually does make her long awaited WWE debut.Awesome Kong will have a feud with all of the WWE Divas, starting, by Eve being found unconscious in the divas locker room.Awesome Kong will later in that same night defeat Gail Kim to become the new Divas Champion, putting Awesome Kong on a reign of terror for the next six months, with her defending the Divas Championship and defeating Gail Kim, Melina, & Eve.If you ask me, aside from Beth Phoenix, these could be Awesome Kong's best WWE feuds that she could possibly have, and they don't need Awesome Kong to feud with every diva in a short time span, since that would make them run out of possible Awesome Kong storylines very quicker.", 11359, "LY7vI8bnaa", 1],

If she comes to WWE, then Beth Phoenix will no longer be the single most dominant female in the WWE. Awesome Kong brings, Wrestling Moves, Wrestling Holds, Kicks and Strikes to the WWE that no other Man or Woman does. Awesome Kong will be the most powerful force that Beth Phoenix has ever faced. Everyone else pales in comparison. As much as I like Beth Phoenix, I'm going to have to go with Awesome Kong on this one.
