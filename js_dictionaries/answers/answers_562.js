Toll-free help lines work 24/7 regardless whether this is a holiday or not. Systemic racism, from all sides. There are parts of the country that look like they have seceded in that respect.

I wouldn't necessarily say it's a fun place, although you can have fun skiing and snowboarding etc. if that's your thing, but yes it is a beautiful and picturesque place with a good infrastructure. Those photos you see online? They are the real deal. Being a landlocked country, you can also combine it with visits to France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, or Germany, depending on which area of Switzerland you're visiting.
