	58489 : ["For about the same price, Nvidia is a little faster and uses a little less fuel. Nvidia is the winner. Nvidia wins in the majority of categories across a wide variety of titles. AMD can compete with the RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT, but it can't compete with the 2070 Super or higher, and it's essentially equal to the old GTX 1080 Tic.", 8110, "dpR8aG5Caa", -1],
	58490 : ["No real crashing issues with either driver set that I have ever found. I'm currently using AMD, previously had Nvidia. Right now, there is a lot of talk that the AMD drivers put 20-30% less load on the CPU. Hardly makes a difference if you have a relatively high-end CPU with 8 or more cores, but anything less than that seems to suffer worse when paired with an Nvidia GPU. Apparently it's due to the fact that AMD are now using hardware scheduling on their GPU's, while Nvidia is still using just software scheduling. For those reasons, you might want to go with AMD right now. But in the greater scheme of things, you can't buy anybody's GPU's right now anyways, as they are all sold out. So unless you have an existing GPU, you really have no choice what you can run right now.", 8110, "bz34wCGSaa", 1],
	58491 : ["do you mean hardware as in something external that you plug in, or an internal part, like RAM? and if the former, does a USB flash drive count, because technically, that is hardware, and although there are \"autodrivers\" to accomodate that now, back when i had Windows 98, 1st Edition, it did not come with them built-in, and i had to find a website that had them (this was before Google existed, too). if you were referring to the latter option, inside the PC, i didn't take that on till i was 19, and owned my own PC, which i bought used from the neighbors, with the paycheck from my first job. after playing around on the computer for a day or so, i had the whole PC torn down to it's tiniest part, before subsequently reassembling it fully. i had never done this before (nor had i any formal training on it), but it started up again after! if that doesn't count, then probably it would be the following year when i built my own PC.", 8125, "ydVOV3iFaa", 0],

My question may be moot because I just learned that the power supply (250w) cant handle bigger cards.  If this is untrue, feel free to correct me.

	58498 : ["Keep the volume on your receiver at least 5-6dB below its max setting. The volume adjustment on most receivers goes from -80dB (mute) to about +16dB (max).

	58502 : ["No. You've got that backwards. \"Karens\" have a CONSERVATIVE entitlement problem, *always* aimed at service workers and/or minorities. It's class contempt that \"Karens\" are displaying, they're the alleged \"middle class\" being snooty to a worker they see as below them (in actuality, they're not \"middle class,\" they're labor aristocracy, just workers themselves, but they have a little money and a  BIG attitude problem).  And they often display racism too. ", 8104, "Wx1uiKBFaa", -4],

	58505 : ["\"Are women with a liberal entitlement attitude referred to as Karens in the U.S.?\" The Karen phenomenon is just the advancement of critical theory/cultural Marxism with its divide and conquer method, to its natural conclusion.  It's White women's turn to be denigrated now according to the Left's critical theory and identity politics. There can be no \"Shaniquas\", the Black equivalent to a Karen, because of course, 'that's racist'. But Karen is White, and the Left ... including feminism... all agree with each other that White people cannot be victims of racism. <lol> So there you go Karen. Your years of being a useful idiot for feminism by denigrating your own White men, are now over. Time to discard you so that the movement can go forward with the ever changing ideology that it's run by. Women's advocacy? No! That's old school feminism. Cultural Marxism? Yes!

I have access to a color printer/copier at work - but usually when I need color prints, I go to Walgreens or Staples where they have a multi-thousands of dollars worth of color printers and scanners (their websites allow you to upload your jobs, then go pick them up).
