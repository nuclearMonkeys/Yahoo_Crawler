I started getting allergy shots to try and build up immunity to what I was allergic to- I really did not see any health benefits from this process although others may have  found great success.  It is my understanding that all allergies start as internal allergies i.e. food and then manifest to external allergies.  Getting your food allergies under control could possibly eliminate your allergies all together.  I know that it is difficult because it is likely your are consuming everything you are allergic too.  I went through the same process and eliminated about 40 foods which meant changing my entire diet and my allergies disappeared completely and let me tell you they were awful I mean just awful!  One thing I did learn is that through food combination I could add some of my favorites back in my diet but I could not consume them individually so it was a learning process but well worth the journey.", 9973, "AA10386317", 0],

I was having major allergy attacks every month and could not figure it out. Turns out it was the tree outside my 2nd story apartment window and I slept with the window open and my head at the window end. And the winds would kick up about once a month. I kept the windows closed, air conditioner on and filtered the air til I could move to another place. Been allergy free since then.", 9973, "877a06d84789033de3d215d7ccbcb99aaa", 0],

	106862 : ["If you are looking for a \"practical\" degree that you can use to get a job immediately after college, then no, you cannot practice psychology with a B.A. or B.S., like you could, for instance, a B.S. in Nursing.  However, a bachelor's in psychology is applicable to a wide variety of fields, such as business, human resources, sports, child development, criminal justice, pretty much any field that involves people and analyzing how they think.   If you want to be a psychologist, then you will need an M.A. or doctorate (Psy.D. or Ph.D.).  However, the purpose of college is to find out what you are interested in - if that is what you want to explore, then follow your heart, and the rest will follow.  College is too early to start thinking about ONLY what is practical, and not what you are REALLY passionate about.  You'll be working for a long time - it might as well be at a job that you love. Update: I would also like to address the poster above that said that the trend in the field is towards cost-effective treatment, which means more drugs and less therapy.  This trend has been brought on by the insurance companies and the government, who have cut funding for mental health care, NOT psychologists.  Depending on the condition, most psycholoigsts would LOVE to offer more therapy and, when appropriate, medication (although strictly speaking, meds are prescribed by psychiatrists, not psychologists).  The problem is helping people PAY for the therapy that they need.", 9970, "140bcbccfcaf04885a0bfdff1d1991c7aa", 3],

	106877 : ["I am appalled by the statements that you have been receiving - as I am a psychology major. In my opinion, it is a waste of time to major in something that you truly have no interest in - in order to sellout. So, if you have a genuine interest in psychology, then you should definitely go for it. It's more admiriable than following the crowd. Psychology is not always an easy major. Actually, when I tell people my major, I have heard alot of people say, \"That's a hard major isn't it?\" And while it was never real hard for me, the upper level classes do get challenging. It is alot of reading. And some people just plain old hate reading. It is true that you will probably need to go on to get a masters or doctorate with psychology, but if it's your passion you truly won't mind it. Ignore what those people have been telling you. They are either jealous or bitter or ignorant about what psychology truly entails. And I just wanted to add, there are a number of majors that do require you to pursue more schooling even after college. As the job market is becoming more competitive.", 9970, "myG2hhaKaa", 2],

If you are truly interested in psychology then by all means keep studying....  the field is wide open! Plus, by enrolling in advanced classes you might discover aspects of psychology  that you never knew about or even considered.    You don't necessarily have to go into counseling to help people-- psychologists contribute to human advancement  and also help find solutions to problems in many different areas. I found that by completing university-level psychology classes  it served to pique my interest, and I plan to keep studying.  Go on and enroll  and get as many types of psychology classes that you can.   Investigate health psychology, educational psychology,  forensic psychology, organizational psychology-- look into the various areas and see  how psychologists help people in other ways than just counseling. It is not a waste of time  and I'd suggest you follow your dream,  and shut out the people who are trying to burst your bubble.
