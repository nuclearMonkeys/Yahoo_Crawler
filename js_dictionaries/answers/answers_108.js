	5444 : ["If the couple think they are in love, then they *are* in love. They have genuine feelings about each other. The man slowly realizes that he is sexually attracted to other men, or to one particular man. He would be upset at himself. I think he would tell himself, \"Real men don't love other men.\" He would fight his feelings of desire. He loves his wifeÂ  He would not hurt her.Â  But the attraction is too strong and he succumbs to it. Maybe he thinks that he could get it out of his system. Then he feels guilty for cheating. (These are my thoughts. Your character may think differently.)Â  Meanwhile, his wife's intuition tells her something is going wrong. Her husband is growing distant and edgy perhaps, as he works out his feelings of sexual confusion and guilt. Perhaps she confronts him. Perhaps she tries harder to be a \"good wife\". She gets edgy too. In my version of the story, they still love each other. They don't want their marriage to fail. Maybe they keep pretending to each other that everything is all right or will be so. Maybe they seek marriage counseling. Maybe he confesses his trysts with the other man and she is appalled and affronted. It does depend on her background and his (and mine too) how they take this gay relationship exploding their marriage. It would be a long, hard journey to divorce and what follows - and I have not yet thought about the second man. One memoir you might like to read about what happened after a woman's husband left her for a gay man and her marriage fell apart is \"Mennonite in a Little Black Dress\" by Rhoda Janzen. I read MsÂ  JanzenÂ  Â when it became a must read and my co-workers quizzed me about being Mennonite. Rhoda is my generation and though we don't know each other, our upbringings are similar.Â  I tried to find another book, but all I could find were about gay marriages, not about what happens to a straight marriage when one partner goes gay.Â ", 924, "AA11768465", 3],
