	85486 : ["Wikipedia clearly states BP plc are a MULTI-national company with UK holding 40% shares and US holding 39%.  \"In 2001 the company formally renamed itself as BP plc and adopted the tagline \"Beyond Petroleum,\" which remains in use today. It states that BP was never meant to be an abbreviation of its tagline. \" The rig itself was staffed by Americans and had a dodgy history.  There had been numerous previous spills and fires on the Deepwater Horizon; the Coast Guard had issued pollution citations 18 times between 2000 and 2010, and had investigated 16 fires and other incidents. The previous fires, spills, and incidents were not considered unusual for a Gulf platform and have not been connected to the April, 2010 explosion and spill. The Deepwater Horizon did, however, have other serious incidents, including one in 2008 in which 77 people were evacuated from the platform when it listed and began to sink after a section of pipe was accidentally removed from the platform's ballast system. This rig was staffed by US citizens.    The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is an agency of the United States Department of the Interior that manages the nation's natural gas, oil and other mineral resources on the outer continental shelf.   MMS is responsible for inspection and oversight of energy companies to ensure they are following the law and protecting the safety of their workers and the environment. BUT - Under the guidance of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the OEMM, a sub division of the MMS, ALSO manages energy and mineral development in over 1.71 billion offshore acres of Federal land called the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and annually disburses to the U.S. Treasury an average of $13 billion in minerals revenue. ****According to Darrell Issa, the top Republican on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, there may be a conflict of interest for the Minerals Management Service to collect revenue and also oversee safety.****   That, I think, says it all, profits before safety! Among MMS's regulatory decisions contributing to the 2010 BP oil spill: MMS's 2009 decision that acoustically-controlled shut-off valve (BOP) would NOT be required as a last resort against underwater spills at the site. MMS's FAILURE to suggest other “fail-safe” mechanisms after a 2004 report raised questions about the reliability of the electrical remote-control devices. MMS granted a categorical exclusion waiver on April 6, 2009 to BP exempting it from National Environmental Policy Act's requirements including a detailed environmental analysis, concluding the spill risk in that part of the Gulf was “minimal or nonexistent.” Such NEPA waivers have become ROUTINE at MMS, and the Interior department approves 250 to 400 per year for Gulf of Mexico projects. MMS gave permission to BP and dozens of other oil companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico without first getting required permits from another agency (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA) that assesses threats to endangered species — and despite strong warnings from NOAA about the impact the drilling was likely to have on the gulf. Those approvals, federal records show, include one for the well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon rig, which exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers and resulting in thousands of barrels of oil spilling into the gulf each day. MMS routinely OVERRULED its staff biologists and engineers who raised concerns about the safety and the environmental impact of drilling proposals in the Gulf and in Alaska. Since 20 April 2010, when an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers, 27 NEW offshore drilling projects have been approved by MMS. All but one project was granted similar exemptions from environmental review as BP. Two were submitted by BP, and made the same claims about oil-rig safety and the implausibility of a spill damaging the environment. But one of the scariest quotes read so far has to be  \"According to an unnamed witness, Deepwater Horizon installation manager Jimmy Harrell, an employee of Transocean, was speaking to someone in Houston, Texas when the fire started, and was heard screaming, \"Are you f*****g happy? Are you f*****g happy? The rig's on fire! I told you this was gonna happen.\" All this goes to prove that the MMS (a US government body), the rig which was owned by US company Transocean and staffed by US employees were mainly to blame for the explosion.    It smacks of one massive cover up by Obama who is desperately trying to shift the blame but with the facts out there he is not fooling anyone, just making himself look like the fool he obviously is.", 9193, "u8mQbzc1aa", 4],
