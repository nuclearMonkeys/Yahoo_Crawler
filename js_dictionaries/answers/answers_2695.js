This has me worried because I really need the money to pay some medical bills. (Not exactly the most desirable things to spend a tax refund on, but it is what it is.) Knowing that I'm not alone here has given me some solace, but I'm still a bit concerned. What's also weird is that some sites are saying that the 9001 code has to do with entering a secondary Taxpayer ID/SSN, but this doesn't apply to me because I filed single and only have one!

After talking to IRS yesterday they told me basically the same of what I can see above: things are being delayed about 1 week, so we should be getting refund by 2/21. But she also said this could be sooner.  This has nothing to do with something wrong in the returns, she said my return was not even processed yet. I guess it is really just a delay due to huge number of returns eFiled, and they use the 9001 code to indicate that those returns are a bit late.  I read that IRS has upgraded the systems to try to detect identify theft frauds, so I'm wondering if this delay may be a system issue and not only due to the number of returns. Anyway, it looks we should get our refunds pretty soon, hopefully not later than 1 week from the expected date.  If someone has new news, pls post here. Thanks !", 11476, "CfHSJfeTaa", 0],
