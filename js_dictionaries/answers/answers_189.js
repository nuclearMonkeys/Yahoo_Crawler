Socialism does not mean that governmet owns everything.  Socialism does not mean dictatorship or totalitarianism either. If we do not share expenses, nothing gets built. The Golden Gate Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, Interstate highways, and airports for example cannot be build without socialism. The US cannot go to Mars or the Moon without socialism because no capitalist is going to waste money going to the moon, since it does not make them any money.  There is nothing in capitalism that forbids social security, medicare, welfare or universal health care.  Fascists do not like these things, but fascism is not capitalism. Fascism is simply the desire to make the rich richer even if it hurts the poor. Capitalism does not look down on the poor nor does it require capitalists to oppress the poor. Fascists do that. Many Republicans are fascists, and they mistakenly think that they are capitalists.", 1523, "None", -1],
