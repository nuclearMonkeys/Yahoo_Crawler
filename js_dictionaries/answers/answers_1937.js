But, if you're not experienced in any of that, then you're an excellent candidate for starting while you're young.  All you need is a good instructor and patience. It's not a trip it's a journey. I currently take Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Boxing, and Wrestling so that I can become a more complete fighter (standing & ground). We have a 15 year old kid at our gym that is very talented and always wins 1st place in tournaments in his division. Just think - at 22 he could be a black belt!  Don't worry about the experience or lack thereof: the fun in getting beat up by guys that are better than you, yet there to help you get better.

I know the first answer is to report it to your parents but that seems not a good idea to you. **** happens and this thing really is bothersome for it is rape. But you are a man so take it like a man. This did not make you a ******. If it is of any consolation, gay men do it all the time to each other but they do not die from it. The real faggots are the ones who violated you. So think it this way, you are a very attractive guy who got violated by gay people. It might as well had been a woman forcing you to have sex because you are so irresistible. So when i say take it like as a man i will also add take it as a man. A man is sexfood to women and gaymen, so as a man you came into the jaws of hungry gaymen. Live with it kid, life is full of choices. Choose this one as a dark secret and hide it forever. If the experience would eventually lead you to this gay lifestyle, hey again **** happens. Don't think i'm adding insult to injury but if you cannot admit it to yourself let me tell you that sometimes a guy becomes gay because of sexual abuse of gay men. But it is also a choice to stay straight and just accept you were too sexy of a man that gay men violated you. If you wish your case to be hidden forever, deal with it that way. Otherwise, if you want to report and expose your violators,and that would include exposing yourself, then take the first answer i suggested. But hey kid don't kill yourself. Let me tell you if it happened to me I might have liked it. In a perverted way it is an ego-trip: I'm too yummy that other guys just took me by force.

Then crumple it up and throw it away. Put all the thoughts down on paper as if you would show the person but tear it up and never show them. That is a way for you to get it out. 11. Go for a walk or jog. Be mindful, look at your surroundings and feel the sun, rain, snow, hot, cold. 12. Hold ice in your hand. The cold will snap you back to the present and wont leave any marks 13. Snap a rubber band against your wrist. Once again it will bring you back to the present. 14. Repeat phrases such as \"I am safe now\" \"It's over\" \"It's just a memory\" 15.

It does sound like varicosele. read this and see if it applies to you. Varicocele is a mass of enlarged and dilated veins that develops in the spermatic cord within the scrotal sac. The spermatic cord is made up of veins, arteries, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and the duct that carries sperm to the seminal vesicles (vas deferens) from the testes. If the valves that regulate bloodflow from these veins are congenitally (from birth) defective, blood does not circulate from the testicles efficiently, causing swelling in the veins above and behind the testicles with resulting warming of the testes. A varicocele can develop in one testicle or both, but in about 85% of cases it develops in the left testicle. The left spermatic vein drains into the left renal vein, which transits between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta; it is theorized that these two arteries can compress the left renal vein and thus impede bloodflow from the spermatic vein, and in the presence of defective venous valves, cause increased distal backpressure and dilation, resulting in formation of a varicocele.", 9819, "iizKx4Bvaa", 0],
