	104450 : ["First, the blue eyed concept COULD happen, depending on how many generations back it happens--ie: great grandma 1x? Good possibility--great grandma 3-4x back or further makes the chances dimmer. The answer to your paternal question: Because the grandmother had blue eyes, there's a strong probability that blue eyes ran in the family on one or both sides of her family. It COULD BE a recessive trait, as is the case with one aunt in one side of our family but the first speculation is the one \"I'd throw money on the table\" to win on. With so many blue-eyed people vs. brown eyed people in the equation, the baby's eye color is 50-50, although don't rule out green. Sometimes, if there is enough brown and blue in the mix the result CAN BE green. The blue has to  \"run deeply\" for blue eyes. The least it would take to have a blue eyed baby: Boyfriend, mother, grandmother all have blue eyes--I'd be shocked if \"little darlin'\" didn't have them too with all that blue---110% certainty of it with all of that.", 9879, "None", 0],
	104451 : ["My daughter and her boyfriend both have dark brown eyes.  Their son who is 17 months old still has bright blue eyes much to my surprise.  I know they can still turn but his mom's eyes were brown by the time she was 3 months old.  As far as the family on both sides.  His side all have brown eyes.  My husbands side has either brown or hazel.  My side, brown, hazel or green.  Nobody exept the baby has blue eyes.  My youngest two children both had blue eyes until they were about 5 or 6 then they turned green.  So just because the baby's eyes are blue now doesn't mean they will be later.", 9879, "None", 0],

	104462 : ["Blue eyes are due to a recessive gene, if one parent has brown eyes, then their babies are more likely to have bown eyes. But, you inherit one eye colour from your mother and one from your father, who also inherited one colour from your grandmother and one from your grandfather, the list goes on, so to answr your question, yes, two ble eyed parents can have a brown eyed child. I know two brown eyed parents who have a blue eyed child, and a gray eyed mother and brow eyed father with a green eyed child, so nothing's impossible! If you have that litle bit of brown around the pupils, then it's just a small variation in the gene passed on, and not due to a brown eyed gene inherited from your parents. Chances are, a parent, grandparent, even great grandparent might have had the same variation and it's lain recessive until it cropped up in you!", 9879, "None", 0],
	104463 : ["genes are crazy little things. Seeing that you already know that there is a blue eyed gene in the blood stream, then why are you asking this question? Yeah, there is no question that the kid just got the gene. Good for him/her. I have a friend who is african american, and both her parents are african american as well as her husband and his parents, grandparents etc., but i think that her great-great grandparents, one was white, well last year, she had a beautiful baby boy, he's light-skinned with grey eyes and curly hair.

	104472 : ["The old teaching of brown dominant, blue recessive, has proven to be false. It's more complicated than that. Eye color has since been discovered to be a polygenic trait, that is, not one gene is responsible for eye color.  It's possible for brown eyed parents to have a blue eyed child, or for blue eyed parents to have a brown eyed child.  Scientists from Australia have made a recent breakthrough discovery in the genetics of eye color. Here an article from the BBC about it ", 9879, "d70677bf1da0e77d878db8daf8f274c6aa", 0],

	104477 : ["Good evening Beatle :) This actually happened with one of mine... Basically, I had the original Fleetwood Mac \"Rumours\" album, but then it got remastered & expanded, and they decided to add 'Silver Springs' in. The official reissue placed it as track 7, between 'Songbird' and 'The Chain'. But for me, it was totally wrong there.  So I burned my own copy, and placed it as track 6, between 'Go Your Own Way' and 'Songbird'. This seemed much more fitting, partially as it was originally the b-side to the 'Go Your Own Way' single, and also because of the lyric \"... I'll follow you down till the sound of my voice will haunt you. You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loved you\". To follow that up with 'Songbird' takes away the anger and pain and prepares us for 'side two' {as would have been}.  BQ: Please see above answer ;)", 9883, "NQ37mnWkaa", 5],

Back in the days before CDs and their easy 'one touch' forwarding to the next song.... there were a few albums that I just couldn't stand a song that was right in the middle!

Red Hot Chili Peppers ~ Californication Why oh why is that clanging song, \"Get on top\" right after the most beautiful, heartfelt, sad songs, \"Scar tissue\" and \"Otherside\"????? Why!?! lol At the beginning or the end would have worked much better for me. Ditto RHCP's \"By the Way\" album. Cabron ~ *What* a stupid song. Boring, too. Please put it at the end, guys.... Thanks!
