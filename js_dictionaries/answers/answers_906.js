Right not it is only on the weekends.He is slowly killing his brain and his liver cells, and by the time it becomes bad-enough to be noticeable, it will be too late.How long CAN he go without having a drink?  If he cannot go for 3 months without any alcohol .. he has a problem. At the least, he probably has become physically addicted and needs to be monitored in a rehab-detox center to break the addiction.  The recovered alcoholic cannot ever take a drink again, if they want remain unaddicted.But usually physical addictions are caused by a psychological addiction: the person is unhappy or lacks skills for handling with their stress and emotions, so they \"self-medicate\" with alcohol.  So most alcoholics must not only go through the phsyical withdrawal .. they have to get psychological therapy, and it can take years for them to not want a drink anymore. As far as him texting someone, I wouldn't worry.  Few women want an alcoholic as their lover or partner, so he's not in danger of attracting women.  He's probably just discontented with his life, and himself .. and rather than fixing himself he distracts himself with alcohol and the fantasy of going onto dating websites.", 7101, "sMtpQ4f2aa", 1],
