Now you don't have to use media player as a slides show and switch to your editing software to edit then come back to slide show it is an all in one program.Best photo-editing software When it comes to the best professional photo-editing software, experts agree that Adobe Photoshop CS3 is the de facto industry standard. However, this is a $620 professional-grade software package, and you might need to take a class in order to overcome the steep learning curve. Photoshop CS3 is capable of almost any type of modification you desire, but it is certainly not easy to learn or understand.  According to CNet.com, Photoshop is a serious tool for professionals. Adobe Photoshop CS3 has new features such as Smart Filters, which allows you to view different effects without destroying the original image, and an improved and faster Bridge, which is Adobe's image organizer. Photoshop CS3 also has new image-alignment and black-and-white conversion tools, and enhanced Curves controls. Reviewers say this is the only version of Photoshop which is completely compatible with Windows Vista, and both Mac and PC users should see an increase in speed, although loading the program is reported to be a headache. Professional photographers say there's really no substitute for Adobe Photoshop CS3. When working in the RAW format, CS3's improved Camera RAW plug-in has new sliders, such as Recovery and Fill Light, that let you improve the lighting in a photo. For non-professionals, however, photo-editing software in the $100 price range includes the most important features of Photoshop CS3 without the learning curve or expense.  Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (*est. $80) currently has a slight lead over Corel Paint Shop Pro X2 (*est. $80) . Elements is favored over Paint Shop Pro at both PC World and PC Magazine. If you are currently using Elements 5, however, you might want to consider before upgrading. Several reviews note that Adobe has primarily added a dark gray interface similar to Paint Shop's and improved ease of use for beginners rather than adding lots of new features, so if you are happy with your current version of Elements, you may not need to upgrade.  Ads by GooglePicasaPhotoshop 7.0Photoshop FilterPhotoshop Plugins Although reviewers say that improvements in Elements 6 are mainly about ease of use, Elements 6 has added some new photo-editing tools. A new Quick Selection tool lets you easily mark off a small part of a photo to work on, while the new Refine Edge tool makes any adjustments blend into the background. These photo-editing tools were first introduced in the $620 Photoshop CS3. Photo blending technology now lets you combine the best parts of several shots to create one perfect photo, or you can even combine features from different faces to create a new face. New Guided Editing walks you through many of Elements' features. Paint Shop Pro has a similar feature called Express Lab, but it doesn't let you edit multiple images at the same time or perform as many tasks as Photoshop Elements. This version of Elements has also added four tabs to the Organizer (organize, fix, create, share) and three tabs to the Editor (edit, create, share) for improved ease of use.  Corel acquired Paint Shop Pro when it bought Jasc three years ago and has been steadily improving it ever since. Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 has some terrific new tools, say reviews, and many of its features compare to Photoshop. New features include Thinify, a tool that makes people look thinner with one click, and Eye Drops, which takes the red out of bloodshot eyes. Paint Shop Pro allows the user to work with multiple layers on a photo. This feature allows for more extensive image manipulation possibilities and is common in better photo-editing software, but it's not seen as often in less-robust photo editors. The new Layer Styles lets you add drop shadows and other effects to your layers.  Other new photo-editing features in Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 include the new dark gray Graphite Workspace Theme which makes your photos stand out on the screen, and Photo Merge which lets you combine two or more photos taken at different exposures to get a full range of highlights and shadows. Black and white photo conversion has been improved, say critics, and new visible watermarks have been added. For ease of use, Express Lab lets you make basic fixes (like cropping, rotating and removing red eye) to individual photos in folders without waiting to open each photo. PC World's Alan Stafford says, however, that you can't batch process photos in Express Lab, although a batch processor is available elsewhere. Like Paint Shop Pro, Adobe Photoshop Elements photo-editing is lauded for its advanced functionality combined with an easy-to-use interface. Since Elements is also made by Adobe, it shares some features with Photoshop, including the Healing Brush, which erases wrinkles and blemishes. In Elements 6, you can now preview these changes before committing to them. The enhanced Clone tool, which lets you copy one part of a photo and apply it over another part, now also lets you preview changes. Another enhanced photo-editing feature lets you automatically stitch together multiple photos to create seamless panoramas.  New in the latest version of Photoshop Elements is a Smart Album. This feature lets you automatically organize photos of the same type. Choose up to 10 search functions, such as size or date, and instantly see the matching set of photos. The function for transforming color pictures to black and white has been enhanced with larger preview images. RAW support has been improved, say reviews, letting you edit from a greater selection of camera models. There is also finer control over lighting and color adjustments in RAW, and the same set of adjustments can now be applied across multiple RAW images simultaneously.  Although the recently released Elements 6 is only compatible with PC computers, Photoshop Elements 4.0 for Mac is compatible with Mac OS X versions 10.3 or 10.4. Other photo editors Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 was Microsoft's photo-editing software. Microsoft also offered its photo editor packaged as the Microsoft Digital Image Suite Anniversary Edition. In May 2007, Microsoft announced that it was discontinuing its line of Digital Image Suite photo-editing products, saying that many of their features and tools can now be found in Windows Vista. Customers will receive product support for up to three years from the purchase date or through April 30, 2010, whichever date is reached first.", 9065, "IZW5NTU3aa", 0],

Planets are a large part of what I study and for me, and others like me, this ruling that Pluto is no longer a planet is not only exciting, but also very important.  Up until now there has never been a formal definition of what a 'planet' is or isn't in astronomy.  Having no definition led to lots of confusion over the years as to what should be or shouldn't be a planet.  It was mentioned earlier that keeping Pluto as a planet would mean that we'd have add a lot more 'planets' to the solar system because we're constantly finding big chunks of rock and ice out beyond Pluto.  If we keep up the rate at which we're finding them, then 50 years from now there could be 100 planets in the solar system.  That's ridiculous.
