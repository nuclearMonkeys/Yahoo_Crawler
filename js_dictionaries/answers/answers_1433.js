The United States of America was forged in the concepts being discussed when the ink spilled onto vellum from a tip of a pen in the form of the words: \"We the People . . .\" The line you typed about above was those words; those words are before and behind you, me and our fellow Americans every moment of every day since that moment. The problem is that there are ideologues committed to hoarding wealth and power at the intentional destruction of those concepts and they have amassed enough wealth and power to enact their intentions. The economic royalists that manipulate folk who erroneously label themselves as 'Conservatives freaked out when a middle-class emerged from the Keynesian economics utilized by the FDR Administration to re-build our great nation after the Republican generated Great Depression. Since the 1950s, there has been a war against education to effect subjection the middle-class. The effect has blunted Americans relationship to the concepts above. We have forgotten that no one injured by the Colonialists who dumped tea into Boston Harbor in protest of the tax-break enacted by the owners of the British East Indies Company and that none of them were carrying guns. We have forgotten that General George Washington commanded that combatant prisoners of of the Colonial Army were to be treated with respect and have no injuries inflicted upon them. We have forgotten that Hoover activated our own military again the Bonus Army on July 28, 1932, for occupying Anacostia Flats. We have forgotten marching across bridges in Mississippi in 1965. We have forgotten that former President Reagan enacted the single largest deficit-enhancing tax-giveaway to the wealthy then raised taxes upon the middle-class eleven times to pay for those 'tax-breaks' yet still leaving a national debt greater than the sum of all prior debts from all previous Administrations. We have forgotten that GWB43 Administration made the Reagan Administration like a bunch of layabouts in their ability to inflict harm on America and Americans. AND yet, we are beginning to remember that that line is behind us and act accordingly.", 8873, "9hAZAVd3aa", 0],
	77297 : ["In the 80s I had issue with city parking laws.  Street sweeping signs saying \"no parking between 8 & 10 Tuesdays\" and that sort of thing.  Except they weren't cleaning the streets, it was just a parking ticket scam. At the time I lived in an old apartment building and we had to park on the street. So I decided to go to court and learn how to beat them.   I had already learned to use a law library, write motions and briefs as this was during my constitutionalist wacko phase. This was a municipal court and for \"infractions\" there was no prosecutor.  The shallow end of the pool is a great place to learn.  I lost repeatedly and had to pay the $35 for the ticket. But at every appearance I learned something, did more research and was smarter the next time. I was having so much fun, I made sure to get a ticket once a month so I could go back and play.  Took me a year to figure out the winning formula.  Which is very simple:  This was in  California and the penal code (1045 I think) says even though the traffic courts are conducted informally, all the rules of evidence still apply.  Ah, rules of evidence....  Hmmmm....  They have to show a prima facie case, meaning every element of the crime.  One of the elements of the crime is \"who owns the car\".  Since there is no prosecutor to introduce the documentary evidence from the DMV, even though it is sitting on the Judge's desk, it does not legally become evidence EVER since there is no prosecutor to lay foundation by bringing someone from the DMV to testify to the authenticity of the document and the Judge never had opportunity to accept it as evidence. So they can't show that it was my car.  Therefore their case fails, no prima facie case. Took me a year to figure this out. Meanwhile, what was I doing?  I was driving up their costs.  Sure they got the $35 every time but it sure cost them way more than that to deal with me.  And I had so much fun dropping paper on them.  This was before computers, so the City Attorney had to have someone type out a formal complaint (putting a note on your car is not proper service of process) and respond to my notices and demands. Once on the complaint they put \"The State of California vs (me)\" So I argued at the arraignment that the muni court had no jurisdiction because the Federal Constitution said in all cases between a State and a citizen, the court of original jurisdiction would be the Supreme Court (now Federal District Court). So a lawyer had to run across the street and retype it to say \"The People of the State of California vs (me)\". I had so much fun!!!!!  They hated me.", 8873, "AA10294213", 1],

Nixon approached that personal line, but never crossed it with a Greetings from your Uncle Sam letter. If he had, I would have had to try to stop him.     I am not a pacifist. Anybody who wants to can come to me and ask me to kill somebody. The thing they need to remember is that I will judge two lives, the life of the person they want me to kill, and their life.
