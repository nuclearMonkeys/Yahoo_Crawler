The only thing I can tell you, without seeing it myself is that if you shut it all the way down and you can get to the jets, you could pull a pipe cleaner through the jet and possibly get whatever is in the way out and the it should not give any more trouble. don't quote me, because like I said, without looking at it,  really don't know.

The cost of the insurance is then passed on to the patients through things like a $50 pee test. The products themselves don't cost much but everything in a hospital has a cost... for instance: A hospital charges about $1000 for the use of a surgery theater for one hour because it has to be booked so another surgery doesn't conflict.  It's how they try to operate while making a profit to stay open.  Universal healthcare may alleviate some of these problems but will most likely cause others.", 10340, "NysFTExhaa", 0],

You will at least be able to check to see if they have one on file for your job.

	113083 : ["Unreasonable?  A little.  About the charges? Maybe not, that is unless the additional charge for returning is for coming out on the weekend.  But they should stand behind their work. That doesn't mean if they solve one problem and another shows up on the third day they are responsible for it. If it is working well when we leave there is little we can diagnose. In other words, if it ain't broke at the time we can't fix it. Customers tend to think there are rooms full of people waiting to come out to you 24/7 day and night, weekend and holidays. The service people have no life of their own but to serve, nor do they deserve one.  Service people need to have work scheduled for days, or a week or more in advance to keep busy. Same day emergency service like you got on Friday generally means others will be delayed and/or the serviceperson will have to start work earlier and not get dinner working 14 hour days when people are screaming because the weather is cold. And often those screaming loudest don't have their furnaces serviced regularly which means more unscheduled work when I arrive and I see what a mess they are, having not been touched in years.  When is the last time you had it serviced and cleaned? Have you had the blower wheel and ducting cleaned in recent history? Do you approve the recommended repairs when it is serviced like replacing burners or other worn parts?  People need to take \"some\" personal responsibility.   You are exaggerating. It stopped again on Sunday and you are screaming about them not being back there less than within 16 hours on the weekend. That is NOT being without heat for \"three days\".  Tell me again why is it that you are more important than those other people without heat that have likely been waiting longer, over the weekend or more, for a part?    How often do you have your furnace serviced for regular maintenance to prevent problems? Sometimes I have wished I could give the customers demanding immediate service the phone numbers of the other people I have scheduled. Then let you explain to THEM why you are more important than they are and I should come to your first even though they have been waiting days. Then you can call my wife and tell her why I won't be home for dinner again because of the extra work you are demanding I do today on your old unmaintained furnace.", 10341, "ww12lItvaa", 0],

	113087 : ["You'll struggle to find things as good as probably the best kids series written in the past 30 years... It does depend on your definition of \"age appropriate\". My son loves the Alex Rider books...but they are intended for slightly older children. People die in them and there is violence. The Percy Jackson books are basically a clone of the HP idea, except with Greek godly powers in place of magic. Don't let that put you off - they are great fun. Michelle Paver's Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series is excellent. Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series is a favourite of my son's (though I'm not a huge fan) and he also loves the Edge Chronicles  and the Mortal Engines series. You might also be better off looking at older childrens books (I mean books written longer ago) when it wouldn't have been acceptable to have a lot of things in books intended for older children which you'd have in them now. Try Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series. The Hobbit - maybe even Lord of the Rings if he's a really advanced reader. The Narnia books. Swallows and Amazons. My 10 year old loves Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Occasional innuendo but no more than that. They are intended for adults, so I'm taking you at your word on \"advanced\" :) Lemony Snickett...bleargh. Fun for a while, but it's all the same, and the tiny number of words per page mean that what you think is quite a long book is actually barely more than a short story. IMO aimed at older poor readers rather than younger good ones. Judy Blume my son read when he was about five. Really not for an advanced 9 year old.", 10338, "None", 2],

The title pretty much explains it - it's about a group of girl's who run a baysitter's club and you get lots of different stories all about each of them. Spooksville or Goosebumps books - Again loved these, they're creepy but not scary or anything. Jacqueline Wilson books especially The Lottie Project, Double Act, The Illustrated Mum and The Bed and Breakfast Star. They're all really good stories and I think they deal with things that younger people go through without being too adult. Garth Nix is also really good I think for younger readers probably the Keys to the Kingdom series that starts with Mister Monday. The Artemis Fowl books by Eoin Colfer - it's got faeries and things and is a good fantasy series. The Wish List is also good.", 10338, "U7BcLZnVaa", 0],

	113090 : ["It sounds like it is turning itself because the burners didn't all light - it also sounds like a fairly modern furnace with electronic ignition (i.e. the pilot light isn't always on. There are really only three possible reasons for some burners to light and others to not light. First, there's usually some sort of deal to carry the flame from the igniter to all of the burners.  You should be able to watch the ignition sequence through a little window.  The igniter lights, a tiny flame ripples along a little tube, then the main gas valves open and the burners come on.  So, are all of the little holes in this tube clean and do you get a nice clean, even flame all the way across? Another problem could be that some burners aren't getting gas.  Is it a multi-stage furnace where it turns on more burners when more heat is needed?  It could have a band gas valve.  Probably it's a single stage furnace with one gas valve and mulitple orofices - one per burner - and one of them could be clogged.  Sometimes you can just swipe the inside of an orofice with a pin and get it going again. One burner may not be getting air - spiders can get in there and make eggs sacs inside venturi tubes and cause all sorts of hassle.  These can be cleaned with a bit of wire, a toothpick, etc, it really depends on what is in there and where it is. I hear you when you say that you can't afford to pay for help right now, but you have to understand that working on your own furnace involves ricks of fire and risks of carbon monoxide poisoning.  There are a lot of people out there with enough mechanical skill to do the level of work that you need to do to diagnose this problem quite safely and there are a lot of dopes that try to use butter knives as screwdrivers.  Be sure you now which you are and if it's the latter, seriously consider alternatives, like handy family member, handy neighbor, social services folks that will pay for a real furnace tech for you, etc.", 10339, "256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa", 3],

Under this policy, if a broadcaster allowed something supportive or derogatory about a particular political issue to be sent out over the airwaves, they were required to give equal time and access to an opposing viewpoint.  It made sense at the time because of the handful of radio and TV stations in existence one viewpoint could completely dominate a particular political point of view if the broadcasting companies choose to do so.  With today's access to such varied and multitudinous broadcast and online media, I don't believe it makes sense to force media outlets to provide equal and opposing time for political viewpoints. The Regan administration worked to remove the Fairness Doctrine while congress simultaneously tried to codify it.  Nancy Peloci, Richard Durbin, John Kerry are just a few of the high powered democrats that have been very public in their intention to codify this former policy.
