	107109 : ["Jesus says nothing about same-sex behavior.  The Jewish prophets are silent about homosexuality. Only six or seven of the Bible's one million verses refer to same-sex behavior in any way; none of these verses refer to homosexuality as it's understood today The bible is a book about God, not on sexuality. Leviticus 18:6 reads: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination.\" Leviticus 20:13: \"A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.\" Just below the surface of these words is the deeper truth about God -- and it has nothing to do with sex. Leviticus is a holiness code (list of behaviors that people of faith find offensive in a certain place and time. In this case, the code was written for priests only, and its primary intent was to set the priests of Israel over and against priests of other cultures) written 3,000 years ago. This code also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortune told, and even playing with the skin of a pig. (There goes football!!!) Jesus and Paul both said the holiness code in Leviticus does not pertain to Christian believers. Nevertheless, there are still people who pull the two verses about men sleeping together from this ancient holiness code to say that the Bible SEEMES to condemn homosexuality. The Bible also says that sex with a prostitute is acceptable for the husband but not for the wife. Polygamy's acceptable, as is a king's having many concubines. (Solomon, the wisest king of all, had 1,000 concubines.) Slavery and sex with slaves, marriage of girls aged 11-13, and treatment of women as property are all accepted practices in the Scriptures. There are strict prohibitions against interracial marriage, birth control, discussing or even naming a sexual organ, and seeing one's parents nude. The Bible has been misused to defend bloody crusades and tragic inquisitions; to support slavery, apartheid, and segregation; to persecute Jews and other non-Christian people of faith; to support Hitler's Third Reich and the Holocaust; to oppose medical science; to condemn interracial marriage; to execute women as witches; and to support the Ku Klux Klan.

I wouldn't be able to get it ff my head and it would be really painful. You can just break up with him or here's what you can also consider trying: If you still think it's hard to forget about him, you can go on a short break. And see how he will react. During the break if he continue to do it more instead of getting back with you, then it means he's not worth it. If he DOES, that means you can consider getting back together.

	107121 : ["In the old Testament the law was to hate one's enemy and actually anyone that was of different religion. Why? Because people back then were unable to understand how you can love a person but be against their action and behaviour. So, to extinguish the peril of people taking bad habits from their neighbours stuff like that was allowed. It's similar to your parents when you are small telling you not to play with someone because you may get bad habits from that person.  The part with homosexuality is simple: the main reason for sex is procreation. And homosexuality is something wrong. Some would argue some people are naturally drawn to that kind of behaviour. The problem is that we do not see any animal in the wild have this sort of behaviour naturally. They always prefer heterosexual sex. Of course, there are exceptions: when a proper mate cannot be found, sometimes the instincts make them act crazy.

The anti-sieze will make it much easier to install this way. If he did it the \"old fashioned way\" in which you turn it to a quarter turn past tight, then it makes no difference. If he used a torque wrench, then the anti sieze will produce the correct torque reading, and dry will not. However, this is not a big deal, as long as they're all \"pretty tight\". It also makes sure that corrosion does not form on the threads, causing them to sieze and become difficult or impossible to remove. I have never seen this problem develop to a level that I could not remove the plug, however, the threads will not be as smooth and clean as they originally were.
