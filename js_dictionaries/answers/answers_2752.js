	143452 : ["May not work for you, but I think poetically 24/7. For me it's my strongest passion. I offer some suggestions I write words, lines, scraps of ideas. Everything inspires me. How you start is just start. Don't force anything, not all poetry has to be rhyme. Use personal experiences, nature, something you're already passionate about Use humor if you can, or use dark if that's where you are. keep the work simple at first. Learn some of the rules, even if you choose not to follow them always. Read valid, decent, even classic poets. get a feel for what you write, as a rhythm and flow, even if it doesn't rhyme.", 11591, "OXleDYVQaa", 0],
	143453 : ["Writing poetry isn't found in our thought world as much as in our emotional world. When a poet writes it is largely due to a passion he/she feels at the time whether over the niceties in life like love and beautiful nature or atrocities of life. One does not think a poem so much as one feels a poem. I suggest the next time you are absolutely taken with beauty or emotional wonder or frustrated with anger, hurt or other misaligned feelings and events, take time to put what you are feeling on paper. Take the blinders off the reader by being fully descriptive as though you are painting a picture. Lets say I am grieving the death of my father. I write a poem to help me get through my emotions. Written passionately The lion roars and bears its teeth My daddy is gone! My daddy is gone He lays there frozen to this world  Where went that warm heart? I bend to kiss him. My lips taste salt. Cold, icen salt shocks my senses. My heart is bleeding tears I am enraged, with sorrow so deep I feel as though I will never daylight see without spilling tears on my gray life.  Written without passion My dad is gone He died He lays there  His body is cold I bent and kissed him. I am feeling sorrow Hoping my life will go on. So in essence don't think yourself into writing. Feel yourself inside the poem. Let passion consume you. I hope this is helpful Keep in mind that just as not all people can play a piano or sing, not all people can write poetry. It is a unique talent. Poets don't just think up words. By the way....this poem I just wrote did happen and was felt.", 11591, "uhc1MCDzaa", 0],

Very few things are cast and/or shot anywhere else, and if there were to be any in Ohio, they would be in Cleveland at the closest.  (Major cities are key.)   And, even to get into those, she needs to have an agent most of the time--people cannot just walk in off the street, because that would cause an OVERWHELMING length of auditions, and nothing would ever be filmed.
