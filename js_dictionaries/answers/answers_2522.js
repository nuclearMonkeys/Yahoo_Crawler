	131921 : ["that answer all depends upon what your idea of messed up means. Some would say messed up can mean takes drugs, fights etc. others say that is perfectly fine. Some say do whatever you like as long as it does not harm others, and include drugs and stuff into not harming anyone. Others say you hurt others doing even personal actions. Some say being messed up means unable to get close, others do not mind. I guess a person has to first find out everything about themselves and everything they personally like and dislike, then seek out a person who agrees with all of their own views.The outside world would look upon me and my relationship and claim we are both very messed up and crazy and harmful. But in fact we are both happy and have been together for years, simply because we agree on the same so called wrong things, as well as right ones. we are not offended by different things, for example. And as far as society, they are usually closed minded and wrong anyhow.Just search for someone you relate to, who agrees with you personally. Or stop looking like I did, and they will come to you. I have never looked for anyone, never dated, never even tried to find a partner, and I havent been single in my whole adult life.", 11126, "SFYU9ZpGaa", 0],

Other problems are 'fly tipping' (taking large items of waste like chairs, beds etc. to remote places and dumping them), bureaucracy (getting the local council to do their job even after you've filled in the appropriate forms), 'pot holes' in the roads (holes appear due to bad road repair and cracking due to ice in winter etc.) which damage car suspensions and are never (and never will be) repaired, 'yobs' (nasty, violent and destructive youths) who think the law can't touch them - and it often can't!  Too many people thinking England have the best football team in the world when it's obvious we haven't!

	131924 : ["Yes, there are problems with both of those things in some areas but you can easily educate yourself on which those are and avoid them. I'm not sure where you are but the UK is very variable - we have areas in which you can leave your door unlocked, drink from streams and everybody will stop and greet you but there are also places where you'll need a good lock, an alarm and possibly a dog, a mask to cycle on the roads and you don't make eye contact with anyone - more specifics? Edit - I'm 5 miles ouside London and just walked my dog though beautiful forest with fresh, clean air, my daughter is at a school where there is never any trouble - we occasionally get a couple of kids hanging around outside off licences asking people to get them cigarettes or alcohol but that's about it.", 11123, "gFart0H9aa", -1],

She got the man in the end.  i hear he is more than she is capable of handling in more ways than one.  Good for them.   I learned to ask three questions which inevitably never get anyone to ask for my number... 1.  Are you married? 2.  Is your wife married? 3.  Is there a woman out the who believes you are HER man?

	131928 : ["Passing a drug test is a hell of a lot easier than people think. Ive passed tests even one day after smoking. The first time I drank a hell of a lot of water. I mean my piss was so clear it was white and I passed. Then I heard of Niacin. Its an over the counter \"weight loss\" pill(its only about $10) that has the same effects of a detox pill, but it doesn't show up on a drug test because Niacin is naturally produced in everybody. So you can take as many as you want and it wont show up. I smoked one night and the next day was told that I was going to have a drug test the next morning. I took about 5,000 mg of niacin that night and was completely clean the next morning. The problem with niacin though is that you turn red and have itchy burning skin for a while. You can get kind of dehydrated so drink plenty of water if you take it. These are two ways that I have passed drug tests and both have been very effective. And im 5'10 and 150lbs so the effects will be about the same. Good luck.", 11125, "Q9gZrYKYaa", 0],

It can cause a lot more of an upset stomach and requires more bacteria in the gut to devour these sugars, causing gas.  I don't think it's the emulsifiers or soya though.

I went through Emma's closet last night to get out all of the winter clothes, and put in the summer stuff, and I cried the whole time! lol I know that all of those clothes she won't fit into next winter, she's growing so fast.... Same goes for putting her into the toddler bed from the crib. I borrowed my crib from a friend, and she needed it back, so I went to walmart to get a new mattress the other night, and I just stood there crying because I was moving her out of her crib.
