	3852 : ["That is called passive immunity and not a vaccine. What the person vaccinated is donating is antibodies and those antibodies only last for a couple of months and then disappear. They don't last forever compared to a person who was actually vaccinated. Vaccination renders the person being vaccinated the ability to create antibodies on their own and in many cases lasts a lifetime. That is termed active immunization. ", 635, "0nyWiro9aa", 2],

	3854 : ["60Amp means very little. What voltage and what Amp-hour? a 12V 60Ahr battery is 720 Watt-hours or about 6 minutes at 7KW. A 120Volt( ten car batteries) 60Ahr battery should last one hour. If the battery is just for starting the generator then it may assume you run it often enough to keep the battery charged. If not, then you need to add a \"float charger\" to keep your battery charged.    ", 636, "eU1B5khyaa", 0],
	3855 : ["You have zero understanding of how these things are suppose to be set up.  Strongly recommend you keep hands off so you don't hurt yourself or start a fire.    If this mess is hooked to commercial power, things will end bad.  Have someone who understands how batteries are charged explain things.", 636, "None", 0],

	3857 : ["you need to be specific. There are hundreds of books on both topics, I can't summarize those in the few paragraphs allowed here. to put it at it's simplistic, electricity is the flow of electrons in a conductor, and wind energy is energy derived from the wind, usually by the wind causing blades to rotate, which causes a generator to spin, which generates electric energy.", 638, "8Y7LQ6TGaa", 1],
	3858 : ["Lots of times I had an \"Smarter looking\" classmates, but found \"smartness\" is often an illusion.  They were just better speakers or more social than me.----My grades turned out to be just as good (or better) than theirs---when I was able to somehow SEE their grades.-------Do not assume a classmate is necessarily smarter than you.  Too many times, I discovered they were just better talkers.", 643, "9LmAcLLsaa", 0],
	3859 : ["It is very hard to compare yourself to anyone because we all have different abilities. Height, weight, hair, eye color you can compare.  It is all moot anyway because it really depends on how hard you're willing to work. You might have to try harder than others in some things but you can succeed if you work hard enough. Don't waste a second in self-doubt. Use that time working towards your goal.", 643, "AA12295435", 0],

	3868 : ["If the machine has dynamic balancing high spin speeds are just fine. Extractors run at very high speeds and reduce drying times up to 50%. It is the dryer which uses the most energy. The bearings can take it. It is the motors which quit first.", 626, "a8pRDaIyaa", 1],
	3869 : ["There is an advantage to doing the spinning quicker, it gets the laundry cycle done quicker and the laundry is dryer.  I suspect spinning longer at slower speeds will not get it as dry.  And my 10 year-old washer seems to be doing just fine, the last time I had to replace a washer was for the motor, not the bearings.", 626, "wJTsifugaa", 0],
	3870 : ["Not really, there has been a lot of work done already on vaccines for viruses (SARS made it clear we needed to develop something).

	3871 : ["pretty safe Volts and amps always go together. If one doubles or triples, so does the other", 621, "None", -1],
	3872 : ["The LED is an indicator light.  That's easy. You would normally have a resistance in series with that LED to keep the current within desired operating limits.  Since there isn't one, and D1 is reverse-biased relative to the LED, I'm going to assume that D1 is a Zener diode, used to limit the voltage on the LED. In brief: Zener diodes provide a constant voltage reference when reverse-biased. It's mildly interesting that both the LED and Zener diode receive an AC signal; I can't say more about that without more information about this circuit. Google \"Zener Diode\" if you want to know more.", 639, "6hOS4Bnfaa", -1],
	3873 : ["I like the one answer that says an LED is not a diode. WTF do you think an LED is? A Light Emitting Diode. LOL D1 is a rectifier, allowing only forward bias current to flow in the circuit. It blocks reverse bias current.", 639, "Wuy7Q2a1aa", 0],
	3874 : ["You're not alone ... I'm slightly skeptical too. I think they are real robots and are really doing these dance moves, but there's something too slick about it all. I reckon they have a motion-tracked camera with preprogrammed repeatable paths. I don't think the robots did the whole dance sequence in one go and I'm not sure all the robots were there at the same time. In other words, I think it was multiple takes and the whole thing composited and edited together. One thing my eye keeps focusing on is that the frame rate for the robot motions seems slightly different to one another ... that 4 legged robot looks like it was shot at a slightly higher frame rate than the 2 legged ones? I really hope I'm completely wrong though and this dance was one take with several robots. I think this is the problem now with companies showing us cool stuff. If it's too cool you need a 'making of' video or we'll think it was faked!", 645, "BZbvSrwUaa", 0],

	3880 : ["How large a heat pump?  Define your idea of \"a lot\".  For a given output a heat pump will use less electricity than a resistance heater.  How much less depends on a number of thing, not the least of which is the temperature difference it is trying to pump across. ", 642, "WqRctcQ7aa", 0],
	3881 : ["Mexico/Spain had possession of what is now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California before the United States. There are Spanish Missions all the way up to San Francisco.

	3883 : ["Technically, Spain claimed ALL of the Americas (those portions of which did not already have \"a Christian king\") upon the formalization of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494.  That would have included California.  Spain followed up on that claim about 50 years later by visiting and planting the flag up the west coast of North America as far north as the Columbia River in 1542 - but they didn't actually establish any settlements in the region until 1769.  (That's in contrast to their settlement of   Fe, New Mexico much earlier, in 1610.)  After Mexico won independence from Spain (1821), Mexico claimed roughly the same area as Spain had, including California, although its claims in what would become Oregon were contested by Russia, by that time. After Mexico's defeat in the Mexican-American War, Mexico agreed to cede California to the USA, along with pretty much all of what makes up the southwestern United States today, (extending as far north as parts of Wyoming.)", 628, "None", 1],

	3888 : ["It sounds like the system is drawing power from the battery even when the mains is on line. You need an electrician to check the system. It should have a trickle charger as part of the system. What voltage is it? If it is a single 12V @ 60 Ah battery this is only 720 Wh. How many watts is the building using? Look at the electric bill to find KWh usage. Is the building using power from the battery when the building is locked up after hours? to run a refrigerator, AC, other stuff, computers? No one can diagnose your system by email or YA.", 636, "a8pRDaIyaa", 0],
	3889 : ["It would make sense to have the battery on charge while there is mains available, you could do this with a suitable stand alone battery charger and flying clip-on leads.    The battery probably doesn't normally charge from mains because it was designed for where there is no mains. I'm guessing it is like a car battery in that it charges when the gen. is running but if the gen. doesn't run for a long interval the battery goes flat.", 636, "jB2Z6uxhaa", 0],
