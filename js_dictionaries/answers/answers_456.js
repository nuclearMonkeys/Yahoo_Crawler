When nothing works, then either dental veneers or crowns are the option to fix the appearance of the teeth.  This option usually isn't done until after the age of 16 - especially if there is some chance that the child will need braces in their early teens.   BTW - sorry to tell you this - but I am 55 years old and have never found a way to fix my yellow issues on my two front teeth.  The rest seem fine - but my two front teeth can be embarrassing at times.  I once considered veneers but couldn't afford it at the time and now it just feels \"too late\".  After all, I have made it through most of my life now - why spend the money at this point.  ", 3968, "None", -1],

So using activated charcoal is the best way to get rid of this problem. Washing mouth with apple cider vinegar (in a small amount) can also help to remove the yellowish color of teeth.
