	40071 : ["  I have been a Yahoo Answers user for over 10 years and have really enjoyed it. There is no other site like YA. A site where one can ask (practically) any question and get a response. I would like to believe that I have helped people with very serious questions as well as frivolous ones. I have answered over 6,600 questions!        I answered questions as I would have liked others to answer my own. People who were worried or experiencing great loss. People who wanted help with a recipe idea or travel information. People who had a quick question about their new puppy or were seeking advice on a birthday gift for their boss. Questions about dealing with a mean mother-in-law or proper etiquette at a formal dinner party. People who asked for help finding the right words to say to their crush. People who needed encouragement with sticking to their diet or were trying to quit smoking. People who didn't have a huge social medial presence and many who didn't have friends or family to turn to. I was glad that I could be there on the other end of their YA question. I haven't been as into YA as I was in the first few years but I still check-in and I still ask questions that (despite what some say) are not really google-able. YA has been helpful to me because in many cases I am/was asking for opinion vs. fact (in a good way).  I would be less saddened if YA would remain read-only (like old threads on Reddit) because I still think that the Q&A's are relevant - I want it all to be accessible.  ☹", 5848, "Xlr2xG9daa", 4],
