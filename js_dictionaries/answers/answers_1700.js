Plus broiling, and of course toasting.  There is nothing I dislike about it.  I love it mostly because it's a good sized one so fits some good sized baking dishes if needed, the cooking time is great when baking casseroles, and it doesn't heat up the kitchen on a hot day like the standard sized oven does.  I haven't used it for making desserts, but I would think standard cooking (not the convection feature) would probably be best.", 9366, "None", 0],

People go away from home and say \"Oh there is a starbucks \" instead of tryiing a local small operator who maybe roasts their own coffee. People for some reason like brands.

Take your time, take baby steps. Your sister knew what would happen if she told everyone and she understood that. She knew it would take time for people to adjust or else she wouldnt have told yall. And if she expects you to just accept it like it is right off the bat then she is selfish. You just take your, talk to people who have gone threw this, talk to your parents and especially talk to your sister. She is still your sister.

If the brother's loan at the time, was to help bail them out of a mess with their home (even if she didn't know about it), then on some level, I can see where she felt it was to benefit her at the time as well.  While this was her husband's loan, it was for their benefit as a couple that they they have the money.  It doesn't in any way sound like she was legally obligated to repay it...but, I can understand the strong (and I believe correct) moral obligation she felt to do so...provided that she helped to repay it for that purpose.  I probably would not pay more than half, as she did, but I don't know the full circumstances of the loan (and you may actually not, either).   I would let it go...it sounds like she had at least reasonable cause (clearing her conscience, for one, if that was why she opted to make some payment on the loan--and if it's something that's been bothering her for some time, then $7k was probably a pretty inexpensive resolve to her).  I just hope that she plans on putting the rest of this money back, and using it for her own bail-out one day when she needs one.   Best wishes.", 9372, "pbEbILMlaa", 1],
