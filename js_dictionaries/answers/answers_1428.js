Solution:  Wait for the light to come back on and then take the vehicle to Auto Zone or Advanced Auto to have them check it.  Just tell them your \"check engine\" light is on and they will check it for free.  If the light is not on then they won't get a reading if they check it.  Also whatever they tell you is wrong with it, ask them how to fix it and then do it yourself or pay through the nose.  Good Luck", 8876, "6ae2f072d1aa4c5ad3b45f388352d5fbaa", 0],

There you have it - the melancholy evidence of Rome's steadily increasing departure from the simplicity of the Gospel, a departure so radical and far-reaching at the present time (1965) that it has produced a drastically anti-evangelical church. It is clear beyond possibility of doubt that the Roman Catholic religion as now practiced is the outgrowth of centuries of error. Human inventions have been substituted for Bible truth and practice. Intolerance and arrogance have replaced the love and kindness and tolerance that were the distinguishing qualities of the first century Christians, so that now in Roman Catholic countries Protestants and others who are sincere believers in Christ but who do not acknowledge the authority of the pope are subject to all kinds of restrictions and in some cases even forbidden to practice their religion. The distinctive attitude of the present day Roman Church was fixed largely by the Council of Trent (1545-1563), with its more than 100 anathemas or curses pronounced against all who then or in the future would dare to differ with its decisions.", 8865, "c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa", -1],

(Matt.:9) Catholics call their priests \"father.\" Jesus said at Matt. 5:44 to \"love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.\" Catholics have ignored those words and have participated in the bloodiest wars this world has ever known. Jesus said at John 4:24 that we should worship God with \"spirit and truth.\" Catholics practice paganism by celebrating such events as  , Easter, and Halloween.  They venerate the cross as a Christian symbol, although the cross predates Christianity by thousands of years.  Jesus said at John 17:3 that his Father is the ONLY true God. Catholics elevate the Son and the holy spirit to the same plane as the Father and worship them as a trinity, although trinities have existed in paganism for thousands of years. At Matt. 28:20, Jesus commanded his followers to \"teach [others] all the things I have commanded you.\" For centuries, Catholisism has oppressed those who tried to translate the Bible in the languages of the common person. Many of those translaters were hunted down, tortured, and executed by the Church. If a person merely had a Bible in his possession, he was strapped to a pole with his Bible chained around his neck and burned alive. Jesus instructed his followers to be \"no part of the world. (John 17:16) Catholics hold political office and the reigning Pope has always involved himself in politics. Jesus led a simple life. At Matt. 8:20, he said: \"Foxes have dens and birds have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.\" How about the Pope? He lives in extreme luxury in Vatican City.
