The rules are explained there. Your mother will qualify based on her husband's earnings, and as a surviving spouse if he dies first. ", 2893, "1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa", -1],

	16865 : ["No, the whole idea behind that comes from the smell of Sulfur burning when you light the match. Lighting a match produces sulfur dioxide, which masks the odor of compounds in your farts and feces that make them smell bad. ... Instead, it just masked the smell of methyl mercaptan, which, as aforementioned, is one of the smelly gases in farts and feces.", 2879, "f841afbad67e2febaf16f5f41aea6d1eaa", 5],

	16876 : ["Universal plant is dandelion weeds.  It would not be a weed IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH IT, but so far it does not make tea, wine, beer, salad, toilet paper, not a smokeable worthy to be compared to tobacco or MaryJane, not newsprint, not a 2x4, not animal feed(they don't like the bitter taste), bugs don't like it either, so leave it on Mars and maybe it could oxygenate the planet.  It has a pretty yellow flower which bees collect pollen from to produce honey...so I guess it has a reason to be here.  No one \"tiptoes through the dandelions\"   It has probably been here as long as the dinosaurs. I notice that Egypt figured out how to get rid of them.  Make sure it NEVER RAINS. Thorny blackberries is another weed.  It however produces a fruit we can eat. Just nasty to get to to pick it.   I brought 1 plant over from a wild road bush 7 miles away.  Soon there was barbed wire as it grew...and I can't get rid of it....as it reroots itself in almost any ground so long as it has water such as road side drainage ditches or small creeks so it grows on the banks in a handful of low grade soil. It puts grape jelly to SHAME...it is so tasty.  Maybe that is because my blood is mixed in? Cooch grass is another plant that just starts almost naturally. It is rough green grass that grows in clumps. If you can't grow one of these, then soil does not exist.", 2870, "None", 1],

	16881 : ["Bill is incorrect. If it's YOUR business, you certainly can pay her a salary if you want. Many business owners pay salaries to their spouses or even their children. I suppose they write it off as a business expense. My former boss had his wife and son on the payroll. I'd be surprised if your mom's Social Security for working ten years comes to much. She has to earn at least $1470 per quarter. She will be able to collect your father's if / when he passes. She can't collect both his and her own.", 2893, "VNk20PROaa", -1],
	16882 : ["Doing that serves no purpose. Once she reaches age 62, she is entitled to receive half of her husband's or her own, whichever will give her more. At age 50, she would never catch up in 'significant earnings' to exceed half of her husband's.  And if he passes away, she can collect his full benefit if she is at least 60, as a survivor's benefit. She wouldn't be able to collect if he dies before she is 60, she would have to wait, but she wouldn't get her own SS before 62 anyway. You would have to hire her as an employee, and pay one half of the FICA and Medicare taxes on her earnings, and you would have to deduct her half from her earnings and submit that to the IRS.  It makes no sense to do that if you don't need her as an employee. It would be far better to take what you can afford and gift it to her in some sort of savings account she can't access until she needs to.  You are allowed to give her up to $15,000 every year without being required to file a gift tax return.", 2893, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 5],

	16894 : ["R-13 will fit perfectly in a standard 2x4 framed wall. That's exactly what it is made for and that's what most builders in the Midwest use on exterior walls. But most of your heat will escape up through the roof. If you get the foil backed Styrofoam sheets that come in 4x8 pieces  you can easily nail them across the bottom of your rafters with the foil facing down into the garage area to reflect the radiant heat back into your garage. Most of that is not a really high r factor but it will make a big difference over having nothing.  One caution, styrofoam has a very very low ignition point and if you have a fire the smoke from the Styrofoam is very toxic.If you have room, can you build an exercise room in your detached garage that can be enclosed with a door? that way you only have to heat inside of that room, and you can build something that can be easily insulated, both the ceiling and the walls.", 2898, "2EddmzfAaa", 0],
	16895 : ["As others have said the more the better for both heating and cooling. I had my inside roof insulated because I converted the upper part of my garage to an office.
