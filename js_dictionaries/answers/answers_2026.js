My advice would be to try to gently push in one direction by simply asking her out to dinner or coffee sometime, something casual and not too imposing.  Or you could invite her slyly to a one on one study session, just make sure you're not too overt about your intentions.  Tell her then that you really fancy her and that you'd like to know if she'd like to go out with you?  It's important to not ruin your friendship, so do stress that if she says no to your proposition that you will not be hurt and that that way you can continue one strongly knowing that you are just friends.  Try to see if she'll start out casually dating you, and just take it from there!  Best of luck!", 9976, "yw4HQC38aa", 0],

Then you can \"rate\" answers with \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down.\" Just click on the “thumbs up” icon to give someone a “thumbs up” and show you approve of or like their answer; same but reverse meaning  with “thumbs down,” click on the icon to show you disapprove or don't like the answer.. It doesn't cost you any points to “rate” an answer but, once you do rate, you're stuck with that rating. You can't later change your mind and decide they don't deserve the “thumbs up” or have regrets about giving a “thumbs down.” They're forever. Stars are ways to show approval for questions. You click on the star icon to give a star, click on the same place to remove your star after you give it. No points involved..   Answer a question and get 2 pts. Ask a question and lose 5 pts. Choose the \"best answer\" to your question and get 3 of those 5 pts. back.  Be chosen as \"best answer\" and get 10 pts. plus 1 bonus pt. for each \"thumbs up\" your answer received. There's no deduction for “thumbs down.” Anyone, even people on level 1, can \"vote\" but it's not the same as \"rating\" with thumbs up/down. Vote for \"best answer\" on unresolved questions “in voting” and you get 1 pt. per question.  You can vote by clicking on the “answer” toolbar at the top of the page then click on the “vote” tab or, when you see the list of questions available in a particular category, there's a “vote” tab at the top of the questions. Either way, if you vote then you earn a point per question and help pick the “best answer.” You also get 1 pt. every day for just logging in. It's as easy as that!

EDIT: Just saw your edit. There is a specific commandment in Deuteronomy about not erasing the name of God.  Technically that only applies THE name, in Hebrew, but many Jews carry that through wherever they write \"God\".
