Then you spend any time off that you have looking for another job.  But, I can tell you that things like that happen anyplace you go.  What you are describing sounds so close to something that happened to me it makes me wonder if the manager that left my company is now your manager.   I have been at my company for almost 30 years.  I had a perfect record until about six years ago when management made some major changes.  Then there was a situation in which a few coworkers decided to become company snitches and repeat anything you said (often changing it slightly).  I somehow managed to end up on the bad side of the current management team and honestly thought I would end up fired.  I survived the struggles - the plant manager ended up being fired (I celebrated that night) - new management came in - and things calmed back down.  I am still nervous sometimes but I am not about to give up nearly 30 years in one company - (and a good pension plan and vacation time) over something that is now calming down again.  Sometimes you just need to keep your head down and stick out the bad times.  Usually, the people causing the issues will eventually be gone.
