I myself have a plan that I pay on my own, its $23 a month, through cigna, if covers once a year, Cleanign x rays and an exam for free, THEN  everything else is a discount. Like a Filling I get charged $144 instead of $240 that the dentist charges.  I really like this dentist I have gone to him for 13 years, Hell I will tell you his name, He is Dr. Robert Everett on Portland ave. In Gladstone, Oregon Unfortunalty in the next year or two he will probably retire, He has done so many of my fillings, Pulled one of my wisdom teeth, I myself Am about to get on a group plan at work. If its a crap dental plan or they are not in network with Robert everett, then I wont take it. BTW, If you do keep your own plan I would avoid saying \"keep you crappy insurance\" chances are unless this is some small company then your boss has no say what kind of insurance is offered. God bless and Happy Easter. Edit- Ok I cannot hold back, I cannot believe that several of these answers are telling you that neither of those policys are worth the paper they are written on,THAT IS A BUNCH OF BULL, One year like in 2011 I went to the dentist and had no insurance and I had the exam x rays PLUS FIVE cavities, I was out nearly 1100 to 1200 bucks right there!!! Of course these Policys have value, and spending $400 a year on dental work isnt abnormal at all. I will be 42 this summer, Wow some of these answers you have recieved are luducrous.", 2298, "BvnTNDmTaa", -2],

Yes, the cashiers were supposed to ask every customer that didn't pay with JM card if he or she wanted one.  That accounted for only a *part* of an employee's evaluation. There was one woman who rather regularly got praise for accruing more applications than her peers. She said to me once that she \"just didn't take no for an answer.\" As she walked away, another cashier said, \"I guess that's why some customers avoid her and bring their purchases to me.\" Employees were also evaluated on their \"average unit sales check.\" Credit card lady was probably far behind her peers in that, because good customers knew who she was and avoided her. I *know* they're supposed to ask. If someone gave me a hard time about it, I'd gather up my merchandise and take it to another cashier. By the way - last time I was told \"You can get 25% off your purchase if you apply and qualify for a credit card with our store\" I applied - and was denied.
