	123476 : ["I have something to show you...  Thank you Ben Garisson for clarifying, what John Adams told us: There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution. John Adams", 10752, "WaWbiTgWaa", 1],
	123477 : ["Ayn Rand has been dead for more than a quarter of a century. She was a fiction writer. I don't see why she is so idolized, but I have my own favorite authors so if someone wants to be a major Ayn Rand fan then more power to you. I disagree with you about capitalism being a \"filthy, disgusting system\", but do agree that some regulations are needed. IMO, the goal of a society should be for as many people to live a good life as possible, but people should also be expected to contribute to the well being of that society.  Harder workers and people with special skills should have more, but the  problem is that regular working people can no longer support their families on their salaries while a few people get to have exorbitant amounts of goods and money at the expense of everyone else.", 10750, "WhcPr1yraa", 0],
	123478 : ["Who says supporters of capitalism don't support healthcare and education for children? I work as a Registered Nurse at a county hospital (Houston Tx); we, as a county, have a healthcare system available to everyone, kids included.  If you qualify for welfare then you qualify for our services.   Last I heard, we still have public schools; if your mother didn't make you go to school or help you learn then why is that anyones fault other than that parent? I grew up poor (not my fault) but my parents taught me to work hard and not to expect a handout. People who harm people and are caught (in jail/prison) are provided all the services any ward of the state would have - healthcare, education, shelter and food which leaves me to think you are referring to welfare kids which I've already addressed above.", 10750, "77065613f37e389ce84c3ccdb115f32baa", 1],

	123480 : ["Obama is a puppet of the corporations so he'll be protected.  It would be Nader that would probably be assassinated b/c he's not a fan of the corporations.   Or if McCain switched away from the conservatives and started doing liberal things ... pow!", 10746, "izY3JNhqaa", -2],

	123482 : ["To me, there is a 95% chance a Democrat will be President.  There is only a 51% chance it will be Obama, but I'll take it over the other candidate who could do the following while in office: 1.  Misspeak to another countries leader and get us in a war. 2.  Not research the facts and quote someone elses lie again 3.  \"Not recollect\" or remember more than 57 times in office (think of the Grand Jury questionings she's had).", 10746, "e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa", -2],
	123483 : ["This is such an invalid argument. Driving is purely optional. Civilization advanced through the milleniums without automobiles. Therefore, auto insurance is 100% optional since driving is 100% optional. Health insurance is different. Everyone can get sick or get injured. In the US, we believe in advanced medicine and technology to a degree that financially cripples the average patient. Somebody has to pay for the newest technology and most advanced studies.  I believe there should be a \"choice\" - but not one mandated by the feds.  The choice should simply be traditional practice, or advanced practice that you're gonna pay out the wazoo to receive. For all you libs, progressives and socialists who want a single payer system, remember there will be years in which the Republicans run the show. Do you trust them? Personally, I don't trust the government with a dollar. They'll charge me $15 to let me lend them $1. added: Now that I think about it, are you referring to the levels of coverage? For example, as a male, why should I pay for cervical cancer coverage? If this is what you meant, then yes, I believe health insurance should be like auto insurance.", 10753, "sUAaeqlHaa", 8],
	123484 : ["It is unconstitutional, period. I do not own a car, and I do not need to buy car insurance. You can buy it if you wish if you are a licensed driver who does not own a  car, but there is no requirement to have a license unless you have had an accident without insurance, then you must be insured to have a license, but it is Still an \"If-Then\" situation.

	123485 : ["People are only forced to buy auto insurance if they drive a car.  With this health care bill everyone will be forced to purchase health care insurance from private insurers.  What else is being accomplished with this bill besides making health insurers stocks go up?  What a watered-down mess it turned out to be.  In the end, the objective was simply to pass a bill no matter what the content.", 10753, "DQT5ZDSPaa", 12],
	123486 : ["If you look closely at Obama's 'birth certificate', you'll notice that there is no official government agency embossed stamp or signature on it (see link below). Anyone can print a birth certificate, but only an authorized government agency can put the correct stamp on the document. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.
