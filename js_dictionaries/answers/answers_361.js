	19144 : ["50,000 to 60,000 people died of opioids and opiates last year, another 20,000 died of other drug over-doses. Do you favor more or less party time drugs in this country? With all the drugged out freaks running around killing and robbing and looting, I favor every American citizen having the right to own and carry a gun for self defense.  The same people who encourage the crime and murder are the same people who want to take away law abiding citizens right to defense. The same people who want to defund and dismantle the police are the same people who want to take away your right to defend yourself. With all of the mass riots and v other assorted violent crime exploding, I absolutely favor the rights of people to own guns. If the left have their way, when your wife and kids are getting murdered  there will not even be a policeman to be called. 911 will tell you to sing kumbyua and hope the murderer has a change of heart.", 3196, "2EddmzfAaa", 7],

	19149 : ["1]  George Floyd is NOT on trial. 2]  The Judge, Prosecution, and Defense all did their jobs better than I had hoped. 3]   Mad Maxine has interfered with the Judicial process, giving Chauvin an automatic justification to appeal if he is convicted.   4]  Jurors and witnesses have been threatened with violence. If Chauvin is convicted, it will look like a miscarriage of justice against Chauvin. 5]  They are already protesting the jury deliberations!  They don't believe Chauvin is really guilty!

	19153 : ["We'll just gloss over that Toledo was firing said gun at passing cars, apparently for fun.  2:30 AM isn't known for being the brightest time of day, and running from the pursuing officer while holding the gun only to whip around a bare half-second after throwing said firearm behind a fence out of the cop's line of sight probably had something to do with it. But know what an even better question would be, that I'm not hearing much of in the news?  Who was it that put the gun in the boy's hand to begin with?", 3194, "449528dea0d8594946c32c19ed142eadaa", 12],

	19155 : ["Very funny,,he was running from the cops,,AND he was armed with a gun. Have you not seen the body-cam footage yet, it is viral. Good way to get shot.", 3194, "3521143c1fee1cb67663128ed5d0ef31aa", 18],

	19189 : ["More guns is the direction America has been headed preceding the waves of mass shootings. So far, there's more than one mass shooting per day in America this yr.

These are the weapon of choice for mass shooters.", 3196, "None", -6],
	19190 : ["I favor less guns. There are 120 firearms for every hundred American citizens. How can that possibly be justified? We also  happen to have one of the largest and best-funded professional militaries in the world, if not THE largest and best funded. Even in a country like Switzerland where males within a certain age range are required to keep one rifle in their homes since they have always had a citizen  army and not a professional military like we do, they don't average that many total guns per person.

Perhaps the American Police should just shoot anyone they expect to pull a gun on them, with a TAZZER.  Start fining unlicensed gun owners, making them help out on Hospital wards where patience are recovering from gun shot wounds. Educating your children on what happens when you shoot someone, adults too.  Most Americans come across as being thick as pig **** and virtually every gun owner is a potential murderer.  People that want guns are barbaric morons.", 3194, "BGj3gzuRaa", -1],
