You DON\"T have to believe anything the U.S. tells you, about who IS or ISN\"T a terrorist.  I agree with the guy who said that when someone is pointing a gun or strapping a suicide bomb to themselves and aiming it at U.S. civilians...terrorist.  I prefer to have some idea of who is, and I also VALUE my own judgement.   I agree with the guy who suggested traveling to Tibet or Venezuela.

She has lied on his behalf, he has lied, he has slandered the reporters who actually had the proof.  He broke the law paying for his whore with campaign funds, he saw his whore within the last three weeks, and his whore is living in a three million dollar mansion.  He has denied the baby is his and seems if you can believe him, passed her to his buddy for a nice roll in the sheets.  Not very presidential, unless it is a Clinton.  Add in he has delegates for sale in Denver in a couple of weeks. He continues to lie.  He was also a contender for Vice President until about 30hrs ago.......

	78810 : ["the national inquirer broke this story in 2007 and it took that long for the liberal press to even mention it.  some of them intentionally sat on the story.  i heard many of them say that Edward's private life should be kept private.  this was unfair but typical.  if it had been a conservative, it would have been all over the headlines long ago. i am seeing so many questions about the pararelles of McCain and Edwards by liberals who are using this as an excuse to attack McCain.   i think that it is morally wrong but liberals have taught us that these things don't matter anymore. we took a page right out of their playbook. it is strange how liberals will attack others for it yet when a liberal commits such sins, they think that it has nothing to do with how the person will perform his job as a politician. just look at congress and how many homosexuals, murderers, and adulterers are in it. Ted Kennedy was responsible for the death of a young woman yet has served from these many years with no negative aspect to his career. history shows us that many leaders had scandalous affairs yet served as our leaders. even the Bible tells of many who did the same and yet went on to serve their God. i don't think it will serve either candidates in a negative manner but then i am a forgiving person as i have some things in my own past that i am not proud of and wish that i could change. i bet most are in the same boat if they are hones. i feel for the families and those who have to live with it and try to pick up the pieces and move on with their lives.", 8956, "d8ZptpnMaa", 0],

	78844 : ["n physics, uniform circular motion describes the motion of a body traversing a circular path at constant speed. The distance of the body from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body's speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body's speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates the presence of an acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times towards the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed towards the axis of rotation. In the case of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body that is not negligibly small compared to the radius of the path, each particle of the body describes a uniform circular motion with the same angular velocity, but with velocity and acceleration varying with the position with respect to the axis.", 8963, "oApSnMlraa", 0],
