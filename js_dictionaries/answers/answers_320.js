Try playing it in a DVD player. It even has a label that says, Sony Corporation, DVD-R, 1.4 GB. CD players will not play DVD discs.   DVD discs have plastic protecting both sides of the disc so it is not as easy to damage as CDs. CDs can be unplayable if the side that contains the data is damaged. The data side of the disc, which is also the label side, is not protected by plastic, so it can be easily damaged. Once damaged, it cannot be repaired. Scratches on the side with plastic protection can be easily repaired. Your DVD disc should be playable because the circled area is the white colored covering on the surface of the disc. The data layer is sandwiched between 2 layers of plastic and is therefore not damaged. You just need to play it on a DVD player or computer with a DVD recorder or player, assuming that it was recorded properly. If a disc is not recorded properly then it won't play either.
