	116685 : ["Apparently the \"silver\" designation is seems to only be available at Big 5. Where $320 is not a bad price the same combo can be had with wood instead of synthetic stock and an Accuchoke barrel with 3 choke tubes instead of a barrel with a fixed choke for $379 at Gander Mountain I believe. There are a ton of these combos out there so shop around your price is good but you could probably score more features for just a little more $$. You are right the slide release becomes inactive after rounds are loaded unless you need to unload a chambered round.  Adding choke tubes is something that is possible but not cost effective for such an inexpensive gun and buying a barrel that already has them is a smarter way to go. Bottom line if this gun has all the features you want go for it but be aware that regret has made many a man buy twice just make sure you know what you want.", 10471, "b4CNiCwmaa", 1],
	116686 : ["$320 is pretty much the standard price I have seen for 500's. I have never heard of a 'silver' model though. That tap is to allow the forearm to move if the gun is readied, see when the gun is pumped and the trigger is back which makes the gun primed the forearm locks into place. That tab is to allow the forearm to move while like that to say remove a live shell without having to pull the trigger. As for choke tubes you need to see if the barrel is threaded for them. Some are some aren't. For what it is the 500 is a pump action shotgun. Nothing really special about it. I mean the only two issues are make sure the barrel will work as they make 5 and 7 round tubes and some may complain as the receiver is aluminum to save on weight rather than steel and the safety is plastic. Also it will be annoying the first time you totally take it apart. Taking apart the trigger grouping is unnecessary.", 10471, "mOTCr8Pxaa", 2],

	116706 : ["Actually it depeds on the sentencing. From what I can understand when the DA puts in a 25 to life sentence, it means that the CONVICTED felon can expect a sentencing of anything between 25 years and life in prison. Basically 25 to life is usually what they say before the defendant is convicted. After he or she is convicted, the jury can 'advise' the judge as to what the sentence should be. The judge then takes the jury and the DA's sentences into advisement before the judge makes a ruling to how long the convicted person/s should stay in jail. So if the DA requests 25 to life it means that, s/he wants the convicted felon to be in jail for atleast 25 years and at most life in jail. The judge can go ahead and pick some random number like 44 and it will still be ok, but the judge can also pick a lower number if s/he feels that 25 is too much. It's all up to the preception of the judge, the jury, the DA and the defense. Usually convicted felons don't normally serve out their whole term. Usually only about a 1/3 or a 1/4 of their term is served in jail and the rest is what we call parole where they have to go and check in with a shrink and the police every so often. But life in jail usually means that they serve life unless parole is granted where then the convicted felon would serve out the rest of his or her sentence outside jail. But life without parole is usually when the felon cannot appeal for parole but can appeal the decisions. This is my interpretation of the life sentence. I may be right or wrong it really depends on so many factors, good behavior and the such. The death sentence is different because you get sent to prision and then death row, this process is so slow you can rot in prision/death row forever and never actually be killed. Usually inmates on death row die from the atrocious living conditions.", 10469, "yrVbrxM6aa", 0],

During normal use, the bolt unlock wouldn't be used. It mainly for unloading the shotgun without firing the shells.  4. The long hunting barrel has a fixed choke. It will not be interchangeable. It's probably a full choke and will be fine for most hunting applications.  5. I owned a M500 a while ago and it was a reliable and fun to shoot. Unfortunately, it was stolen while I was deployed.
