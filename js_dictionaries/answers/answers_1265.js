	68784 : ["Do you think democrats care? Here's the evidence that progressives don't give a damn about America: 8/31/1910 Osawatomie, Kansas, Republican T. Roosevelt proclaims the progressive agenda -- national health care, social security and the championing of unions (the vanguard of all such movements) -- and discards the Constitution: “This, I know, implies a policy of a far more active governmental interference with social and economic conditions in this country than we have yet had, but I THINK WE HAVE GOT TO FACE THE FACT THAT SUCH AN INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT CONTROL IS NOW NECESSARY.” Dem. pres. Wilson (1913-21):  \"You are not here merely to make a living. You are here to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, and with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. YOU ARE HERE TO ENRICH THE WORLD. You impoverish yourself if you forget this errand.”  FDR's “Second Bill of Rights” included the “right”: to “earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation”; of every family to a “decent home”; “to be free from economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment.” (Speech to Congress on 1/11/44) LBJ's Great Society spent trillions on those “rights.” In fact, America's semi-capitalist system provided those “rights” in such abundance that millions of Europeans fled their welfare state nations to come here. But none of that matters to democrats. Their party now has what they want, a welfare-state America: -2/4/10 Gallup poll: 61% of liberals have a positive view of socialism. -6/2/11 Gallup poll: 71% of democrats favor re-distributing wealth. -9/6-9/2012   Those who want more government control over us: Republicans 15%; Independents, 29%; Democrats 67%.   -4/4/12 Pew Research Center:  71% of Hispanics (who overwhelmingly vote democrat) want bigger government. -Now they have national health care, the hallmark of all welfare and socialist states. -Norman Thomas ran for president six times under the Socialist Party banner:  In a speech he gave in 1944 he said, \"I no longer need to run as a Presidential Candidate for the Socialist Party. The Democrat Party has adopted our platform.\" Ben Franklin predicted all of it: \"When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.\"  We're now a democracy. Thomas Jefferson: \"A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where 51% of the people may take away the rights of the other 49%.” Ben Franklin: \"Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.” Obama will nominate like-minded progressives to the Supreme Court who will affirm the democracy agenda. Corporations will vote for corporate welfare and government contracts. The welfare class will vote for more benefits. The government unions will push for bigger government because that means more unionized government union jobs. Our elites politicians will continue to give money to nations which are anti-American and welfare state nations that promote the democrat dream of an American utopia.  And the Constitution will not be there to protect freedom lovers. Even national security is secondary to their political agenda. 6/10/13  A majority of Republicans found that the NSA's surveillance programs were acceptable under both Bush and Obama, but with democrats it's who's in power that counts:  Under Bush only 37% found the programs acceptable; under Obama 64% found them acceptable.", 8470, "None", 9],
	68785 : ["Well, I'm sort of torn here.  I don't necessarily think the racing itself is bad, but the way most of the dogs are treated, is horrible.  Racing greyhounds is really more about using their instincts as a sighthound.  I don't see the activity itself much different than hunt tests and field trials.  (Except you aren't supposed to bet on those!  LOL!) As for the statement about it being the end of the greyhound breed?  That's hogwash!  It might actually be GREAT for the breed- It will decrease the demand, and maybe greyhound rescue will not be as necessary.", 8473, "JtZfTiEEaa", 3],
	68786 : ["The actual racing....fine....those dogs love to run and I don't find putting them on a track and letting them run to their heart's content to be cruel. In that aspect, it's not much different than agility or other dog sports BUT, the treatment of the dogs when they are not racing IS cruel. Kept in small cages 23 hours a day, given minimal vet care, etc.  I would support a total ban on racing for the simple fact that most tracks can't seem to give the dogs the care they deserve. Even if the breed dies out, which I don't see happening at all, that is far preferable to keeping the breed around simply to abuse them. I think there are plenty of Greyhound people out there that will keep the breed alive and well, right now there is just no need for much breeding since the tracks keep a steady supply in rescue groups.

Also don't eat right before you sleep and no physical exercise right before sleep, although it's good earlier in the day.

	68812 : ["I can't answer on behalf of the people you name. My best guess they don't contribute their own money is that they're selfish greedy bastards that don't really care about anybody but themselves... but that's just my best guess and I don't know it for a fact. Speaking for myself (even though I'm not actually a liberal democrat but close enough to it for the purposes of this question) I would never contribute my own money (above or beyond taxes) to anybody else because (a) I don't have the kind of money I can give away, (b) the kind of money I do have to give away would never accomplish anything or make a difference in anybody's lives and (c) I never will have that kind of money. To answer your question about \"financing the needs of (others)\", we have organized ourselves into an economy based society (and that is as opposed to a humanity based society). We compel labor contribution in exchange for benefit and our economics (not humans) determine the contribution to benefit ratio, and our economics (not humans) also determine that a perpetual variable percentage of our humanity is always surplus. That means our social structure and our economics prohibit some percentage of our population from contributory participation, so when we talk \"no work, no eat\" talk, we're talking about punishing people that WE PROHIBITED from participation and that's murder talk. If we're going to prohibit some percentage of our population from participation, prohibit their natural behavior and neither offer nor allow any alternatives then we have to either feed them or kill them. I sympathize that it feels good to lash out at those we consider at fault but the reality is under current conditions, you and I don't know the difference between someone that WON'T work and someone we are PREVENTING from working. You may choose to call them people that won't work, but you don't really know that for a fact and speaking for myself, before I start talking about starving them or murdering them, I want to know who is really guilty. The reason we have welfare programs is because we operate a 'competitive' system that excludes and punishes those numerically eliminated but we're too cowardly to kill them and too weak to defend ourselves, so we try to buy them off with squalor, and that's why WE SHOULD 'FINANCE' their squalor... because if we don't, they'll kill us all... because the one thing I know for sure is that NO ONE will EVER sit down and starve to death quietly without disrupting the rest of us while we drive our SUVs to the restaurants and shopping malls. They're not working because we won't let them work and we refuse to find a way for them to participate and contribute, and when we talk about forcing them to starve as well, we're talking about some pretty serious conflict that is going to involve a lot of violence. That's not what I want and despite any words you say, I don't believe that's what you want either. The deadbeats of this society are the owners, operators and shareholders that forcibly prohibit our natural behavior, prevent us from acting like a responsible society, revoke our humanity, contribute nothing, seize all value, and trick us into blaming and hating humans instead of the sadistic inhuman economy. Those are the ones that ought to work or starve. I'm with you on the attitude, the only difference is I've identified the correct deadbeats. That's why I want to pay my share and that's why owners, operators and shareholders should 'finance' life for everyone else.", 8472, "None", -1],
