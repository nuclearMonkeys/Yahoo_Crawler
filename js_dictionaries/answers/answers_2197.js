	115652 : ["I tried Sears.. will never do it again. They entice you with $9.99 portrait package offers and ads.. then when it comes down to it, you end up spending $150 or more anyways.. to get next to nothing. They take 20 poses and we had to wait 30 minutes even though we had an appt. We then had to wait another 45 minutes after we were done to order the pictures. You know that is next to impossible with a 2 month old. They then would not mail them unless we paid $25 for shipping on a couple of prints. We had to drive 30 minutes each way once again to pick them up. I wasn't impressed at all. The pictures came out cute but we didn't have any variety.  My advice is to find a local photographer who charges $150 flat rate, takes over 100 pictures and then gives you the proof book with the negatives. Many locals do this.. we have a fabulous local photographer we use but we tried out Sears to save money. Long story short, we won't be switching again and we'll be using her from now on. I guess I just think 100 shots to choose from is more worth it. Best Wishes. ;-)", 10437, "AA11328606", 3],
	115653 : ["We had pictures taken every month for the first year and we had most of them done at Walmart.  We'd get one of their package deals and I'd get a ton of pics for like $7.  For his 2 month we used Olan Mills because we had a coupon for a free package.  It wasn't a great experience so I've never gone back.   When it came to his six month pics which also happened to be Easter we used JCPenney and LOVED them.  They had tons of props, they love when parents bring their own props and the photographers there really seemed to be patient and take the time to get good shots.   There was also a very noticable difference in the quality of pictures from JCPenney vs Walmart.  The pictures from Walmart weren't truly the size they said they were and the quality of paper just wasn't as good. We used JCPenney for several other occasions and I really like them.  I've used studios in 3 different states (MI, CA & TX) and even had to have them mailed to us once.   I've never used Sears because they just seemed so expensive, even with coupons.  There is also Kiddie Kandids inside of Babies R Us.  They are also quite expensive but I have never seen a bad picture come from there.  Those people are trained to deal with kids and getting toddlers pictures taken can be a real challenge.  We're hoping our son will be more cooperative for pictures by his 3rd birthday and then we'll give Kiddie Kandids a shot. Here is a link to my son's photos and you can tell which ones were done by JCPenney.  All of them were at JCPenney from 12 mo & up but so were his 6 & 10 month pictures.", 10437, "gk4z8fp2aa", 0],

I started it because I was depressed quite a bit and didn't feel comfortable sharing such personal feelings with anyone but I didn't want to keep them inside, either. I found it ironic that my childhood diary filled with mostly nonsense, had a lock on it, but my adult journal filled with much more personal, disturbing thoughts, was left open for anyone to see. I have to admit that it helped quite a bit, and whenever i'm feeling down, i pull out my journal and write down whatever is on my mind. It's nice being able to get it all out and not worrying that im going to be judged for it (unless somebody finds my journals, but if they read it and get freaked out, thats their fault, not mine). ....I'm 25 and I adore my journals.", 10436, "d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa", 0],
