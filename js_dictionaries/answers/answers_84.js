What melts the wires is a factor of the current drawn and its resistance, generating heat (in direct proportion to power). A normal extension cord is a type of \"resistor\" with low losses at ordinary current (load), but can quickly heat up and deteriorate at high loads that exceed the designed ampacity of the conductors and their ability to transfer the heat away quickly enough to protect the integrity of the insulation and sheath.", 702, "VjgqZetcaa", 0],
