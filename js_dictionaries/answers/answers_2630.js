M.D.s are supposed to care for the patient's health, while insurance companies provide payments but act in the interest of the company (revenues matter most). You may feel that M.D.s (the doctors) hesitate to pay for alternative treatments.  M.D.s are waiting for good scientific data for these treatments before they prescribe them.  Good data comes from independent (not funded by large pharmaceutical/equipment companies) \"random controlled trials\".  Anecdotal data (\"I know a guy who...\") is just not good science. Insurance companies are balancing effectiveness of the treatment with the cost.  If a treatment is 30% effective but costs $1000 AND is not necessary (life-saving/life-prolonging), then they won't pay for it.  If a treatment is 80% effective, costs $100 and is medically necessary, they are more likely to pay for it.  There are plenty of other statistical computations they do before they decide to pay.  In general, the company is trying to minimize *their* cost (thus maximize their profits). The good news is that the National Institutes of Health has a relatively new division   that studies alternative treatments.  Good science will be applied to old but untested remedies.  M.D.s will be able to prescribe these methods, comfortable with the fact that they have good science behind them.  Sham treatments will be exposed as useless, and will not harm the patients who use them (by harming them directly or by delaying effective treatment).", 11352, "44e876f5820ec4940e919b4fd10ef2c0aa", 0],
	137325 : ["I think that some insurance companies are starting to realize that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  *starting* being the operative word, lol.  I think many insurance companies see pain relief as optional and not necessary to keep someone alive.  Sustaining life and sustaining a quality of life is something insurance companies and healthcare organizations need to seriously think about. Chronic pain has really been horribly under treated and JAHCO has tried to face this, and pain is now a vital sign that needs to be treated.  Unfortunately, many places just don't enforce it well enough.  There are some places that have pain free policies, and even wear cute little buttons, but still may not relieve pain adequately.  I sincerely hope that this is a trend that will continue to show medical professionals and care centers that pain is subjective and absolutely positively needs to be treated. Autoimmune diseases run in my family, and chronic pain management is a huge issue with us.  We get so tired of healthcare professionals having modern and up to date medical knowledge, yet still have antequated ideas about pain relief.  I understand that they do have to weed out people who are drug seeking for recreational useage, but is it really worth keeping someone who most likely is on the edge of their rope, just barely holding on suffering?  I absolutely do not think so.   As far as alternative therapies, there are many pain clinics that keep their patients using only those methods and not pain medicine.  My mother was sent for biofeedback and aromatherapy treatments, and they were covered by her insurance.  We found that a combination of alternative therapies and western medicine was a good fit for her.   In no way am I bashing healthcare professionals, heck, I am one.  Policies and attitudes about chronic pain and pain management need to change.  That is just the bottom line.", 11352, "Fl3zUQjWaa", -1],

The kids are using their knowledge of phonics to sound out words the best they can and write down their ideas. The best suggestion I can give you is to work in your child's classroom if at all possible. This will give you a better idea of your child's abilities, where she fits in academically with the other kids, and what the teacher expects of the kids. The teacher may say, yes the other kids can do this and you are thinking they are writing perfectly spelled and punctuated sentences when they really are doing the same as your child. I was extremely concerned about how my daughter would fare in school as she started out with speech and language delays. Working in the classroom put many of my fears to rest as I saw that there were some kids way ahead of her but there were also kids way behind her.  If you still are concerned, arrange a meeting with the teacher so you can be clear on the expectations and get a better idea of where your child fits in. If your child is not making progress, go to Pupil Services in your district and request an evaluation of your child to determine if there are any special needs. Try to work with the teacher and the school, and by all means get her signed up for after school help if it is available. Good luck!", 11353, "4bcdb6352b37bed4a709920e29df85c0aa", 0],

Terribly wrong as far as I'm concerned.  I live in Texas and my child was being taught to pass the taaks test, rather than being taught what she needed to know.  The teachers actually admitted this.  The taaks test is to prove how well the school is doing, not to test my child independently.  I was so frustrated at this, I've pulled my child from public schools and now she's doing home schooling.  If it's possible for you to do, this might be something for you to consider.  There are homeschooling groups just about everywhere and many times the parents get the children together and rotate which parent will be teaching on different days.

LOOK into what the World Trade Organization is trying to do with medicine. Better for us.... Physical therapy has its place but is geared to force rather than relax the muscle into submission. Pain can be referred from places other than the head. This deals with headaches but the principle works for all kinds of pain.  Muscles get knots called trigger points. These make the muscles tight causing them to press on nerves and other thing. #1 The first thing is to take a couple swigs of molasses or eat a couple of bananas. They contain magnisium and potassium both of which muscles need. #2 WATER she should be drinking 1/2 gallon minimum. The head of neurology at UCDavis likens a body running low on water to a car running low on oil (the engine can seize). Get a good (deep tissue) massage (to loosen the trigger points) on the back, shoulders and neck. Make sure to press up at the base of the skull where it meets the spine. You rub or lightly scratch everywhere on your head. You will hit spots that are tender these are trigger points. The idea is to rub across them 6-12 times per session up to six times per day until they go away. For more information on trigger points read The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Davies.

We buy things we know they will want at sales throughout the year which add up.  This year for example we are getting my son a tool bench that has all the tools.  This will be the big item for him.  We got it half off and only had to spend $25 on it this summer.  That is our big item for him.  My daughter loves the toy kitchen at a friends house and we ended up getting it on sale for $45.  That is going to be her big item.  The rest are small things like cars, animal figurines, puzzles,  etc.  We try not to give them too much at   time and try and spread it out more throughout the year so they can appreciate/enjoy it more. I think it does get more expensive as they age.  Mainly because they no longer want cheap toys.

I'm positive my brother and I were more expensive as younger kids, because we didn't really understand money or what things cost, and our father would usually get what we asked for. As we got older (tweens and teens) and understood it, we would talk in private before gift shopping time and agreed between the two of us to just ask for smaller things, since by that time we had younger siblings too, and thought the big-ticket items should go to them rather than us, since we had allowance and money from working.
