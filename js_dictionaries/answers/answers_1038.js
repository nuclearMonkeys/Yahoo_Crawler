	57387 : ["There is a hell of a lot of evidence for this in hospitals. There was quite a famous case about a patient who died on the operating table as many people do. She could feel herself leave her body and rise to the ceiling. there was a high metal cabinet there and she could describe things that were on the top of the cabinet even though nothing could be seen from her bed. She felt herself rise higher until she was outside of the hospital and looking down on the flat roof. She saw a single blue trainer (not sure about colour) lying on its side with long laces. Later a caretaker was asked to check and sure enough, there was the trainer exactly as the patient had said. Other people have seen things and could repeat conversations between doctors and nurses even though they were braindead at the time. Nothing at all showing up on the monitors. That suggests that the mind was intact and working outside of the body or if you like, outside of the brain. A thought of my own was, what if we are already somewhere else, and interacting from that place with the brain, that in turn makes our body do our bidding. Inside a remote control car there is a brain or electronic circuit. With a controller, we talk to that brain in the car and it makes the steering and and motors respond to do our bidding even though we are far away. Same thing may be happening with us. We may have never left some other place. EDIT! NG, there has been a vast advancement in your lifetime. We now have computers, ghost boxes, EMF meters, and a whole host of other equipment to help us know more about paranormal. If people refuse to accept these tools, then that is the reason why it may seem to you that there has been no advancement in your lifetime. If there are people who refuse to accept spades, picks, wood, bricks and cement, you will find that they also have not advanced and still live in the cave. Our senses can be easily beaten by a mangy moggy yet they are the preferred tools of the denialist. No wonder they are retarded rather than advanced when it comes to paranormal. Our eyes are ok for our everyday use but we get nothing for nothing from nature. As far as organic eyes go, our eyes are crap. It would be easy for invisible creatures to live with us as we see in a very small portion of the spectrum. That is a fact. Go shine a UV torch down the freshly washed gleaming white toilet and it will no longer be white but will show yellow patches of bacteria all over. Shine an infrared light into your eyes and you will see nothing. That is how good the denialists paranormal tools are so no wonder you think the world is the same old same old every day. Turn your head away from the paranormal and your primitive eyes will not have to contend with it.  As for your retarded question, I did not put anything in with anything. Read the answer and stop looking for a niche to get your grubby little fingers into. I mentioned computers and ghost boxes as tools to help us with the paranormal. Computers are used to filter out unwanted sounds for a start. Would you like to argue about the colour of the computer? Yes NG, you are wrong again. Stop picking fault because you got your @ss smacked again and grow up. No froth and no beer. One last thing NG, if you don't mind, could you also show me the link of me telling people I hit my wife if it is not too much trouble. You might see her when you come here and she might rip your fecking head off for that one. As for your own wife NG, she fecked off from you? Wonder why? Maybe your version of being a nice guy was not hers? Just like magic people, that link is never ever going to appear.  Oh! EG is on to me, I better make something up quick. Yes people this is the sad little man who claims to be a nice guy??? Just like Dr Harold Shipman. Look at the way you treat first timers or long stayers with every post. Even now. But for some reason, you are trying to kid people that you are the Q&A ambassador. For some reason, not only do you want to fool all these people NG but you think you can fool me? I have an excellent memory NG, I remember my first post and the neg mocking from you and the paedo plus little Gary, not that he matters as I knew he would fall asleep. You started this but with the wrong person. I can not abide a fool NG. I don't need links because I, plus you plus everyone on site saw her talking about an eleven year olds vagina and if she used a vibrator. They saw her destroy a 12 year olds birthday with a comment about her father who had just died days earlier. We all saw her mock a 15 year old boy and laugh at him because he just lost his mum. You SAW this yourself NG but again, you never passed comment. As for being effeminate, The last thing I need is links. What man would run around putting silly TD's because a bad man hurt his little feelings? If a man acted like that in person???? Boy would he be sore. \"Oh! Look, the bad man swore again.\" If you act like a Nancy, you will be treat like a Nancy, so again, no links needed. Actually you may find witnesses on another site because a lot of folk left here because of you and your paedo pal who also admitted that she is only here for the comradery, or did you not see that either? Now, can I see the link where I came here and announced that I beat my wife? As I said ladies and gentlemen, No link. Why, Because it only happened in NG's lying imagination. He is only trying to discredit me, hoping to cover his own wrong doing. Just because he needed the paedo's friendship to give him a hand when his victims turned on him.
