	57040 : ["I think the Autism is HUGELY responsible for why your brother still can't feed himself correctly. He needs to be retested, because it's possible that his symptoms may have increased since he was first diagnosed or identified as a person with Autism. If so, he needs to be in therapy (such as CBT) which will help him learn in ways that he can manage and which are adapted to his particular level of functioning.  NO, this is NOT HIS FAULT, nor is it his mother's fault. People with Autism disorders are NOT RESPONSIBLE for their disabilities. They DON'T ASK to be born with them. I'm mildly Autistic myself, and I can imagine what your brother must be going through, especially at his age. Think about what life was like for YOU when you were his age, and then put yourself in HIS SHOES and ask yourself if YOU'D want to be treated the way he has been treated by almost everyone around him. Autism has NOTHING TO DO with a lack of discipline. I'm only mildly affected myself, but I had a step parent who thought the same thing that your family does about your brother about me, and used that as an excuse to nearly kill me more than once while I was growing up. And he justified his actions by saying that he was trying to \"train\" me. I almost died- and worse, I was left with psychological wounds that will NEVER HEAL completely,no matter how long I live or where I travel in life. Your family's mistreatment of your brother is undoubtedly causing him the same kind of pain, but he evidently isn't verbal enough to be able to say anything about it. I feel for him, I really do. You need to do everything you can to PROTECT your brother- because he needs your help, and he needs an advocate. People with Autism often have issues with coordination and fine motor skills, and it's not uncommon for them to have issues with sensory integration as well. That's because their brains are wired differently than those of neurotypical people. If per chance your brother has an intellectual disability in addition to Autism (and yes, ID and Autism can and do occur together) then that might also help explain his inability to follow directions and to grasp simple concepts like how to hold a fork or a spoon. This is NOT a disciplinary issue. It's a MEDICAL issue. Your brother has a disability.", 7934, "None", 1],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and SeraphimofSarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 7935, "None", 0],
