	53384 : ["It is sort of dumb but I'm guessing even though you're a teenager and your body is still going through changes that you're legally adult now because 18 is the magic number for adulthood. I guess it's because you graduate high school at 18 normally so they decided to make that the legal adult age. But what really doesn't make any sense is how you can be an adult at 18 but can't buy liquor or Tobacco until you're 21. I'm 20 I should be able to buy alcohol alone but i guess Ill have to wait 2 more months until my birthday because the law makes so much sense!   ", 7467, "8aclMQCPaa", 0],

Some of these can be fatal if they are left untreated, so it's in your best interest to see a doctor as soon as you can. Meanwhile, because of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, I wouldn't go to a slumber party right now. You can use that as your excuse, you know- and no one will be any the wiser about your situation. Just tell your friends that you and your parents are worried about possibly transmitting the virus from one house to another, and that because of this, you will stay home for now. You can also mention that when the pandemic ends and it's safe, then you'll be eager to participate. That will give you time to get this investigated and yourself cleared medically- and no one else needs to know about it other than you and your folks (and your doctor, of course).

	53418 : ["The problem here is you are trying to be his \"friend\", and not his parent! Play time is over, you need to stop giving him a platform, rules are set, and if he disobeys them, consquences will swiftly follow. Toys- He is given to the count of 3 to put the toy away on his own, otherwise you take the toy from him, and he doesn't get it back until a certain period of time and if/when conditions are met. School- If he refuses to get dressed? He's given 5 minutes to change out of his PJ's and into school clothes, otherwise he is physically escorted to school in the car in his pjs and that is what he wears for the day. I can assure you if he shows up in his pjs, his peers will heavily mock him, and he will quickly learn to put his clothes on and be ready for school at the normal time. Homework- If he puts up a fight about not getting it done? He stays up until a certain point, anything not done/or with errors not fixed, gets submitted to his teacher and he gets a failing grade on the assignment. Once the failing grades start piling up, he will face the threat of being held back a year, this will make him smarten the **** up, because the last thing he wants is to be a year behind from the rest of his friends. If he wants to play the \"I have a sore stomach\" game, he's put in the car and driven to the doctors, the doctor will then expose him for faking, and from there he faces consequences at home.

Since he will refuse, get a trash bag and start cleaning it. throw out pretty much everything other then the bed, school work, what clothing you allow him to keep and what he needs to do school work If he throws a fit tell him you did say to clean the room and what would happen if he didn't If he won't do his home work then he has to sit at the table until its done or its bed time.

	53420 : ["Not necessarily.  Older to be sure, but maturity is more a matter of behavior than it is of chronological age.  We would hope the 14 yo has learned to behave in a more adult way and therefore be more mature than the 13 yo because of that extra year of age.  But it doesn't always work that way. And here's another plug of tobacco to put in your peace pipe...girls generally mature earlier in life than boys.  There are always exceptions, but in general if that 13 yo is a girl and the 14 yo is a boy, the 13 yo will act more mature.", 7449, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", 2],
