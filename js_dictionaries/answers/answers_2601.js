However I do have some of todays country singers in my collection( Blake Shelton,Gary Allan,Billy Curington,Joe Nichols,Trace Adkins.Brad Paisley,Miranda Lambert....) these have a certain feel to the songs they sing which sound like the country music I am a fan of. But like any artist these and some of the \"traditional/classic\" singers would have a song I don't care for, but that is their choice.  As for Taylor,Lady A , and 90% of todays singers they are more POP than country compared to the country music I am a fan of.Their songs just do not have a country feel or heart. They gear their music for a young audience and loose the older fans. Not everybody wants to hear about a highschool love gone wrong(hell most of us lived that in the 60's and 70's ) . We hear a beautiful melody and tune but then the singer starts talking about smoking some illegal substance and how good they feel( Cheech and Chong did that in the 70's).  Sure a lot of older country songs talked about drinking, but it also told a story of life. It had heart , soul, and warmth that is missing from todays songs.Today watch an artist jump off a bus run into the venue finish run out jump back on the bus .Other that a half way grin and a hand being thrown up very few react with the fans ( yes I read about how there are actions with fans by todays artist but we are talking on a daily concert bases).  So is todays country music country, my answer is yes. It is a \"Progressive-Alternative country\". It is aimed for a young crowd.   Todays country misses the mark as \"Traditional/Classic\" country music.", 11300, "9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa", 0],

	135903 : ["I started collecting Country & Western Music (as it was then called) records in the late 1950s, during the heyday of Honky Tonk and Western Swing. Within a few years, the music started to change. Jim Reeves, Patsy Cline, George Morgan, Eddy Arnold,  Ray Price, Ferlin Husky, all were drawn into \"The Nashville Sound\", which completely changed their music. It became reminiscent of Ray Charles's \"Modern Sounds In Country And Western Music\" and nearly re-routed my taste to 1960s R & B. Fortunately there were others who were still performing Country Music as it should be performed, so I was still able to build up a collection of the music I love. We had the advent of \"The Bakersfield Sound\" from artists like Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Rose Maddox, Wynn Stewart, and Tommy Collins. Many other artists moved the way of \"Countrypolitan\" and \"Country Soul\" in the 1970s, around which time \"The Outlaw\" movement started. Since then we have had \"Americana\", \"Alternative Country\", \"Cowpunk\", \"New Traditionalist\", \"Texas Country\" and the dreaded \"New Country (called pop-country)\".  Yes, Country Music is always changing, but the traditional sound which the likes of myself and blakree advocate is ALWAYS lurking amongst all of these different sub-genres. There are some amazing examples which come to light on a regular basis in the pages of youtube. Just browse and you will find it!", 11300, "None", 0],

The Coast Guard shall be a service in the Department of Homeland Security, except when operating as a service in the Navy. ”  Coast Guard organization and operation is as set forth in Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations. On February 25, 2003, the Coast Guard was placed under the Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard reports directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security. However, under 14 U.S.C. § 3 as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when Congress so directs in the declaration, or when the President directs, the Coast Guard operates under the Department of Defense as a service in the Department of the Navy. 14 U.S.C. § 2 authorizes the Coast Guard to enforce federal law, which is futher defined in 14 U.S.C. § 89. Further, the Coast Guard is exempt from and not subject to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act which restrict the law enforcement activities of the other four military services within United States territory.", 11301, "tnOCQXg5aa", 5],
