	96684 : ["I am so sick of people crying racism about the stereotyping of different ethnic groups in comedy and animation. Comedy is all about poking fun at people, and and exaggerating physical and social characteristics. People forget that when Amos and Andy was on radio and TV, the comedy aside, Amos and Andy were portrayed in the form of black society of the day. Just as white society was different in those days. They don't go around saying things like \"golly\", \"gee, that's swell\" etc, etc anymore. Another show of that day, \"The Honeymooners\" stereotyped the working poor of New York City of the day. I don't seeing anyone getting offended. \"Leave it to Beaver\" stereotyped the life of a kid of the day living in suburbia. Is anyone offended that Theodore was square and naive?  I am extremely offended that modern releases of the Tom and Jerry theatrical cartoons edit out Mammy Two Shoes. She was a normal black housewife of the day that those shorts were made. Because I am a middle aged working class man of eastern european decent, should I be offended by Elmer Fudd's exagerated features and accent?  Should people of the southwest be offended by Yosemite Sam? Should seniors be offended by Tweety Bird's owner \"Granny\"? It's really funny how the \"black shows\" of today stereotype typical blacks of the region where the show is ment to take place, but because they now are written and produced by blacks supposedly makes it ok? Comedy and Cartoons came to be to make fun of anyone and anything. People need to stop waving the freakin' race card all the time and learn to get along. xx", 9591, "a67ded244a677cdde3260927d40c3e74aa", 5],

I would not want to live with my parents. I think this is wrong because it is not being a mature resonsible adult who can take care of themselves. I mature person does not want to live with parents.

There is nothing at all wrong with living on your own, and nothing wrong with living with your parents.  the elderly couple who live next door to us have their son, his wife, and their baby grandson living with them, and they all seem to be perfectly happy with the arrangement.

In Winter, if its miserable outside and people can see that through the windows then you may have to set it at 24-25 to keep people happy. On the other hand if they can see sunshine outside even if its cold out, then you can drop it to 20-23 and not get too many complaints.  Temperature to feel comfortable at depends on people's perceptions and expectations as well as how they are dressed, the type of activity going on as well as the actual temperature.
