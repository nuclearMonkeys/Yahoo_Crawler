	129076 : ["In my opinion, John Cena vs. Umaga, Last Man Standing, at the Royal Rumble is the match of the year thus far. Admittedly, it was fairly predictable to see Cena coming out of it, albeit not as predictable as Trips winning, and anyone who says that the Cena vs. Umaga match itself was predictable is biased, as Cena strays far from his \"5 moves of doom lol\" and creates a great in-ring story in which he doesn't reverse Umaga's moves or overpowers him, he just gets the hell out of the way and takes advantage of key points to win the match. An epic match with a great story and exciting and original finish that left both men over as hell with the fans, definitely better than the Trips vs. Umaga match.", 11006, "WAGAcLPMaa", 4],

	129078 : ["It is not illogical. Raising the tax for the rich can be a measure to more evenly redistribute the wealth of a country.

	129079 : ["Lets all sit back and permit all the illegals in the country including all the terrorists.  These are the results..... At your expense, that is TAXES....you will be providing free health care for them.... While they work and pay no taxes. They send their money home (and I don't mean the United States). Mexico takes a cut of the money.  It is a win win situation with permitting the illegals in this country.  Let's not forget the Mexican government provides them with maps and kits to ensure there success in coming across. This country should be for all who desire to succeed but take a number and get to the back of the line like the rest of the world.   As for the terrorists, let them blow-up the united states since we will not agree to convert to Islam.  Oh, by the way don't put up your arms and ask the military to protect you because your taxes are now paying for the illegal immigrants. Mark Foley is only one person who does not represent all of the Republican Party. Check history out.  Discover all the perverts that have been in office both Democrats and Republican.

Clinton, the Pervert Rapist extraordanaire. he gets serviced by an intern in the oval office, gropes countless other women not his wife, rapes quite a few other interns and other women, lies repeatedly to the supreme court and to America, and Democrats hail him as their Hereo! 'nuff said. I dont see him being such an all fired hero when he shakes the hand of the murderer of countless innocent people, Yassir Arafat. Is it brave to shake hands with the biggest man on the playing field at that time? i think not. is it brave to stand up for the little guy (which you Dems claim to do) namely, Israel. Israel is at such a disadvantage in this little war (if youv'e ever seen a map) you'd think the \"compassionate\"  Dems would rush to Israel's Defense. instead, Bush did, who was the only one with big enough balls to go after the terrorosts who attacked us on 9/11. and all liberals can do is stand around and sing kumbaya? So who exactly is the brave guy? Kofi Anan? Nancy Pelosi? give me a break, and go back to singing kumbaya, and let the brave men and women  of the army do your dirty work and keep your democracy safe from terrorist invaders. how do you sleep at night?", 11007, "None", -3],

I'm not sure if this is all men and women; some indicate that this is among the American population.  The high profile cases have given sociopaths a considerable negative reputation.  And you could argue that this is deserved.  But also consider this.  Most are not predisposed to military-type service, as they tend to be rebellious by definition, but the small percentage that can adapt tend to be invaluable to their trade.  These men (usually) kill without remorse and prove to be great special operatives.  History proves them to be invaluable in times of crisis.", 11020, "cfzfQU7daa", 1],

If clinton had done it right, instead of a stupid missle attack, sent in the troops the way we have done now, you partison hacks would be all on board defending his actions.  let's talk about gay pedophile congressmen! when your party has a sex scandal, including one of your own haveing sex with a 17 year old boy,  and including ones who's boyfriend's run gay brothels out of their homes, you applaud them, you let them chair comittees.  No you can't see your own hipocracy! Why? because you have been brainwashed into thinking if someone else is sucessfull, they take away from you. IT's CRAP! If i write a book, and get rich from it, who benefited besides me? the employees at the paper company, the employees at the printing shop, the employees at the bookstore chain, the employees at the gas station tht you spent money at to get to the bookstore to get my book.

All because your are brainwashed into thinking you have a \"right' to a middle class existance. You have no such right. You have to get up off of your *** and earn it.

Anyone breaking the law deserves to be killed,  we must protect the law abiding citizens of this country.    And I believe just as many liberals abuse women. And as far as obese,   the majortiy of blacks and hispanics (I read this, so don't call me racist) are overweight and we know that the majority of them aren't Republicans.

I think it is certain that life exists but I am a bit skeptical about visitation because i myself have never seen a UFO or alien but can you say that the 11milllion people in the US alone that claim to have seen a UFO that couldn't have been from Earth because of it's capabilities or seen an alien or had some kind of abduction take place are lying? Stephen Hawking said last year that If Humanity was ever contacted by an alien species it would not end well because it is likely that they have used up all their resources on their own planet and have come to take ours, by force. So I believe they exist, I think at the moment i am 40% sure they probably have visited us to survey what capabilities we have but I think contacting another species, when we have no idea how they would react, if they would view humanity as a threat is very risky.", 11021, "CY9dFpNZaa", 0],
