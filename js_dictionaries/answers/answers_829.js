	46052 : ["It's an honest and noble sacrifice.  Plus... I imagine not being able to see the meat one is eating would get worrisome after awhile.  Think about how worried yourself or other people can get when you can't see what people are doing to your food when preparing it and how it plays with your head, now imagine that all the time for everything.  I imagine giving up meat and other foods would be quite easy if unable to see them.", 6584, "TB5ZQPOnaa", 0],

Otherwise, they just reabsorb back into tissues or turn into stones. Going vegetarian or vegan often a start of a deeper cleanse of the body. Smoothies, green juices... etc only do half the job until it bumps into accumulated toxins stored in tissues. Some examples are: heavy metals, hormones from food, any other synthetic hormones, toxins from vaccines, toxins from medical drugs, toxins from cigarettes and so on. Next make sure you drink enough water. Dehydration causes problems in gallbladder.  And you can always normalize your metabolism with a help of different herbs and supplements.  And don't let this information to scare you because the longer toxins accumliate in tissues, the higher the chances of it turning into something else like tumors, cancer.  Remember to exercise, reduce stress, get sunlight, read and understand labels on your food, cut down on sugar, caffeine, gluten, questionable dairy.", 6585, "lAGatG40aa", 1],
	46054 : ["I too am alarmed by this trend in vegan bandwagoners.  The best way to confront them, in reality, is to see if they've read Peter Singer's Animal Liberation. If they haven't read that ever so basic bit of philosophy they aren't (a) intelligent; or (b) a vegan. Ergo, they are not worth your time.  Ignore the philistines casting stones, Phil.  Stay strong, spiritually. ", 6586, "CVuub4Wlaa", -4],

And I would never force her on to a vegan diet (not even vegetarian). I'm a straight man, and I also am a meat eater. I won't even go vegetarian or vegan.

Everybody is going to die one day, regardless of whether or not they eat meat. If someone claimed that so-called breatharianism saved people's lives, I would call them a bold-faced liar. There's no such thing as breatharianism in practice. In reality, it is starvation. And there's rumors that there's documented cases in which people have died because of going \"breatharian\". Veganism may not be quite as bad as breatharianism, but veganism is still pretty bad. The best diet is a normal, omnivorous diet which includes the following: 2 to 3 servings per day of milk and dairy 2 to 3 servings per day of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts 3 to 5 servings per day of vegetables 2 to 4 servings per day of fruit 6 to 11 servings per day of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta According to the Bible, those who command people to abstain from eating meat have given heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. They speak lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron. Don't just take my word for it. Get a King James Bible, and read 1 Timothy 4:1-6.

You have already established that you like toast, and want it quickly, and you often burn the toast because you leave it in the oven too long. So, you already have your answer.

At Subway, go for a salad with meat, same drink deal. Taco Bell has power bowls that are healthy, low fat and tasty. I like the beef.

	46081 : ["Not determined. Veganism has only been semi-popular in larger numbers for about 10 years, and it takes a good 30 to 40 years to assess longevity from dietary changes.  Yes, vegans have been round for a long time. But since SO many factors influence longevity, you have to have a HUGE sample size to account for all the confounding factors. You also have to screen out the meat eaters who do not eat enough vegetables (half your plate should be veggies) as well as screening out both groups (vegans and meat-eaters) who eat junk food, those who have inherited health disorders, and those who smoke, drink too much, have too much stress in their life, and who don't exercise enough.   You are going to end up with a much smaller sample once you start screening out those sub-groups.", 6565, "None", 1],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 6591, "None", -1],
