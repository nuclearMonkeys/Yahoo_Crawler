	67228 : ["The myth about social security is that it exists to accommodate the needs of the people.  This is now, and has always been untrue.  Ensuring that all people have access to at least some money is the brainchild of a politician whose only interest was seeing that the roller-coaster boom-recession cycle of the capitalist system didn't drive millions into death by starvation when the recession hit it's lowest point.  How can an economy recover if there's nobody left to do the work?  How would businesses survive if their former consumers were left unable to buy anything whenever they were unable to work?  How can capitalism survive if people see how it actually works? They tax the people to give those without money the ability to keep those in work actually in work.   All around the planet, major political parties express views and policies that will cause enormous harm to the economy of their respective countries.  I'm afraid that the majority of humans are too fantastically ignorant to understand that accommodating the rich in society doesn't automatically promise prosperity for the economy.  The trickle of the trickle-down theory isn't sufficiently strong to even have a minor beneficial impact upon the economy.  The Thatcher government pursued a hit-the-poor and give-everything-to-the-rich political agenda for eleven years: before he Conservative party actually sacked her.  The whole planet is on the verge of the biggest recession that it has ever had, as a consequence of her government's actions: they were mimicked all around the world!   Big recessions lead to global warfare.  Ergo Thatcher is the cause of the soon to arrive world war three. I am genuinely saddened by the belief that the \"news\" media - which rarely tells us the truth - holds such influence over the human race that few people will even consider what I have just said.", 8418, "vPeNKLK7aa", -1],
