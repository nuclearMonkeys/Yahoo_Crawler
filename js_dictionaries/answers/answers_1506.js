JKD has good foot works for ppl with good learning skills. KM - attackers understands your 'boxer' style stance JKD - attackers does not understand your stance Comment : Its the darnest thing for a beginner to make a attacker sense his movements. In most cases a eastern stance always makes attackers to take second thoughts to attack or not KM - Learner is made ready for the bad outcome and instilled to fight on JKD - Learner is still in the eastern martial fighting doctrines - drop downs, standing, kicking-punching are like phases Comment: KM learners are made to learn in the flow of fight and use of combination to defend and attack, continue till one tills stands and the other falls ;-). Other trainers tend to use each scenario in a phased manner giving time between each problem...this is not a real life situation.

	80982 : ["Although most crocodilians have an undeserved reputation of being maneaters, the saltwater crocodile is an extremely agressive crocodile that besides animals will target humans as well. The name \"saltwater crocodile\" would give the false impression of being save from these animals in freshwater. Don't be mistaken: saltwater crocodiles live in the seas around Australia and Papua New Guinea and in the freshwater creeks,lakes and billabongs in those areas too. A saltwater crocodile is (as are all crocodiles) quite lazy and will mostly try a sneak-attack, using the element of suprise combined with brute strength. This however does not mean they just lie still until some unlucky animal wanders in their mouths! \"Salties\" (the nickname Australians give them) are also known to use their tales and smashing the victime in the water so they can easier continue the attack and commence the death-rol. This animal is so agressive that they will even attack boates and canoes. It's also known to leap from the water to attack unaware wanderers among the shore. A saltwater crocodile will attack in the following circumstances:     * If it's irritated it will get angry and attack fiercly! Don't provocate them! Salties are very territorial and trespassing won't be tolerated by them either.     * In mating-season: when mating the saltwater crocodiles will be on their guard for rivals and are extremely easy to irritate!     * If an opportunity presents itself: It's a very lazy crocodile and won't pass the chance of an easy victime like pets and people walking closely aside the river. Limbs hanging outside the boat or an unaware swimmer will almost certainly encounter the crocodile. A hungry saltwater crocodile won't say no to a tasty human!     * Like all animals, if it's wounded it will become very agressive and defensive. They are not easy to wound as their back is protected by scales and they are well equiped to defend theirselves. With only eachother and humans capable of wounding them they are a very dominant species (an important reason why their population is increasing again).     * Like all crocodiles, a female saltwater crocodile will stop at nothing to defend her nest!     * Never feed a (saltwater) crocodile! One day a crocodile might encounter another boat with people and will expect to be fed, and if not fed it may just take what he thinks is rightfully his..  A crocodile attack can be prevented if you follow the basicrules from this link:  When your unfortunate enough to encounter a (saltwater) crocodile maybe these tips will save you life:  For some reported saltwater crocodile attacks click this link: ", 9049, "None", 1],
	80983 : ["I used to live in Australia, Queensland. Where most of the saltwater crocodiles live, but I'm no expert. They may be called saltwater crocodiles but they spend most of their lives in freshwater rivers. They only go to the sea a couple of times a year. My advice is to swim where the locals swim, away from estuaries. Salties can be massive, if your attacked by one of a significant size then you are dead. You can poke their eyes, hit them with sticks or scream and shout as much as you like. Your still dead.  Don't worry about it. It never happens. Most crocodile attacks are in fresh water.", 9049, "LBHQkBnkaa", 0],
	80984 : ["Well, Via Sifu Paul Vunak Jeet Kune Do (under the named Executive Progressive Fighting systems) is taught to the Navy SEALS who are the military's elite. Jeet Kune Do is all about self defense and self preservation, but Paul's version is more of a \"street orient\" version of JKD placing high regard to elbows, knees and headbutts.
