	124438 : ["It is more likely that it is the fault of your cable co. or the local channels, rather than your TV. First thing you should do it have the TV re-scan for all channels. To do that look in the instructions for your TV or use the TV's on-screen menus. Then, If you have over-the-air TV with an antenna (not cable): make sure that the regular network channels in your area (ABC, NBC, CBS, etc...) come in on the channel numbers for your area. If they do, then the infomercials are extra channels you can ignore. Or if you have cable: you need to find out what cable channels you are supposed to be getting on which channel numbers, and if you are getting those, then once again, you can ignore infomercials on extra channels. Once you have done the above, assuming you are getting the channels you are supposed to get, you probably can program your TV or cable box to skip or delete the channels that are always just informercials. To do that you'll need to check the instructions for your TV or cable box since it's different for each brand, or look in the on-screen menu for your TV or cable box.", 10788, "FqrKjtzwaa", 0],

Girls with wider hips have bigger thigh gaps (obvs) but if your narrow like me, you will need to lose weight and tone up to acheive this. I eat 1200-1500 cals per day and aim to burn around 200 of these through exercise. For defined legs, running/walking is best. I also do ballet workouts as they elongate the leg muscles and target more muscles than ordinary squats and lunges. The DVD Im using at the minute is Element: Ballet Conditiong by Elise Gulan. Its great but I'll warn you its pretty tough! I don't know why people are so anti-thigh gap, if you want one get one, don't listen to anyone else. And thats it! Good luck.", 10792, "jGxV84M2aa", 1],

My thigh gap is usually about two inches wide at the crotch (even wider whenever I am extra skinny!!!). A thigh gap is not common. Very few of my girlfriends had a thigh gap. My heavyset (fat) girlfriends (most were shorter, bigger and stronger than me!!!) certainly did not have a thigh gap. Believe it or not, I didn't do any kind of work to get my thigh gap.

Don't be so naive AMERICA, the US government doesn't care about safety; do you think a government that care about safety would have their whole southern border so DAMN WIDE OPEN for anyone who wanted to bring anything into this country could?
