Some months my babies will be OK but others it seems the shots wear off faster than others and I can only get their shots every 30 days.   But on those months where the shot wears off faster my pugs chew on their knuckles and lick constantly on their feet.   what i do when i see that happening is take them and give them both baths and wash carefully between their toes and their pads with sensitive skin shampoo.  the medicated kind.  it re-leaves their itchiness.   I then take them to get their shots as soon as I can.   just be careful because it sounds like she has licked and chewed them raw which is something that they will do if they are itching.   also put neosporin on their until you can get to the vet.", 11138, "nXPSAMsaaa", 0],

I understand why it was started as well, and just like many other things in science, people have found a new use for it. Before my husband and I ever got pregnant or decided to have a baby we had actually talked about this. I wanted a girl, and we really only want 1 child. Why not get what we want the 1st time around, provide the best life that we can for that child and be happy? Not to say that we wouldn't have been happy with a boy, but really if you have your heart set on 1 gender, it can be hard to come to terms that you are having the other. Luckily when we got pregnant, we had a little girl. I couldn't be more happy, and to me just by getting what we wanted made me a happier person. Now granted I wouldn't pick what color eyes/ hair and such as that. That to me didn't make a difference, and it still doesn't.  And your right you could change your mind about it in 10-15 years when you find someone and are ready to have a child. And at the point in time you will have to look at this and say \"am I ok with this\" and if your not address things then.

It isn't the concept that Americans should be able to afford to own a home that is at fault.

	132286 : ["No one can argue against the fact that the U.S., because of our free-market \"ownership\" society, has fostered inventions, medical breakthroughs, scientific discovery, engineering innovation, and modern communication technology to name a few, at a rate which astronomically exceeds any other nation in the world throughout history. If you want to argue that point, simply produce examples. How many medical break-throughs did Communist Russia produce since it was concieved? When was the last time you used a technological device made in Cuba or Myanmar?  This is all to the credit of the political and economic climate which exists under a free-market system which provides incentives for private individuals to go above and beyond what is needed to survive. (China by the way, though they call themselves communist, in reality is more of a free-market society and has very few elements left of a true communist system.) What people need to realize is that every Communist government that has EVER existed has had an average life of about 40 years. This is because Communism's #1 flaw is that its principle assumes all people desire to be equal and by good faith alone, will hold everything in a common ownership. Humans by nature are selfish, and rightfully so. Example: In society, you have to have trash collectors, and you have to have doctors. Under a true Communist system, the Doctor cannot be paid more than the trash collector, and both are only entitled to and equal share of resources.  Now, is it fair that the Doctor had to spend 10 years in school; studying, toiling, worrying about grades, working hard to become profficient in a highly technically involved skill and must be on call on the weekends and holidays: but still is by law entitled to NO MORE than the man who did not attend school past 10th grade, who does not have to work holidays and weekends, who did not have to read and practice and be graded on being profficient at any skill?  What incentive then, would there be to put forth the effort to become a doctor, when you have the option to not even complete High School while recieving the same salary, benefits, etc? The truth is, without reward or incentive the idealistic good faith or moral responsibility alone will never provide for achievement and success required to maintain any society. This is why Communism DOES NOT AND NEVER WILL WORK. Communism is not only dangerous because of its instability, but what makes it most lethal is its appeal to ignorant and/or disadvantaged people. Fueled by jealousy and hatred for success, Socialism and Communism work not to help better the lives of the poor and uneducated, but to force those in higher social strata to lower themselves to meet the standards held by the most pathetic citizens in a society.", 11136, "oOUmH0Uyaa", 1],
