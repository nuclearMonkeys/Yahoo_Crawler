	55813 : ["There are no real differences between the brains of Black and White people. Modern-type humans evolved in Africa between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. Around 80,000 years ago some of those humans left Africa and spread out in Eurasia where they adapted to local conditions and developed physiologically into the various non-African races. Contrary to what creationist CRR says, Darwin did NOT believe that Blacks are mentally inferior to Whites. Creationists typically misrepresent what Darwin said about the inevitable European expansion into Africa and overwhelming the Blacks there. Here is what Darwin said about the races in his Descent of Man: \"Although the existing races of man differ in many respects, as in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, &c., yet if their whole organisation be taken into consideration they are found to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points. Many of these points are of so unimportant or of so singular a nature, that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races. The same remark holds good with equal or greater force with respect to the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the Beagle, with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded n e g r o with whom I happened once to be intimate.\" Does that sound like someone who believed that blacks are inferior?
