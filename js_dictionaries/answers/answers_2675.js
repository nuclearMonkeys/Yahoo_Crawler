Once you get the Holy Spirit, you are able to understand the Bible with His help.

Anyway maybe God answers prayers for people even if they are into a different form of religion because he loves us that much. Most of the time when people pray they need something really bad and God knows that and answers the prayer regardless of the person religious preference.

	139598 : ["I'm not christian, so from an outside perspective, the question reminded me of Greek mythology, where all of the Gods have different duties, but are all flawed in some way, some are hot-tempered, some are easily swayed etc. None of them is perfect, they are all flawed in quite human ways. I see this as being a kind of example - we can learn from the mistakes of others, as well as ourselves. It also kind of makes them more approachable. A perfect deity would be quite intimidating to me, but one who has weaknesses and flaws, likes and dislikes is more human, and somehow more likeable.  Jesus was human for a time, and as the saying goes, 'to err is human'. If somebody as influential as Jesus could be tempted, it's not the end of the world if we average joes are, as long as we recognise our weaknesses. Once we recognise our own failings, we can work to improve ourselves and be our best.", 11434, "eC6uNG3baa", 0],

When you pray... he hears you... and forgives you for all your wrong doing... makes you clean again... All you need to do is let Jesus into your life... let him take over your worries, fears... he'll be your friend forever.

What do strong feeling represent, sexual, emotional-- first love,  When people are together perhaps with the intentions of pursuing a relationship, having fun is a good start, similar interests and of course looking forward to the next encounter.

When he says that he is hoping that you are doing some soul searching about your relationship I imagine that it means that he wants you to think about how things are, how they have been, and where they are going. This is probably what he is thinking about. You are both at a point in your lives where things are moving very quickly forward, and it is time to evaluate what you want out of life.

	139625 : ["This is a really good kind of question and it shows that you have a seeking heart.   You are right, the Son of the divine Trinity is indeed God.  Yet, in His Godhead, whenever God wants to contact man and be among man, He does so in the Person of the Son. For the first time in history, God the Son was \" born ' of a woman, taking on genuine humanity. As \" Jesus\" the Lord had to face the enemy and be tempted in every way that we were.  So that today sister, when we come before the Lord, praying about our situations, even of being tempted, this Lord is able to genuinely know what you are going through and He knows how to minister His strength and supply to you, to overcome that temptation. He had to be touched with every feeling of our infirmities and tempted in all points like we were, yet this One did not sin. He went ahead of us sis, and faced down satan and came out victoriously, not just as God, but as a genuine Man.. as the Son of Man. And sis, He had to do it as a Man too. He set the stage for us, telling us that if He could do it, then He can come into us when we believed into Him and do it again. God allowed this temptation to show us how to deal with satan. The Lord subdued the devil, which means accuser and slanderer, but using the Living Word.  This word proceeded out of His mouth with authority and with confidence.   Today, we too need to take the time to learn the Word of God. Even a verse a week is good and not hard, but by storing up the word in our hearts, it gives us the means to shut satan up and this word also serves as a supply to strengthen our spirits. I like this verse in the bible that shares that the evil one satan, found NOTHING in the Lord. No matter how much satan tempted, tried to mock, influence or defeat the Lord, the Lord came through and He did it for you and I.  That we too will not be bullied by satan.  1 John 4:4 You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. John 16:33 These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In this world you have affliction, but take courage, I have overcome the world. 1 John 5:19  We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one. So sister, praise the Lord, He was tried, tested and came out true. Satan found nothing in the Lord.  So today, we can have such boldness in all that Christ has done for us.  When satan tries to tempt and seduce us away from the Lord, we take the pattern of our Living Christ and speak the word. Gird our minds with the helmet of salvation and take up the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God by praying. How truly blessed we are. Grace be with you sister your sis sandy", 11434, "ctOge9SLaa", 3],
	139626 : ["The first Adam was tempted by Satan, and he failed. It was only fair then that Jesus, the 2nd Adam would also be tempted by Satan. But of course, Jesus didn't fail. However, Satan never knew who Jesus really was, and when he couldn't get Jesus to sin, he arranged for his minions to crucify him. Since absolutely no one has the power or the authority to take the life of a sinless man, let alone the only begotten Son of God, the moment Jesus died, Satan's dominion over the earth was ended. God raised Jesus up from the dead, made Jesus the new head of all mankind, and Satan has been a fugitive on the earth ever since, awaiting Judgment Day like all the rest of us.", 11434, "None", 2],
