The lightbulb was invented by Swan AND Edison, but Edison got the patent in first. The first successful modern car was invented by a Karl Benz (a German), Trevithic (British) invented the first viable steam powered car. Charles Babbage (British) was the first to create a mechanical calculator, the Antasoff-Berry computer (US) was again more of a calculator, it could only do one thing. The first 100% electonic, programable computer was Colossus, built in the UK in 1943. There are many inventors of the aeroplane - Cayley (British) invented the first passenger carrying glider, John Stringfellow (British) created the first powered model plane, Clement Ader (French) invented the first powered passenger powered plane, and the Wright brothers invented the first controllable one. The internet was also invented by many people, both the US military and CERN (in Europe) played key roles in its development. The radio could perhaps be said to have been invented in America, although it was done by Tesla, who was a Serb - and Marconi (Italian) was doing similar things at the same time. Logie Baird invented the first broadcasting television, but Farmsworth was the one who created the first 100% electronic TV.  Perhaps you should get some facts straight. America did not invent the 20th century.", 8765, "27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa", 5],
	74204 : ["That's just bizarre. I've lived most of my life in Great Britain, in various parts of the island (in Wales, England and Scotland) and I've never heard any British person refer to themselves as North American. I can only assume you've either met an unrepresentative sample of Brits, or that they were pulling your leg. The only way it even makes sense is if by North American, they just mean \"culturally closer to North America than to the rest of Europe\", but that's clearly not the same thing. Britain is culturally closer to Germany than to Saudi Arabia, but we're not German. Edit: The history of invention is complicated, and very few of the examples you give are at all purely American. The world's first working television system was invented by John Logie Baird, who was Scottish. It was only the first completely electronic television that was invented by an American (Philo Farnsworth). It's very hard to say who specifically invented the internet. It was the result of much collaboration. Certainly its forerunners were specifically located in the US, but the people involved in its development were from both sides of the Atlantic.  As for the other inventions: the lightbulb was invented in Britain, although the kind we use now is closer to a later American version. The car was invented by Europeans (though not Brits); Ford simply introduced assembly lines. Computers of one sort or another were invented by all sorts of people, and were certainly not an American invention (although Americans were involved). Two of the most important names — Charles Babbage and Alan Turing — were Brits, for example. Von Neumann was Hungarian-American. It was a German who discovered how to produce and receive radio waves, and the first workable commercial radio was invented by an Italian; although it was a Serbian-American who first demonstrated its feasibility. Of the inventions you mention, only the plane really has much claim to being a purely American invention (although, even then, the first self-powered aircraft was invented by an Englishman).", 8765, "e77321da1ccb8c6435c70fd1482cd10faa", 9],

Whereas John Terry is slow, over-rated and a bit immature especially for an older guy. Gibbs for Baines. This one SHOULD be self-explanatory. Lennon out, Rodwell in. Lennon is quick, but his final ball is poor if you ask me, too poor for top level football. Rodwell has been unlucky with injuries and what-not. But anyone who watches him can see he has obvious talent. Abgonlahor out, Defoe in. He is not consistent, but when he plays well, he punishes defenders. Abgonlahor is inexperienced and young. Not to mention he hasn't really proven he can set any team on fire. Defoe has, rare though it may be. Carroll out, Sturridge in.

	74245 : ["Gee, why don't we look at some answers, and maybe that might shed some light on Israeli actions. \"Stop complaining about Israel's actions. The minute the Palestinians stop lobbing bombs over on Israel's side then real peace talks can begin. As for building settlements, Israel gave the Palestinians more land then they've ever had and even their own country and what did they get for it? More suicide bombings!!! If you ask me Israel isn't the problem, the Arabs are.  And don't give me any guff about how the poor Palestinians were kicked out of their homes. The Palestinians sided with Hitler during WWII. IMHO it is their own fault they lost land. That's what usually happens to people who lose wars. Ask the Germans.\" Where to start? Well one thing, there are more acts of violence AGAINST the Palestinians in the West Bank then BY them. Israel has always stated that when  the Palestinians address the security concerns then they'll talk, by and large they have (in the West Bank). Another, Palestinians DID NOT side with Hitler. There were a couple of brigades of Palestinians that fought on the side of the British. While WWII was going on, Zionist terrorist attacks were increased, while Palestinian were nonexistent. The Zionist Underground went so far as to propose an alliance with Nazi Germany! I guess either the poster didn't know that or is purposely distorting facts and inventing...my guess is the latter. And innocent civilians are allowed to return to their homes after the war, whether their government won or loss. \"Firstly it's not Palestinian territory but dispute territory. and accordingly is subject to negotiations. Those who claim that all the West Bank is palestinian are trying to presume the results of final status talks before they've even begun.\" This is almost too easy. If it IS disputed territory, then I guess you're saying the land ceded to Israel and to a Palestinian state by UN181 is invalid. The territory was annexed by Jordan and accepted de facto by the rest of the world. The territory was NEVER accepted as annexed (and Israel has never claimed it to be the case) and Jordan legally ceded its claim to the PLO in 1988. The territories are not in dispute. UN 446 is very specific about naming Israel as an OCCUPYING force and that settlements are ILLEGAL- even in Jerusalem. While it is a foregone conclusion that Israel will be ceded parts of the West Bank, until they do ALL OF IT is OCCUPIED TERRITORY as opposed to \"disputed\" territory. This is by International Law, the UN Charter and UN Security Council. Territory acquired by force is not recognized. \"There has never been an independent Palestinian state.\" There has never been an Israel \"Jewish\" state either. So just because a state didn't exist in the past, precludes it from EVER existing? Can't argue with that...so when can the British expect their North American colonies back? Oh and Australia too. \"3. Most of those \"settlements\" are built on land that is either Jewish owned private property or government owned property. The reason there were no Jews there in 1967 was because Arabs ethnically cleansed the Jews out of there in 1948. \" Really?So the 94% of both Israel AND occupied territories that WASN'T owned can revert back to Palestinian ownership? Oh and the reason why there are no Jews in the West Bank is because they didn't settle there, they wanted the prime land in the north and close to the port of Haifa. Less then 1% of the West Bank population was Jewish. THIS is how Israel can get away with the settlements; people are either purposefully misleading others or themselves misled by the TRUE nature of the history and current situation.", 8768, "IAHW9xbjaa", -4],
