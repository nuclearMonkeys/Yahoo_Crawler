	141451 : ["My freshman year I did a project that involved a Wildflower Investigation. When done properly, it makes for a great project that is super impressive. You should make a collection of 20 or so wildflowers. All specimens are to be properly pressed, dried, and then mounted on individual pages. You should classify these specimens to at least the genus level. Assign a number to each plant as you collect it. Record date, location, and the plant number in a logbook. You should also record overall plant height and flower diameter in this logbook. Make the information neat and orderly. Take photographs of the plowers and mount it with the dried specimen. Specimens can be easily dried and pressed by placing them between pieces of blotting paper and pressing them under a stack of books. You may need to also replace the blotting paper several times to prevent mildew. Newspaper also works well. Be sure to arrange your specimen in the way you wish it to dry. You should include the leaves and stem with the flower. Mount the specimens on heavy grade orange or red paper using a small amount of glue. Place this pages into a photo album or binder. Format: - Number each flower, one per page (1-20). - Collection date and location in the upper left hand corner. - Common name written above the specimen. - Genus (and species) name below the specimen. Remember to underline the Genus and species name. Be sure to include a cover page and table of contents. There are excellent books in libraries to help with identification of flowers. Turn in a logbook with the wildflowers.", 11507, "FHYbIcQjaa", 0],

Dark brown thin hair doesnt look bad.  2.) Dark hair wont really make your hair look thicker if you have thin hair to begin with.

I would recommend that you couple that with safe browsing habits, a fully patched operating system and programs, and use common sense.  You get what you pay for.
