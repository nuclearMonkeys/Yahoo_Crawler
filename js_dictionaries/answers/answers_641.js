	35858 : ["It has already happened in the past, just last year Patrick Day died after suffering brain trauma in a boxing match. The other fighter won't be charged with anything unless he was intentionally trying to cause serious harm or kill his opponent.", 5390, "HSkNW8djaa", 0],
	35859 : ["There will be an enquiry into the facts and circumstance of the case.  And you could be charged with unintentional manslaughter.  From there it is up to the courts. Peace.", 5390, "5W57wPnYaa", 1],

	35864 : ["Mayweather said his own self he carefully chose fights and at the right time. He lost the first fight to Castillo clearly. He also had a close fight with a last prime De La Hoya who would've beaten Floyd in his prime.", 5392, "None", 1],
	35865 : ["Well he clearly lost to Jose Castillo in their first showdown but the judges gave him the decision.  It was so bad he had to give Castillo a rematch. Apart from that he was just a tremendous boxer.  He didn't have another fight that I don't agree that he won and so if I were the judge he would be 49-1.  Aside from his great boxing ability and ring IQ he also helped bolster his record with wins against fighters that had no business in the ring with him.  Andre Berto and Conor McGregor quickly come to mind. Circa 09-10 I'm gonna say Floyd because Roy was past it and Floyd wasn't but there isn't any weight class that they could both be in at that point.", 5392, "psOmJErtaa", 2],
	35866 : ["He is a very clever boxer both inside the ring and out. His technique was as close to perfection as you can get, but his boxing brain was phenomenal. His ability to analyse an opponent, find their flaws and exploit them was second to none. Also one thing i think was underrated, he didn't fight round to round. He had the long game in mind. A lot of fighters i see go out to win each round. Floyd didn't mind losing a round if it meant benefitting him in the long run.He also had a habit of fighting the better fighters at the right time. Prime Roy Jones beats him purely on the weight advantage. But Mayweather was the better fighter.", 5392, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	35870 : ["Clenching should be treated like a technical knockout. The minute the person starts clenching the count begins if it reaches 10. It's a technical knockout against him. And if the person clenches more the nine times during the fight it should be treated as a technical knockout.", 5385, "zRPRphYsaa", 0],
	35871 : ["I didn't know him. But I think about how he must have suffered. You call for your momma and ask for a breath. I can never forget that.", 5382, "vSQIqCGeaa", 0],
	35872 : ["Absolutely not. LeBron and the Lakers won this trade. Can we go back a little in history? This is the Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce trade, part 2. The Nets will regret this trade for a decade. With Kyrie Irving being goofy, this is DOA. Harden is a soloist, not a team player. which is why CP3, Russell Westbrook didn't want to play with him.  DOA, LeBron fan. I love it. Let me give you Kyrie. He was on First Take with Steven A. and Skip. They convinced him that he led LeBron to the championship and that he was the MVP. LeBron led the series in ever statistic category. Crucial block and free throws. So Kyrie feels that he's better than LeBron. He just took a shot at LeBron over the last shot. So now, wait for it, he's a SOCIAL ACTIVIST. He's competing with LeBron as an activist. He wasn't in the bubble but he thought that the players shouldn't play. Of course, he was against LeBron. Patrick Beverly said if the King says we are balling, we ballin'. Steven A. now has the nerve to say that Kyrie should retire. He and Skip created this fool. But from Boston to the Nets, no team with Kyrie on it wins, because he brings them down. This is DOA.", 5401, "1edb7e285e1837d108c2caf03520c8bbaa", -1],

	35879 : ["I hope he does and I also hope that is Mike Tyson you're talking about. Floyd vs. Logan is an exhibition fight that won't have a winner. It will be called a draw leaving the verdict to the audience. Floyd would be generous to Logan but not Mike Tyson. Mike will put him in his proper place that will make him and his bro stop these nonsense.", 5403, "SXlrQGnJaa", 0],
