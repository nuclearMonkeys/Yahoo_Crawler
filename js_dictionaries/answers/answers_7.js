	358 : ["Yes it can for a short period of time until it heats up to the core temp of the processor after that it does no good. A heat sink has fins to radiate heat to the air and a fan to blow air across the fins. There is a complex calculation to determine the size and shape of the heat sink. The uP is attached to the sink with special Heat Sink Grease to move the heat to the sink efficiently. the grease is a very thin film between the uP & Sink. A much larger sink will cool more but it will also take up much more room inside the case. A solid block will be much worse. try it with a temp monitor program and watch the heat rise very quickly. You can make an infinite heat sink by using a block of solid silver and making the length 10 times the area if the uP attachment. very large and very expensive. The attachment between them should be Diamond film.", 66, "a8pRDaIyaa", 0],

I took the gamble of no vaccine and if I have compromised my ¬†health and/or die sooner because of that, I guess that's just the way it goes. Nothing is guaranteed in life is it? At least I can say I had control over my decisions and didn't let somebody else make them for me even if the consequences aren't the best. For some reason that makes me feel better to be honest. I've had a lifetime full of being f cked over by doctors and psychiatrists and their poison health-destroying drugs and surgeries to ever want to place myself in a position where I submit to their incompetence and profit motives and end up getting totally messed up by all of that as I already have in the past.
