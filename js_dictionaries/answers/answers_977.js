Lot of poetry eventually results in an exercise  of fine sounding phrases  that sendup with so many stanzas that the overall finished open ends up as a technical exercise which says nothing very intelligently and leaves the reader wondering what the Hell it was all about anyway.   It's not supposed to be like that you know. Music is a form of poetry where the music paints the mood, and you provide  the  picture.  If music can achieve the desired effect with ease, its a puzzle why poetry cannot do the same considering that it has the advantage  of language  to play with.  The reason in my humble opinion is that poetry concentrates so much on the 'construction of the poetry' that it starts to disregard what it was try to relate which eventually ends up as meaningless nonsense.  Technical nonsense  is not very inspiring if simply viewed as a forhulea .", 7583, "JW2C4KG1aa", 0],

	54331 : ["I have no problem whatsoever with a coach making an inattentive player run some laps in front of the squad at practice.  I hope her fragile self-esteem isn't permanently traumatized, but in a team sport setting, sometimes a little humiliation is a great tool for making a point.    I know in this day and age of the \"participation ribbon culture,\" I suppose \"woke\" parents would expect the coach to sit down with Princess after practice and \"have a dialog\" about what coach can do to make his players \"more engaged\" at practice. However, discipline is necessary to succeed in sports, and the last thing a coach should have to worry about is whether or not his/her players are paying attention in practice.  She is a 17-year old young woman, not some 5-year old checking out the dandelions in the outfield at a t-ball game.  I think it's time she should be expected to be attentive at practice. Look, if she can't pay attention during practice, how can a coach trust her to exert the necessary effort and mental discipline during a match? Proper response?  Do NOT confront the coach about this, and do NOT ***** to the school or school board.  DO tell you daughter to pay attention and give a 100% effort in practice.  And if she is the one who is put out over this (as opposed to you), tell her to grow tf up, develop some thick skin and get over herself.  The coach is not there to be her BFF...he/she is there to coach and teach skill to his/her players.  And by the time you reach high school, \"everybody is special\" time is over, and he/she is expected to prepare the team to WIN (I know that's such a dirty word among Snowflake parents these days) which is the whole point of a volleyball match at the high school level to begin with.

	54346 : ["“God\" is really nothing more than a conceptual label. God is a word that every human being can individually fill with personal meaning. For some, God is the \"big guy in the sky.\" For others, God is nothing more than a fairytale. As for myself, I resonate with the words of Rev. Dr. Cynthia Bourgeault, in that God entails a more mystical quality of life. She states that “God is all over the place. . . . God is the web, the energy, the space, the light ... revealed in that singular, vast net of relationships that animates everything that is.”(1) We know that which is God, not in logical conceptual reasoning, but in feeling and experiencing God in ourselves, in others, and in all creation.   The word God is like a finger pointing to the moon. It is a tool of the conceptual mind to help us actualize that which is beyond our conceptual understanding. The Benedictine monk Fr. Thomas Keating writes about this fact as well, saying that \"whatever we say about God is more unlike God than saying nothing. If we do say something, it can only be a pointer toward the Mystery that can never be articulated in words.”(2) No human language can truly describe God. In fact, we know God best in silence, when we are settled in inner stillness and free from the confines of conceptuality. It is in that silence that we see how God points to the ultimate truth of reality, to the divine nature of all created phenomena that is far beyond what our limited thinking minds can possibly know.   In the words of Lao Tzu, as written in the very first verse of the Tao Te Ching, \"The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The NAMELESS is the origin of Heaven and Earth.”(3) The original conception of Tao was simply the observation that reality has a certain way about it. This \"way\" encompasses all of existence: life, the universe — everything! Lao Tzu continues:  “Look at it, it cannot be seen. It is called colorless. Listen to it, it cannot be heard. It is called noiseless. Reach for it, it cannot be held. It is called formless. … [It] is the wonder of all things. … I do not know its name. Identifying it, I call it Tao … eternally nameless.”(4)  Both concepts of God and Tao point to this \"nameless\" way of reality. We cannot see it, hear it, nor touch it because it is metaphysical in nature. Because it has no physical manifestations, it cannot be detected by any of our five sense perceptions. Therefore, tangible proof does not exist, and no words can truly name or describe it. We can only feel and observe its effects in our personal lived experiences. In fact, our very existence is a physical expression written in the universal language of this nameless way that can be called by so many names. I know the Bible is not proof of God, but it can be a lens that guides us to explore who or what God truly is. According to the Scriptures, God is . . .  Exodus 3:14 -- God is \"Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh\" Translated most commonly as \"I Am who I Am\" or \"I Will Be who I Will Be.\" The meaning of this verse implies that \"my nature is evident in my actions.\" This description of God is derived from the Hebrew tetragrammaton YHVH (pronounced yod-hey-vav-hey), which is a combination of the verbs HVH and HYH, meaning \"to be.\" Thus, grammatically, YHVH means \"He who is\" or \"He who will be,\" or perhaps more likely, \"He who causes things to be.\" In other words, God is not a noun. God is not a person, place, or thing. God is a verb! God is Be-ing itself. (5)   Deuteronomy 33:27 — “God is your refuge\" Psalm 46:1 — “God is our refuge & strength”   Psalm 73:26 NRSV — “God is the strength of my heart\"  The two Hebrew nouns m'onah and machaseh are translated as “refuge.” They also mean dwelling, habitation, or shelter. God is wherever we find ourselves dwelling, which is none other than the present moment. As Joshua 1:9 states, “God is with you wherever you go.\" God is always with us because the present moment is always with us -- sheltering and protecting us, right here, right now, in every aspect of our experience. … The two Hebrew words translated as \"strength\" are tzur and oz. Tzur literally means rock, as in a rock cliff, but metaphorically it means the rock of God. Oz implies that which is our personal strength. Thus God can be found wherever we experience strength in our lives. Psalm 115:3 — “God is in the heavens”   The Hebrew word translated as heavens is shamayim, defined as the visible heavens — sky, atmosphere, stars, visible universe, etc.; the abode of God. In the Hebrew Scriptures, God is often referred to as \"El Shaddai,\" meaning “God Almighty” or God of the Awe-inspiring. Contemplating the immensity and vastness of the entire cosmos, or simply looking up at the moon on a clear starry night, can give us a deep sense of awe. It is in this felt sense of awe-inspiring awesomeness that we can experience the true power of God (cf. Rom 1:20; Ps 104). John 4:24 — \"God is Spirit\"   Spirit is the translation of the Greek noun pneuma, which is defined as \"the vital principal by which the body is animated\", in other words the breath. God is the life giving air that we breathe each and every moment.   Romans 14:17 — “God is . . . goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Sprit”   1 Corinthians 14:33 — “God is . . . peace”   Peace is the translation of the Greek noun eirēnē, \"an internal sense of well-being\". In the words of St. Paul, “God's peace . . . exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds” (Phil 4:7). Even Paul recognized God's ineffable nature that transcends all words and logical understanding. Yet, he still felt and knew the God that is profound peace and well-being.    1 John 1:5 — “God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.”   Phōs is the Greek noun for light. It is a metaphor for the \"Light of Christ\" that dwells in all of us (Col 3:11). \"God is light\" reflects a Hebrew background where \"light\" symbolizes knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. It points to the naturally pure and luminous quality of our hearts and minds.   1 John 4:16 NRSV — \"God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them.\"   Greek noun, agapē: affection, good will, love, benevolence. When feelings and sensations of love are present, then God is present. The more love that is present in the world, the more God will also be present with all of us.   Thank you so much for taking the time to read this essay. I hope it's a valid answer that encourages you to examine how you personally define and relate with the word “God.” I hope it helps you look at how you perceive others who believe or disbelieve in God. The word “God” is REAL. The way people relate to “God” is REAL. The definitions people associate with the word “God” are REAL. Thus, it is my personal belief that to know God as God truly is, we must possess the ability to let go of those definitions and associations. If we can do this, then we will be able to deeply tune into the “nameless way\" of existence. We will feel and know that which can be called \"God.\"   Thanks for the question. May God's strength, spirit, peace, light, and love be forever and always with you :)  [ References ] (1) Cynthia Bourgeault, The Wisdom Way of Knowing (San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2003), 46.   (2) Thomas Keating, Manifesting God (New York, NY: Lantern Books, 2005), 1 (3) Derek Lin, Tao Te Ching: Annotated & Explained, 5th ed.

And he always answered: - I believe in the God of Spinoza. Baruch de Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher considered one of the great rationalists of 17th century philosophy, along with Descartes. (Spinoza) : God would say: Stop praying. What I want you to do is go out into the world and enjoy your life. I want you to sing, have fun and enjoy everything I've made for you. Stop going into those dark, cold temples that you built yourself and saying they are my house. My house is in the mountains, in the woods, rivers, lakes, beaches. That's where I live and there I express my love for you. Stop blaming me for your miserable life; I never told you there was anything wrong with you or that you were a sinner, or that your sexuality was a bad thing. Sex is a gift I have given you and with which you can express your love, your ecstasy, your joy. So don't blame me for everything they made you believe. Stop reading alleged sacred scriptures that have nothing to do with me. If you can't read me in a sunrise, in a landscape, in the look of your friends, in your son's eyes... ➤ you will find me in no book! Stop asking me \"will you tell me how to do my job?\" Stop being so scared of me. I do not judge you or criticize you, nor get angry, or bothered. I am pure love. Stop asking for forgiveness, there's nothing to forgive. If I made you... I filled you with passions, limitations, pleasures, feelings, needs, inconsistencies... free will. How can I blame you if you respond to something I put in you? How can I punish you for being the way you are, if I'm the one who made you? Do you think I could create a place to burn all my children who behave badly for the rest of eternity? What kind of god would do that? Respect your peers and don't do what you don't want for yourself. All I ask is that you pay attention in your life, that alertness is your guide. My beloved, this life is not a test, not a step on the way, not a rehearsal, nor a prelude to paradise. This life is the only thing here and now and it is all you need. I have set you absolutely free, no prizes or punishments, no sins or virtues, no one carries a marker, no one keeps a record. You are absolutely free to create in your life. Heaven or hell. ➤ I can't tell you if there's anything after this life but I can give you a tip. Live as if there is not. As if this is your only chance to enjoy, to love, to exist. So, if there's nothing after, then you will have enjoyed the opportunity I gave you. And if there is, rest assured that I won't ask if you behaved right or wrong, I'll ask. Did you like it? Did you have fun? What did you enjoy the most? What did you learn?... Stop believing in me; believing is assuming, guessing, imagining. I don't want you to believe in me, I want you to believe in you. I want you to feel me in you when you kiss your beloved, when you tuck in your little girl, when you caress your dog, when you bathe in the sea. Stop praising me, what kind of egomaniac God do you think I am? I'm bored being praised. I'm tired of being thanked. Feeling grateful? Prove it by taking care of yourself, your health, your relationships, the world. Express your joy! That's the way to praise me. Stop complicating things and repeating as a parakeet what you've been taught about me. What do you need more miracles for? So many explanations? The only thing for sure is that you are here, that you are alive, that this world is full of wonders. - Spinoza ~", 7590, "iVldlCyEaa", 0],

Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs; stay away from cats [Athanasius III of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (hemisphere); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse.

Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us.

Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails.

Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't using chemtrails; they're also in gov't food and medicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of aborted fetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human flesh is in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging, anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-12 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse, Chrtistians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos Virgin Mary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyes scan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. Gabriel Urgebadze said that they do it on index finger when they scan your finger. Basically, try to avoid new documents at all cost. Police will microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, green mark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you; burn documents because they're from Satan. The Most Holy Trinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. Social Security Number). People who die with these Satanic documents go to concentration camp in hell to await Final Judgement; once the BEAST Computer is burned down, souls will be released for Final Judgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceased relatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristian names given during antibaptism by the beast system; or just burn these documents because gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from half a millennium ago describes Final Judgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had little boards (plastic cards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year [at midnight September 18-19 and similarly on November 20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they are rescued if they're in hell] (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell. It's a big sin to remember the dead with wreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're in hell with their hands tied up behind their back while hanging by their hands), meat, alcohol, sweets, and worldly music. Demons print icons of saints in newspapers so that you throw these newspapers in the trash blaspheming these saints. Crosses on soles of shoes and back of pants are blasphemy. Demons make carpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walk on crosses. Playing cards mock how Jesus suffered on the cross: clubs (cross on which Jesus was crucified), diamonds (four nails Jesus was crucified with), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesus was given to drink),spades (spear with which Jesus was pierced).Cremation is devil worship; only blasphemers such as Lenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this.After China attacks Russia, Ruski Orthodox Tsar (shown by resurrected Seraphim of Sarov) will come to power in Russia;this Tsar will slay traitors inside church and gov't; as a result, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism = 263 heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same Supreme Being [aka the devil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on their heads in hell. Arkhimandrite Antonin Kapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, Ein Karem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; Patriarch Kirill of Russia and Mark of Berlin blessed this church in 2007. When priests pray for current gov't (instead of praying for future Tsar),Jesus gets up from His throne and turns His back to them. Forgive me.", 7689, "None", 0],
	54373 : ["Gov't is killing you with high frequency electricity.Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are 40 demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on 7 meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for 1 year = 5 aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of tight pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell for until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chipped using IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs; stay away from cats [Athanasius III of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (hemisphere); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flour from mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm) because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher].
