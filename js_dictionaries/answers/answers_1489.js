	80145 : ["I agree with your mom 100%. I came to the point of hating Jennifer and wishing every week that she would fall flat on her face and break her ******* mouth... How can people not see how she was playing the sympathy card and how conceited she became? Does anybody remember her after her jive? She never stayed humble.. Another thing that the idiot people who fell for her phoniness failed to see or notice is when she was crying when she heard the 1st song \"These arms of Mine\". She claims it brought back memories of her and Patrick and how she was so overwhelmed that he was gone but yet she herself said she didn't maintain contact after the movie. So what the F***?   I also agree with Molls 100%. I wanted Bristol & Mark to win because that competition is about people like Bristol. People who come in with no experience and improve each week and Bristol did improve.. As for those who say she is not a star that can be debatable.. She may not be overly famous but she does have fame like it or not. People know who she is.. People recognize her. She deserved to be on that show and to me she deserved to be in the final. One of the things I loved most about Bristol is that she was humble and thankful through the whole season. It never got to her head that she was being saved like it did with Jennifer and even Brandy. And one last thing Jennifer had dancing experience. Lot's of it actually. It isn't fair how they put her in with Bristol and most of the cast.. She was the judges favorite since day 1. In conclusion: I HATE JENNIFER A THE WINNER, I AGREE WITH YOUR MOM AND I WISH THE FINAL 2 WOULD HAVE BEEN KYLE AND BRISTOL. THEY ARE WHAT DANCING WITH THE STARS IS ALL ABOUT! ** Oh and by the way, I was a HUGE Dirty Dancing/ Jennifer Grey fan.", 9016, "qmY9Nuxkaa", 0],

How is that fair to the other contestants who are not already professional dancers? Isn't that what the show was suppose to be about, people who didn't have professional dance training and they learned while on the show? Kyle had the whole package. He was very likable with a great personality, funny, entertaining, and he became a great little chubby dancer lol. Jennifer was the judges favorite from the very beginning. That was so obvious. I think they just bloated Bristol's ego b/c of who her mama is. They know that she was not that good. Her shimmy outfit tonight did more dancing than she did lol. And she didn't even work that! Did you see Mel B when she was on? Now she worked the heck out of those shimmy outfits and so did Nicole S. They could really dance!", 9016, "Ossomrplaa", -3],
