	22535 : ["The culture of North America is influenced by European culture, but it is also modified by experiences in the \"New World\". Add to that the large level in immigration of non-European peoples and those cultures add another element which differentiates places like the US from Europe proper. People in the US are usually perceived as pretty friendly. Perhaps, that had its roots in the frontier, stay by yourself and ignore your neighbor could result in your early death by disease or starvation. It paid to be friendly. Having a neighbor come by to help nurse your sick spouse back to health and tend to your younger children while you worked the fields, with the help of the older children, and while you worked the neighbor's fields as well, had practical benefits. Much of that has lingered, especially in the country's interior.Â  You mention Southeastern Europe and yes, the cultures of each have a very different feel. The US absorbed many people from Eastern and Southern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries and they brought elements of those cultures with them. One thing which is very interesting about the US is that ideas, practices and especially foods once thought \"ethnic\" can be absorbed into the larger culture (100 years ago, the only people in the US who ate pizza on a regular basis were Italian immigrants. The only people who ate bagels were Jewish). Now many of these things are nearly universal in the US-based culture. I would say what is European-American is really a blending of many areas of Europe into US culture. You can still find Polish areas, Greek areas, Italian areas, Romanian areas, and so on, but these tend to be older communities and many of its younger members have relocated to more typical US communities which are not as ethnically defined.Â  An interesting note, we are experiencing a similar immigration and integration process among people outside of Europe in the US with people from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The process resembles what the diverse group of Europeans contributed in the 19th and early 20th centuries.Â ", 3633, "3d68ef0e8dcae25d5140a521c017da71aa", 0],

European Americans in history started the country, led and ran the country without challenge (1776-to date). We today makeup all the 'blue' states of the NE, Central Atlantic coast, the Midwest interior through the Great Lakes, Virginia on the Atlantic coast and all the entire west Pacific Coast, California, Oregon, Washington). Since (1890-1923) we were joined with immigrants from south and east Europe...Italians/ Polish/ Greeks and others whose cultures merged with ours.
