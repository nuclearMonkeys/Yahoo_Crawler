These add up to 52 cm. 6k + 4k + 3k = 52 13k = 52 k = 4 The sides are therefore: 6k → 6(4) = 24 cm 4k → 4(4) = 16 cm 3k → 3(4) = 12 cm Note: We could have kept the numbers as fractions and you could have still gotten the same answer. Let the sides be ½x, ⅓x and ¼x respectively. ½x + ⅓x + ¼x = 52 (½ + ⅓ + ¼)x = 52 (6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12)x = 52 (13/12)x = 52 x = 52*(12/13) x = 52/13 * 12 x = 4*12 x = 48 So the sides are: ½x → 48/2 = 24 cm ⅓x → 48/3 = 16 cm ¼x → 48/4 = 12 cm I just like working with integers rather than fractions which is why I multiplied it all by 12 at the beginning.

The majority of planets will of course be lifeless  People have proof other planets exist ; but they don't have proof that there's life on them (or they aren't letting on). But it is almost certain life will be - and has been - found on some other planets ; even by humans Because humans are a relatively young species, inhabitants of some other planets will have a HUGE lead over us. They WILL HAVE detected life elsewhere - from a distance OR travelling -; and some will be able to travel to that planet. Of course, it'll be easier if the other planet is in the same star system. You could also get an alien or human race avoiding - and perhaps denying the existence of - another too-powerful, unfriendly race ; and trying to find a similar, more friendly one If you believe aliens are visiting Earth - and many people do - then these aliens etc. are coming from either another planet / from another dimension / or from another time. These travellers are almost NEVER in difficulty - they control the situation PERFECTLY -; which is another reason why they're disbelieved. Aliens' technology will also be unbelievable : humans can only think of going to Mars and in a straight line We only have accounts of extraterrestrial spaceships in space, in the solar system and on Earth. If these accounts are true - and I believe some are -, the spaceships would be piloted and pilotless. Therefore, if the spaceships were proved to be true : aliens existed or still exist.

	4922 : ["\"If\" there is life on other planets (and that is a very bif \"if\") then it is so rare that there will be none within a thousand light years of us. There is no evidence of any stable planetary systems within that range, and we already know that the parameters required for life to exist are very tight and require long term stability. We already know enough about the laws of physics in the universe to know that it is not possible to travel the trillions and trillions of miles between stars, No amount of \"technology\" is ever going to change that. Technology depends on tha laws of physics. It does not circumvent them. Technology is a very wide field, and although some forms of technology such as medical are in their infancy, all the technologies relevant to flight through outer space have now reached maturity. In other words we have all the technology there is. No other fanciful species however far and however old will have significantly more than we have. So yes, since we know that he laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe, and because we have already fully exploited those laws applicable to spaceflight, we can say with certainty that nobody else (who might or might not exist) is any further advanced than we are. The fact that there is no sober evidence of space aliens visiting Earth is consistent with this conclusion.
