Pinky toes are accessories.   5) Having your team change their logo to a rooster.  Only a few people will recognize me.  6) Finding out that you're 2 years older than you really think you are.

I guess I'm drinking Boones Farm....I prefer strawberry hill. 3. The Salt Lake Wings has a ring to it. 4. I don't use that toe, bring on the Cup. 5. I'll pick it and even eat it on camera before I would want a damn rooster on the Wings sweaters. 6. I'll take the losses. 7.

	107969 : ["I'm very sorry to read that you lost your father.   At times in my life, I've asked myself the same questions that you have -- I lost my father when I was 11 years old.  He was only 37.   After many years, it finally dawned on me that I was not alone in my suffering and loss.   Christ was there too, and so was His blessed Mother.   Both of them also experienced suffering and loss. Jesus and His mother Mary saw a lot of pain and loss in their own lives and in the lives of those around them.   For Jesus, this was one of the consequences of His sharing in our humanity -- along with everything else, He shared in our suffering and loss, and indeed even experienced it firsthand.   So too did His Mother.   She watched people around her get sick, suffer, and die -- including her own husband.   She saw her Son wrongfully convicted of a crime and brutally executed.    And, although the Bible doesn't record this, she no doubt saw the early Christians suffer persecution, arrest, and even death after Christ's Ascension -- she may have even experienced some of this herself. Christ is not some distant God who is not part of our suffering and trials in this world.   He experienced them and He saw them with His own earthly eyes.   Please know that your father is undoubtedly in the eternal and glorious presence of God at this very time.", 10020, "None", 2],

How is Mike Illitch going to pay our salaries if he cant sell LIttle Ceasers pizza??! 2) Wont be old enough to leagally drink for another 3 months so I will have to go with #1.  At least selling Boones Farm might make ticket prices drop. 3) If the Red Wings moved I would be amazed.  That would be the worst by far.  As long as they love me they will always be my parents /corny. 4) Definately losing in the finals.  My feet are enormous(16US) and I always get that damn toe caught on stuff.  I wouldnt miss it. 5) Lol I could totally see the WIngs changing their logo to a big red chicken.  It would almost fit with our playoff attitude over the last couple years. It would be so comical I would enjoy it. #2 would be worse. 6) Thats still 41 points in my book lol.  That plus a decent road record would get you in the playoffs most of the time. If I am 2 years older i can enjoy the experience of beer+hockey legally at the games.  Push. 7)  Definately wasting a pick.", 10023, "Zrg7sNYRaa", 5],
	107976 : ["About compatibility: In order to answer this question correctly, you need to compare the time, place, and date of birth of you and the other person. And you cannot truly call anything a TRINE unless you look at the degree; just because the signs are trine does not mean the placements are trine by degrees. It important to compare the degrees between the signs and planets of each chart also. Sun signs are notoriously unreliable for compatibility analysis, so you really do need to look at the aspects to tell. However you can go to   and put in both birth dates. It will give you a compatibility analysis which is much more accurate and exact than anything sun sign based.", 10023, "None", 0],

	107982 : ["I would assume so.  I personally have never been for an extended time for it to affect me in the long run but I was watching a documentary on gangs & for example a kid gets busted for a misdemeanor say drugs or burglary then the only way they feel they will be safe in jail is to join a gang.  Once you join there is no escape but death & you always have to prove loyalty by killing for the gang & various other crimes.  So a non-violent criminal comes out a brainwashed killer.  Look at Murder in the First....good movie same principle as I just mentioned.  A good line from the movie shawshank redemption is \"I had to come to jail to become a crook\"  I know these are movies but that kind of thing happens.  That's why Alcatraz was closed.  Also think about the people that get rapped in there, even if they come out shaken up & keep to themselves they aren't the cocky badasses they thought they were either that it makes them more defiant then they initially were because they've been through it & they aren't afraid to go back.  Some are in there so long they become institutionalized & can't relate to life on the outside.  All of these are good points to ponder & discuss in your paper.", 10022, "x5WNupDXaa", 0],

I will tell you to walk and the reason behind this is, I did sit and wonder all the good times we had and I missed him a lot also but he told me everything I wanted to hear and when he got out of prison he just started all over again. It's a very long process to get someone off of drugs and alcohol. When he gets out he needs to go to rehabilitation for himself and others he has hurt in his lifetime, He will be doing himself that favor. If he has abused you and was on drugs and alcohol I don't think it would be smart to give him a second chance I do believe that people can change, however I was in this position and it kept happening and I walked I now have been with someone else for the past 3 years and we have a wonderful family.

I was dumb enough to try and go back with my ex husband after we divorced, dated- he acted perfect, spoiling me,ect- then went on a trip with him to test the waters,and he threw an emotional temper tantrum over something stupid, broke some glasses that we'd just bought and stormed off leaving me walking alone on a street in San Antonio.
