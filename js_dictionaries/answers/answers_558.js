You can however work it out for yourself. 1/ Fill the tank, zero the trip meter. 2/ drive your usual route/s until tank is about half empty. 3/ Refill the tank, record the trip meter reading & the amount of petrol needed to fill the tank. 4/ Calculate your fuel consumption in miles/gallon or km/litre or litres/100km. 5/ Check in the car's specifications the actual size of the fuel tank. 6/ NEVER run the tank completely empty - that will suck up any junk in the bottom of the tank so take a gallon (or 5l ) from the tanks capacity. This will give you a figure for the useable amount of fuel you have. You know your consumption & useable fuel capacity. Simple arithmetic will give you your total range. Always zero the trip meter on refilling it gives a more reliable range reading than the consumption figure on the dash.
