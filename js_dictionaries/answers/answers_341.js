When you filed your return you applied all credits and payments against that liability and got a refund of any amount over that liability. With the new unemployment exemption of $10,200 your taxable income will be reduced to $79,731. Your new tax liability for the year will be reduced to $9,173. This will result in an additional refund of $2,192 (the difference between your original tax liability and your new one). As Wayne Z mentioned - don't hold your breath, I will probably take many months for the IRS to get through these returns and get the adjustments sent out. For those who don't realize what's going on here - the recent stimulus bill included a provision to make the first $10,200 worth of unemployment benefits non-taxable, and the provision is retroactive to 2020 taxes even though it wasn't passed until 2021. So the IRS said that anyone who already filed their 2020 taxes does NOT need to file an amendment. The IRS will go back through all the returns filed before this law passed and make the adjustment for anyone who had unemployment income and automatically send them whatever additional refund they get as a result. Marvin is in this situation - he already flied, but originally included all of his unemployment benefits in the taxable income. So the IRS is going to automatically apply the newly passed exemption and send him a refund for the difference.", 2948, "Jvx658HFaa", 1],

	17287 : ["You will have to fill out both types of return to see which works better for you, then pick the method that lets you pay the least tax. The majority of couples see an advantage to married/joint returns rather than married/separate ones--but it depends on many other factors--not only income. Filing by yourself is not necessarily going to reduce your 'tax exposure'. If, when you turn 59-1/2, you have NO OTHER INCOME for that year, other than the distribution you took from your 401K, then very likely it would be much lower than your EARNED income in previous years, which will make your taxes less. If you take the distribution in the middle of the year, and you have EARNED income PLUS your 401K distributions, you might actually end up in a higher tax bracket and pay more. And none of this accounts for any deductions or credits you may have that affect your Adjusted Gross Income. So there's no ONE answer to your question.  Most people who turn 59-1/2 don't stop working even if they CAN--because you will drastically reduce your Social Security benefits later on if you do. Your SS benefits are based on the \"high 3\" years of your earnings--and the longer you can actually work, the more you will earn (up to the cap, that is). So why quit earlier?  Your SS benefits aren't usually taxable.  You can ALSO roll over your 401K into a Roth IRA and pay those taxes NOW--instead of later. That way you can be completely assured your tax burden will be lower. You are not /required/ to take distributions from any of your retirement accounts until age 72--so you can keep working if you want to. Deferring taking them will maximize your SS, and minimize your taxes. ", 2946, "1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa", 2],
