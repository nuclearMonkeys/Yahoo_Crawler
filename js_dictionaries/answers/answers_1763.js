	93855 : ["1.) At the moment of the union of a human sperm cell and a human egg,  there is a living creature who is genetically human and genetically unique. At that moment of conception the being is human, unique and alive.  Given that evidence, I consider it entirely unreasonable to say it is not a human being.  Given the hard science proof that the creature is human - genetic identification as a human being with a full and unique human genetic code,  that being must be protected just like any other human being unless it can be proven that such a creature is not really human,  something that is scientifically absurd.  At the moment a human being begins to exist - the moment of conception,  he or she is a human being. 2.)  I do not consider murder to be a cure for rape.  No one who has been raped is cured of what was done to her by killing an innocent human creature.   The important part of abortion is not something that happens to a pregnant woman,  it is something that happens to her offspring.  The important part of an abortion is the chemical burning to death of the fetus with a concentrated saline solution,  or the surgical slicing to death of the fetus.   Either way,  it seems to me to be a lot more significant to the one who dies than to the one who didn't want that person to remain alive.  No,  under no conditions would I intentionally allow an innocent human being to be slaughtered.  If ever a girl or woman could need to stop being pregnant,  I think it is never justified to willingly kill the fetus.  The fetus must always be protected as well as possible,  with every effort made to protect the life of both the mother and her son or daughter.  Modern use of abortion almost never makes any attempt to save the victim.  The young human creature is killed intentionally by brutal means with no anesthesia.  This is barbaric,  and I would never allow this to be done to anyone,  least of all to a member of my own family. EDIT:  As for organogenesis,  or brain-wave criteria,  what do you have to say about people who are well past birth - the sick or elderly,  who lose these functions?  Such criteria are wildly arbitrary,  and do nothing to prove that a being with unique human genes - a brand new one-celled human creature, is not really a human being.", 9490, "eO2rnf7yaa", -1],

	93887 : ["What I have always found unendingly fascinating is that so many of the truly pro-life countries (like my home country) have taken steps that the  pro-life contingent in the US is generally rather vehemently against. There is no death penalty but there IS comprehensive sex education, a strong social safety net and the stigma attached to unwed mothers has largely been removed. However, abortion is legal and paid for by the national health system, it's just a very low rate. I am fairly convinced that those things are related.  When  you give young women the knowledge and the tools to prevent pregnancy rather than rely on abstinence only, ensure that they and their child will be well cared for and their education completed with help from the social welfare system and make sure that system is strong enough and well funded enough that there really aren't any good reasons to abort. However, that option is there because not everyone's faith has such prohibitions against abortions and no one should force another to live by another person's faith no matter how right they may feel that they are. More importantly, it does no one any good to criminalize what has to be the most traumatic decision someone would  ever have to make. Adoption is hardly a realistic option as there are literally thousands (well over 100,000, actually) children available for adoption in the US RIGHT NOW yet many people do not want to adopt an American child for fear that there \"will be something wrong with it\" or \"one of the parents may look for it later\" or \"it will want to know who its parents are\". I've actually heard those excuses from those who go overseas for adoption. I also have heard \"it's too hard to adopt in the US\".  Unfortunately, those things that have made the Nordic abortion rates so low cost money - and lots of it - and most people in the US are more focused on money and even simply punishing both mother AND bastard child (or they'd care for that child regardless of its provenance) than they are truly concerned with the sanctity of life. This is why victims of rape get a \"pass\" from many \"pro-lifers\". That resultant high tax rate/huge expense is also why I'm pretty sure that sort of thing will never happen here. Well, not in my lifetime, it won't. Which is sad. That way of doing things put in place right after WWII means there's no longer any such thing as poverty in my home country, and contrary to popular belief, there are indeed wealthy Norwegians.

If you are against abortions that is perfectly fine, don't get one, but don't go taking another persons rights to there own body away. I am pro-choice, personally i would never get an abortion because i don't think i could deal with the emotional side of it. But just because i wouldn't have one doesn't mean i'm willing to take others options and rights away from other women. Forcing someone to carry an unwanted pregnancy is just as bad as forcing another woman to abort. Do not try to take a woman's right to her own body away. But on the subject of rape IF they report it they are given the plan b pill or an equivalent to prevent pregnancy. But not every rape is reported so it can't always be prevented, not to mention majority of rapes are committed by someone the victim knows.

The story is false.\"  The Arab Peace Initiative, based on the Saudi peace plan of February 2002, calls for a full Israeli withdrawal from all territories taken in the Six Day War, including east Jerusalem, in exchange for normalizing ties with the Arab world.

They have reportedly told Obama he should not waste time, and must begin pushing his policies within his first year in office while he still enjoys maximum goodwill.  Senior Jerusalem officials last month dismissed a sudden surge of interest both in Israel and abroad in the initiative, saying it was a function of both a diplomatic process that has stalled and the transition periods in Israel, the US and the Palestinian Authority.  \"Whenever the process stalls, there will be those who will pull out the Saudi plan,\" one senior official said. \"And the Saudis have an interest in pushing this out there now, to put on a 'constructive face' with which to greet the new US president.\"  You must learn to read all not just PARTS !!!!!!!", 9494, "wdyf1sueaa", -4],

She chose to be what she is, and therefore she must pay whatever price is to be paid for that lifestyle.
