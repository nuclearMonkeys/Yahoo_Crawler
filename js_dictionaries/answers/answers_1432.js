As Christians, we are all here to further God's Kingdom and set our denominational differences aside. It's not about us!!! Secondly, since I have been here on R & S, I have see a lot of \"Catholic bashing\" from all religions.  One of the questions that is asked here on R & S repeatedly is \"What is the difference between Catholics and Christians\"?  Obviously, many people are not aware that Catholics are Christians. So I would like to address Catholics with this question.   What is the reason there is so much Catholic bashing and why are people not aware that Catholics are Christians??? Catholics always give the answer, that others have been misinformed and are mistaken about the Catholic Church. Is this the truthful real reason or an easy denial?

They should also respect the beliefs of Catholics, and accept that Catholics believe what they do for very good reasons.  Chances are they understand their religion better than the haters do.  Carebear above, for example, has listed a couple examples of what Catholics DON'T believe. If you are going to reject Catholicism, do it for the right reasons.  Don't do it based on misinformation you have been fed from radical fundamentalist Christians.  Chances are the information is incorrect.

When I answer anti-Catholic questions, my goal is to stop disinformation, not convince the poster that their current denomination is evil, or something.   I'd like to help stop the Catholic bashing and promote a little bit of understanding.  When it comes to non-Catholic Christians, I've experienced a lot of compassion and a lot of real ugliness.

I have posted questions that are based on attacks by protestants in the hope that the truth can become known.   My entire family is protestant.  I am a convert to the Catholic faith.  I was an agnostic before.  You cannot even begin to imagine what you are missing as a non-Catholic.  There are really very few truly faithful Catholics in the Church and the other Catholics here can surely attest to that, I believe. You honestly have *no idea* what you are talking about when you post your anti-Catholic \"information\".  Truly, it's not the real story.  That's what I am here for. EDIT -- DMD, the vast majority of Catholics who were catechized after Vatican II haven't the slightest idea what the authentic teachings of the Church are.

	77273 : ["If you're a beginner, you're most likely asking yourself: Nikon or Canon? Really, I feel confident in saying that you can't go wrong with either. I've used both brand's cameras extensively and find that they both offer amazing image quality with well-built, solid cameras that, if taken care of, will last decades. There are two differences between the cameras, though, that can be taken into consideration. The user-interface: If cameras were computers, Nikons would be PCs and Canons would be MACs. PCs are built for people not afraid of technology whereas Macs are built for people who want things super-easy. Nikons excel at customization options which means you'll see so many more options with the Advanced features of a Nikon than you will with a Canon. Canons, on the other hand, excel at ease-of-use for beginners. Canons offer less advanced options and can be easier to learn on. This can be frustrating down the line, though, once you've learned a lot about photography. At that point you may want all of the options that Nikon offers and be frustrated with your Canon. If you're someone who really likes to delve deep into your hobbies or if you're intent on becoming a professional photographer, I'd say a Nikon would be your best bet. If you're someone who wants to learn the basics of photography and only imagine yourself being a hobbyist, Canon would be a better option for you. Where Nikon 5200 excels: Flash photography. I often find myself in situations where I'm shooting event photography (weddings, movie premiers, benefits and galas) where I need to use a lot of flash. For this kind of photography, I'll always prefer to be shooting with a Nikon. Nikon's flash metering (how the camera magically decides how much light to fire out of the flash) is much more consistent than Canon's. You can take a Canon and shoot the same scene three times in a row with flash and all three images will be at different brightness levels. You can do the same thing with a Nikon and all three images will be wonderfully the same. If you're somebody who plans on shooting a lot with flash (indoor photography, event photography, etc.) you'll want to consider going with Nikon. Where Canon EOS  60D excels: Richness of colors. I've been in numerous situations where I've been on the red carpet taking the exact same picture as the photographer next to me. I'll have a Canon and the person next to me will have a Nikon. This has provided quite a few opportunities to compare the images side-by-side. What I've found is that the colors on the Canon's images look richer and make the image pop more. If I'm doing fine art photography (anything I'd like to someday hang in a gallery), I'll always want to be shooting with a Canon for this reason.", 8882, "awFvKqC1aa", 1],
