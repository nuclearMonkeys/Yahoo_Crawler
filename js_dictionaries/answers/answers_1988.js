There's no \"salvation\" to get there.  There is however a belief among many that the good deeds, works and acts of charity, will show that you deserve to be among the righteous.", 9909, "None", 4],
	105147 : ["generally speaking from the way I understand it, its widely believed that everyone has a place in the world to come. its a relatively hard thing to answer, because Judaism is about this life, not the next/afterlife/ect and there are very very few things that are agreed upon. there is generally NO concept of an eternal torment like in most of christianity.  or at least not one that is nearly as commonplace as many christians belive it to be. almost all of the difference between the \"sects\" of Judaism is observance/strictness. for example keeping kosher, in conservative, many may keep kosher, many might not. many may go for something sort of in between, where for example they might not eat forbidden varietys of food, but the foods they do eat(of a permissible species, ect) might not ACTUALLY be kosher.  they might not mix meat and milk in actual meals, but they might not go to the extent of keeping separate dishes. but in reform, most would likely NOT keep kosher. in Orthodox, the majority almost certainly WOULD. similar goes for most things.  but allt he core stuff pretty much all actually Jewish people agree on. (such as the singularity of God)  what I personallybelieve, simplified and summarized is that you die,  hang around and watch the funeral, assuming you accept your death, you move on. you have a court type thing where your outstanding sins are discerned, you then have a purgatory-ish thing where you review and repent your sins, with a maximum sentence of 1 year's passage for the living world, then, assuming that \"goes smoothly\" you move on, cleansed of the immediately past life's sins, and then you move on to rest, or plan the major events and timings of the next life. then you (as time appropriate) rest or incarnate into your next life, and you are off again. of course, that is for the average person, phenomenally good or bad people would have some variation, and there could be some \"variation\" if a person was persistently unrepentant, or refused to accept their death.  and yes. I mean that I believe in reincarnation.  to many peoples's suprise, this is NOT actually that far out in Judaism. if you understand the mechanics of it, it is clear that its pretty much the only way God can be Just and Merciful as we know him to be. pretty much no other system actually \"works\" in this way. I was raised, and still consider myself Conservative Jewish by Religion, my spiritual views, while not outside the bounds of Judaism, are.... well not mainstream either. as a bottom line, at least ofr my opinion of it, non-Jews would be \"judged\" appropriately for the context, with everyone (universally) judged to certain standards regardless of their affiliation,  and others according to the context.  in fact many Jewish people consider that Jews would be held to a higher standard, since we know the whole of God's laws... we know how God wants us to behave,  comparatively explicitly, so we are more personally responsible when we screw it up. compared to someone else who didn't know as thoroughly.... a transgression might be entirely innocent in comparison. this is part of why Judaism does not seek converts. if two people act precisely the same, one Jewish one not, the Jewish person is generally regarded to get a harsher punishment.  .. its a \"stumbling block before the blind\" thing. but overall... decent people of whatever affiliation have nothing to fear from the Jewish concept of the afterlife. regardless of their personal beliefs.  the people who would have the most to \"fear\" so to speak, are those who are Jewish by religion, but evil in actions.", 9909, "None", 9],

	105154 : ["Judaism is a world-affirming faith, more concerned with what we do with this life. We are to enjoy the blessings of this world while we work to make it a better place for all living and for the next generation. After being immersed in a culture that was very obsessed with preparing for the afterlife in Egypt, I think that the Hebrews learned the hard lesson that such a concern overwhelming your life prevents you from fulfilling your purpose IN this life. Judaism is a world and life-affirming religion to its very core. A contextual reading of the Exodus story alone in contrast to the Book of the Dead shows this sharp divide in focus. The Torah reads much more as a replacement theology to the Book of the Dead. Ironically..in much the same way that the New Testament reads as replacement theology to the Tanakh. The Torah led the Hebrews from a system of worship of more than one deity who was represented on earth in the form of Pharaoh as a man/god and whose religions focused more on the afterlife than this life, to a covenant of faith that is monotheistic in nature, forbids the worship of any man as god and primarily focuses on life rather than death. Torah = The Book of Life, Egyptian man/god's and polytheistic idolatry = The Book of the Dead.  Judaism is a world-affirming, not world-denying faith. We use the gifts and blessings we have in this world to make it better for ourselves, for our families and for the rest of the world. The great sage Hillel, whom you may recognize as the one Jesus paraphrased in a slightly different form, declared not only that what is distasteful to you do not do to another, but left us this quote that teaches of other ethical lessons of Judaism If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am for myself alone, what am I? If not now, when? Life is our greatest gift from God. We are also here to enjoy that and share that joy. There isn't a thing wrong with doing good to feel good or to try to help another feel better about themselves.  The world can be a sad, cruel place and it is the very role of Israel to struggle with God and find our place in God's creation to make it a better one.  We are partners with God and our fellow living creatures working to repair and restore it to harmony and a state of perfection.(Tikkun Olam or Repair of the World) We aren't expected to BE perfect but to strive toward it and help along others on the way as well as be willing to take the hand of another when we need help. Teshuvah repentance and return) have specific steps of being accountable when we make mistakes or do things to hurt another so that we learn from our mistakes and to help guide us back on the path of righteousness. In focusing on our deeds and how we live and treat one another, we come to greater awarness of the Divine..Judaism stresses deed over creed.  The world to come..whatever it is..will take care of itself. It's this world that we're entrusted with in the here and now. Judaism teaches that humanity's role is to work with each other to help God with perfecting and restoring or repairing anything out of harmony, any and all injustice or opression, any poverty, sickness, etc. Our walk with Hashem is more about deed than creed.  I shall try to explain how this works. It isn't about earning a ticket into heaven. It is about fulfilling what we believe our purpose for existence is all about and how we achieve connection to one another and to Hashem (God)  Whatever behaviors one does repeatedly, become habit and thus the \"nature\" of the person. If you repeatedly act in greedy, thoughtless or hateful ways, or allow impulsive and rash emotional choices rule you those become habit and you reinforce this. It becomes hardto do the right thing because you have made it easy to choose the \"wrong\" way..to separate yourself from the Divine as well.   If you live and act in a manner that fulfills this purpose of connection to the Divine source and make it the habit..the awareness of this connection grows and making wise decisions that are not harmful to self and others and benefit \"tikkun olam\" are reinforced and thus \"become habit\" For many people, it appears to be a slow process of growth into an awareness of our connection to God, rather than some kind of overwhelming divine revelatory moment.  The Talmud was written over the course of a few hundred years of debates and discourse of how to apply the laws of Torah in lands and cultures of the Diaspora.  There were different views of the afterlife among different Jews because Torah is a path of living, not devoted to the afterlife.  I have not read the entire Talmud, but I would not be at all surprised to find opposing views of the afterlife within it.  Some of what is in the Talmud is not altogether different than the types of discourse learned Jews today engage in during Torah study, attempting to discern how to apply the laws and ethics of Torah to modern situations. In Judaism, thee is no concept of original sin, (meaning that we are born with a burden of sin and an evil nature that requires salvation to merit blessing.)  We are born with a blank slate..potential for both good and evil and the ability to master our evil inclination.   Torah is clear that non-Jews are as capable as Jews to know God and merit blessing and achieve atonement directly, hence those are not Talmud concepts but from Torah.  The Prophets and Writings also reaffirm those beliefs.  Kings speaks of the Gentiles praying at the Temple, the Prophet Isaiah says directly that the righteous of all nations merit a place in the world to come. What that world is..isn't exactly clear from the Tanakh. I'm Reform, but these are concepts are not exclusive to any branch of Judaism, coming from the Tanakh. Because of my Jewish upbringing, I often find it really hard to try to focus on what will happen after I'm gone.  That isn't really something I waste much time in worry over. I trust that if I do my best and leave the rest to God, there isn't anything to worry about.  I do not believe in a firey underworld hell and a demi-god devil of the underworld.   It is how I live and the legacy my life leaves behind for others to come after me that I focus on.  Shalom Edit: Being Reform I can tell you with certainty that I was raised believing what the Tanakh said...the righteous of all nations merit a place in the world to come.  I have no idea why kismet thinks Reform is different in that regard.   However, among Orthodox and among some Reform, there is no universal belief in the same kind of afterlife.  I learned that from Orthodox Jews I know who have these different views :)", 9909, "vEEeq7kYaa", 7],
