	131271 : ["It's a good question, and I hope you will take the response seriously. First, military weapons' purpose is to violently attack opposing forces. Such weapons generally are used to neutralize one's enemy. Some can be used at military targets; some can be used against civilian populations. In the case of Hamas, since they place their military assets within civilian populations, the death of civilians and collateral damage inevitably occurs. Please note that Hamas specifcally targets civilians. Second, radical Islam is far more complicated than that. Al-Qaeda, which carried out 9/11, was created not to fight for the freedom of the Palestinians, but objecting to American bases in Saudi Arabia. You'll note that none of the bombers on 9/11 were Palestinian--the great mass of them were Saudi. Finally, how does Israel support us? First, it is our staunchest ally in the region and publicly supports the U.S. in most international issues. Second, Israel is the only democracy in the region, which gives it a sort of legitimacy that a lot of the religious and secular regimes in the Middle East do not have. Third, unlike many of those countries who get both military and civilian aid from the US, Israel has the best record of repayment for that aid. None of these things, I should point out, obviates the need for Israel to equitably and humanely deal with the Palestinians and create a framework for a lasting peace and Palestinian nationhood. But to suggest that ending our support would suddenly be a panacea for all the ills in the region or that it would radically alter the opinion of Arabs towards the U.S. is a fundamentally na√Øve notion.

	131300 : ["Oh, wow, my best recipe? There are sooooo many good ones, that me and all my vegetarian friends have just loved. Lasagna, grilled eggplant, grilled stuffed peppers, spinach roll-ups, chili! There are so many great foods, you'd be amazed! I'll give you a link to the website I get recipes from. Now, I hope you know that vegetarianism is very serious. The last thing you want is not to get enough protein or vitamins, or something, and have your family say \"I told you so\". That would just be horrible. So, I've already done my homework, I guess I'll let you cheat off of me. :D hahaha. -PROTEIN Plant proteins should provide for you enough, as long as you make sure your calorie intake is high enough for your energy needs. -MORE AMINO ACIDS If plant proteins simply aren't enough, try eating whole grains, nuts or seeds. -IRON If you're not totally vegan, egg yolk provides iron well. However, dried beans, dried fruits, and spinach are good sources as well. -VITAMIN B 12 This only comes naturally from animals. It can be found in some fortified (not enriched) breakfast cereals such as Total and some brands of nutritional brewer's yeast, or in supplements. -VITAMIN D You will need a reliable vitamin D source. If you don't get a lot of sunlight, you'll probably need a supplement. -CALCIUM Studies have shown that vegetarians absorb and retain more calcium than meat eaters. Cool, huh? Calcium can be found in greens such as spinach, kale and broccoli, and some legumes and soybean products. -ZINC Grains, nuts and legumes are good sources. If you chose to take a supplement, be sure to pick supplements containing no more than 15-18 mg zinc. Supplements containing 50 mg or more may lower HDL (\"good\") cholesterol in some people. --And some more tips-- Keep your intake of sweets and fatty foods to a minimum. These foods are low in nutrients and high in calories. Choose whole or unrefined grain products when possible, or use fortified or enriched cereal products. Use a variety of fruits and vegetables, including foods that are good sources of vitamins A and C. If you use milk or dairy products, choose fat-free/nonfat and low-fat varieties. Eggs are high in cholesterol (213 mg per yolk), so monitor your use of them. Limit your cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg per day. Oh, and if your family is.... uh, disrespectful? about your diet, you could always tell them about how healthy you'll be. Many studies have shown that all kinds of vegetarians have a lower risk of obesity, coronary heart disease (which causes heart attacks), high blood pressure, diabetes and some forms of cancer.

	131303 : ["Several Years ago I had sever depression. I went to counseling and was on a lot of medicine. I was experiencing panic and anxiety attacks. There were times when I did not think life was worth living. I was finally hospitalized and had 5 EST therapy. About a year after that and regulating my medication, I did get better. I can now function and do not have to spend all my days in bed or living in fear because of the panic attacks. I  an now physically healthier. There are times when I may have a day or two of depression but it is not the severe dibilitating kind. I am only on two medicines now. One is for depression and the other for panic and anxiety attacks Since I believe depression is a chemical imbalance im most people, I do not think you ever completely get over it. I think we can get much better and able to function in society. But, I think the clinical illness is always there even if it is dormant. It takes a lot of personal work to keep from going back down and even we try our best, sometimes it is difficult to overcome because for me, I am freightened of having a major relapse. I just try every day to live in the moment and live by the serenity prayer.  God Bless those who do suffer and don't give up.
