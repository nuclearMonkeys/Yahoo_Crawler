	9704 : ["Hello, \"Palestine\" is not and never has been, any sovereign state. The \"Palestinian\" Arabs have autonomy under the Oslo Accords, referred to as: the \"Palestinian Territories\". Although there is a: \"State of Palestine\" place-card at the Arab-dominated United Nations, in reality there is no such state. I suggest you consider views from both sides and make up your own mind.  I have considered the Palestinian viewpoint, but find that the things they say cannot be verified.  In order to have the best possibility for peace there would need to be: The removal of hate and prejudice against Israel and in particular against Jewish people from the Palestinian education system, which could eventually lead to significantly less hate by Palestinians against Israel and Jewish people, with more willingness to sincerely negotiate a trustworthy peace treaty providing for a two state solution.  The “European Union” would also need to cease its funding of the Palestinians (“Palestinian Authority” aka Fatah) since as the E.U. is aware, this can only constitute funding for Palestinian terrorism (see further below), while such funding of terrorism represents an obstacle to peace.  The “Palestinian” Arabs falsely-allege Israeli Jews all came from Europe. Some Jews are returnee-exiles, since the Jewish People have Judean heritage. Yet the Jewish People are indigenous to their ancestral homeland of Israel, with unbroken presence there from Biblical times:  The Jewish People have had an unbroken presence in their ancestral homeland of Israel since Biblical times, and also previous sovereign states in the land, for example the Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom of Judah (aka Judea) (including the West Bank, Gaza, and Golan Heights), with its capital of (what is now East) Jerusalem. Between 110 BCE / 754 BH and 63 BCE / 706 BH:  By comparison there has never been a sovereign state of “Palestine” upon which the “Palestinian” Arabs could base any claim to the land of Israel. Following the Ottoman Turkish defeat in the First World War, the League of Nations in 1921 resurrecting the name “Palestine” from Roman occupation, authorized a British Mandate, whose inhabitants were known as:  “Palestinian Jews” / “Palestinian Arabs”. An administrative region, NOT a sovereign state, it was an area that later would be today's:  Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Territories - Please compare the second and third maps down, at:  The prior Ottoman Turkish empire did not use any such political term as “Palestine”, but rather Ottoman-occupied Judea / Israel was within the Ottoman province of “Syria” – see (copy to your web browser):  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Syria The “Palestinian” Arabs may come from those who invaded and occupied the Jewish land of Judea / Israel. However, it is also unclear at what point they arrived there, since they were opposed to being called a “People” until the 1960's, when they decided it fitted with their intention to steal the land from its indigenous Jews:  Israel was Re-established in 1948 following a United Nations Partition Plan which had sought to set up two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The then Palestinian Jewish Community had accepted the U.N. Partition Plan, while the “Palestinian” Arab response was in 1947 to start a civil war and terror to oppose the U.N. Partition Plan and instead take ALL the land of Israel, and also to ethnically-cleanse or murder the Jewish population from the Jews ancestral homeland of Israel.  In 1948 the Arab countries attacked the newly Re-established State of Israel, but the Arabs lost the war. Jordan then illegally-occupied the West Bank, and also illegally-occupied East Jerusalem from which the Jordanians expelled the Jews. Egypt illegally-occupied the Gaza strip. Neither country offered these areas to the Palestinians.  (Please see the sources which I have put into the “Sources” area of this answer.)  The Palestinians have two territories (part of the West Bank and the whole of Gaza) (or Palestinian colonies on land of the former Jewish kingdoms of Judea / Israel) which the Palestinians run themselves with their own army and police.  Being a grant of autonomy (and not sovereignty), until any peace treaty that may say otherwise, the land remains Israel's.  Once the “Palestinian” Arabs had tricked Israel into giving them autonomy of part of the West Bank and the whole of Gaza under the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians since:   > Do not sincerely negotiate a peace treaty,   > falsely-claim ALL of Israel,   > attack Israeli Jewish civilians as policy including children (see below).  No wonder anti-Semites display such emotional-support for the Palestinians!  Palestinian ethnic-hatred of Jewish people has not changed since the Palestinian support of the Nazis in the second world war. Due to ethnic-hatred of Jewish people and also territorial ambitions, the Palestinian education system in the Palestinian Territories practices mind-abuse, teaching:   > Hatred of Jewish people,   > a false victim-mentality,   > that Israel does not exist (aka the Palestinian false-claim to ALL the land of Israel);   > and similar to the propaganda of Nazi Germany, that the Jew / Israel is the (fake) cause of all Palestinian alleged issues:  “WASATIA Education - Exploring the Palestinian Curriculum” - Professor Mohammed S. Dajani Daoudi:  Progress towards a peace treaty can be made only once the idea of war ceases to be what keeps the Palestinians united, but is instead replaced by a desire to unite by peacefully developing alongside neighbours, seeking the common-good.  For the purposes for making any successful sincere negotiations possible, any parties in conflict in the world may need to consider: psychologically blocking-off grievances of the past, while building-in negotiations for sufficient security for both sides, with one intention - to make a present and future free of conflict for future generations of both sides.  The Palestinians would need to be willing to develop away from their current conflict-mindset, and also away from their addiction to ethnic-hatred of Jewish people.  The Palestinian leadership have “painted themselves into a corner” because the Palestinian Education System teaches such hatred so effectively that if the Palestinian leadership could be trusted at all to attempt to change policy now, their health could be at risk from their own people.  One solution would be to change the Palestinian Education System to remove from it its hatred, prejudice, and racism, against the Jewish People and Israel.  However, their leaders cannot remove hatred from the Palestinian Education System because they themselves are consumed with hatred > Why are they consumed with hatred? > Because they likely graduated from the Palestinian Education System, which teaches hatred, etc ...  Supporting anti-Semitism is anti-Semitism:  The Palestinian Education Authority in the Palestinian Territories also teaches Holocaust-Denial and admiration of the Nazis - see (copy to your web browser):  palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=655 What does the word “peace” mean to the Palestinians?  It refers to the stage after the Palestinian intention to: take ALL the land of Israel, ethnically-cleanse the Jews, and replace Israel with another Arab state comprised of those who arrived in the land well after the Jewish People.  Could the Palestinians be trusted to keep to any peace treaty?  The Palestinians do not accept the same world history as the rest of us and therefore have consequential “difficulties” with it: Palestinian propaganda seeks to replace the history of Jewish presence in the Jewish People's ancestral homeland of Israel, with a fake Arab history – see (copy to your web browser):  palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=495 The “Palestinian National Charter” seeks the expulsion of the Jewish People from the Jews ancestral homeland of Israel:  Due to anti-Semitism many people do not require any proper moral standard from the “Palestinian” Arabs.  The Palestinians cynically whitewash their anti-Jewish hate-war as:  “uprising”, “defence”, “desperation”, “struggle”, “resistance”:  - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “The Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund is a fund operated by the Palestinian Authority for the purpose of paying a monthly cash stipend to the families of Palestinians killed, injured or imprisoned for involvement in attacking, assisting in attacking, or planning to attack Israel [...]”  - - - - End of extract - - - - Here is an example result from the Palestinian on-going anti-Jewish hate-war:  Israeli girl, Hallel Yaffa Ariel, aged 13, fatally stabbed in her bedroom in West Bank by a Palestinian terrorist, June 30, 2016, The Guardian:  The “Palestinian Authority” aka Fatah (which together with the P.L.O. pays the terrorism reward-“Pension” of their “Martyrs Fund”, and also funds “Hamas”) is itself funded by the “European Union”.  The “Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund” and “Hamas”, both brought to you by “European Union” funding of the “Palestinian Authority” aka Fatah:  I hope this helps. Robert.", 1569, "lZ0LHWV4aa", -1],
