	75866 : ["Even in Jerry Rice's last three years, he was productive.  Maybe not the elite numbers, but still a stronger threat than other WRs at the time. Brett Favre is not ruining his legacy.  The Media and the people buying into the media stories is what is ruining his legacy if it were all true.  The fact is that even if Brett Favre has a down year, his past performances still stand.   I am rather tired of hearing sissies moaning and groaning about Brett Favre should retire, he is ruining his legacy, blah blah blah.......  What is everyones damn problem?  If the guy wants to play football, then let him.  Who the hell are we to say when he should retire?  Are we experts on retirement.  Better yet, id there such thing as an expert in retirement?  There is not one person here that likes to be told what they should and shouldn't do with their lives.  Why is Brett Favre any different.  It is not like he is breaking the law.  It is his life and he should be allowed to do whatever he wants with it, just like everyone else.  Isn't he a grown man? In fact, despite his age, Brett Favre is still a better QB option than half of the starters in the league today.  Most will say that Favre was the reason that the Jets lost last season, but many dismiss that he did have an injury that affected his throws.  Also, people are forgetting that Favre helped open up the running game.  Thomas Jones had only 1 TD in 2007, but had 15 TDs to get him in the Pro Bowl in 2008.  So you see, Favre did have impact to improve the Jets. If Favre wants to play for the Vikings as a personal vendetta, then let the guy do it.  Again, it is his life and if he wants some personal satisfaction from a fall out with his former team, then let him.  Who in the world has never wanted to get even? So you see, there is no reason that anyone should be acting like cry babies about Favre.  It is illogical and it shows you follow the media and can't make sound opinions on your own.  Sorry if it insults anybody, but I hope what I said will open some eyes.  I am just blunt like that and tell it like it is. Thumbs up to those who agree. Philidelphia Eagles - Who in this world hasn't changed their minds.  How does Brett Favre changing his mind affect your life at all?  I bet it doesn't even if he contemplated retirement for the last 5 years.  Likely you are tired of the media buzz, so blame the media. Joe M - People are people and not everyone reacts the same.  We all know that Brett FAVRE is probably the most passionate player to ever play the game.  I can't think of a player that matches his love for the game.  Again, it you want to blame someone one, blame the nedia.  They are the ones who covered the story.  He is not breaking any laws or doing anything bad.  Tell me a man that has never cried.It may not be manly for a football player, but even a football player is human.  By the way, it is hard to take your opinion seriously when you mispelled Brett Favre's last name every single time.  I think most football fans know how to spell his last name.  Sorry bro, but I am just to bothered by all the bashing Favre gets.  I feel as though people are more bothered with a man that wants to play football than a guy who ran an illegal gambling ring and tortured and killed dogs for pleasure. In other words, force an upstanding guy who has done nothing wrong from playing, but allow a terrible person who is a criminal to play.  It just makes no damn sense.", 8818, "4kdlE54Paa", 2],

The way he went out was ridiculous-Ted Thompson - I have nothing good to say about. As a fan, it ripped my heart to see him go. No way was I on that bandwagon! People need to realize that Packer fans were out in droves to keep Favre-it was NOT us. Now, your statement about misguided fans hurts, but you have a point. I am not misguided, I am upset. This hurts.  I believe Jerry going to the Raiders is on a different level as Favre going to the Packers rivals. Just as he went to the Jets and most Packer fans backed him 100% after the Pack. He wants to play, I'll give him that. But, yeah, it feels like a slap in the face. I will always love Favre-right now I am upset with developments. But Thompson is the idiot who set the ball in motion.  Brett Favre is an all out Iron Man. Why would a team put everything on hold to get him if he wasn't? AND why didn't the Packers in 2008? Thompson, not the fans.", 8818, "1uSoU8Lpaa", 4],
	75886 : ["Just stop already man. You are making yourself look dumb. You really are. Jerry Rice at age 42 playing football. And still putting up numbers. Yeah sorry but favre is not. I mean its showing he just had another surgery.  lets take a look at stats. Rice in his last \"4\" seasons had averaged 912 yards a season and that is only as a 2nd string receiver. So yeah he really ruined himself his last 4 years. I am not even counting seattle because i am a seattle fan and it was a blessing for him to be there. But he was not a starter. So i dont even count him as a player that year. And the difference is that Rice had been quite in the press. He didnt change his mind 400 times.   Lets look at brett favre's last 4 years. He threw the ball 2,277 times.  He had 88 td passes and 84 interceptions. Nothing impressive. The only reason he has so many yards each years is that he throws the ball SO many times.  Brett Favre is annoying. He is a waste of time on espn. he was a great qb and now washed up. Jerry rice was a better player at his position compared to favre. And look at the age difference. What will favre be doing at age 42? Still deciding if he wants to retire again? Read what Rice said about favre EDIT: We can take it one step further you thumb downers.  You say 2005-06 was a bad season. Rice was with the Raiders.. Take a second to breath that in. THE RAIDERS. And putting  up great numbers. Why are you even comparing the two. The guy below me is right. But since his truth hurts you all and you thumb him down to that just proves our points. Your not getting the truth and answer you want. Rice is in a whole other level than Favre. Rice didnt ruin his future. He wanted to keep playing and did. He played for 3 teams but did very quietly to the media. Favre on the other hand. \"hey guys im gonna retire this is it. Oh wait nevermind i want to play but i am an attention hog and cant make up my mind\". You either want to PLAY or you DONT.

Here are some examples of dramas they use: different backgrounds/financial situations religion jealousy games making bets on relationships fake pregnancy family issues finding out you are related to the other person you are competing with start out hating the person you are in love with i think the best factor in a love triangle is when two people won't admit it or don't realize they are in love. they get right on the verge of getting together, then something stops them and they don't follow through, yet. my favorite example was in \"fingerprints\" by melinda metz, where her two main characters take six books to realize they are meant for each other. sorry it got a little off the topic of books but i hope i helped a little", 8823, "J4GwinOAaa", 0],
