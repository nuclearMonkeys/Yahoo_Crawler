	96984 : ["The CRV is a great vehicle, and should be perfect for your situation, if it is within the price range. My mother has a 98 Honda CRV that she bought brand new in 97. Since then, she has only done the regular maintenance like oil changes, tire rotations, scheduled tune ups, and 1 brake pad replacement, that's it!! Not 1 major problem has happened to her car, and it still looks and drives like it was brand new, even though it has 190K miles on it!! So this is a very reliable vehicle, and the newer ones have more room, and are more powerful. That is the only downside of the 1st generation CRV's, they were highly underpowered. But good luck! I think you will love the CRV! The TOyota Rav4 is another good one.", 9604, "None", 0],
	96985 : ["For under 20,000 the best in MPG, resale value, space, unreliability are below. Brand New or slightly used with less than 5k miles: 1. Honda Civic 17-20k - the new model just came out, you cant beat honda reliability and its got a radical style, my gf has one and its excellent. 2. Toyota Corolla 17-20k - Its a toyota need i say more? another friend of mine has one and you cant go wrong, but the styling is bland which is my only complaint. 3. Honda Fit 13-16k - small cute car, very practical!, sporty, fun! but is smaller than the cars above but also cheaper 4. Nissan Sentra 14-18k - brand new, practical and safe! 5. Hyundai Sonata 17-20k- new car, please take a look at it, for the money u pay u get an AMAZING deal! excellent warranty. Here is a few reviews on the cars to help you out :) In the end i suggest you go down to the honda, toyota, hyundai and nissan dealerships drive the cars, sit in them, stare at them and then decide because all these cars will last and will run smoothly all the way to 150k miles plus EASILY! as long as you take care of them! :) ... in the end its ure decision they are all excellent cars! It just takes one day to go to all these dealerships and i promise you wont regret it! also in the end you can be fully satisfied you bought the car you wanted without any regrets! If i were you i would go to the dealership and choose between a honda civic, hyundai sonata. If you dont mind a used car also with less than 20k miles here are a few: Honda Accord and Civic Toyota Camry and corolla Nissan Altima  any questions or want more info jus email me at joellooyis@hotmail.com", 9604, "VPPboMccaa", 0],

Some try to get you to negotiate between the dealer markup and the MSRP-- but you're still overpaying. You want to pay LESS than MSRP. Focus has a $2500 rebate right now and MSRP starts at around 14K as well. Remember you probably wont get the highest value for your trade in-- dealerships rarely do give you top dollar.
