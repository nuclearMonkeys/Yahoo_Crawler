As others mentioned, the Cardinals (originally the Chicago Cardinals until 1960, when they moved to St. Louis) arrived in Phoenix in 1988, and became the Arizona Cardinals in 1994. The Oilers were one of the original eight AFL teams in 1960 (along with the New York Titans [Jets], Boston [New England] Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles [San Diego] Chargers, Oakland Raiders, Denver Broncos, and Dallas Texans [Kansas City Chiefs]) who moved out of Houston in 1996.", 9294, "AA11524578", 1],
	88315 : ["Like when Clinton was President - a lot of the Left HATED  him for letting them cut welfare and other social programs!  That's of course what helped balance the budget. But FOX TV and Rush Limbaugh kept right on blathering about how Clinton was a \"far left\" liberal - complete B******T then just as now with Obama who's done far more Conservative things than Liberal so far.", 9292, "None", -1],
	88316 : ["I think he had leftist leanings before he became President but after swearing the oath, he then realized that he is the President of all American People and that caused him to swing toward the middle road.

	88323 : ["I hate that commercial. I think some companies have a Contact Us option somewhere on their websites (email) or you can call a phone number (they usually have a toll-free one), so you can tell them how annoying the commercial is. But I don't think they'll do much about it. I mean, they had to pay a whole lot of money to get that on the air, so they won't just pull it off-air for just any reason. The commercial did do its purpose, though--it stuck in your mind, and you did tell others about it through this question. People will read this, watch the commercial in question, and possibly be swayed to buy the product. So, you really just helped the company.

	88327 : ["I don't think it matters. You can be irresponsible and live without your parents or you can be responsible and live with your parents.  The situations vary so much.  I am not going to judge a person based on where they live.  At least if they live with their parents they are less likely to be on social welfare.

The assistance provided may involve serving the non-custodial parent with papers requiring him or her to meet with the District Attorney and arrange a payment schedule, and informing the parent that refusal to do so may result in jail time. If the other parent lives in another state... You or the DA can use legal procedures to locate a parent who has moved out of state, and seek payment. Under the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (RURESA), if the other parent lives in a different state, the court in your state contacts a court in the other parent's state, and that court requires him or her to pay the child support that is due. This is a free service, but unfortunately, it doesn't always work. If you don't know where the other parent is living, there are Federal and state parent locator services that assist in locating missing parents. If the Other Parent Won't Pay Court-Ordered Child Support... A parent's tax refund can be intercepted to enforce a child support order. Wages can be garnished, property can be seized, business or professional licenses can be suspended, and in some states, driver's licenses can be revoked. Unemployment Insurance payments can be attached to pay child support. If the non-payer has assets, you can use a judgment against his or her house or other asset. For other possibilities, see Problems and Solutions. If you have an ex who fulfills his or her obligations to his or her children and pays child support on time, you're fortunate. If you're one of the millions who do NOT get any child support, or don't get all you should, don't ever give up. Keep working the system until you get the funds that your children are due.", 9292, "None", 0],
