	5326 : ["Not all CD's are equal. It's possible to have audiophile quality with a CD if the recording studio put that on it. There certainly can be enough dynamic range in that medium to surpass tape. I have heard very excellent reproduction on metal tape though. Metal tape audio cassettes generally were not  common in record shops, but they were used for mastering, not for mass produced records. A car is one of the worst listening environments, so when you audition media, you won't give either a fair chance against upholstery, wind, engine and tire noise. They can only sound as good as your worst speaker. You can easily obtain a supply of blank CDs to carry your entertainment, but just try and find blank audio cassettes capable of carrying good recordings today. You can find voice quality ones at Target and Walmart, but forget high-bias chromium tape or Maxell Metal on the shelf anywhere. There have been vinyl records and equipment capable of sounding just like the live performance, but most record shops never carried those very special issue records. Back in the 70's when an album sold for $3-$4, audiophile series vinyl disks could be found for $15 and up.
