	41335 : ["Don't worry. You will find true love soon. But even after you find, the one person who would love you more than your human true love is Jesus. Jesus loves you. His love is above the love of everyone else. I am praying for you. ", 6025, "EIU8ZzOEaa", 0],
	41336 : ["Well now, you're not a spring chicken anymore. Chances are you have lost your youthful appearance that men crave.  You can somewhat compensate for that through taking care of yourself, exercise, and being as visually appealing as possible.  Look for a guy in his 50s & 60s.  They are more likely to find you acceptable.  Guys in their 40s are still eyeing those 20 somethings because at that age they can afford them. You've had 20 good years to find love.  What's wrong with you? Are you fat?  Overly religious?  Way too picky?  Too pushy?  Toxic in some way?  There's got to be something.  Men will date below their abilities just to get laid.  You haven't gotten laid yet.  That leads me to believe there's a lot more to know than what you are telling us here. I'm not telling you to be a whore, but men today are not usually going to consider a long term relationship without sex eventually entering into it.  Just in case you are hanging on to the idea that today's man still expects a virgin.  It's just not so. It's actually preferable that a woman has some sexual skills rather than try to break in a new girl with all these sexual hangups she needs to get over.  At the very least be generous with your hands and a bit of lotion if you are reluctant to do more. That's my 2 cents.  Take it or leave it. One more thing.  Go to Meetup.com Find a group that interests you, in your area. There you will find men and women enjoying the same activities you enjoy and having something of interest in common with others is a good way to meet people, and very often find love. Good luck to you, and best wishes. . . .", 6025, "5P6m4Gs4aa", 3],

We can listen to almost any interview with today's famous singers and actresses and realize that they have little knowledge.  It is arguable about the hard work they put into their craft but I see many more pictures of \"artists\" partying, getting into fights, licking donuts and doing stupid things than I do doctors.  I would guess that the singers and actress do not work as hard as they claim.  I see few student doctors or practicing physicians in clubs doing dumb stuff.

As a horse person, it worries me that you have your dog on a long extendable leash and your dog is still unresponsive.  That leash is a danger to me and my horse.  Let the dog off the leash or keep him on a short leash.    For the sake of everyone else. I've properly desensitized my horse to dogs, so yours won't bother mine.   But I will be really pissed if I'm coming down a trail and your idiot dog is on a 20 foot lead who can wrap himself around my horse's legs, etc. Tips for training your dog?    You adopted the wrong breed for your lifestyle.    ", 6040, "None", 1],

You can contact people at SMARTRecovery.org.  It's like a brainy version of Narcotics Anonymous, which I can't really recommend because I've heard so much about it. I admit though that you might find some good people at a NA meeting. The next thing might sound dumb, but I swear it's great.

You can quit if you want to. Right now. It's the influence of your friends that is causing you to do so. You said yourself. You say you are not going to anymore. That is your true desire.

	41381 : ["The first step to getting well is admitting that one has a problem and is powerless over the drug (and/or substance), and you seem to realize that.  A person can be a \"functional addict,\" for instance, which refers to possibly having a full-time job and seeming \"okay,\" but the individual's life is still negatively affected in various ways by the addiction.   Please seek outside professional help for the cocaine use, especially before something catastrophic happens.  Those who use cocaine, which is categorized as a stimulant, may be at risk for stroke (\"brain attack\"), for instance, which is a type of brain injury that may result in partial or one-sided paralysis. There are different programs for those with addiction issues, which may include an outpatient treatment program for certain individuals.  The two credentials to look for in a substance abuse counselor is either a Certified Addiction Counselor (CAC) or a Certified Alcohol & Drug Counselor (CADC). Another respondent mentioned to consider making other friends, and that may be another step to leading a healthier lifestyle too. The following website should have some local counseling and treatment programs for those with mental health and/or addiction issues.  Some people with a drug and/or alcohol addiction may also have a mental illness.  For those with both a mental illness and addiction (or if suspecting a mental illness as well), there may be a program referred to as MICA (mental illness chemical addiction) for those with a \"dual diagnosis.\"  There may be an outpatient treatment program for MICA too: Their toll-free 24/7 ** referral ** hotline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357). Please also consider a 12-step program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), as a program of recovery, especially in addition to therapy.  (Some 12-step meetings may be online these days because of Covid-19 restrictions.)  If one doesn't have a drinking problem, he or she may attend an \"open\" AA meeting.  The only requirement is having a desire to be sober. Here is their website for more general info: NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) is a non-profit organization that has more general info and resources for those with mental health conditions *and/or* their family members or caregivers, and their website has more general info re: those with substance use disorders too (however, *not* for self-diagnosis or self-treatment): This website has more general info re: those with \"addiction\" issues (though, also for informational purposes):", 6028, "rSTNUGy3aa", 2],
