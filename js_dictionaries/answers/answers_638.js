	31910 : ["MMA has 5 rounds, that's why I really don't like it too much. I like when boxing had 15 rounds. Although 6 would be safer for the fighters.", 5369, "F72fC26Kaa"],
	31911 : ["Hi, i would prefer not 12, or 6, but 4 rounds! Butter Bean was the king of the 4 rounders ðŸ‘‘ and that category offered a lot of brutal knockouts.Â ", 5369, "None"],

	31920 : ["There are 17 different weight classes and Tyson Fury competes in just one of them, +201lbs. When looking at the best boxer in the world regardless of the weight class, you look to the P4P list though the issue with that is heavyweights are usually exclude", 5381, "psOmJErtaa"],
	31921 : ["At the moment, I think it would be fair to say Fury is the best heavyweight in the world. Although we won't be able to say that definitively until he fights Joshua, who holds the WBA,WBO and IBF titles. But personally, I think he will beat Joshua.", 5381, "l3Jay0Mbaa"],
	31922 : ["I thought Fury had the possibility to be champ, but also that he never seemed to make an effort to have a plan.Â  Not until he fought Wilder did he really show he has some boxing skills.

	31928 : ["Considering he's admitted it's basically an exhibition and a way for him to stay fit and the fights ain't that serious... I like it. Better than a full blown comeback against proper fighters. 2 legends in amateur fights for charity could help a lot of box", 5383, "TdmTjKt8aa"],

	31939 : ["Ward slightly overrated. Should've lost to Kovalev in their first match. Fought extremely dirty in the second match. Hes always been an unclean fighter and overall ugly to watch.Â  He couldve easily been disqualified from at least 2 or 3 fights. Certainly ", 5374, "None"],

	31946 : ["Ali would win a unanimous decision. The speed of hand and foot would be the deciding factor. Ali talked very highly of Marciano. He said that he was much harder too hit than you would think. Also Rocky was very well conditioned and kept coming for 15 roun", 5375, "Xm8crry3aa"],
	31947 : ["Duran is another Marco's maidana. He's flat footed and he struggle against people who used angles like Leonard. Mayweather style was similar to Ray. I have Mayweather implenting the same game plan and taking a decision win.Â ", 5376, "vrQdic06aa"],
	31948 : ["Duran in the early 80s version takes any version of Floyd.Â  Floy admitted himself he took the biggest fights in his career at the right time meaning he carefully selected his opponents when he felt he could beat them.Â ", 5376, "None"],
