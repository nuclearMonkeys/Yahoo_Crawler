	35715 : ["MMA has 5 rounds, that's why I really don't like it too much. I like when boxing had 15 rounds. Although 6 would be safer for the fighters.", 5369, "F72fC26Kaa", -1],
	35716 : ["Hi, i would prefer not 12, or 6, but 4 rounds! Butter Bean was the king of the 4 rounders ðŸ‘‘ and that category offered a lot of brutal knockouts.Â ", 5369, "None", 0],

	35725 : ["There are 17 different weight classes and Tyson Fury competes in just one of them, +201lbs. When looking at the best boxer in the world regardless of the weight class, you look to the P4P list though the issue with that is heavyweights are usually excluded from the P4P rankings. Vasyl Lomachenko, Saul Alvarez or Terence Crawford is #1 P4P at the moment, who is placed where depends on whom you ask but as you can see, Tyson Fury's name isn't on the consideration list. Â Â  However, in the heavyweight division only, Tyson Fury is indeed number 1 in the world.Â  Some say it is Anthony Joshua and others say they need to fight to decide but I've already decided that Fury is the best given that he has held every world title belt and also the lineal title, has never lost a professional bout and I believe he would beat Joshua fairly comfortably.", 5381, "psOmJErtaa", 0],
	35726 : ["At the moment, I think it would be fair to say Fury is the best heavyweight in the world. Although we won't be able to say that definitively until he fights Joshua, who holds the WBA,WBO and IBF titles. But personally, I think he will beat Joshua.", 5381, "l3Jay0Mbaa", 0],
	35727 : ["I thought Fury had the possibility to be champ, but also that he never seemed to make an effort to have a plan.Â  Not until he fought Wilder did he really show he has some boxing skills. After his 1st Wilder fight I had a of certainty that Fury would beat Wilder.Â Â  Also, we can now be sure that Wilder never was a great fighter,Â  Fury proved that.Â  If there is a 3rd Fury/Wilder fight, I see Fury winning early; ie, 5th or 6th round by pressuring Wilder from the start of round 1.", 5381, "391fb23dafd355005ac7c816295c4b03aa", -1],

	35732 : ["They're professionals although that may not be enough if it starts to get a bit edgy. Â As former elite sportsmen they're also still going to have that extreme competitive urge. Â I'm hoping neither one of them gets hurt. Â I can't see this as a proper competitive, something on the line fight. Â It's an amble down memory lane.", 5383, "tHxhVr9paa", 0],
	35733 : ["Considering he's admitted it's basically an exhibition and a way for him to stay fit and the fights ain't that serious... I like it. Better than a full blown comeback against proper fighters. 2 legends in amateur fights for charity could help a lot of boxing undercards and I think they could do the sport some good. If we had Tyson V Holyfield on the fury AJ undercard for charity, it could help bring more eyes to the sport", 5383, "TdmTjKt8aa", 1],

Also, it is 3pm ET to 6:30pm ET. Their phone number is, 704-332-0173. 2nd sports radio show is from Monday to Friday, 12pm ET to 12:55pm ET. Their phone number is, 502-571-1080.

	35744 : ["Ward slightly overrated. Should've lost to Kovalev in their first match. Fought extremely dirty in the second match. Hes always been an unclean fighter and overall ugly to watch.Â  He couldve easily been disqualified from at least 2 or 3 fights. Certainly against Mikkel Kessler.Â ", 5374, "None", 0],
	35745 : ["I don't know much about Ward, but Calzaghe may have been the best fighter ever.Â  BTW, what ever happened to him? His fight with Roy Jones was nothing but fun for Calzaghe.Â  He gave Jones a beating,Â  BTW, they were only 2 years apart in age; Jones 36 Calzaghe 34.Â  Neither one was as they had been, but Calzaghe would have beat Jones 8 or 10 years back.", 5374, "391fb23dafd355005ac7c816295c4b03aa", -2],

	35748 : ["If he fights a proper heavyweight he will get knocked out, just like he did in his prime off buster Douglas. If he lasts the distance, he will be outclassed, just like he did in his prime against evander holyfield", 5384, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	35751 : ["Ali would win a unanimous decision. The speed of hand and foot would be the deciding factor. Ali talked very highly of Marciano. He said that he was much harder too hit than you would think. Also Rocky was very well conditioned and kept coming for 15 rounds. Ali would have to be at his brilliant best in top condition and be ready to move and groove for 15 solid rounds.Â ", 5375, "Xm8crry3aa", 3],
	35752 : ["Duran is another Marco's maidana. He's flat footed and he struggle against people who used angles like Leonard. Mayweather style was similar to Ray. I have Mayweather implenting the same game plan and taking a decision win.Â ", 5376, "vrQdic06aa", -2],
	35753 : ["Duran in the early 80s version takes any version of Floyd.Â  Floy admitted himself he took the biggest fights in his career at the right time meaning he carefully selected his opponents when he felt he could beat them.Â ", 5376, "None", 2],
	35754 : ["Mayweather.  Mayweather probably would have beaten Leonard, and we all know what Leonard did to Duran.", 5376, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", -2],
