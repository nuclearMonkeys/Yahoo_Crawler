By reducing your stress, you will actually feel less apprehension, which will automatically reduce the appearance of apprehension.Â  Other than that, talking to others without giving that vibe is just something that becomes more natural from experience and practice. So the long term answer is to keep talking to people anyway, even if you haven't got all the apprehension out of the way yet. Good luck. Take comfort in the fact that others won't think about your mood as much as you do or for as long as you think about it.
