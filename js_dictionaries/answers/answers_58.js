	2912 : ["In general Americans think that since  the world revolves around them they have no need to learn about the world.  In addition, if you watch American news most of the content is domestic news and maybe one item  is foreign news. Even their TV weather maps show nothing beyond their borders.  As an example the only time Canada is mentioned in the news  is during the winter when our arctic air  invades the US.  Since each state in the US sets its own educational standards maybe \"world\" geography isn't taught. Other than those Americans who live along the US - Canada border Americans know very little about us Canadians- their northern neighbours. Perhaps the geographic location of N America plays a part. ", 465, "6Whuc4WXaa", -2],

	2919 : ["No.  There are several instances where an island is not \"just an island\". There are large masses of vegetation in lakes and rivers where the surface seems like an island, but is a floating body that moves around.  Many in the delta of the Nile River change the landscape often.   Some in Lake Titicaca actually have people building homes on them.  Loops in the Mississippi River have sandbars that can grow into an island, but soon disappear if there is a flood.  Manmade bodies for bridge supports or tunnel entrances are in San Francisco's Golden Gate, and in the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey and town on the north coast of France looks like an island often, but when the tide goes out, people can walk on a causeway to it from the mainland.  So it varies from island to peninsula.", 479, "2yFSkim8aa", 2],

	2942 : ["Form my perspective in Britain, any part of the world which does not directly face the ocean is landlocked. Thus Illinois is landlocked. I know that the Great Lakes are very large bodies of water, and in fact I crossed Lake Superior and Lake Huron in 1956 by passenger steamer (built 1907, would you believe), spending 2 nights on the ship.  But I still find it hard to think of any inland area of a continent as not being landlocked. In my mind, the connection of the Great Lakes by canal and river to the general body of the world's oceans does not count.   A direct, tidal connection is needed. All of the Great Lakes are well above normal sea level. The lack of approval for my notion shows an obvious difference between Britain and the USA on such matters.

I certainly knew that Brazil was a huge country in South America. Then I had to re-learn some of them in the 1960s and 70s because the African ones, especially, changed their names as we in Europe and Britain decolonised.  But never mind, things are always changing. I am a little surprised that you had not heard of Brazil until recently, especially as the Olympic Games were held there not so long ago.
