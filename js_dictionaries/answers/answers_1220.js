	66531 : ["Christians get lost in the romantic notion of a wedding and forget that a marriage is a legal contract, fist and foremost. A homosexual person would want to protect their partner, offspring and assets the same was a heterosexual would.  Common law couples simply do not have the same rights as a married couple, and wills and even custody can be contested in court, particularly if the family did not \"approve\" of the deceased choice in partner.  In the end the bereaved can really make life a living hell for each other.....which is the last thing the deceased would have wanted. Marriage ultimately would protect the surviving partner, homosexual or not, from legal battles that could arise.  A person, homosexual or not, should be able to have the peace of mind upon death that their loved ones will be taken care of in the way want them to be. It is the most responsible choice. Edit:  Meg M if you actually believe that article, then you are very naive.  For an accurate account on how straight people with children behave, catch an episode of Maury Povich,", 8332, "6f71b2cd793ff1b2e18fbf2a075142a9aa", 3],
	66532 : ["So, are you asking me whether they should by law be able to be married, or are you asking me whether I will approve of them being married. Two very different issues. Two very different issues.  Okay, so you're equating those sins with the sin of homosexual sex.  So, let's look at qualifications for marriage in the process. Murderers? What was the original reason for the murder. Was it an accident, self-protection, premeditated? Has this person been rehabilitated, or is that a recent crime? Will that person commit murder again? If they are reformed, I feel that they are capable of being a decent marriage partner, especially if it was not a murder out of rage, revenge or premeditation.  Same with burglary...is this a case of thievery out of lack of option for food, or was this a case of burglary  just because they wanted something without earning it? If they are reformed, then they are capable of a marriage.  Extortionists? I can't see any reason that this person would have the capacity to love and care for someone. They are too selfish. Child molesters....don't even get me started. They should never marry, because of the potential to create children. Once a molester, most likely they will always be a molester. And, this is a non-issue relating to the issue of gay marriage, as no one in their right mind would think a child molester should ever marry, including same sex marriage advocates.  So, we're now left with the homosexuals and whether it is acceptable for them to marry. Are they a decent person, and will they be faithful and committed to their partner for life and not stray from their promises to one another?  Maybe I'm wrong, but from what I understand about homosexual couples, they don't necessarily agree to one partner for life. I sincerely hope I am wrong on this. If they are likely to have an open marriage, I don't see them as a good candidate for marriage as it goes against the very idea of what marriage is about.  However, if they can remain committed and faithful to their partner, then as long as they don't try to force a minister to perform the ceremony and want a civil union (which is the legal term for a marriage), then I'm okay with it.", 8332, "None", 0],

	66545 : ["It was a set-up, arranged by a sadistic bully. Yahweh lied to Adam and Eve (he told them that if they ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they would die that very day), and then he left them alone with the serpent (who may, or may not, be the same entity you call 'satan' and 'Lucifer'), knowing that the serpent would tell them the truth, and that they would eat the fruit, so that Yahweh would have an excuse to punish all of them. Which makes me, personally, very happy that I am descended from the first creation, and not from one of Yahweh's little pets.", 8333, "KnTrvQd6aa", 0],
	66546 : ["Remember that Lucifer fell some time before Adam and Eve were created. Along with that there were other devils and evil as well. The serpent told Eve to eat, and not Lucifer. Although the serpent is a form of evil, and might have been one of the devils. Now to your question: God would not allow sinners in the garden, but just because God knows you're going to sin one day, doesn't mean you can't be in the garden if you haven't sinned yet. There were many animals in the garden, and there was no sin yet. But once man fell, they were kicked out. Now why would God let the serpent in? Well although God did know again it doesn't mean he will punish you before doing the act. Same logic, why did God create Adam and Eve, if he knew they were going to sin. Why did Jesus choose Judas as on of the disciples, if he knew he was going to turn him in? God's knowledge doesn't mean that he won't give people the chance. God only knows because he's God, but it's your own choice. Quick example: a parent has two kids, one of them hardworking and the other really lazy. He gives an assignment to both of them, and he knows 100% the hardworking kid will start the assignment right away, and he also knows 100% the lazy one will wait about a week to start on it. His knowledge did not prevent him though from giving an assignment to both. hope that makes sense", 8333, "yDgxAHO9aa", -2],
	66547 : ["Even more importantly why are divorcees allowed to remarry?  Jesus never said anything about homosexuals, but he was quite clear that remarrying after divorce is the same as adultery. Edit: It should be noted for particularly dense believers that the Bible says nothing about who marriage should be between, it does, however, say that two men should not sleep together in a married woman's bed but it never ever says anything about two men or two women marrying.  On the other hand, it does imply that we can have as many concubines and we can support.", 8332, "AA10556726", 5],
	66548 : ["I used to sugar coat these answers to avoid getting into confrontations with the Christian supremacists but now I don't care anymore.  You've got modern mental health experts and medical science saying it's not a sickness and a bunch of people who think their fairytale book of stone age mythology trumps it.  I call that willful stupidity and I have no patience for anyone who tries to fly it.  I'd be equally remiss in listening to anything the Ku Klux Klan has to say. \"Chuck Norris\" gave a very revealing answer.  Like so many before him, he focuses on the sexual aspect of the relationship and not the love and commitment.

The comma goes between consequences and but. Read the sentences aloud.  Where you pause, that's where a comma goes. Also, commas denote asides, like if you're specifying things...for instance Green Eggs and Ham is a specification of your favorite book.
