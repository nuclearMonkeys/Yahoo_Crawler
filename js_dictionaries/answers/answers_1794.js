McGahee is obvious because he's running against the DET defense but I'd take SJax against a \"pretty good\" SEA defense over T. Barber against a \"really good\" ATL defense.  Plus, ATL is getting Abraham (DE) and Hartwell (LB) back on defense for the first time since the 1st game of the season.  No way Tiki runs wild on the Falcons.  You made a good choice: SJax & McGahee I have to disagree with you on QB though.  I'd start Grossman vs. ARI instead of Hasselbeck vs. STL.  Arizona is terrible and Grossman is the real deal.  I'm not saying he's on the level of the Manning's, Brady's and Palmers....but Grossman is not fluke.  As long as he's healthy, Grossman will put up big numbers.

	95468 : ["I think that it's way to early to tell if he was a steal, a bust, or a decent pick. Personally I think he will be good if not great. In order for him to be as good as Reggie Wayne, he will need some things to go his way, those being: O-Line has to live up to the hype, after signing Stacy Andrews, possibly getting back Shawn Andrew, and trading for Jason Peter from buffalo; we might have an elite O-line, if they have good chemistry. McNabb has to be more consistent. I love McNabb, I think that he could easily be one of the best QB's if he was more consistent. He has one of the best W-L ratios, in the top 3 I believe, with Brady and Manning. He also has a great TD-INT ratio, but have you seen some of his incompletions...they are sometimes very off. McNabb must also stay healthy, if Maclin doesn't play entire seasons with McNabb, they won't have the chemistry that Manning and Harrison had; plus, I don't think having a \"rookie\" Kolb will help his chances. Desean Jackson must become an elite receiver. He gave the Eagles a magnificent year last year, but that doesn't mean he's not able to have a sophomore slump, or worse go from promising to bust like TB's Michael Clayton. If Jackson can play up to the level many Eagle's fans now expect, then Maclin will have a better chance of becoming great. Kind of like Harrison drawing coverage early in Wayne's career. Brian Westbrook must stay healthy as well, since he draws the most attention from the defense. If Westbrook can get defenses to pay attention to him and neglect maclin, then maclin will see more touchdowns than if Westbrook wasn't on the field. Lesean McCoy may need to become a successor to Westbrook, I mean after all Westbrook is reaching his 30's, and Maclin is just starting his career. Hey kevo, DeSean Jackson was also praised for his return skills more than his receiving skills, and you saw how he came out...plus great receivers need that elusiveness to get YAC, the same elusiveness Maclin uses to make great returns.", 9551, "None", 0],
