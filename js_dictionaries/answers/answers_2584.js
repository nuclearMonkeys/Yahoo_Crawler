If you're on antidepressants, cod liver oil may boost their effects. But if you are on antidepressants, you shouldn't stop taking them without medical supervision. Most antidepressants have to be tapered off, or you get withdrawal symptoms and get depressed all over again. Your doctor can change your prescription if you're ready to taper off the antidepressants. And because any supplement may interact with any drug, you should run it by your doctor before you start taking cod liver oil along with antidepressants. If you're not on antidepressants but have been advised to go on them, and you're wondering if you could just take cod liver oil instead, the answer is maybe. If you're only mildly depressed, a supplement could be just what you need, and if you are only mildly depressed, you probably don't need antidepressants. But cod liver oil doesn't necessarily have that effect for everyone. You would need to give it some time to see if it helps your depression, and if it doesn't, then consider something else. And if your depression is worse than mild, cod liver oil won't do it.", 11264, "h6IMX8Bjaa", 0],

Trump has never been in politics, so he won't \"fake\" his way into it and say he's gunna do all this stuff and then never does it.  I truly believe he will follow through.  And the whole thing about the Muslim ban, I think our country needs that right now.  Yes, there are good Muslims just looking for an escape, but honestly, we can't take that chance.  We can't even take care of OUR OWN vets...tons of them are homeless and live on the street.  This is THEIR country, and we're trying to invite other people in to house them.  It just doesn't make sense, and Trump said he wanted to TEMPORARILY put a ban on having these Muslims.  With Isis, we just can't afford that risk.  And the whole thing about the Mexicans.....Obama says \"oh, you snuck past the border, but it's okay if you do this little thing and pay this fine..\" No.  I have Mexican friends who are IRATE about that.  They came here legally and did everything they were supposed to.  Why do the illegal ones get a slap on the wrist?  It's just not right.

We are talking about actual American citizens who were put into concentration camps because their parents were born in the wrong nation. Not only did America completely agree, and support FDR, but they also kept reelecting him as President. He literally could have been King of the United States if he had lived long enough. Fast forward to 2015, and you see Donald Trump wanting to do the exact same thing FDR did. What changed? Why are you Americans suddenly in opposition to something you whole-heartedly agreed with, AND supported when FDR did it? Why have you Americans suddenly decided to reverse your stance? And I mean this as a serious question, America. I genuinely want to know.

	135027 : ["If it anyone, it Chavo Guerrero. I mean, if WWE really wanted to pay tribute to Eddie Guerrero, why not give him the honor and privilege of a push to his Nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Chavo Guerrero is one of the most underrated wrestler in WWE in my opinion. His In-Ring Wrestling Skills is very good in my opinion, and his mic skills is underrated. Now, I believe when Chavo was misused is whenever he lost to Kane at Wrestlemania XXIV, he lost his ECW Championship to Kane in eight seconds, that was when I believe Chavo's position is starting to take place. He then got involved in The Undertaker-Edge feud, because he was a member of the La Familia, but Edge betray every member of La Familia and that includes Chavo Guerrero. So, it basically waste Chavo's time in the WWE. Then at 2009, he was in a feud with Santina Marella, and one of those matches was a Hog Pen Match, are you really kidding me? Then he feuded with Hornswoggle, and he lost to Hornswoggle a couple of times, are you really kidding me WWE? Fortunately, he picks up a victory against Primo, and it started a Mini-Feud with Primo, but that really didn't make up for what happen to Chavo. Now, when he move to Smackdown, he form an Alliance to take out Christian with Dolph Ziggler, which in my opinion I thought Chavo was going to get a push, but once again, WWE didn't. Then in now, this year. Chavo actually turned Face which I thought would be a good thing, only to see this Face turn be short-lived. So I believe Chavo is arguably the most misused wrestler there is for now in the WWE.", 11257, "TjZf8D9Naa", 3],

Whether he was face or heel, the fans would fully support or despise him, and very few Superstars have or had that ability.

One WWE championship reign and getting more recognition in the end of his career for constantly losing than by being the wrestling mastermind he was.

	135029 : ["For me, it was, is, and will always be Kane. In his prime (1997-2003), Kane was such an intimidating monster. He was the real deal. He scared the hell out of me when I was a child. He lost sometimes, but only to great stars such as The Rock, Stone Cold, The Undertaker, and Triple H. And he also had at least one victory over these guys in his prime, he also won WWE Championship from Stone Cold in 1998. But, since he took off his mask in 2003, I don't think Kane was ever the same again. I know the first few months, his character was cool. He was depressed and frustrated as hell, later turned heel and ebat the living hell out of everybody. But, after that I think since his face turn in 2004 in his feud against Snistky, I think Kane has been nothing, but a jobber to the stars. Kane has jobbed from monsters to monsters : Snitsky (2004), Umaga (2006), fake masked (2006),  The Great Khali (2007),Mark Henry (2007), Batista, etc. And even he got beaten by M.V.P, Drew Mcintyre, and Rey Mytserio. This is like a complete WTF. A man who go from beating Stone Cold Steve Austin for WWE Title to jobbing to Rey Mysterio, Drew, and M.V.P??? WWE has completely misused Kane in my honest opinion. WWE screwed up his great character. He had a pretty good gimmick and his feud with The Undertaker is one of the reason WWE wins Monday Night Wars. His feud with The Undertaker during Attitude Era really took WWE into new heights. Not to mention, Kane's one of WWE's most loyal perfomer. He never jump ships to other companies such as WCW, TNA, and others. So, is this the way WWE repay one of its greatest and most loyal Superstar? After a short time holding WHC for 2nd time, he falls back to mid card tag team division.  One more thing, this saddens me when a new WWE Fan think Kane's nothing, but a bald glorified jobber. I have tried to explain to them, and if they don't want to listen, this is really frustrating. They should have watched Kane in his prime and they will know who he truly is.", 11257, "kXrohLMjaa", 8],
