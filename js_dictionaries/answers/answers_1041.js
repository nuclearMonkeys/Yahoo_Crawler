	57529 : ["Absolutely.Â Â  It's like gossip and so-called \"reality\" showsÂ  -Â  people are so desperate for gossip to fill their emptiness that whatever they're shown, they believe.Â  News is no different.Â  They are shown what gives the broadcaster the highest revenue and the presenters are generally \"beautiful\" to make our perception even more realistic and trustworthy. However,Â  if media were to be questioned, they'd shut down anything negative.Â  In New Zealand, all forms of news media are becoming increasingly censored so commenting against them results in bans or non-publication of those comments.", 7982, "Tfbntl4Qaa", 1],
	57530 : ["Yes lots. Even entertainment media is censored e.g. superfluous military rescues are inserted and police have to dive out of the way rather than getting killed. When a US soldier executed a wounded prisoner in a mosque no US networks broadcast the footage and it was downplayed in the UK. Very few US citizens know specifically what reasons Bin Laden gave for 9/11 and Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi isn't a household name in the west, as it still is in Iraq. The book Guantanamo Diaries contains multiple consecutive pages which are fully redacted. There's far more US media censorship now than there was during Vietnam. Where are the equivalent images from the Gulf compared to the famous photo of the girls US soldiers set on fire in Vietnam? Nowadays 'democracies' don't even tell their citizens how many wars they're fighting, let alone give them a choice. Try emailing the ruling party or it's opposition and asking how many wars your country is fighting and which side it's on. I've made two official Freedom of Information requests in Britain and asked two MPs. They won't give a straight answer about the total number of wars, just that none of them are against \"states\". I've also received no response from the British military about whether they have a policy of running over the children they inveigle with sweets just in case they're part of an ambush", 7982, "8na9oPlJaa", 0],

	57538 : ["It really wouldn't have made any difference. The Americans had defeated the greatest military power in the world barely 30 years before the war broke out. From the American perspective, the British weren't honoring the treaty agreement they'd signed in Paris in 1783. The Treaty of Paris stipulated that Britain agreed to recognize American sovereignty and territorial integrity, but they weren't honoring those clauses in the contract. The British were attempting to entice Native Americans to harass American settlers on the frontier and they were impressing American sailors and forcing them to sail for Britain. The Americans had attempted to find a peaceful resolution, but one could not be found. The Americans never wanted to annex Canada, but the prospect of removing Atlantic Canada as a base of operations for the British was an attractive proposition.Â  If the American Revolution was the quintessential David versus Goliath, the War of 1812 wasn't much different. Whereas there was a definitiveÂ  victor the first time around, the second time there really wasn't. Why? Well, the simple answer is because both sides basically just decided that it wasn't worth it anymore. Despite being defeated back in 1781, the British had managed to win a few major battles. 1812 was no different. The British won some battles, but they weren't able to win enough of them and they weren't able to win a decisive one. In fact, the most definitive battle of the war came two weeks after an official end to the fighting had been declared when Jackson positively routed the British at the Battle of New Orleans. The plain and simple fact is that the British were fighting Napoleon in Europe and the fighting in North America wasn't a huge priority. While Napoleon's forces were on the run, the Americans had managed to convince the British that it would essentially be 1781 all over again if they didn't come to the bargaining table.Â  During the Revolutionary War the British had managed to hold New York City, and that hadn't impeded the Americans enough to cost them the war. The burning of Washington, D.C. may have been a symbolic blow to the Americans, but it hardly impacted the fighting in any way. When the British bombardment of Baltimore failed and their forces were routed on Lake Champlain, it became clear that they could either make a deal or be in for a long, hard fight against an enemy they'd already been stupid enough to underestimate twice before. They chose to make a deal.Â  And what a deal it was. The Americans didn't cede an inch of territory, and while it was agreed that the border between the US and Canada would be surveyed and finalized later, the Americans came out ahead there too when they got most of the Aroostook Valley. All in all, the Americans came out of the war stronger than they were at its outset, and when things heated up between the US and Canada over the border between British Columbia and what would become the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, the British gave in to US demands to avoid war.Â  The illiterate retard armorer has been copying and pasting the same horseshÄ±t for years now. The British could issue medals for being annihilated at Singapore and it wouldn't make any difference. History would remain the same - the British were decimated in Singapore. No medal could change that fact. The United States is the richest, wealthiest, most powerful, and most influential country in the world today - and it's because the British were too weak to stop that from happening. The British have become an American colony, the 51st state. Washington, D.C. - the city they failed to subjugate 206 years ago, is now the place where the policies Britons have to follow are made. No country except for maybe Spain or Portugal has fallen as far as the UK has. Even if the British had managed to win the War of 1812, which the Treaty of Ghent that they signed says they didn't, the Americans would still be their masters today.Â ", 7947, "None", 2],
