I later learned that he re-incorporated his record lable from Dublin, Ireland to Amsterdam, Holland but Holland has more favorable tax rates.  After I learned this, I lost all respect for Bono.

Like it or not, most of the people volunteering their time in third world countries for medical and humanitarian reasons have some sort of religious bent.

	67155 : ["Hair grease is a build up of sebum produced by the skin of the scalp, the same sticky oil that causes acne and other lesions on the face and body. On the scalp excess oil gets clotted up with dead skin cells, dirt and sweat. A build up of oil and dead skin can lead to an over-growth of a yeast type fungus called malassezia. Normally malassezia eats the oil and dead skin and helps keep hair and scalp healthy. When there's too much oil it goes crazy and reproduces like rabbits in the spring.  A dandruff shampoo for oily hair will bring the oil and the fungus under control. Use frequently as needed and wash with the warmest water you can take. To bring the oil under control you might need to wash every day for a week or two. Don't let oil build up because that makes it more difficult to clean away. You don't get oily hair from shampooing too much and you can't \"train\" hair to make less oil. Hair is dead, it's like trying to train a dead dog to roll over. And it's the scalp that makes oil, not the hair. That advice is like trying to control acne by washing the face once week.  Uncontrolled oily hair that seems oily even after washing could need a dermatologist's help. Something else is going on with the skin. It might need a stronger cleaning shampoo or it could be a sign of a skin problem. Men seem to produce a lot more oil than women (because of testosterone, the male hormone) and while most greasy hair goes away the polder you get some are always struggling with sebum their whole life. ", 8391, "qQqC2cHIaa", -1],
