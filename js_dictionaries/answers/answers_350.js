Here's my opinion for this: There's nothing wrong with having a regular job since it consistently pays us and it provides us lots of benefits.   People are trying to run their own business because of many reasons like earning much money. The harder they work for their business, the higher it pays them back through profit. Another reason is having a flexible schedule. They can spend more time with their families since they are the boss of their own business. They have the privilege to decide and able to apply their creativity on it. That's an example why people try to run their business.

Handles that are put on with a screwdriver.  Something that you could have done YOURSELF.  Cost would be the handles. or maybe $30 for the pair. All you had to do is take off a handle and pocket it and go to HOME DEPOT or HOME  HARDWARE or similar store to the plumbing section and find what you want.  Pay at the register and you got your new handles.   Takes maybe 5 minutes to do both. . So, JUST DRIVING TO YOUR HOUSE was a bother.  You are paying from the moment he gets in his car and drives.  It seems you got him to do the shopping too? So from your place then drive to the store to get handles that fit and drive back to your house and install them using 2 screws. . You were more of a BOTHER because he was not doing real plumbing.  For bothering him you paid for it. His time(which includes running around FOR YOU). Using his gas in his car to do this TRIVIAL THING, yeah money is how he is compensated. .This is the interesting part \"Now I am stuck. It is tub handles and would be too expensive in labor to have someone else come out and do it.\" . WHY is this beyond your capabilities to do yourself? Do you lack hands or eyes?  Why do you need \"someone else\"? They may only charge $800. A screwdriver costs a couple bucks an because you brought in the old handle, they can match it up for you in the store to a vast array of handle styles. Done.

Since pool bottoms are usually white in color as your is, they reflect nearly all solar radiation so little solar heating occurs. If the bottom of the pool were BLACK then the sun would be able to heat the pool quite well without a cover or with a clear cover.

	17968 : ["It is a \"pyramid scheme\" and very illegal.  Yes, it is a scam. Sadly the person who is promoting it to you may not yet have figured out that it is a scam, or that it is illegal.  Basically the person, or business,  who starts it makes a killing. The people on the second or third tier might make money or just break even. After that the person who started it typically stops communicating.  Those on the next level seldom break even, and everyone after that looses. I am guessing that your friend is on the third or fourth tier. The person who first started it, or even the second tier members have likely already exited the queue, and closed their Facebook accounts.  Those who got suckered in will always say, \"it is a promotion\" and pressure you. Odd are he or she will keep extending it until he or she breaks even, gives up, or gets arrested. Odds are he or she was promised a big TV, game console, or maybe even a car if he or she was able to get enough members. I have seen these many times.  Some accept Amazon gift cards, but most want you to pay using cash, or Western Union. Facebook is loaded with scams.  Nothing about Facebook legitimizes a business.  There is no reason to trust anyone or any business over another person or business just because they have a presence on Facebook. Anyone can pretend to be someone else on facebook.  There is no validation process built into Facebook. I am not sure to whom you can report it.
