	139218 : ["1. When someones still labels Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair at WM 24 as Flair's retirement match?  I'm surprised and disappointed that so many people still think the WWE is the only promotion that matters.  I'm also quite baffled that out of the thousands of storylines the WWE has done the past 26 years that the Ric Flair \"retirement\" storyline is the only one they believed to be NOT a storyline.  For being such supposedly \"smart\" fans who spend so much time relying on spoiler/rumor sites to tell them the \"real story\", they sure got took with the Flair \"retirement\" storyline. 2. When someone says Ric Flair is still retired?  I just point out that the \"retirement\" storyline in the WWE was just that, a storyline. 3. If someone says 'Since they're on different brands, I don't think the match can ever happen' when you create your own Wrestlemania card and book a match like Undertaker vs John Cena?  The \"brands\" are not relevant anymore.  It's just RAW and Smackdown, two WWE shows they can wrestle on.  Vince and the crayon-wielders move wrestlers around whenever they want.  No wrestler is locked-in to one show and CAN'T appear on the other one. 4. When WWE belittles the fans' intelligence by erasing history or playing with facts?  This is one of the reasons I have little respect for Vince McMahon.  He's a liar, a thief, a manipulator, and a user (of people), and he has no conscience when it comes to screwing anybody over to put a couple more bucks into his bank account or to make people believe he's a \"genius\" and that HE created or invented pro wrestling and everything about it. 5. When someone still says Ted DiBiase Jr is the fittest man to end The Streak?  I just laugh at that. 6. When someone says The Streak is an obscure accomplishment?  That person is either an Undertaker-hater or doesn't know what Wrestlemania is. 7. When someone is still hoping for people like The Rock and Stone Cold to return and bring back Attitude Era?  These are people with their fingers in their ears, chanting \"la la la la\" to drown out anybody who tries to explain that \"Attitude Era\" types of storylines, characters, and matches can be found pretty much in any promotion except for the WWE.  These people have also romanticized that Era into something better than it actually was. 8. When someone actually believes The Rock will ever return when his movie career is doing great?  I can understand and sympathize with them.  I didn't think RVD would ever return, either.  It's tough to \"lose\" a favorite and you always hold out hope that he will return someday. 9. When someone is still hoping for Stone Cold to wrestle one last match despite the fact his neck is too injured to do so?  Same reaction as for number 8.  In The Rock's case, it's a choice he made.  In Austin's case, he doesn't have a choice.  The next bump he takes could very easily make a quadriplegic of him.  I try to point that out. 10. To this question:  Answered this one directly.", 11417, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 5],
	139219 : ["1. I laugh. I know that match was very special and quite emotional in the begging but I think everyone knew that Ric Flair wasn't retired permanently. I mean he's Ric Flair! He's stuck around wwe since the beginning and him just retiring was kinda laughable but I still cried during that match. What I'm a wussy 2. Like I said before I find it hilarious. Retired means out of the business for good. Not behind the scenes action with no wrestling. I knew Ric would never not be able to stay away from the biz.  3. Never say never in the wwe. Just because there on different brands doesn't mean they won't ever wrestle against each other or together. Vince is a business man and does all he can to promote wrestling. So always expect the unexpected from him.  4. I'm kinda saddened that wwe thinks were not smart enough to comprehend that they do these things behind our backs. Especially since we dedicated our lives to watching and supporting his program.  5. God I love Ted. He's a great wrestler and has so much potential but Ted ending Undertakers streak is very laughable to me.  6. I kinda agree. It is hard for me to wrap my mind around the streak and she that Undertaker has this almost immortal like presence at WM.  7. I try to be kind but some fans are pretty damn stubborn. Even if IF we ever have an attitude era it will never be the same as last time. Plus wrestles never stay in the biz forever (unless your ric flair) they have lives outside of wrestling and other endures they want to try. I just say keep on wishing people.  8. The Rock had his run and is now a movie star. Stop dreaming for stuff you know is never going to happen. Not trying to be mean or break little kids hearts but come one? It's been how long now and we still get questions like \"Do you think the Rock will ever return?\" Let go of the past people and enjoy the present.  9. Some people or kids mainly don't have the concept that Wrestlers are not immortal or bullet proof and alot of old wrestlers have injuries that don't allow them to wrestle again. Sometimes you have to lay it to them straight. If Stone Cold ever wrestled again there is a great chance he can injure his beck further and become paralyzed or quite possibly die. Do you want that on your plate? Do you want to see him injured? No? Then stop pestering him about it.", 11417, "kx4M1nvvaa", 1],

	139233 : ["1. I just take it that they haven't watched TNA. To call Flair's Retirement Match at Mania 24 is appropriate for WWE only, however if you were talking about his retirement match in general, then I label it as his \"Semi Retired match\". 2. I'll just tell them Ric Flair is semi retired, just check out TNA and you'll see why. 3. I would say that it could happen, a inter-brand match has happened before and it can happen again if the two brands are still intact in the future. 4. I just tell them the facts anyway. What's done is done and you can't change the past. 5. I get angry because I don't think there is anyway possible Dibiase JR will end the streak, I just can't see it happening, nor will it happen. 6. I'll tell them to watch more WWE because I don't think his streak is that obscure, Yes it is obscure from the general public but so is most of wrestling. 7. Facepalm would be my only reaction. 8. I'll tell them over and over again Rock will NEVER wrestle again, he makes more money in the movie industry, plus when he was wrestling he was busting his *** 300 days a year, which is alot. 9. I'll tell them that Stone Cold's Neck is screwed up. 10. Answer is on the link.", 11417, "None", 1],
	139234 : ["1. Facepalm to that person....WWE retirement match? Fine. How can it be his retirement match if the man's still in the wrestling buisiness? 2. That's a step up from a facepalm to a head-desk. The man is obviousley not retired. Retired is what Shawn Micheals is. I honestly haven't heard from him since the Night after Wrestlemania. 3. That's dumb. WWE has people jumping brands like they're playing the ground is lava in a hotel room. I'm not even sure what brands Taker/HBK were on Last year...there's always room for interbrand matches. 4. Just like with IRS's kid Husky Harris....the WWE thinks they're tricking people or making them beleive something that's not true so they can brainwash this generation of little kids into being 'bad' wrestling fans. 5. suuu! No one is fit to beat the Undertaker at Wrestlemania. No one. 6. Bullshit. There's not much obscure about 20 years of hardwork culminating in one of the greatest Wrestling careers of all time. 7. Let it go. Stop living in the past, it drags down the present and the future. Those guys are done and won't wrestle anymore. 8. See #7 and who even cares? Not like I would really like to see 'Dwayne' anyways 9.People need to just leave the man alone....Christ Almighty. 10. Did it", 11417, "Voa5lfliaa", 2],
	139235 : ["1. I don't bat an eyelash or I either tell them about TNA.   2. I generally agree.  Look it, the man's not a full time wrestler.  He's a full time personality, but so is Hogan, but I'd consider both men retired from being full time wrestlers. 3. I tend to disagree.  Brands mean nothing, they never have, and they mean even less at Wrestlemania. 4. I roll my eyes.  But ignorance works in their favor in a lot of ways, so I don't blame them for using it. 5. I usually ask why they think so.  I never saw much in him. 6. I've never heard anyone say that, but I find it kind of ridiculous to say such a thing.  It's the biggest PPV in wrestling history and a man's never been defeated on the night where wrestlers arguably work their hardest. 7. I kind of laugh.  Not because I think the return of either is within the realm of impossibility, but because most elements that made Attitude a big deal are still present in wrestling and people are complaining about them.  I think what people generally mean when they say that is they want the good old days back, or they want something fresh and new, and the last time they got that was the Attitude Era. 8. Never say never.  I wouldn't call his movie career a slam dunk.  It's not as bad as Hogan's, but it's not great either.  People tend to fall back on wrestling when plans elsewhere go awry, and the man's already returned once for a short period, so I'm not saying never on it. 9. Austin's actually said in interviews that he still has about a handful of bouts in him, but he'd rather not risk health or his legacy.  He's not in Bret Hart or Dynamite Kid shape, he's in pretty good shape, it's just a matter of staying that way. 10. Why isn't there a question mark?", 11417, "7sa6B6Qhaa", 1],
