	55976 : ["Onychoschizia or splitting of the fingernails is a common problem seen by dermatologists. The term onychoschizia includes splitting, brittle, soft or thin nails. Onychoschizia is more common in women. Only very rarely are internal disease or vitamin deficiencies the reason (iron deficiency is the most common). One tip is that if the fingernails split, but the toenails are strong, then an external factor is the cause. Basically brittle nails can be divided into dry and brittle (too little moisture) and soft and brittle (often too much moisture).   The usual cause is repeated wetting and drying of the fingernails. This makes them dry and brittle. This is often worse in low humidity and in the winter (dry heat). The best treatment is to apply lotions containing alpha-hydroxy acids or lanolin containing lotions such as \"Elon\" (by the \"Dartmouth\" company) to the nails after soaking nails in water for 5 minutes and after getting the hands wet. Try to wear gloves when performing household chores that involve getting the hands wet to avoid repeated wetting and drying of the nails. Cotton lined rubber gloves can be purchased in stores. If soft, consider that the nails may be getting too much moisture or being damaged by chemicals such as detergents, cleaning fluids and nail polish removers (the acetone containing removers are somewhat worse than acetone free). Some feel that once a week application of clear nail prep once a week may help. Nail polishes with nylon fibers in them may add strength. Be gentle to you nails. Shape and file the nails with a very fine file and round the tips in a gentle curve. Daily filing of snags or irregularities helps to prevent further breakage or splitting. Avoid metal instruments on the nail surface to push back the cuticle. If the nails are \"buffed\" do this in the same direction as the nail grows and not in a \"back and forth\" motion because this can cause nail splitting. Biotin (a vitamin) taken by mouth is beneficial. Gets the \"Biotin ultra\" 1 mg. size as it also comes as much smaller pills and take 2 or three a day. It takes at least 6 months, but does really help at least 1/3 of the time. Do not take this if you are pregnant.

	56005 : ["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease of the lungs in which the airways become narrowed. This leads to a limitation of the flow of air to and from the lungs causing shortness of breath. In contrast to asthma, the limitation of airflow is poorly reversible and usually gradually gets worse over time. COPD is caused by noxious particles or gases, most commonly from smoking, which trigger an abnormal inflammatory response in the lung.[1][2] The inflammatory response in the larger airways is known as chronic bronchitis, which is diagnosed clinically when people regularly cough up sputum. In the alveoli, the inflammatory response causes destruction of the tissue of the lung, a process known as emphysema. The natural course of COPD is characterized by occasional sudden worsenings of symptoms called acute exacerbations, most of which are caused by infections or air pollution. The diagnosis of COPD requires lung function tests. Important management strategies are smoking cessation, vaccinations, rehabilitation and drug therapy (often using inhalers). Some patients go on to requiring long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.[1] Worldwide, COPD ranked sixth as the cause of death in 1990. It is projected to be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 due to an increase in smoking rates and demographic changes in many countries.[1] COPD is the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S., and the economic burden of COPD in the U.S. in 2007 was $42.6 billion in health care costs and lost productivity.[3][4] COPD is also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), chronic airflow limitation (CAL) and chronic obstructive respiratory disease.", 7893, "ZTchdNRjaa", 4],

	56008 : ["Little Miss Sunshine - very cute movie! I did enjoy that. I didn't enjoy Days Of Summer. Seven - every time, my second favourite movie! So interesting, the awesome twist at the end, Kevin Spacey playing such a great bad guy.  Gran Torino - I love the ending to this film, Clint's casual racism towards Toad and Clint's car. Good film overall. This Is England - I thought this film was hilarious in parts. But it was also very emotional in some parts, especially when Milky got punched to death (although not to death because he came back for This Is England '86. Great film, great director. Very tough one! Gonna go with Kill Bill just because there's two of them and they're both good (difficult to make a sequel that equals the success of the first movie, but very well done in this case!). Both fantastic films, love films with a good amount of violence in them and these two have plenty! Another tough one! It's widely established that OFOTCN is a better film. But I honestly think I prefer to watch Forrest Gump. I definitely like comedies better and I really think this is one of the best comedies ever. Slumdog Millionaire - I really rated this film. Very heart-warming and inspiring, complete contrast to Trainspotting, although both good films. Black Hawk Down - every time. One of my favourite war movies of all time. I did like Hurt Locker but it wasn't nearly as good. The Dark Knight - again, liked both films (thought IB was overrated though...). I love Dark Knight, everything about it is cool and Heath Ledger (RIP) played, in my opinion, the best movie villain ever. BQ: Looking to get Watchmen on DVD. I've watched it twice in the last month (Sky+) and think it's fantastic, wanna add it to my collection. I'd also like to get Leon (as per your previous recommendation!) and also The Wanderers.

Don't get any on you because it tends to migrate until it hits the bone and starts to eat it. supposedly very painfully.  Won't much affect the skin though. Phosphoric acid, on the other hand, won't react fast but it will eat your skin and flesh pretty good if you allow it to.  Burned a hole in my shoe once from an unseen drop of glacial H3PO4 (very strong phosphoric acid).  Didn't happen right away, only noticed it a few days later. You would probably be best suited to use a powerful caustic oxidant (base oxidizer).  Finish up with an acid on the bony residues. Inorganic solids tend to be salts made by combining a metal or alkali with a conjugate base of a weak acid, so tend to be amenable to destruction by strong acids. The conjugate base to a weak acid likes H+, which is, of course, why the acid is weak to begin with.  The base part won't let go of the H+ easily.  Flooding the place with lots of free H+ (via strong acid) will cause those bases to grab the H+ in place of whatever cation they have been attached to. Organic compounds are not generally salts so not so amenable to acid attack as a general rule.  They are much more amenable to attack by oxidants or other powerful organic solvents.  Strong bases do affect organic acids, like fatty acids, though (which is the general idea of soap, really).  But lots of the body won't much react to the base, you need an oxidant.  Some nice sodium hypochlorite (bleach) with heat will do a lot of destruction, but perchloric acid or hot sodium perchlorate, well, that will work even better.  Just more hazardous (can make some pretty vigorous reaction, explosively so).
