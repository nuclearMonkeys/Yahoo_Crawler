	65492 : ["What's your point? Did George Bush know about steroid use when he was part owner of the Texas Rangers. The ideology of less government...no transparency, accountability and oversight is the root cause of this bullshit.", 8298, "d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa", 2],

	65495 : ["I think that the right in America has gone a little paranoid schizophrenic. They're used to their discourse holding sway. They're not used to seeing the very basics, the very core of their belief system being attacked.  They are convincing themselves they are being attacked by 'a few extremist'. The problem is by those standards, common sense is more and more being classified as extremist.  Frankly, I can only hope that the 'cultural warriors' are finally losing the culture war. The rest of us are mostly just waking up to the fact they were serious and we were meant to fight back or die.", 8295, "LFWQiGYkaa", -1],
	65496 : ["Of course not. And I've never understood the twisted logic that abortions are bad, so we should not allow women to get contraceptives to prevent pregnancies.", 8295, "eulMjLtPaa", 1],
	65497 : ["No, Santorum is a stooge and a fool. In fact, the reason African Americans still live, to such a degree, in poverty is the LACK of family planning and, yes, abortions.  By having children when they are still children themselves too many Black girls are condemned to a life of poverty. If my daughter had gotten pregnant when 15 she would not have turned down college to stay home and be an unwed mother.  She would have become financially self-sufficient first.  Then, if she wanted 6 kids, she could have them when she could afford them. Lack of family planning is the largest contributor to current day economic slavery in America.  Every African American would be pro-choice if they truly understood the economics.", 8295, "None", -3],
	65498 : ["Call Al Sharpton, he will know if the race card was used. I think he was just trying to make a point and meant no harm to African America character on the contrary he is saying they always have had good moral judgment about the life of the unborn.

	65501 : ["Wow- what a gerbil brained question you ask. I don't actually think there is such an organization as \"Republican birthers.\"  I don't think Mitt Romney would have any trouble producing his birth certificate or proving he is a natural born citizen.       Mocking people who question the veracity of Obama's birth certificate which appears to be a well done forgery just seems to be sheep behavior on your part. The issue is that Obama is not a \"natural born citizen\". Google it so you can understand it. If you can stop acting so tribal for two or three minutes you might learn something.", 8296, "sfSgLZA5aa", -1],
	65502 : ["I'll feel it after I see the certificates. Every US president in historical past has offered proof of being born on US soil (beginning certificate). Obama is the primary to not achieve this. Why? What do you must disguise Mr. President? No one has come as much as say anything like \"yea, I keep in mind we had type together in eighth grade\". Each different former president was once known to others means before they grew to be president. I needed to provide my original beginning certificates to get my rattling license.

	65509 : ["Pretty much, although the Reps in Congress during Clinton's reign are somewhat to blame as well (and I'm a Rep).  But don't worry, this tidbit of info will never become widely known - the media will not report on this.  *sigh*", 8298, "THRtsl83aa", 0],
	65510 : ["Yes. Obama in a statement yesterday blamed the shocking new round of subprime-related bankruptcies on the free-market system, and specifically the \"trickle-down\" economics of the Bush administration, which he tried to gig opponent John McCain for wanting to extend. But it was the Clinton administration, obsessed with multiculturalism, that dictated where mortgage lenders could lend, and originally helped create the market for the high-risk subprime loans now infecting like a retrovirus the balance sheets of many of Wall Street's most revered institutions. Tough new regulations forced lenders into high-risk areas where they had no choice but to lower lending standards to make the loans that sound business practices had previously guarded against making. It was either that or face stiff government penalties. The untold story in this whole national crisis is that President Clinton put on steroids the Community Redevelopment Act, a well-intended Carter-era law designed to encourage minority homeownership. And in so doing, he helped create the market for the risky subprime loans that he and Democrats now decry as not only greedy but \"predatory.\"", 8298, "None", 7],
	65511 : ["As Bill said, \"It depends how you define 'is' \"  :-) In this case, the question is \"How do you define \"forced\"?\"  What Bill did was to lower the capitalization limits required, and to lower the creditworthiness levels required for a mortgage to be considered \"sub-prime\".  While no bank was \"forced\" to adopt the new lower rules, any bank that did not would have been at a severe competitive disadvantage with regard to the others, so the reality is that they ALL adopted the new limits.  Remember, the banks that write mortgage loans only 'very' rarely keep them on their books. In general, the mortgages are bundled up and sold as investment vehicles through Fannie Mae / Freddy Mac. So if a bank is trying to offer mortgage loans, knowing that they are going to turn around and resell them right away, they have no reason to impose credit requirements any stricter than they have to to keep their mortgages compliant.

	65512 : ["There is a much better argument. \"Margaret Sanger is founder of Planned Parenthood, a liberal Democrat organization, and through Planned Parenthood, advocated abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called \"socially undesirable people\". \"We do not want word to get out that we want to exterminate the ***** population\" Who spoke these words? The Klu Klux Klan? Aryan Nations? The National Socialist (Nazi) Party? These are the words of Margaret Sanger, Founder of Planned Parenthood, the largest provider and promoter of legal abortion in the United States. Most Blacks support the genocide of their own race without even knowing it.", 8295, "GViI1Nxpaa", 1],
	65513 : ["Not sure about that, but the abortion movement was started to weed out blacks.  Look it up.  Margaret Sanger.  Also half of all African American pregnancies end in abortion.  You should never vote based on your race, but there is an argument to be made that abortion hurts blacks more than any other group.  If that concerns you, vote pro-life.  If it doesn't, then don't.", 8295, "W94ePLfBaa", -1],
	65514 : ["Because you accepted a document proved to be a forgery, then a document that indicated out-of-state birth, then a picture of a hand holding an unidentifiable piece of paper, then a document Obama's LAWYER says is a forgery - all as \"proof\" that Obama's AUTO-biographical claims are false.

FULL background check with full disclosure, public. If you don't want to have that public, DON'T run for President. Thank you.

	65520 : ["Of course.  He's running for president on the promise that he will continue it.  He's been promising to stay in Iraq for 100 years.  If he's elected, that means the majority of Americans (or if he cheats like Bush did, at least close to half) want that.  So it would be in his best interest to continue. :o(", 8299, "None", 0],
	65521 : ["Did the DNC fax over their deranged talking points to you after the cocktail hour? It sounds like they've been DRINKING again. That stuff is so off-base that it's pathetic. Obama doesn't know sh^t from Shinola about economic policy and would send the country into a tailspin worse than Carter did. The policies he and the Democrats are proposing are almost identical to the FAILED foolishness that led to the double digit inflation and horrendous unemployment of the Carter years. Foreclosures? How about 22% interest rates on home mortgages? Home building at a complete standstill. Gas lines around the block. You could only buy gas on alternate days depending on your license plate number. Sometimes the pumps ran out before you got there so you had to wait two days. Nice, huh? That was the direct result of the Windfall Profits tax - just like Obama's bright idea. The cost of the Iraq war? It's equal to 1% of GDP. The defense budget during the Carter years was 12% of GDP and we still survived. The defense budget didn't start dropping until Reagan ended the Cold War. The entire defense budget now is 3.9% of GDP - lower than during the Clinton Adminsitration when he was trashing the military so he could claim his \"peace dividend.\" McCain has NEVER \"vowed to attack Iran\" or do any of the other crap that you have imagined.

	65523 : ["The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, whose provisions were strengthened during the Clinton administration, is a federal law that MANDATES lenders to offer credit throughout their entire market and discourages them from restricting their credit services to high-income markets, a practice known as redlining.

	65524 : ["President Clinton was part of it.  In the mid 90s housing prices just took off and banks decided to throw out the qualification rules - we'll lend you the money no matter what your current income because housing prices will rise forever.  Then, in 2001, the President Bush took all of the controls off the brokerage house and let them be banks, too.  In 2007 President Bush cancelled the \"uptick rule\" and then the fun really started. Hands down, this is a failure due to deregulation.", 8298, "VJ0QCn8xaa", 0],

	65526 : ["So should Mexicans be allowed to be citizens. Anyone not born in the US was denied rights. The argument is that blacks did not have rights. Mexicans do not have rights. Ergo, both groups should have rights. Embryos and Mexicans should have rights as citizens.", 8295, "1QBqmgEyaa", -2],

All he said was that he doesn't want the US to reach into peoples pockets WITHOUT PERMISSION and take their hard-earned money and give it to someone else.  If someone earns the money THEY should be the ones who choose who and if that money they earned goes to the poor.  It didn't have anything to do with the color of their skin.  Way to twist words though.  Typical democrat. Please note that he said \"I don't want to make black peoples life better >>>>>>>BY<<<<<<< (a clause is beginning here) giving them someone elses money.  Therefore he doesn't have a problem with 'helping to make Black peoples lives better', but it must be through another means then steeling from a richer persons pocket.  And if the race was relevent (maybe there was a disproportional number of Black people in the area that were extremely poor), then it is perfectly appropriate to call it like it is.  I dislike it when others get all bent out of shape because someone has the audacity to mention the color of anothers skin.  So much freaking out about nothing.  No disrespect was meant by it.
