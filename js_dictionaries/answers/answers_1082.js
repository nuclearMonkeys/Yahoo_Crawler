All morals and laws derive from the needs of society and from the golden rule, which becomes obvious to the smallest child when they develop the ability to see thing from another viewpoint and so develop empathy.

If it is moral, why do the vast majority of civilized societies ban it? Quite frankly you are talking bollocks.

You can't be moral if you are alone? That is a big assumption. If I went out into the forest and lived the life of a hillbilly nomad, you are saying all my actions would be gray on the ethical line?  By this you are stating that morals and ethics ONLY exist between humans, not on how you treat the world around you or yourself.  God could have said murdering was a good thing to do, and you, by this argument, would agree with whatever He said. Also, by this argument God could change his mind and you would have to go with him. Lastly, by this argument, you are saying that people need the threat of Hell and the reward of eternal life to do anything good and not be evil. By this you state that you would murder, rape, steal, and do all sorts of horrible things if God was proven to not exist or if you lost faith. I am an atheist, why do i act morally? edit: people are not born 'knowing' God, they grow up in a family being taught.

Slapping some religion on those morals doesn't fix the problem. I don't think everyone following their own morals is corruption. It may be chaos, but it's not corruption. Morality is a set of standards to follow and usually settled by agreement (to some degree) by society. Things clearly change (as they did in the 60s), but what of it?
