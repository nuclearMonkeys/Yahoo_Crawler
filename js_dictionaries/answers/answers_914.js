What you need to do is sit down and make up a list of what you will need.  Will you want a \"wizard\" to help you build the site easily from templates? Do you need to run WordPress scripts from the site? Will you need to receive emails through the site? Will you need more than one domain name for your site? Do you need the site to interaction?  Does it need to respond to input form the users? Does it need to be able to accept credit card? Will you need to be able to run scripts behind the web page? Will you need a database to hold products or other information?

And because he got a glimpse at the aerodynamics problems tall towers experiment, and because he was convinced that \"heavier than air\" planes would eventually overcome, he decided to start a new career as an aerodynamics engineer. He founded one of the world's first wind tunnel to test structures, with back then, revolutionary method (it is still running today, and making money. I had the occasion to visit it. Some of the control panels commands are still in place. Very \"cyber punk\" style). And because you can't test real scale model in wind tunnel, he also wrote a book about aerodynamics, model scale, etc, that is still referenced today. He was 77 when he started to learn this new career. So, no, it is never too late. That being said, not everybody is Gustave Eiffel.", 7165, "d3cd3e0f2e8feaaff79363574632bf96aa", 1],

Sometimes there are students who cannot go home for valid reasons, like international students whose home countries are in civil unrest or war, or who might not be re-admitted to the US if they leave (under the Trump administration).

Also, I hope you realize that Apple computers can get viruses.  Examples include Silver Sparrow (which only attacks the M1 processors used in MACs last year), Pirri/GoSearch22, Generic.Suspicious (which accounts for about 80% of MACS that have gotten viruses), FakeFileOpener, ThiefQuest (which is a ransomware virus), LoudMiner (which looks for an steal bitcoins from MAC PCs), and SearchAwesome It is just that because Apple has such a small percentage of the PC market, the viruses fo not make the news the way that Windows viruses do. ", 7154, "AA11622701", -2],

There are financial institutions that will sometimes look at college transcripts before they decide whether or not to grant you a mortgage or a loan.
