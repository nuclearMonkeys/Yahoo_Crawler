I asked a question about a gentle leader and I was immediately branded a lazy trainer. What they didn't realise was that I was going to put in several hours a day training as well as using the gentle leader. They assumed I was going to use it instead of training.  There are some people here who don't see the whole picture, but others which are brilliant. I admit I have been a little too judgemental in the past, but I am trying to change this!

	68219 : ["Some people think so. I trained in a pretty liberal department (social work) and my aunt and uncle said they noticed a big change in my attitude from the first visit after going away to college. Actually though, I think those attitudes were already there and I just didn't have a voice for them.  A huge reason for this, and another aspect of your question is that when a kid leaves home for the first time, no matter where they go, they are going to be bombarded with different ways of thinking, different cultures, religions, lifestyles, and backgrounds of people. Most kids do look around at these different things, and begin a lifelong process of picking and choosing, and building their own individual ideals, opinions. There will be some times when a kid is rebelling, or maybe falling into peer pressure to think or act a certain way. But in time, an individual that has left the family home is going to learn that some/much of what they were taught stuck, and was embellished/expanded by exposure to new ideas. ANY educator or institution worth learning from is not going to tell you WHAT to think. They will teach you HOW to think. It's like being in the same room your whole life, and by leaving home you open the door and enter a new room. You can't blame that new place for being different and affecting the person. As always too, as a parent you have TWO gifts for your kids while they are in your care:  ROOTS. If you give them sturdy roots, they will will have a strong sense of family, morals, security, and confidence. You do this by being trustworthy in the things you teach them. In other words, what you tell your children to do, you should do, and your actions should prove fruitful for you...and should be functional way of relating in the world. If you preach saving money...save your money...and let them see you enjoying financial security because of it...and let them see that you have a good reputation because of it. And WINGS. If you give them sturdy wings, they will reach out for individual experiences, independence, and yes maybe to make their own mistakes. To teach this, let them have an identity that isn't all about their role as part of the family. Jobs and chores. AND opinions and choices.", 8452, "AA10020034", 1],
