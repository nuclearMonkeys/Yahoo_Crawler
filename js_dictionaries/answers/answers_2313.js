You see, the moon has it's gravitational pull too but it doesn't affect us much except that it pulls the water. Therefore, high tides are caused when the moon is pulling the water up (usually in the night or on an eclipse or during new moons)  and the low tide is caused by the moon pulling the water at another side of the earth.", 10665, "zileH54jaa", -1],

Kestrel (fun fact, this was the name of a MALE character in my fav book as a kid \" The Robber Hotzenplotz\") - while its not crazy. I don't totally like this name. Its not in use these days, but would be acceptable simply because it is easy to spell and say (for a guy though!) Astrid - I actually love this name. It's gaining strength in the US because of that movie \"How to Train Your Dragon\". This name is actually currently in the top 100 in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.  Circe - This is the ancient version of Kirk (male)... though it's a female name. I like it. Its sweet sounding though you will have to help people pronounce it often.  Lyette - very pretty. I never heard this name before. It doesnt appeal to me personally, but I can see that it is lovely for someone else's tastes.  Beatrix - Beatrix Potter! The author of Peter Rabbit. I like this name... probably better than Beatrice. My sister had a rabbit named this and called it Trixie.  Magdalena - means someone from Magdala. Its a pretty name, and a common surname. I wouldnt use it simply because of the biblical reference to the woman posessed by demons... even though she was one of Jesus' most faithful followers. The english version is Madeline... which doesnt sound as nice as Magdalena.... but has less connotation.  All in all - cool names.  I like Astrid, Circe and Beatrix as usable... the others might work (for someone else).  I hope that helped. Happy name-hunting!", 10666, "nuHpnDjKaa", 0],

	121500 : ["First it needs to explain how electromagnetic fields evolved to begin with.  I've never seen anything even resembling an attempt at an explanation. But to be fair, any engine produces an EM field, from the core of the earth to the mitochondria of a living cell.  Even thunderstorms have highly disorganized EM fields (their engine being a rotating column of air up to six miles in diameter known as a mesocyclone).  Hence the static discharge we call lightning. \"Soul\" is a collective term for the mind, will and emotions, and not every living thing has all of these.  Humans are the only creatures with fully developed souls.  With our minds we can think and rationalize, communicate complex ideas and create technology that aids in our day to day lives.  With our will we can build empires or tear them down.  With our emotions we can recognize beauty and replicate it, creating art, poetry, music and more.  No other creature in the world is capable of all that.  And evolution cannot explain it anymore than it can an EM field.  This is what the soul is.  It does not leave our bodies in any physical manifestation because it is not itself physical.  It is abstract.  The mind is not the brain.  The emotions are not mere adrenal glands near our colon (which is where we get the terms, \"hate your guts,\" \"gut feeling,\" and, in ancient times, \"I love you with all my gut).
