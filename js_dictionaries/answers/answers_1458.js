Depends how big your mouse is, I dont know if this is the same for mice, but rats can flatten their rib cage so I'd be careful 3. non-sugar cereals (plain wheat cereals) fruits and vegetables and um.. i think that's it, 4.Alot, estimating in around, 1-10  5. Not that I know of, try to get 2 mice that have been in the same cages while kept in a pet store, they will usually not fight. Males will usually fight 6. Yes, I also suggest keeping a small bowl with water just in case they have trouble drinking for the water bottle. Sick or old mice should alwas have a bowl of fresh water (they also will enjoy a bowl of water on a hot summer day) 7. Um, with the mice I had, yes 8. Rags, shreded neswpaper (non-toxic ink) carboard, etc. I use the cardboard rolls that are left over from toilet paper  It is possible for a female mouse to get prego at a petstore IF they are not separated from gender. DO NOT get the mice from petstores that dont separate them from gender Wheels are great for mice as long as they are safe and dont have wire bars on them.

	78566 : ["1. totally. theyll have a great time running through those!! 2. that doesnt sound to big. just make sure the space between the bars isnt big enough for escape. 3. fruits and veggies. u could also try PLAIN cooked meat. my rat and hamsters loved it. 4. about 3-4. no more than 4. 5.no. they may have a few squabbles. to be safe, get females from the same litter or have lived together for awhile. 6. yea those are great bottles. just get the smaller ones. 7. yea. they love to play with humans. and fyi they are very active when out of the cage. 8. old socks for hamocks toilet paper tubes to crawl through cardboard cut into a mini jungle gym for climbing treats hung from an area in the cage for a workout to get yummy treats use ur imagination for othr ideas. also search on the internet.", 8954, "None", -1],

If you want something a little calmer, try a gerbil. they are a little bigger than mice and are very social. you could only get maybe two gerbils in the hamster cage though.  8. cut little branches off of untreated bushes. hang little pieces of food from the ceiling. make ladders out of sticks. ANTHING!! If females and Males are kept separate in their cages at petco they shouldn't be pregnant. but for best results, try petsmart!", 8954, "yavm9QpRaa", 0],
	78573 : ["I'm going to save you a lot of trouble and heartache and tell you to get two female rats instead because  1. Your tunnels will work fine. 2. Your cage is okay. 3. Rats can eat anything a human can eat EXCEPT ALCOHOL, CHOCOLATE, CAFFIENE AND CANDY!!! 4. Your cage is an okay size for two rats. 5.  Get the rats young and keep them together and they won't fight.  They'll play 'fight' but it's harmless. 6. They drink from the hamster bottle. 7. Rats, as long as you start them young, LOVE to be handled, petted, and stroked.  8.  My rat plays with his furniture!!  I have a little crate in his cage that he pushes around.  Homemade toys are anything the rats can safely chew, a peice of rope with a knot in it will work as a swing.  A peice of fabric tied to the corner of the cage will work as a hammack.  a tube sock with the toes cut out will be a nice tunnel and toilet paper tubes are great for them to chew on. Most of this works with mice but I'm telling you, rats are nicer, cleaner, and live longer than mice.  You'll be happier in the long run.", 8954, "None", 0],

	78582 : ["1. yes , mice are extremely talkented with climibing. dont get the ma cage with bars though, because they can fit through very small holes, and escape. get a plastic one, or a  glass one. 2. one again, dont get bars, it doesnt matter what size they are, they can still escape. unless the gaps between them are either square and really small, or a pencil cant fit in them. mice are escapers, whether they like their cages or not, and im sure you wouldnt want that. 3. they ca neat anything that isnt too big, greasy, or has cocoa in it. i wouldnt recomment feeding them anything that isnt sold at petco though, cause it could hurt their diet. but you can feed them a little bit of raw bacon every once in a while, for a little added protein(its safe, as long as its just a nibble, not a big chunk) 4. um, as many as you think. i would say 5 is a nice number though, so they can have some space, and run around freely. 5. no they dont, usually. try to get ones that arent, or dont seem dominant though, when you go to petsmart or wherever.  they will get along the quieter and smaller they are. 6. yes ma'am! but smaller ones are more suited for mice, because its less work and their height. 7. yes, but some are jumpers. you have to work with themm, and should probably close your room or whatever so they dont run. little explorers...i have some stories.  8. homemade toys...little pieces of wood, toilet paper or paper towel rolls, wooden rulers, almost anything kinda blunt, made of wood, and or tunnel-like.  mice can get through very small holes. their tails dont regrow.  they are loving, but you have to take good care of them. clean the cage at least one a week or once every two weeks. they love corners to take bathroom breaks in, so clean there especially well. they live for about six years if you take good care of them. they are very adorable too, and i had like 60 mice at one time though cause they reproduced. for extra information you should google tips on how to care for them, and they sell books and magazines on care, toys, etc for mice in petco/petsmart.  hope i helped!!! love, mousie", 8954, "Pf76Q2Fvaa", 0],

	78584 : ["I wonder about this also. Why is Elizabeth acting this way??? Normally, I see the candidates behaving this way towards each other.

	78594 : ["1.  They should be able to :3  The reason dwarf hamsters may have a hard time climbing up the tunnels is because they have hair on their feet.  Mice don't have hair on the feet, so they can climb them. 2.  should be ok  but I have heard of very determined females still squeezing though bars. (I prefer a 10 gal aquarium for two mice.  Make sure to utilize the entire space : example--> 3. I actually when it comes to food, I recommend Suebee's Homemade diet. (link below) which uses human foods.  However this homemade mix is incomplete without a high quality dog food (like Natural Balance Reduced Calorie, or Solid Gold Holistic dog food.  make sure to add more dog food to the mix, as mice need more protein then rats) and with out fresh fruits and veggies.  The is another homemade mix (link below) created by Pual Goodman.   I do not recommend pet store mixes because most are seed mixes (which mice can become over weight on seed, and since they have a tendency to keep eating even when they are full, you are sure to have a fat mouse on a seed mix).  Another reason to be against pet store foods is the amount of dried corn found in the mixes. Dried corn is bad for all animals and humans!  A lot of dog and cat foods are being mad with out dried corn for this very reason.  The companies that make small animal foods have yet to get the memo :(   homemade mixes Suebee's--> P.G.--> if homemade mixes are not an option for you, then here are some pet store bought foods that are acceptable. -Oxbrow's Regal Rat (online) -Mazuri (Petsmart) -Harlan Lab Blocks (online) foods to beware --> (for rats, but mice and rats are very similar) 4.  If I am guessing correctly... about 3 mice.  The rule that I know of is 5 gals per mouse, so ig you can guess about how many gals the cage would be if it were an aquarium, there you go :3 5. as long as you get them at the same time and have them in an appropriate size cage, you should not have any territorial issues.  6.as long as it isn't a spring loaded water bottle, it should be fine. 7.Mice are just as smart as rats and can be taught to come to their name!  The only difference (in my opinion) in mice and rats is their size which can make mice a bit more timid and cautious. 8. check out   and  :3 Good luck! edit not a lot of cheese.  Mice can actually be lactose intolerant and a lot of dairy products can make them sick! edit I work for petco and there is a lot of things they put on items to try and sell them.  For example, the rat care sheets say that rats can live in a 10 gal aqurium.  This is completely wrong!  Rats are prone to respiratory problems and aquariums provide poor ventilation which can result in making the rat sick.  Second,  a 10 gal is way to small for one rat.  PLus rats are social and should be housed in pairs.  Also, remember the wire mesh wheels you saw in the cages?  at my petco, we have had 1 robo, 1 dwarf and 2 rats break their legs on those wheels yet petco still insists on using them and selling them!  Just goes to prove that petco will say anything to make money.  They honestly do not care about the animals (not that the people who work their don't care, but the high ups who make all the rules don't care) Unfortunately, the people that Petco gets their animals from are idiots and do not know how to tell a male mouse from a female and who ever accepts the animals during delivery is not always a specialist who knows how to tell, so who knows if a male made it in with the females or not.  There is also the possibility of the supplier sending a mouse pregnant.  So Unfortunately if you plan on getting from a pet store you are risking getting a pregnant, or sick animal.  This is why it is best to adopt or buy from a breeder of possible.   However, of all pet stores, petco and petsmart are the best places to buy animals from because they do separate sexes (for the most part) while mom and pop shops house both genders together (mom and pop shops are sure to give you a pregnant animal).    also, a solid bottom wheel of any kind should be fine :3", 8954, "Egg918Z6aa", 0],
