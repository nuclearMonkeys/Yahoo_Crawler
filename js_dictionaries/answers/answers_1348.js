It's one of those situations you really can't answer unless you found yourself in it. You see I've wondered about this many times, and I have  come to the conclusion that: although I would still foolishly jump at the chance to know everything, I think it's very likely that anyone who dose, would either become insane or essentially lose their humanity.  Is it even possible for all the knowledge in the universe (and that might which exists beyond)to fit within the confines of a human mind? Even now in quantum physics there are concepts that, we seem to barely be able to grasp. Like electrons they can be waves of energy or they can be particles, they can be several places at the same time. What if time isn't linear, but instead branches out into billions of parallel universes, where everything that can happens dose. When you met someone you would know all the outcomes of their potential futures, what if they're a fire fighter in one, but a serial killer in another? Are they good are they evil, would you honestly be able to consider such concepts as being valid if you knew everything? I think by now yo see what I mean. What I would want to do IF I  knew everything is help people, I would start with wanting to cure cancer....But if I really DID know everything I might end up becoming indifferent to human suffering, because I see the universe in such a grand scale, so that all people seem like a tick in time and a dot in space.", 8708, "4EIIYizHaa", 2],

Spirituality for me, however, is a more pedantic thing.  It is something I have to practice because I am not quite good at it yet, so I can only try through duty and ritual practices.  I have found several similarities in these rituals in some places I wouldn't have expected.  Buddhism, Rosacrucianism, Catholicism, Hinduism and Native North Americans religion, some Judaic practices have all given me a sense of home. I think in the final analysis, spirituality is seeking oneness....and finding similarities already there.", 8707, "AA11466759", 1],

	73001 : ["Avant Garde/Dada Atheism is (sort of?) as follows: Many \"churches\" and \"religious\" movements such as The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster satire religion by creating a parody religion. Mrdeity.com satires Christianity itself. However, that satire ends at the conceptual level on the internets stage. The Church of Atheism continues the satire by having incorporated the church with the state of Wisconsin and pushes the concept into a paradoxically actual religion - as \"actual\" as any religion can be.  Simply because you have said there is a place for non-believers where you will burn in hell or the beer will always be flat, does not make it true. Nor does having a legal status as a religion, make it true. There is no true religion. All religions are equally false and absurd. Every religious title and ritual has been made up, no matter if it is the ridiculous Christian churches or the Avant Garde Atheist churches such as the Invisible Pink Unicorn religion, or the First Church of Atheism. (It reminds me of Brancusi ‘s sculptures. He was a foreign sculptor who was forced to pay tax on his art even though art is tax exempt. He wound up in a court battle, after which the court ruled that his sculptures were art. When that happened, art exhibits that had previously rejected his sculptures, suddenly regarded his art as art and wanted his sculptures. In effect, the courts determined what was art and what was not. Incorporating an Avant Garde Atheist religion as a legal religion just continues the satire of the \"authority\" systems which define for us what is a religion, art, or what is true and pushes it into a paradox. Similarly, Michael Duchamp's dadaism challenged us all with the question “What is art?” when his piece became the first to be rejected by the Society of Independent Artists. What he submitted was a signed urinal. The next day the news papers published the scandal on the front page and his “art” became highly demanded. He then underwent mass “production” of signed urinals. A signed urinal today could fetch around a million dollars.) So like Michael Duchamp's urinal challenged us to question what art was, Avante Garde Atheism challenges us to question what religion is.  Pure Avante Garde Atheism, however, pushes past mere parody into a actualized religious status both in an actual definition and a legal definition. The Church of Atheism in Eau Claire is legally incorporated in the State of Wisconsin and holds that all people have a religion as outlined below: Religion, in its most basic, is the answering of the \"big questions\" such as 1.) Where did we come from 2.) Where are we going? 3.) Is there an unchanging aspect of individuals? 4.) How should we live our lives? Every thinking person has an answer for the Big Questions whether the answer is \"I don't know,\" \"Goddidit,\" or \"The Big Bang,\" etc. Therefore, every person has a religion. A religion need not be shared by any other person, believe in a god, or believe in the supernatural to exist. A religion need not, and cannot, represent all of the actual beliefs of its adherents. All rituals, titles, and religious organizations are made up. It stands to reason that Atheism can create equally valid (for none are valid) aspects of organization, if they choose to create a church such as the Church of Atheism.", 8707, "None", -3],

Dhammapada 35 - 'CittaVagga: The Mind'. Monkey-Mind, the endless chattering in our head as we jump in our mind from thought to thought while meditating, in everyday activities, while we daydream, reminisce over regrets of the past, or worry over the future. The Buddha called this mind, which races from thought to thought, 'the monkey' and 'a wild horse'. The Monkey Mind calculates and schemes, chases thoughts of self and others, clinging to rights and wrongs, and quarrels over me and mine. The wild horse mind loves to run away into fantasies and false-thoughts, to wander far without warning and to return when it pleases. It's difficult to break the wild horse mind to the saddle of mindfulness and discipline. The Buddha taught us that the way to tame these wild creatures in our head is through consistent practice of Mindfulness Meditation, although the paradox is that when we clear the mind for meditation, we actually invite the Monkey-Mind into our head to play. This is when we are given the opportunity to tame this wild mental beast by moving beyond thought rather than thinking thought. When we are aware of thoughts, we can let the thoughts rise and fall away without floating in different directions. Being able to concentrate is one of the tools that allow us to slow down our thought process and focus on observing our thoughts. To develop our concentration, we start by focusing on the breath. To allow this entire process to work, we must be willing to suffer. This is why patience is stressed. We must open our minds to suffering because it is in embracing suffering that suffering ceases. When we find that we are suffering - physically, mentally or emotionally then we go to the actual suffering that is present. We open up completely to it, welcome it, concentrate on it, allowing it to be what it is. That means we must be patient and bear with all the unpleasantness of a particular condition. We have to endure boredom, anger, despair, depression, anxiety, fear, doubt and other conditions in order to understand that they are impermanent and cease, rather than running away from them. In life, I have seen that attachment to my desires is suffering. There is no doubt about that. I can see how much suffering in my life has been caused by attachments to material things, ideas, beliefs, attitudes, anxieties and fears. I can see all kinds of unnecessary misery that I have caused myself through attachments because I did not know better. I was brought up in America, the land of freedom. It promises the right to be happy, but what it actually offers is the right to be attached to everything. America encourages us to try to be as happy as we can by getting things. Working with attachment is to be understood and contemplated then insight into non-attachment arises. This really isn't an intellectual stand or a command from our brain saying that we should not be attached; it is just a natural insight into non-attachment or non-suffering. As we daily tame the Monkey-Mind, we do so with firm kindness, patience and compassion. And when the endless chatter in our head arises, we open up to it, concentrate on it and   observe it as anicca (impermanent), dukkha (unsatisfactoriness), or anatta (non-self), then we allow it to cease and gently return to the breath. In Buddhism, the root cause of human suffering is identified as the mind. So we follow the wisdom of Lord Buddha to train the mind: \"Wonderful it is to train the mind - so swiftly moving, seizing whatever it wants. Good is it to have a well-trained mind, for a well-trained mind brings happiness\".  Dhammapada 35 :) With Metta, Brian.", 8709, "None", 2],

More advanced tripods come in two pieces, the legs with a 3/8\" thread at the top, which attached to a head.

With a quality tripod and head you frame your shot lock the tripod off and it stays where you put it, no droop or sag. The cheapest one I use which works well is the Manfrotto 190PROB with a 486/RC2 ball head. Cost around the Â£100 mark here in the UK. Ball heads are quicker for stills photography as you only have one control to lock, but if your into video then a Pan and Tilt head is easier as you can lock of all but the direction you want to move the camera, you can lock off tilt and the pan can still be moved. Either can be used on the 190PROB tripod. I tend to carry both types. Don't buy a cheap tripod.

The idea is, most pro tripods expect you to put a tilt and swivel head on them (costs extra of course), and those are usually 3/8\" W thread underneath. Even pro ball and socket heads are like this (they let you swivel the cam every which way, but are fussy too set up exactly flat) Recap; a flimsy tripod is useless; get the heaviest you can afford (sacrifice working height to get a compromise - so 130 cm 2,6 kg tripod is more use than a 160cm 1,2kg tripod, if you see what I mean.) Get a cheap but 'smooth' ball and socket head on top of the tripod.  If you can afford it, get one with a 'quick release' platform - all that is, is a plate that screws under your cam (1/4\"W remember) and snaps fits into the top of the ball and socket on the tripod.  Very quick, very useable, not great money. Go to a cam store that stocks second hand kit - tripods of quality do not wear out - and try what they've got. Lastly, compromise;  a seven ton tripod will never be taken out with you; a one kilogramme aluminium cheapie will be thrown away after one shot.  Aim for a proper make, around 2,6kg plus, a good shoulder strap or bag with the same attached; makes to look for Gitzo ($$$$) Giotto, Benbo, Manfrotto, Slik (less $$$).  Good luck another edit - thanks Chris you put it so much better than I did, (voted for you of course) I had forgotten Manfrotto have cut their prices recently and they are 9/10ths of the costly Gitzo quality of design. Friend of mine got a German wooden tripod from Mr CAD (Croydon) about the same price - it is very steady, beautifully made, and has a column release that enables you to level the head part (there's a bubble too) by tilting the middle column.
