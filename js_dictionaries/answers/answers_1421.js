Everytime you turn on the radio, it's always some \"rapper\" talking about their shoes, their hoes, their bust-it-babies, their chain hanging and all that type of crap.

That song is so true because the hip-hop dream is being clouded by all this nonsense that people are calling music. Yeah, hip-hop still exists, but it would be nice to be able to turn on the radio and listen to a new, fresh hip-hop song.

	76730 : ["Peace be to this house (Luke 10:5) ======================== Great question most are not even aware of this. The Son of God, all angels are Sons of God (capital \"S\") There has only been one (1) angel, a Son of God that ever became human, therefore He is called the Son of man (capital \"S\") Here is the part that most do not know or understand. We are the sons of man (small \"s\"), that is the flesh body and only the flesh body are sons of man. Man is spirit, man is not flesh and blood, man is spirit created by God the Father and the Sons.  Man is the sons (small \"s\") of the Sons (capital \"S\"). Man is the English word for the Hebrew word <da which means adam in English. Adam and man are one in the same, that right, adam is spirit not flesh and blood. God the Father \"created\" flesh bodies for the spirit called man in the beginning. The first flesh body God \"created\" was a FEMALE. God the Father than \"joined' the spirit called adam/man with the Female flesh body He \"created\" and the flesh and the spirit became one.  Joined together they were no longer spirit and flesh but one, and God the Father called them a \"Living Soul\", that is a spirit that could not enteract with the all the things of the physical world. The spirit called adam/man was created before the universe was \"created\" The spirit called adam/man was joined with the flesh after the universe and planets were created. In the beginning flesh bodies were not human. When Lucifer was cast from heaven his crown and title were taken from him and given to God the Father's second born Son called the Christ. God the Father gave the crown taken from Lucifer to the Christ along with a new title called LORD God, after the title of God the Father's the Lord thy God. It was LORD God the Christ who \"MADE\" the first human flesh body. This first flesh body \"MADE\" by LORD God, the Christ was FEMALE. LORD God breathed the spirit called adam/man into the FEMALE flesh body. The spirit called adam/man became one with the FEMALE flesh body, they became a living soul. This what a soul is, a soul is a spirit that is joined together with a flesh body, they are no longer spirit and flesh, but become one. When the flesh body takes it's last breath the spirit is released and returns to heaven, and the flesh returns to dust. A lost soul is a spirit that has not returned to heaven, because Lucifer deceived the spirit into believing that the flesh is it's life and that it need to defend and save it's life. The truth is that it is the spirit that gives life (animation) to the flesh, and that the spirit has no REAL need for the things of the physical world, because it is spirit, not flesh and blood. God the Father provides all that the spirit needs and that is the Father word which it uses for food, the body needs only simple things, such as food, drink and shelter.  Anything beyond the simple things are not desires of the spirit they are desires that Lucifer has told and deceived you into believing that you must have for the flesh. The Christ was the first, last and only Son of God to ever be born of the FEMALE, He is God the Father's only begotten (born of the female) Sons (capital \"S\") We sons of man are lower than the angels, therefore those who do make it back to heaven will be called sons of God (small \"s\"). ------------------------------------------------  27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Gen 1:27 (KJV) ------------------------------------------------ in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, Gen 2:4 (KJV) ------------------------------------------------ 7 And the LORD God formed man (son of man) of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his (her) nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. Gen 2:7 (KJV) ------------------------------------------------ All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made John 1:3 (KJV) ------------------------------------------------ He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.  11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.  12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:  13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  John 1:10-13 (KJV) ------------------------------------------------ Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  5 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?  6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. Matt 19:4-6 (KJV) ======================== Remember Mary sister of Lazarus, for she anointed Jesus at the hour of His death.
