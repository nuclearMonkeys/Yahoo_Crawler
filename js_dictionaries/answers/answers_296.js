Intelligence is the gatekeeper to opportunities. Having an open attitude and putting yourself in environments that encourage growth are part of finding good opportunities because having those two things help us come up with new ideas. And, just as importantly, they encourage us to implement those ideas. openness leads to higher creative potential. In other words, if are you curious about learning new ideas and discovering the world around you, successful scientists, artists, and professions that require creativity show higher openness levels. Work means examining a topic from various angles and being willing to try something new. But all the intelligence and openness to experiences won't help if you don't bother to apply them.

As far as classes that gets complicated because most places aren't going to stop you from going to a class although if you are removed from the computer system, the professor may ask you to stop coming. You definitely would not be able to get a transcript or credit for the course nor enroll in class for the next semester (or quarter or whatever) As far as the dorm, that is interesting that they let you move into the dorm without paying. Eviction is possible since it is a tenant landlord situation (as far as I know) and those get complicated.  It is a crime to write a check knowing you can't cover the expenses. If you were to write a check for thousands of dollars and only have $100 in the bank it will raise red flags, so I don't suggest you go that route.", 2496, "f3d506f1430fab32d23ae661f4553e41aa", 3],

Either save every penny or use part to attend a community college to pick up some of the credits you need, especially outside your major.

Which is normal .  So this makes it also possible to still get sick but one is or should be better protected to survive .      Think of your computer, you get virus protection but you can still get a virus if you don't update your virus protection .      One last thing.  Is peoples bodies are different and won't react the same.          Anyway this is my thoughts .  ", 2477, "None", 0],

That once we force Trump out of office, whether that be through impeachment or the election, things will go back to they always have been.

The difference is that they have a very specific doctrine, of their own development, that they claim is what is required in order to\"get into heaven\" or \"escape hell', rather than what is specifically written in the bible, whether by Jesus Himslef or one of His disciples. They also exert a lot of control over their members, putting great burdens on them and also putting guilt on them if they don't do those required things. the leaders always have much power and authority over the members, and they never encourage any members to follow Jesus closely and ask the Holy Spirit to guide them and teach them the Way, which Jesus said would be the case with believers. To me, being a christian means that you are born-again, saved by grace, and are able to be taught, led, and transformed by Jesus Himself, although He may use a number of different people in your life to accomplish His purposes--people that he chooses.", 2501, "AA11963798", 0],

I don't care who we are- all of us need to work on being a good neighbor. If all of us were good to each other like we should be then CNN and all of the purveyors of bad news would be out of work.
