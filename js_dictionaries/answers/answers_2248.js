They are not necessarily selfish, but people with low self-esteem sometimes think that someone who is not focused on them, or gushy, is selfish.  Not so. Capricorn, if they are goal-focused instead of insecure themselves, are self-confident.  Again, people with low self-esteem sometimes think that someone else who is not likewise insecure, are prideful.  Not so.

	118196 : ["What is your hiking/backpacking experience.  An experienced hiker could probably do this successfully - but for someone who is not in tip-top shape, hiking in and out is a two day proposition that leaves you pretty exhausted.  Especially if you are planning to do it in summer.  Plus  it leaves you no chance to see the canyon at sunset or sunrise - which are jaw-dropping spectacular. To do a really beautiful partial day hike, which I recommend, from the South Rim, I recommend the South Kaibab Trail.  It's steep with lots of switchbacks - and you can take it only a mile and a half to Cedar Ridge, where there are restrooms and such, then hike back up.  That will take about half a day, and will be stunningly beautiful.  Bright Angel to the 1 or 2 mile rest house is good too, but because bright angel is more sheltered and has more vegetation it does not provide quite as spectacular vistas.   Then you can spend time on the rim, see sunset on the rim then sunrise.   Herein lies a dilemma - the other parks you might want to see are on the OTHER side of this big long canyon.  It's not far across, but you can't drive across, you need to drive out way west or east.  So doing another park is damn hard.  You could head back toward Las Vegas and visit the Hoover Dam, or you could head east to the painted desert, but you will have to book to drive back to Vegas Wednesday night.  Another option is to head north and see the North Rim, around the east side, through Cameron and the Navajo Reservation.  the North Side has spectacular views of the canyon, too, some feel more spectacular than the south rim (I've been to both and they both reach a level of spectacularity above which I find it hard to distinguish),  But there is no nice day hike into the canyon from the North Rim like there is from the south - so seeing the canyon from the inside (which is different from seeing it from the Rim) is not really feasible. If I were in your shoes, I would either spend two days at the South Rim or I would spend one day at the south and one at the north rim, making sure to catch sunrise and sunset at one place or the other.  But you mentioned other parks, and while they are not really doable from the south rim, if you did the North Rim, you could possibly also visit Zion, and less likely, Bryce Canyons in southern Utah.  These are beautiful and also very different from the Grand Canyon. They are ONLY doable from the North Rim, so you skip hiking into the Grand Canyon (but could hike in Zion if you liked - some excellent hikes. ) If you do this, I'd suggest reserving the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, going there and seeing the sunset, and just after sunrise heading north for Zion.  It is a rather long way, though, and you will do a lot of driving. Which I why my final recommendation is to stick with the Grand Canyon.", 10533, "G80M8TJLaa", 1],

But, if you're only there for two days, there is the smooth water rafting down the Colorado that I would recommend. Or, even the white water rafting- you really see the canyon and get to enjoy it from the river as well- and you don't have to hike down to see it all. Then, there are several lookout points on the shuttle bus routes that feature old towers and such- very beautiful! I've been a few times now and have enjoyed it every time- you won't be disappointed! I just would suggest not trying to pack too much in- its hard to admire the beauty if you're constantly on the go. =) Its a beautiful place.

Aries and Leo are both very strong personalities, \"need to be followed\" types of people. Leo likes to be center stage and Aries needs to be doing things and may not give Leo the attention they want. I can see that their relationship could have been very turbulant and their problem solving skills different from each other and from you. Capricorns tend to be quieter, more thoughtful, not given to impulsive behavior and focus more on home and family than do either Aries or Leo. For them it is more about themselves.  These are just overviews and not indicitive of everyone in those signs as you need a lot more info about birth do do anything indepth. But, I can see where you in childhood could have gotten the feeling that you were third in importance. They may not have seen themselves as doing this as often we are blind to our own behavior. Most likely, as with most parents, they did the best they could.  I don't think you need to \"thank\" them for raising you or for being parents to you but perhaps there are things they did that do serve you well and you can say something like, \"I learned to stand up for myself by watching you deal with ____.\" Fill in the blanks...mechanics, repair people etc. That's just one thought but maybe you can think of others. No one parents perfectly and some less perfect than others. Figure out what was \"right\" and compliment that. You are to be commended for wanting to be positive to your parents.

	118237 : ["Greetings young lady, Your question show a great amount of potential wisdom and insight and I am proud to have you in the ranks of my fellow Capicorns. After reviewing your question as well as its predecessor, I have only a few comments. What has happened is what happens to many of us. You have turned your brain and eyes on to the world and see it for a scary and chaotic place. quite different from the sheltered rose colored world most of humanity is sheltered behind. The illusion of your life has extended to your parents as well. You have realized their humanity. They were always human. Always imperfect. The only thing that has changed is you. You have become aware of their imperfections after so many years and this highlights thier flaws. Especially since they are highlighting yours. You are at the Axion age, the age of change, in which you will go from aspiring child to adult, and to do this you will need to make sense of your world. To do this you must live life and in doing so you will make mistakes. Those mistakes and the lessons you learn will define you as a person. Your parents would just like for you to not repeat the mistakes they made, which at times is unavoidable. The appriciation you wish to have for your parents will come. Unforetunately this too will change again. I was 23 when I finally saw the wisdom in some of the things my parents taught me. I became hyper-appriciative of their upbringing. Overly so in some cases. Bu that two changed for soon after I realized that my parents had taught me 98% of what they could by that time. So it was now up to me to complete the process of gaining knowledge. These revelations changed our relationships completely and now we are more like friends with a mutual respect for one another. Your parents may have a much wide base of knowledge then mine and so this may take longer. If your parents never stop teaching you then you are truly one of the lucky ones. However, hold tight, the appriciation of your parents will come when you can finally understand the lessons they taught you and apply them to your life.", 10538, "j7oON0ayaa", 1],
