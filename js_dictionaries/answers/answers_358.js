So she called the cops and they came and started harassing me Because I refused to give them identification and felt they had no right to be questioning me when they realized that there was nothing wrong with me. But I know they were on a fishing expedition particularly because I had out-of-state plates on the rental car and they wanted to try to get something on me. They detained me and wouldn't let me leave and I asked to speak to a supervisor and he came and he basically just started harassing me along with them.Then they called an ambulance and were going to force me to go in the ambulance unless I agreed to answer some stupid questions by the ambulance driver to prove that I was mentally coherent. The whole thing was incredible. I should have sued the f*ck out of them. The lawyers here won't take any kind of case unless you actually died from the abuse, and I've had so many bad experiences with cops over the years and lawyers who won't represent you for anything unless they can make $1 million that I don't even bother anymore. And the judges in the court system here are just as bad as the cops anyway. So I just expect them to abuse me whenever  I get pulled over. And yes, I'm very WHITE and most of my problems with redneck CT cops and state troopers happened when I was in my 50s and 60s. A few of them during the almost two-year period I was homeless after my divorce and living in my car. As if I didn't have enough problems. But they wouldn't leave me alone even then.
