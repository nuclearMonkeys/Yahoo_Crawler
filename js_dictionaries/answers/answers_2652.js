	138466 : ["First question - how did the cat get in your house in the first place. That is your responsibility. Let the cats poop in the garden. It is good fertilizer. Natural. Usually they bury it so you should not really notice. Cats are not so domesticated as dogs which have been man's companions for far longer than cats. They are far more independant and territorial.  You are right is suggesting that they should be kept indoors. But when a cat is outside you are not going to tell it to stay in the yard. they can climb - where a dog cannot. It is impossible to put territorial boundries on a cat.  You would have to make a fully enclosed cage - impractical as well as unreasonably expensive. Relax a bit. You do have to keep your doors closed to keep the cats out.  There is no worry about having them poo in the garden, it will be of benefit for the plants. AS for keeping them in the yard - Not possible.  Living in the estate, you can become the most unpopular person by getting neighbors together and getting a petition ro keep cats inside or get the cats out of the estate.

	138468 : ["Hi there! I have recently started an online business and would like to share some of my thoughts with you. Before you start, think what product / service is of interest to you. Just because someone claims a particular business is lucrative, does not mean that its ideal for you. For eg. if you do not like or believe in the products / services of the business you are planning to start, you will never be happy working on that business. You need to be open to listening to different ideas and different opportunities and then use your due diligence in deciding which is the best option for you and then make your informed decision about it. Never let anyone sway you into making a decision... always make sure that you are the one who has actively decided into getting into the business. Also, never pay a cent for beginners kit / information pack before you have joined a business. If the business is legitimate, they will not ask you for any payment before you have decided to join and they will always offer all information / support and help for FREE. Another point I would like to highlight while we are speaking about payments is the difference between online jobs / and business opportunities. You need to decide if you want an online JOB where you are working for someone else who send out your pay to you OR an online BUSINESS which is your own business. Again, if its a job, I would say a legitimate employer should never ask for any money from you before or even after joining the company. On the other hand, if its a business that you are starting, and you are convinced about the product, business model and you future, you must be prepared to treat this as a professional business and understand that there will be start up costs. How much you are willing to spend of course, depends entirely on your decision / and how much you are convinced about the business. I have recently started my own business from home using the internet and phone and after searching for long I finally found something which met all my criteria: - Deals with something I am passionate about - Gives me more than enough time to spend with my precious family and friends - Is legitimate - Simple to start and run - Has a very low start up cost and very high returns on a consistent basis - Not MLM or pyramid scheme - No cold calling or selling - Can be managed from anywhere in the world - Provides residual income consistently - Increases my knowledge and self worth every day by allowing me access to the best minds in the world - Does not require any specific skills or talent If you are interested in something similar, I would be more than happy to help.

You obviously live in a better area than I do so it's probably safer for owners to let their cats roam.  But I'm sure it can be quite a problem for people who don't want to step in cat poo or encounter it unexpectedly when gardening! Unless you're willing to take more drastic steps to keep them out, you might want to look into deterrents.  There are sprays and other things you can buy that you could put into places where they seem to be doing their business the most. As for cat poo being good for the earth, I'm not so sure about that.  I know dog poo is, but I don't think cat poo is.  I'm going to double-check that..... EDIT:  I was right - the consensus is that cat poop isn't good for the soil.  It may have something to do with them being meat eaters.... \"Thankfully, dog poop is not that bad for the garden (except aesthetically of course) and can be composted. Cat poop, however, is not good for the garden. I find the best way to keep cats from pooping in an area is to make it unlike a kitty litter box. Keep the soil moist. The worst trouble spots for this are dry patches near the foundations of houses. Foundations are concrete and often wick moisture away from the soil. You can help battle this problem by digging the soil away from the foundation, putting plastic up against the concrete, and then replacing soil. If you are going to go to this trouble, be sure to ammend the soil with some nice manure or compost. This will help keep the soil moist and get some plants growing there.\"", 11391, "None", -1],
