	66850 : ["Hi Isabella, So, you're a decent young lady who wants to evaluate the hazards of hooking up with a player.  Let's call the guy “Romeo\", OK? First, it's very wise that you are trying to decide if the smooth-yet-toxic charms of Romeo will be worth the rollercoaster ride of pleasure and extreme pain. Second, Romeo cannot take advantage of you without your permission. Isabella... do you really want to volunteer your heart and soul to a player with a history of lying and cheating? Good luck with that. The “secret hook-ups” indicate that Romeo does not respect you enough to even be out with you in public.  Try resist Romeo's charms. How can you do that? Well, start by accepting the fact that you find Romeo attractive… and then start imagining what a future might entail with a guy like Romeo. Imagine your friends telling you all about how Romeo is playing around behind your back. Imagine wondering if everything Romeo tells you are lies or not… especially how he “loves” you. Imagine an old GF announcing that she's pregnant with Romeo's Baby... and then imagine the range of destructive emotions you'll feel while wondering what Romeo's response will be: he'll either marry her, say “Tough luck… sue me!”, tell her to adopt it out, laugh it off, deny being the Dad, offer to pay child support for 18 years, suggest her parents raise the Baby, or advise her to kill the Baby. Gee, isn't that nice? Which option do you think Romeo would choose? Imagine wondering how Romeo can look you in the eyes, hold you close, and smile at you… all while he's telling you lies. Just imagine catching an STD from Romeo… one that he caught from an old sl*t that he's been with… and then imagine having to tell your parents. Imagine how your parents will be advising you not to date Romeo… while you're in denial and telling them how special he is. Imagine how everyone will think you're a fool for dating Romeo… including Romeo himself as he toys with your tender heart. Imagine the pain you'll feel when you are unceremoniously abandoned by Romeo for another girl who is “cuter” or “hotter”. Then imagine how much fun it would be for you and Romeo to get married… and how Romeo probably won't be around much to help you with the housework, the kids, or anything else. Isabella, you really do not need any of this nonsense in your life… so resist the temptation to volunteer yourself to Romeo. OK, since I have your attention now for just this fleeting moment in time… perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. would be helpful for you to think about right now while evaluating the damage Romeo would cause in your life. Since you seem to be sensible… most of it will likely be review, but you might pick up a few tidbits of good info. Isabella... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. Having a serious BF won't be the end of your problems… it'll only be the beginning of them… especially if you do not think about how you are going to deal with the inevitable issues that you'll naturally be faced with.  Young people can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. Just remember that. Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term. Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry!  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to). Unless they already know each other pretty well, the typical proclamations of \"commitment\" made in the darkness when a young girl and her Romeo are first alone together are generally worthless... so be wary of those proclamations. Commitments need to last more than one evening, and be proclaimed publicly, in front of family and friends... not in the darkness or in the heat of passion (although any proclamation made by a player is automatically invalid regardless of where or when it is made). Isabella, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider: 1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will be mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say \"No\". 2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong. The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above? Never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby. You can always find some privacy somewhere if you want to do some romantic kissing (a front porch, a dark living room...), but don't make it so private that you would be able to take your clothes off. You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any events with drugs or alcohol abuse. Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous). OK, why no premarital sex?  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years. Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired). Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD. Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed otherwise. Because your \"no sex\" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators.  Because it takes about a year to know a person well enough to determine if they're marriage material… to determine if their statements and actions are consistent and honest… and adding sex too soon into that mix is like tossing sand into a finely crafted mechanical watch. By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family.  Isabella, just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions. You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate. Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church. You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage. Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values. Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice. You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young. That's pretty much the big picture for you to look at, Isabella. Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife. Take care, and God bless. Best Regards, - Charlie .", 8356, "otTMXJvRaa", 0],
