This poor little girl has had her whole world as she knows it turned upside down, and she has felt obliged to go along with everything the adults in her life throw at her.Â  She didn't \"decide\" to let it all out as in a rational decision. She has been under enormous emotional stress and confusion, and if her mother understands, you definitely do not! I was not so very different, I suppose, so I am in no position to criticise you, but I would urge you to read up on the subject. One thing I did do was to assure my children constantly that they were loved and cherished, even though as an adult my behaviour did not seem to reflect that (wife left - not without reason, of course).Â  You have been her male rock - the one hugely important male love of her short life and you have let her down by choosing someone else and flaunting it in front of her.Â  Don't think your male logic and rationale can assuage her turbulent emotions.

Too much in her young life is changing all at once, and she isn't being given time to adjust.Â  I think you need to talk to your ex-wife about this to decide how to proceed, as co-parents. A family therapist would also be advisable. I think it is important to emphasize that while obviously kicking and biting when upset cannot be tolerated (especially in a child too old to throw temper tantrums), the fact that your normally well-behaved child is suddenly acting out in such a dramatic way cannot be ignored.

Let her find out what that is in her own time- she may not be studying it right now. No.2 smart people do struggle to pay attention in class, everyone does. You can only fully focus for 40 minutes. No.3 She is still young and putting pressure on her to get perfect grades will only make her more stressed. When she is older, she will probably get worse grades because she will feel as if if it is not perfect, then it is not good enough. So she could just stop trying altogether. I have seen this in many kids, it may not happen, but don't push her that much. No 4. No one can always try their best. Let her take breaks and be kind, it is a hard time for everyone. No 5. She is like 11 or 12!!!Don't put so much pressure on her at such a young age. My 16 year old was playing video games with his friends all day at 11 and he passed all of his exams with good marks and ADHD.( she could have ADHD but she probably doesn't, I promise you every kid struggles to concentrate at some point) No 6.
