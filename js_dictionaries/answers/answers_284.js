If you still enjoy going to amusement and water parks, go for it.  One of the things I sometimes still do is after grocery shopping, I'll ride the cart back to my car.  It may look funny to other but I don't care...the little kid in me still thinks it's fun.", 2373, "bqLvWpcZaa", 1],

You said that you used to go to cool places like Universal Studios or Disneyland... You can still go. This isn't some kind of Peter Pan rules where only kids can go to these places. Whatever you're doing in your adult life - if going to these kinds of places would mean that much to you - you need to switch things around to where you can go to these places. It might mean getting a better job or working harder at the one you got, but things like this are doable. If you want to go with friends, will scheduling conflicts will happen - that is the way it is for most adults, but hopefully you can make something happen.

	14218 : ["First there is a great discrepancy between using the verbs \"envision/envisioning\" and the verb \"envisage/envisaging.\"   ENVISION/envisioning simply means to be picturing something in one's MIND (not literally seeing the object of thought) - something that ALREADY EXISTS: a memory of a painting, or sunset; the image of a rose, or a cat . . . . ENVISAGE relates to something completely new - to conceive and image or picture of something that has never been created prior, most especially relating to a future POSSIBILITY - it is used in the scientific community most precisely, likely due to \"blind reviews\" of papers submitted to peer-reviewed journals to meet publication requirements of internationally read journals. (And people enjoying their criticisms to be read \"nameless\" by the person who wants their paper published, which can mean submitting to the \"blind reviewer's\" corrections). Be cautious- The adjective \"VISUAL\" is actually seeing the \"subject\" with one's eye - literally, no exceptions; or is something that one can see and later make \"visual\" in one's mind. The VERB \"VISUALIZING\" is \"non-exact.\" It is an ambiguous verb to use and I suggest avoiding the use of it, most especially if you are distinguishing an \"idea\" or a \"concept\" from something that already exists.  It simply means to form a mental image or vision and thus encompasses both \"envisioning\" and \"envisaging\" so avoid it!  If not, use \"visualizing\" in your sentence with exceptional specificity. It is used clearly in quality writing; I just urge you to prefer the best word usage that is available to you.  Possibly, you may fall into unnecessary less disciplined (ambiguous) writing as well as opening the door to being nitpicked or attacked by \"prideful/snobbish/pseudo-intellectuals/unkind\" people, which is always unpleasant.
