It has -  -dual analogue sticks, so it can play console type games that never came to portables before -near ps3 graphics, so it will look like a ps3 graphics wise (3ds is somewhere around wii)   for some vids -big multitouch screen, so that iphone like apps can come to it, and it can be use for extra buttons. -big multiouch pad, for extra buttons as well as more innovative features. -every psn feature on ps3, like messaging, avatars, trophies, the playstation store, lots of multiplayer games, and other stuff -extra online features, like cross game chat, location based gifting, and other stuff -fantastic browser, so you can check websites easily -great music and video players -social connectivity, facebook, twitter, and skype apps, so you can easily check those -lots of great games. my favorites are assassin's creed ruin uncharted golden abyss metal gear solid 2 + 3 gravity rush littlebigplanet sound shapes bioshock mortal kombat street fighter ninja gaiden call of duty fifa 12 final fantasy 10 And there's some other stuff if you have a ps3, like -cloud saves, so you can start a game on ps3, save, then continue on vita. first game with this is Ruin. -cross platfrm online, so you can play online with people on ps3. first game with this is wipeout 2048. -remote play, so you can use a vita as a screen for ps3 games, so you could play ps3 games in a different room. Lots of games are getting this feature. Honestly, the only thing the 3ds is better for is exclusive nintendo games. I'll buy one eventually, as there are a few games for it i have to have, but overall, i'd say the vita is better unless you're a huge fan of nintendo games. hope this helps!", 8614, "None", 0],
