After having my daughter, I was given an episiotomy and then given Perkoset to ease the pain. Little did I know that Perkoset was constipating. I did not have a bowel movement after giving birth to her. I was in pain--so much pain! I took stool softeners, glycerin sopositories, I gave myself one of those things that you inject water into your anus, NOTHING WORKED. I went to the ER 6 days after I gave birth. They tried everything again. It turned out that I had bowel obstruction (impaction) that needed to be removed. I couldn't poop, so the doctor ended up (literally) digging it out of my butt while I bore down. Yes, embarrassing, but it saved my life. Bowel impactions can be deadly. My mom is a caretaker and one of the ladies she took care of died from a bowel impaction/obstruction. It is extremely dangerous. Your poop basically starts backing up into your body and then poisons you. That \"bowel movement\" of diarrhea you had--I had one, too--but it wasn't an actual bowel movement, it was diarrhea going around the impaction and then out, you still have the impaction.

He said they are playing the best baseball, have a very strong team, but would still list a couple of other clubs ahead of them as being the best. I am a die hard Cubs fan to the end, but will have to agree with what he said. I think the Cubs have one of the most well rounded clubs in baseball. They have an excellent lineup, fantastic bullpen and an above average rotation. Will the Cubs win it all this year? Only time will tell. The good thing is you do not have to be the best team in baseball to win the WS. Look at 2006. I truly believe the Cardinals were not the best team in baseball, but they played the best when it mattered most. Same goes for 2003 when the Marlins topped the Yankees. The Cubs have had a relatively easy schedule thus far. Hopefully the momentum and confidence they have built will continue to carry them.

It was run by Japanese people. I thought it was cool to eat something different. They had beef, chicken and a lot of fish. (Some of the fish was raw as in sushi. Some people like it.) When I went to Desert Storm they wouldn't let us eat any pork. There was no bacon or sausages with breakfast. From what I understand the rule is there is no pork served for the troops in Iraq or Afghanistan either. Many of the industrialized nations have American style restaurants off base too. There is a McDonald's in every port that I visited when I was in the Navy. I've also eaten Pizza Hut, KFC, and Wendy's in foreign countries.
