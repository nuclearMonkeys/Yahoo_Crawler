	69035 : ["First of all, only PS3s with 4 USB ports on the front will play PS2 games.  The 120 GB IS NOT backward compatible, so I hope that 80 GB you are referring to is the old one and not the most recent one that was replaced by that 120 Slim. Second, none of the backward compatible PS3s had 100% PS2 compatibility.  The 20 and 60 models were around 95%-98% compatbile, which means there are about 30 PS2 games give or take that will not play on this console (out of about 1800 games that are in the PS2 library). The first 80 GB emulated the Emotion Engine instead of having the actual chip.  This REDUCES compatibility to about 80% or so.  That means there are about 300 PS2 games give or take that won't work, and this likely includes the games that don't work with the 20 and 60. No, there is no  PS3 that will play \"any old game.\"  That's why everyone says to stick with the PS2.  Its the only console that will play ALL PS2 games without problems.", 8482, "None", 0],
	69036 : ["backward compatibility for the PS3 with PS2 games is as follows on NTSC systems: 20GB (4 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - YES 60GB (4 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - YES 80GB with 4 USB slots (fat, no longer in production, bundled with MGS4 or Motor Storm) - YES 40GB (2 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - NO 80GB with 2 USB slots (fat, no longer in production) - NO 160GB (2 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - NO 120GB/slim (2 USB slots) - NO 250GB/slim (2 USB slots) - NO any other up coming PS3's - NO PAL systems only have one backwards compatible system, and that's the 60GB. THAT'S 4 SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN FACT COMPATIBLE WITH PS2 GAMES!!! NOT 1 SYSTEM, NOT 2, 4!!! in short: if it has 4 USB slots, yes. if it has 2 USB slots, no. and as you can see, there are 3 systems that are fat, but can NOT play PS2 games. just because the system is fat does NOT mean it can play PS2 games. all PS3s play PS1 games. the download that others are referring to is for the PS3s that already are backwards compatible. downloading it to a non-backwards compatible PS3 will do NOTHING but take up space on your hard drive! it will NOT make your PS3 play PS2 games!!! \"If a PLAYSTATION 3 is not backward compatible, you will not be able to add this function through any hardware (i.e., changing the hard disk drive) or software (i.e., updates, homebrew) upgrades or modifications. \" that came DIRECTLY from Sony's own website:  and no, not all PS2 games or PS1 games will work. the 20GB and 60GB come the closest to being fully backwards compatible with PS2 games, but they still do not play 100% of those games or PS1 games. if you buy a backwards compatible PS3 and want to know which of your PS2 games work, check this link:  I dare anyone to steal my answer again. this is MY answer. I took the time to type this all up. yes, every time someone asks this question, I do copy and paste. but I'm copying MY work, MY answer.", 8478, "ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa", 0],
	69037 : ["No. The 120GB does not play any PS2 games. There have been eight PS3 consoles so far, of those only three have been able to play PS2 games.  All three backwards compatible PS3's are now out of production, and can mostly only be bought second-hand/refurbished. The PS3's which can play PS2 games are: 20GB (no wifi) 60GB 80GB ( older one that had four USB ports and came in a bundle with MGS4 or Motorstorm) The PS3's which do NOT play any PS2 games are: 40GB 80GB (newer one with 2 USB ports that you can still buy new in the shops) 160GB 120GB Slim 250GB Slim Are there any side effects? Backwards compatible PS3's do not play all PS2 games perfectly, you may find that some are a bit glitchy, but they will not do any harm to a PS3.  The BC 80GB with four USB ports, is only 80% BC, so there are some PS2 games that it won't play at all, but it will play most of them. Overall, I would say that a PS2 is the best thing to play PS2 games on, and that second hand BC PS3's, are a bit of a risk, because they are quite expensive, and you don't know if they have been looked after well, or refurbished properly, a second hand one, probably won't last as long as a new one would. I recommend that you keep your PS2 for PS2 games, and get a PS3 for PS3 games.  It's cheaper and more reliable that way, and it isn't really that much trouble to have both consoles under your TV:) Edit: PAL  systems are region 2 (UK)  All three backwards compatible PS3's were availble in the UK, region 2 PAL, my answer was not copied, it is information that I have from first hand experiance, and anyone is most welcome to copy it, in order to answer a question and help someone:)", 8478, "3cnGPqt3aa", 1],

Once you get to a point where it doesn't seem likely that a $1,000 repair will net you 10,000km (or whatever the case may be) you need to consider if it's a worthwhile repair. Some discretion is used here but it's a \"guiding formula\" I also look at value of car... If I have a car worth 1,000 I won't do any repair that is worth double the cars value.. but again that really comes from the fact that I likely won't get 20,000km out of that car before it needs more repairs.", 8494, "mwu6aJuyaa", 2],
