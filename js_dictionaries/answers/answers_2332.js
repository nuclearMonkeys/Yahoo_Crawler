I think we are going to see Alex Smith dumping off to him more than Davis. I think your defenses are your weak points.

Farr beat a close to prime Max Baer on points and then lost a narrow decision to Joe Louis in Louis first title defense. He was one of only three men to go the distance with Louis as champion. He would have gotten a rematch but he lost his next few fights all in America. Although it is worth noting that most of the decisions were disputed.

	122428 : ["I am Joshua Mbngo Dmbungo TONGUE-CLICK Jnr. Jnr. No. Only forty fights, how can achieve in forty fights, more than guys before him did in 100? He's 2-1 against Duran. Duran was totally finished by the time of the third fight. The only time both men came in good shape Duran won. He's 1-1 with Hearns if we're honest. His victory over Hagler is among the most contentious in boxing history. Leonard was an exceptional athlete and great, great boxer. Arguably only Robinson beats him at welter, but he didn't fight enough and his titles above welter come with asterisks. His massive ring and 12 round title fights against Hagler, his 168lb light heavyweight title fight against Lalonde. Not active enough etc. You say he dominated at several weights. Did he though? He was beaten at welter, his best weight, by Duran and his victory over Hearns was close as they come. He was less than untouchable. He never defended his middleweight title. Only rematched Hearns once Tommy looked totally shot and still lost. Not P4P top ten material in my book. TONGUE-CLICK!", 10703, "yCj6R2HHaa", 0],

Urlacher is a D playmaker.  Zach Thomas, however, piles up tackles like crazy. he has never had a season with less than 100 tackles.  he will score points.  the you see lowly lance brigs on the bench.    the team looks very solid, you may even be #1 in your league.  but you also have to remember 1 thing.  it is like a team has the best shutdown corner in the NFL.  teams wont throw over toward him, so he wont get all to many points.  however, you should always draft the opposite man, because he will be making tackles, deflecting passes, and picking off passes more than the other guy.  and yes, i am speaking out towards your dbs", 10705, "Rk4VJzrlaa", 0],

Heap is getting older so his numbers will not be what they have been.  David Akers is a kicker with pretty good accuracy so he should get you some points...but I wouldn't expect too many 50 yarders from him.  Dallas defense should be better this year.   Defense looks pretty good.  I would not sit Briggs.  He is looking for a HUGE contract after this year again.

Regularly 'tweet' them, 'retweet' (same as a Facebook 'like'), and treat your followers with courtesy and gratitude. Like you do at 'YA', be very concise (less than 140 characters) and use lots of web links. Also use your own 'hashtags' (eg. #WhatToWear). These will get people interacting with each other.
