Find out why over 90% aren't even covered. Hell, learn what a mass shooting is before you do any of that. Then ask. As of this week, there were 126 of them already this year alone.

Maybe wear something on your skin that make you look orange? I'm seeing some of the things the Coca Cola training program said to do, but I'm finding the directions rather unsophisticated. I'm not sure what you would do to apply all that stuff that the authoress said she wasn't a part of. I think Coca Cola is putting a lot of Facebook videos on Facebook because they really want white people money. Do you think that white people could be less white by buying Pepsi instead of Coca Cola?", 1655, "ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa", 1],

Was Jesus a friend to fake religious ppl who passed judgment?  Was he a friend of the world for that matter?  No. 😏 He was off on his own. Respected the laws. But also knew no one could tell him shxt, like McCain and Romney. He was neutral and yet no friend to the world. And allowed himself to be sacrificed doing the right thing. Although, McCain and Romney were/are Republicans, they represent the same sacrifice Jesus made. 😄 But Jesus was never a Repub.", 1674, "None", -1],

	10270 : ["The \"Anonymous\" that answered that \"the Air Force and Navy are pretty much sissies\", we're you hiding behind mommies skirt when you wrote that? I would bet so because it really shows your lack of intelligence, and downright stupidity.  I can't speak a great deal on the combat arms of the USAF never being an Airman, but I do know a little. I served with a former USAF PJ in the early 80's that served in Vietnam. He had a ribbon rack halfway to his shoulder with numerous Purple Heart awards, a few Bronze Stars, and a couple Silver Stars. Saw him one day at the pool for swim qualifications without a shirt........numerous bullet wound scars. They also have Security Forces, Hell, my last tour in Afghanistan, I was assigned to a small Army Fire Base in the high mountains. We had Army Special Forces, a Navy Chief Petty Officer who ran the motor pool, 2 USAF weather guys, a USMC IT guy, a Navy Physicians assistant and 2 USAF medics. Each time the base was attacked, all, except the medical staff, were armed and joined in the fire fight. The Navy Chief, (me), the 2 weather guys, the Marine, even the cook and the Admin guy, we all fought. Every person, save medical, are first American fighting men/women, a rifleman first.", 1648, "gYIE7AQbaa", 0],

	10276 : ["For the most part, the information they provide is factual.  Granted, there are biases, but that is how the information is spun, not the information itself.  At the very least, they provide a more rounded picture of the news that right wing news sites. For example, consider the election fraud coverage.  MSN etc will present the claim, and then the evidence countering the claim.  So they will show the video purporting to be \"suitcases\" of ballots being \"found\" and counted.  But then they will have an election official explain that they aren't suitcases, they are ballots boxes, and they weren't \"found\", they were put under the table because they didn't think they would get to counting them that night.  A right wing site is more apt to show the same video but with a narration 'explaining\" what you are seeing, then fail to provide expert commentary as to the reality of the situation.   All I can say is if someone cites a YouTube video as proof of anything, it's going to be sheer crap 97% of the time. Personally, if I'm skeptical about a story, I'll research it on multiple sites, and draw my own conclusion.  And just because you don't like the news, that doesn't mean it's fake, as trump would often claim.  ", 1651, "IPACjrR9aa", -4],
