I've just never been much good at writing them. When I wrote the poem below, I was just sitting there writing a.. journal or diary kind of. And then the poem just sort of came to me, and I fixed it up a bit & I was so proud that I'd finally written one. That was a year or two ago though, and unfortunately I haven't been able to complete another poem since. PS.

I originally was only in the Men's Health section, answering questions more than asking due to a ministry I pretty much retired from.  This sort of happened like you, but by a stroke of luck, and I don't even remember how, I came over to poetry, and decided to write a poem.  I was going to say that was a one trick pony, but some people like LC, Dallas, Lizzy and Cassie, even Dave, were there to encourage me, and I stayed on and kept writing.  I can't say I ever loved poetry then, but I do now.

	143618 : ["Sweetheart, in all honesty, fat guys have very low self esteem...and when a fat girl comes onto them...they feel like that you are only doing so because you are fat to and so you think he should like you because he is. It's kinda like you are reassuring him he is fat when he does not want to think so...in their minds, they want skinny girls, so they can feel superior and look good. You know, to boost their self esteems. Haven't you noticed that most fat guys are with skinny women, and most fat girls are with skinny men? It's insane but you cannot help who you love i guess. Fat guys are also at more of a disadvantage than fat girls because women can do alot to look good no matter there size but men cannot do a whole lot. And i am not hating on fat men because i have dated both sizes...I just found the bigger guys to be more sensitive and self consious. From now on, brush them off...they are shallow and have no reason to be. I am 190 and thick, and i have had men that are pushing 290 fat, call me a fat ***. I'm like woahh you got a lot of room to talk but it somehow makes them feel better and turns all of the attention off of themselves and onto someone else.

	143619 : ["Your answer:    Ever heard that old joke that all the twos are looking for a ten? (The movie Ten was popular movie from 1979 starring Bo Derek and Julie Andrews.  ten was highest on the score of good looks.)   Maybe those heavy guys are trying to balance out their genes or something. they are looking for their opposites.    Yes, it is true that very often people are least tolerant towards those who display the traits they dislike in themselves.     A lot of black people are very attracted to blue eyed blonds or Asians and their offspring can be exceptionally good looking, like our latest president and Tiger Woods.     People who talk a lot get along well with people who are quiet.   Tall guys often fall for short girls and vice versa, and don't forget the old nursery rhyme,      \"Jack Spratt could eat no fat .      His wife could eat no lean.      And so you see, together,     they licked the platter clean.\"   I hope this sheds light on why heavy guys are the most critical of you heaviness.", 11587, "Aqwzr7ikaa", -2],

She went down on her new hip with a whimper and as I made a dash for the end of the aisle I saw the other old lady out of the corner of my eye, coming at me with a box of Summer's Eve. She caught me under the left boob and then the 13 year old virgin was on me, pointing and laughing, kicking me in the fallopian tubes.   I laid there, defeated waiting for the crowd to disperse.
