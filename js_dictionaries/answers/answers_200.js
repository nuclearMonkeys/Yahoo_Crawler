In the days, many months after New Orleans was overpowered with flooding from the storm, pundits highlighted the lethargic reaction from the national government, choices made by the city's chairman and the state's lead representative, a deferral in commitment from the U.S. president, the avarice and impact of private organizations, and surprisingly the willfulness of the city's occupants as the foundations for all the torment that had happened. Also, large numbers of the charges had some degree of truth. In any case, on schedule, two straightforward however significant causes were eventually discovered to be the base of what occurred: terrible foundation choices that dated back many years—in New Orleans' case, an ineffectively kept up, deficient levee framework — and a tempest of such extent that once 23 of the levees were penetrated, little should be possible to keep 80% of the city from going submerged.", 1623, "N4aWlOidaa", 0],

Everyone did as they were told. No one complained or refuse to wear masks. It wasn't an option.  Some countries were better prepared. The US didn't have enough masks for everyone so the CDC said to use bandana or t-shirts as face coverings (they're not that great since cotton are quite porous). The CDC said to not buy surgical masks so there would be enough for essential workers (nurses, doctors, grocery workers).  Incompetent leaders.
