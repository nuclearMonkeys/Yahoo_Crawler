	106360 : ["Humans are generally ignorant of the divine spark resident within them. This ignorance is fostered in human nature by the influence of the false creator and his Archons, who together are intent upon keeping men and women ignorant of their true nature and destiny. Anything that causes us to remain attached to earthly things serves to keep us in enslavement to these lower cosmic rulers. Death releases the divine spark from its lowly prison, but if there has not been a substantial work of Gnosis undertaken by the soul prior to death, it becomes likely that the divine spark will be hurled back into, and then re-embodied within, the pangs and slavery of the physical world. Not all humans are spiritual (pneumatics) and thus ready for Gnosis and liberation. Some are earthbound and materialistic beings (hyletics), who recognize only the physical reality. Others live largely in their psyche (psychics). Such people usually mistake the Demiurge for the True God and have little or no awareness of the spiritual world beyond matter and mind. In my search for “THE ANSWER” I went though from the oldest (Chinese) to the youngest belief systems. In all I found a thread of simplicity that it seems everyone misses. I find the human loves to take simple and make it complicated. Here is what I have boiled down to its simplest form. The Divine gave us a soul The Divine communicates to us through the soul. The Divine provided, through the soul, love and strength continuously. The Divine had given us the living word that resides in us. Soul is love Soul is strength Soul is pure Soul is eternal. Through experience I know this. The Love fills us and keeps us from wanting The Strength allows us to over come our human desires and face the situation life gives us. The belief system we chose should guide us to stay connected with our souls.", 9958, "XacKfXcBaa", 0],

When a Mother carries a child..it has even been determined that if she didn't like certain vegetables when she carries her baby,that the child will not like them either,but may not know why.Music has an effect on the unborn and there are so many other factors once the child is born..like no affection,abandonment,abuse and lack of positive role models.

	106362 : ["Depends on the school of thought you'd like to follow. From more deterministic (e.g. psychoanalysis) to less deterministic ones (e.g. humanistic psychology). I personally prefer the more deterministic ones as they actually give info with which to operate. Someone who largely did not pass the oral stage, for example, is likely to have serious problems with authority: from not being able to hold jobs to actual (serious) trouble with the law. It's not the person's fault, these were things that happened or failed to happened between the ages of 0 to 3.  Let's say, I suppose this is going to be shown in the natal chart by a weak Saturn.  From this point onwards what follows is like with every other experiment: hypotheses, operationalisation of the variables, controlling for confounding variables, choosing a sample, procedure, equipment, etc.  At any point there are many traps which can be disputed further and revised several times until a conclusion is reached, and then years later when new data is presented the old conclusions may be refuted altogether. That's what science does in any other field, that's what it should do linking psychology and astrology if someone wants to have their conclusions applicable to larger samples. It's not impossible, there are studies linking the two in one way or another. The biggest (but not insurmountable) obstacle is that you have schools of psychology with totally different views as you have schools of astrology with totally different views. So provided researchers remain as clear as possible as to which methods they are testing something of real value can be produced. I suppose that for this to happen you need a well-schooled psychology team and a well-schooled astrology team and ideally some people (I doubt it you would find many) who are very knowledgeable in at least one sphere of both, as well as being at least moderately versed in research methods themselves. Anything else is and will largely remain speculation where the results are much more likely to be due to chance. Psychology has worked very hard to solidify itself as a science and is not going to easily accept astrological intrusion. I suppose that the wiser thing would be for astrology to come up with stable verifiable data before the two can be linked. But then again, my bias is towards psychology because of my education. Maybe (and most likely) there's far more statistical astrological data than I am aware of.", 9954, "J5JbDYaYaa", 1],

	106383 : ["I think that movies usually involve more action scenes, to keep the audience entertained and engaged, and sometimes (you see this a lot with book to movie adaptions) they can skip over the backstory/inner plot if it is quite complicated. Sometimes they'll just have a character do something (for example maybe a character that was in another country suddenly turned up to save another character from being murdered by an assassin) and you'll be left without an explanation and you'll be sitting there wondering how and why the character acted the way they did or something worked the way it worked out. I also find that in books there is a lot more day to day dialogue (just normal everyay conversations)-probably because there is more time whereas almost everything in a movie is narrowed down so only the really important stuff is in there.
