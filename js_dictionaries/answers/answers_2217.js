So even if someone built a box in the bed big enough it would be taller than a cube-truck and the speakers wouldn't have the -individual, large cu/ft- boxes needed to perform.   Besides it is overkill any way.  I once owned a '86 Mazda B2000 Lowrider Convertible  heavily customized.  Besides all of the mid's and tweeter's the system included 2 - 12\" Kickers inside the cab, behind the bucket seats.  In the bed was two custom made boxes in the bed that each held 4 - 15\" Kickers which faced each other and the space in between them was sealed on the top, bottom and rear, with the only open space facing forward with chicken-wire and carpet.  I had just a Punch 150 powering the 2  12's in the cab and a PPI-2300  (300x4 @2ohms) powering the 4  15's in the bed.  It was LOUD!!!  And it was pretty much useless too!  I got 4 tickets for noise pollution in the span of 2 months.  I couldn't turn the bed on while just listening with the volume down because it was still loud enough to get me pulled over.  It was pretty obnoxious now when I look back on it, but still was a cool truck.   But with only 6 subwoofers it was way overkill, so if your \"buddies buddy\" has 37 subs he wasted a lot of money.  I would believe it if he had a TOTAL of 37 speaker -not all being subwoofers- because that is very possible.   But that is a waste too in my opinion, unless it is for competition and you have sponsors.  The more speakers, the more wiring combinations you can use to power them while getting lots of power from only a few amplifiers.", 10475, "jGq1aLTraa", 0],

He has experiance we controlling egos and would be able to humble the English side. Also, he has experiance with players like SWP, John terry, Lampard, Cole. He knows how they play and also knows how players like ferdinand, gerrard, and rooney play having to face Man Utd and Liverpool in the league.

	116676 : ["28-21 Pats Let's not spend a lot of time explaining why the Cowboys had no business beating Buffalo on Monday. They did it despite themselves.  Dallas will be something of a betting enigma this weekend, a 5-0 team laying more than a field goal at home. But that's what happens when the Patriots come to town. After opening as five-point home underdogs, many are looking at the 'Boys as a tasty bet, especially since they've outscored opponents 80-42 in Dallas this year.  Impressive numbers to be sure. Tantalizing, even. But don't let 'em fool you into thinking Dallas is a good wager.  Why? Well, if you live by the Romo, you die by him too. While he's been lauded for his gunslinging ways, Romo is still rather careless with the football and his decision making leaves a lot to be desired. He's turned the ball over in all but one of Dallas' games this year and is tied for the second-most interceptions in the league with eight.  That's risky business against a Pats team that thrives on takeaways. In its 34-17 closer-than-it-looks victory over Cleveland, New England's defense had three interceptions and a fumble recovery - those takeaways created 21 points. The Pats are tied with Indianapolis for the league lead in turnover differential at plus-seven. The Patriots' defense has forced 11 turnovers (eight interceptions and three fumbles), and the offense has turned it over only four times (two interceptions, two fumbles).  Romo can ill afford to turn the ball over against New England, but his style leads me to believe he won't be able to avoid it. The Pats win games because they win the turnover battles, and this week should be no different.", 10478, "None", 1],
