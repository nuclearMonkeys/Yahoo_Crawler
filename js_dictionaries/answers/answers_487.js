	26946 : ["Roku turns your TV into a \"smart\" TV.  It has many apps available (way more than most smart TVs).  Each app offers different content which may or may not require a subscription. For example, Tubi, Crackle, Stirr, Plex, Roku Channel offer free TV shows and movies.  Note that many are older shows such as \"Petticoat Junction\", but some offer more current content.  Many seem to offer the same \"channels\". Then, different networks offer their own channels, ex. CW with on demand content.  Some also offer live content. Some apps require either a subscription or will let you watch them if you have a current cable/satellite account.  For example, I have Spectrum for our main TVs, but I can watch all my channels live on my Roku.  You can do Sling w/o the Sling box. There are a lot specialty apps.  I like WPT Poker channel.  We have the Cat music channel.  Some are mixture of free or paid content. You can also get subscription apps:  Netflix, HBOMax, Disney +, Amazon, Hulu, etc.  You pay for those separately.  Since we have existing accounts, you just need to set them up in Roku. The main issue I have is their remote.  Its super simple (and I like simple), but there's no page scroll.  If I'm on the Spectrum app I have to hold down the down arrow to move through the channel listing.  There's no volume control.   You can search for movies and TV shows and it will show you if they are available and on what app, even if you haven't add it.  ", 4232, "3u0hV9mdaa", 0],

	27054 : ["t the finish of the play, Macbeth's cut off head is brought to Malcolm by Macduff, verification that Macbeth has been ousted, and that Scotland is currently Malcom's to run the show. Malcolm guarantees awards to all who have battled for him, and names them all dukes, the first in Scotland. He reports that they will currently attempt to welcome back all the individuals of Scotland who fled under Macbeth's oppression, and welcomes all present to watch him be delegated at Scone Castle, the customary crowning liturgy site of Scottish rulers. In his last discourse, Malcolm additionally makes reference to that Lady Macbeth is said to have ended it all. Subsequently, the play closes with next to no equivocalness: the great side has won, and the shrewd side has been vanquished. However there is one leftover string that isn't settled: that of Fleance, Banquo's child, who had the option to escape his dad's killers. The Witches anticipated that Banquo would \"get\" lords, that is, be the patriarch in a line of rulers, albeit not turning into a ruler himself. If this will happen is muddled. Malcolm is the immediate descendent of King Duncan (and, in chronicled truth, took the seat from Macbeth). There was a genuine Banquo, and King James I was believed to be dropped from his line, so maybe Shakespeare left the status of Banquo's relatives questionable to satisfy his benefactor.", 4249, "N2CY3QPWaa", -1],

Well, absolutely, yes. Just like you can also find a few Christians who don't really care about other people's sex lives one bit. But generally speaking, though..? It tends to work this way: Secular people, or people who follow religious/spiritual paths that don't really concern themselves with sexually related dogma, and other people's sex lives: \"Other people can just do whatever... Meh. It's none of my business, anyway.\" Most Christians, who follow a religion that's got TONS of yucky, oppressive dogma as it pertains to sex and people's sexualities: \"Holy crap... My neighbors are doing WHAT in bed?! That's gross! Ewwww!!! And.. what are YOU doing in bed? If you're in THIS sort of relationship, what exactly does THAT say about your sex life? I want to know...
