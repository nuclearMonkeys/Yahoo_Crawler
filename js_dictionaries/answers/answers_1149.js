	62947 : ["Voodoo Child is Hendrix's signature sound --- nothing even comes close (though I might add, he owes a lot to Buddy Guy on that one): Next in line is his Star Spangled Banner performance at Woodstock, 1969 --- a truly inspired and revolutionary interpretation (though not necessarily an easy piece to listen to on a permanent repeat): I really enjoy Hendrix's version of All Along the Watchtower, too -- it's an epic performance; he owned that song. Then there is Hey Joe: and, of course, Little Wing: Hendrix remains one of the incontestable guitar genius of all time.  ... That said, we all have our own favorite guitar heroes, and I personally owe a huge debt of gratitude to MY guitar heroes: Stevie Ray Vaughn, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, Albert King, Jeff Beck, Billy Gibbons, and  na.   Among the reasons why I picked up the guitar in the first place.   Though I would certainly include Joe Satriani and John Mayer on that list, in more recent years, as well.

I have always felt that John's work was not as good after Yoko, because she wanted to be a part of his creative process. Paul, on the other hand has continued to be successul with his music after the Beatles break-up.  Like so many groups, they were the sum total of all their individual talents, and it is a shame that they could not stay together for another 10 years. The works that could have come from the total creativity they possessed. Perhaps, in a way, the group dynamics led each to pursue their individual talents, and return as a tight band.", 8190, "AA11962420", 0],
	62988 : ["To some extent but not really. It is obvious even to the fairest of fans, Sir Paul is the most successful with the Beatles and as a solo artist as well. That is why he is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for both the Beatles and solo too.  Last year when he toured, Lexus ran comercials giving a quick snap of all the accomplishments in his life and only a half of them were with the Beatles. As a musician, I truely appreciate the complexity of his compositions that he took great pleasures to create. I will break down a quick analysis: John was more of a straight rocker who revelled in the late 50's guitar style as well as an acoustical genius and wonderful piano player. Most of his music was steeped in the vein of American rock, dance halls and folk. George was the experimental artist that looked outside of rock to fullfil his creative desires and spiritual searchings.  Ringo did very little writing and the selections that he recorded were rarely composed by him (with the exception of the gem Octopus's Garden a great Ringo penned tune).  Paul always wanted to be a show tune and classical musician. His first instrument was a trumpet [his Dad was in a Brass Band] as Paul wrote \"When I'm 64\" at 14 years old as a show tune. We also had hints in the Beatles as examples he learned to play many instruments and even  in the \"Let It Be\" movie, you see him playing a classical piece on the piano. We would later, of course, see quite  a bit more of that and he is about to release another classical piece called \"Ecce Cor Meum\" which has a 25th of September release date. Paul is deservingly credited with a lot. It is a fact that because the untimely death of George and the horrific death of John, many people tend to lean in their direction when discussing the Beatles and their accomplishments. When it is all said and done,  the accomplishments of Paul in a life time of accomplishments and contributions to society, will by far outshine all the other three Beatles with a far reaching distance. PS-- \"Hey Jude\", recorded July 29th, 30th, 31st and August 1st-1968,  was written by Paul for John's son Julian.", 8190, "AA12393872", 2],
	62989 : ["I just love the Beatles I love every song and I am a huge fan. I saw Paul at the Staples Center a couple of years ago and it was amazing. They all were amazing together.
