	44405 : ["Bible bashing is something that New Atheists invented. Do you find it difficult to view Scripture as the infallible Word of God rather than the personal opinion of man? Do you struggle to accept the fact that the Bible is true and completely trustworthy? If so, you are likely the victim of Bible-bashing. Sadly, many people have been hoodwinked by critics who present false information about Scripture. Victims of Bible-bashing are at a huge disadvantage when it comes to grasping the spiritual dynamics all around them. Attempting to discern the truth about God and salvation is next to impossible if you believe the Bible is a flawed document. The alternative of course is to accept this simple fact: \"All Scripture is God-breathed.\" (2 Tim. 3:16) The decision about whether or not to trust God's Word is up to you. The Lord won't force you to accept this beautiful compilation of 66 books written by 40 authors over a period of 1500 years. And all of it points to Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah and the author of salvation for everyone who receives Him by faith.", 6382, "None", -1],
	44406 : ["As people age, the tendency is to come to terms with the inevitable of death. So not weird. I don't know, you might be a bit young to be going through that.  And youth tend to feel more invincible.  But maybe you were always just more mature for your age. ", 6383, "AA11341587", 1],

	44414 : ["Yes and no. Intelligence changes as you age. That's likely due to inactive genes being turned on later in life. So, if you're under 18-20, your IQ may decrease or increase later in life.

	44418 : ["In my case, I learned to hate school and everything connected with it because I endured years of physical and psychological abuse while I was there. And I'm FAR FROM ALONE in that respect. There are MILLIONS of adults out there who are just like me, and who went through absolute utter HELL at the hands of the American public education system. Most of us are hard to see, though- because we learn how to hide our scars very early on in our lives.

	44423 : ["I highly doubt that's your actual IQ, those online tests aren't at all accurate. I took an actual one for school one time and got 130 but took an online one and got about 98. To be completely honest, I don't even think that IQ tests are even a good measure of intelligence since I wouldn't consider myself especially smart or anything. Besides, different people have different things that the excel in and there are different kinds of intelligences.  Tdlr: Online IQ tests aren't accurate, don't let it get you down", 6399, "None", 0],

	44425 : ["When did he turn 5? Boys often develop a little slower than girls, and are better off being a little older when they start school. My grandson was born on Sept. 3, just past the cutoff for starting kindergarten, so he was almost 6 when he started. But we were fine with that, because it gave him time for social and language development. He's done fine in school every since. You should be looking at this as a failure, or that he's being \"held back\", but as a chance to prepare him for better success. Would you rather he start 1st grade too soon and fall even farther behind? ", 6392, "cbMTODDZaa", 2],

As for the possible sex offender/child molester theory, that's not a problem because registered sex offenders and known pedophiles are forbidden to live within a certain distance of schools and must notify all neighbors within a certain distance of their status and address they live.

	44430 : ["There was a fad at the time for some schools not to worry about grammar and it was more important that children learned to be \"expressive.\" AS Neill was suddenly fashionable around then. Turned out to be a fallacy since without having the tools at your disposal it is impossible to write effectively and with any authority. (I am staggered at what I read as an external examiner for theses.)  The same sort of philosophy that went on to decide that learning your times table parrot fashion was also regressive. Happily my LEA was way behind the times and I got an old-fashioned grounding in English and Maths for which I am grateful.", 6394, "None", 1],

	44434 : ["Many parents, especially with their first child, want to believe that their kids are always angels, and they would never make stuff up or lie. Please listen when I say that KIDS LIE! Yes, all of them, even yours. I assume he's maybe 4 or 5, and he may be confusing reality with fantasy if he's not just telling outright lies. He may have gotten the idea from a movie or book, another child, or maybe he overheard someone making a joke. I'd say it's very unlikely that he's telling the truth, although he may truly believe what he's saying.  If you want to put this to rest, there's a few things you can do. Start by taking him to school and pointing out this “monster closet.” Ask him to describe it in detail, and tell you what's inside it (besides monsters). Then have him show you what's inside. This will at least give you an idea if he's ever even seen the inside of the closet. Just keep in mind that knowing the contents of the closet doesn't mean his story is true. But it's a good way to see how far he will go with this lie or delusion.  You could also speak to some other parents and their children about what goes on at school. Without putting any ideas in the child's head, ask them about the rules and the punishment for breaking those rules. Ask where the teacher sends kids who don't follow the rules. If the other kids don't know anything about this monster closet, then you can assume it's not true. There's also a small possibility that the teacher told the kids about the monster closet to get them to behave, but doesn't actually put kids in there.  If your son still won't let this go, you can try sending him to school with a hidden camera or microphone on his clothing. There are spy cameras and nanny cams that are very small and easily hidden. Make sure your son doesn't know about it. This will let you know exactly what happens once the parents leave.  Once you confirm his story isn't true, you need to tell him that you don't wanna hear about it ever again. He's either confused about something, or he's lying because there's another reason he doesn't wanna go to school. It's possible he's making up stories because he doesn't wanna tell you what's really going on. But do not reward his lies. He may just be doing it for attention too. Whatever you do, do not give in to his tantrums. If you validate his bad behavior, he will keep doing it until he gets his way. ", 6395, "None", -2],
	44435 : ["Perhaps you just need to take your kid to a different school. If he continues speaking about the closet at another school, then you'll know he probably isn't telling the truth. Are there other parents experiencing this too? All in all, I would consider finding a different school if it's possible for you.", 6395, "Z8o8vORBaa", 2],
	44436 : ["This may vary by state.  In my state, the state Board of Education determines the total number of credits required for graduation, and the minimum number of credits in each subject area that are required.  Counties are then able to make their own additional requirements - so they could require specific courses in the subject areas, require more credits for graduation than what the state requires, and require more credits in a subject area than what the state requires.  In my state, students need 3 science credits to graduate; in my county, they must take earth science and biology, with the 3rd course being the student's choice.", 6396, "xif22nwoaa", 1],
	44437 : ["In most school districts, you have a choice of biology, chemistry or whatever other science they offer. Larger schools can offer more choices. Was the school in Twin Oaks smaller? They might not have had enough students to offer choices of science courses.

	44439 : ["Most of us are much happier after high school. The whole drama, not being able to control hormones, insecurity, fight to establish independence from parents while not really wanting to be independent-  I wouldn't go back to that for any money. in the world! While no one under 30 ever believes this, life gets a lot easier in the 30s. You have a better idea who you are, you should be more established in a career, and you stop worrying about what other people think of you. ", 6397, "cbMTODDZaa", 2],

Newsflash:  FEAR is also unseen, and people who don't believe in God, allow it to overtake their lives.  But, they love to point out that FAITH is unseen.", 6382, "vMZr1SSVaa", 1],

Then  go to the town that sits two miles from the dam and ask the residents there the same question. They will tell you that they doubt anything like that might happen, and that they're confident that it never will. But something really interesting happens when you go to the town that sits at the very foot of the dam.
