	42933 : ["Whom do I contact about Jews and freemasons (aka homosexual devilworshipping Jew-masons) killing 70 million in Soviet Union by gulags, famine, or shooting squads? How can Russian Orthodox get some justice? Russian Orthodox Metropolitan Ioann Snychev was poisoned/murdered by Jew Putin (aka Shalomov) because he refused to work for Jews. KGB poisoned Putin; Putin died in 2007; now doubles (who wear latex masks) pretend to be Putin. Medvedev is David Aaronovich Mendel. Jews murdered Tsar Nicolas 2nd's family; Jews bled them for six hours according to ritual. Tsar Nicolas' family was sacrificed by Jews (they bled 6 hours); their remains were burnt; their blood drank; ashes from remains were sprinkled onto 50 hard-boiled eggs (dish called scido Amafreikis) [50 egg shells were found outside the place of ritual murder]. Also, decapitated Tsar's head (which was grey ... hair turned grey when he saw his kids being knifed).. Ritualistic murder... (blood libel is same thing as anti-Semitism ... a lie by Jews to flee justice). Jews came up that Tsar's family was shot. Tsar appeared to warn that whosoever worships false remains will become possessed by demons (this just happened like a decade ago ... maybe less)… Jews collect heads of leaders because they believe in reincarnation. How about Jews coming up with a mocking holiday April 1st because resurrection of Jesus happened on that day? Jews came up with mocking holidays 23 February (Day of Soviet Army) which was capitulation by cowards in Tsar's army… or March 8 (international Woman's day) which celebrates lesbian/prostitute Klara Tsetkin and Rosa Luxembourg. Three biggest saints in heaven (in this order): Theotokos Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, and Tsar Nicolas 2nd Four biggest sinners in hell (in this order from the bottom of hell moving up to our level): Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin You could joke that Marx is a bigger sinner than Engels because Marx fooked Engels but how is Lenin a bigger sinner than Stalin when Lenin was fooked by Zinoviev (even by Bronstein once)? Lenin's brain was the size of walnut. He had syphilis. Was alcoholic. Born from incest degenerate family. Was in insane asylum. Wife Kruspkaya was probably lesbian 'cause what normal woman would stay with him? According to Russian Orthodox researcher Grigoriy Klimov, three stages of degeneracy are 1)sodomy (69, anal, oral, masturbation, pedophilia, incest, necrophilia, beastiality, orgies, hand job, bj, even all non-missionary positions between husband and wife, etc.) 2)insane asylum 3)physical deformities in kids (eyes looking at different angles, wolf jaw, rabbit lip, horse foot, different length limbs, etc.) all these accompanied by drug/alcohol abuse Jews have like six times more degenerates than other nations because they don't have monkhood. Jewish degenerates become politicians (or similar high rank in society). In Germany during Hitler time, it was eight times. Hitler, Stalin (aka Jugashvilli which means son of Jew), Roosevelt, Churchill were all Jewish degenerates. Hitler had many Jewish coworkers as homosexual partners. Stalin was expelled from seminary for sodomy. A few centuries ago, angel appeared to Orthodox Christian community and said not to buy from Jews at bazaar because it's sprinkled with blood (something like that) Those were facts… and now for some Conspiracy Theory: Elimination of comments on Yahoo Answers means that Project Pogo is completed. Now, Project Zyphr will initiate in winter. They will turn off electricity for a few days to gather dissidents into underground concentration camps.

There used to be places in Egypt where ONLY foreigners could go- casinos and bars. I don't know if that's still true. One caveat- Muslim countries are not happy about unmarried couples sharing hotel rooms. They may not ask for a marriage license, but it would hurt to pretend you're married. And while the major tourist areas of Egypt are somewhat use to Westerners dressing in a more provocative way, it would be nice and respectful not to wear tank tops, short shorts, torn jeans or crop tops.

	42943 : ["I can't recommend anything because there are major shortages of Graphics cards and AMD Ryzen processors. There is also a power supply shortage which has caused power supplies to become overpriced.  The Core i7-6700 is still alright so I would recommend upgrading the Graphics card first. If you do upgrade the CPU first then all you MIGHT see is a more stable framerate of a higher framerate in some situations. You won't be able to raise the settings unless you upgrade the Graphics card first. The GTX 1070 is just slightly better than the GTX 1660 ti so you'd have to put down the money and go with something that's the same as the RTX 2080 to see a real upgrade. Since the RTX 20 series has been discontinued so you could look at the RTX 3060ti which is a little bit faster than the RTX 2080 Super. The other reason I'd recommend holding off on a CPU upgrade is you'd have to replace the motherboard and maybe the RAM if you want to upgrade the CPU. The best in-socket upgrade for you would be the Core i7-7700k which isn't much better than the Core i3-10300 or the 6700. Also, since Games are more dependent on the Graphics card performance, you won't see a lineal performance increase by upgrading the CPU. Some games will make you think you wasted you money on the CPU. The AMD Ryzen 5000 processors are the Gaming leader but AMD will probably lose their gaming crown when Intel comes out with their 11th Generation processors. ", 6220, "qo6eoyvmaa", 1],
