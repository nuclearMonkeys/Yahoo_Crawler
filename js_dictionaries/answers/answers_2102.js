Then we came home from work one day and she was laying in a pool of \"water\" b/c she was salivating so much. On our way to the vet she had 3 grand maul seizures and we had to put her to sleep. It was one of the most DEVESTATING things I ever had to go through (until my grandma died of cancer... obviously WORSE!). All I can say is that time will help but you will NEVER forget the love you received (and gave) to your kitty! Just know that you gave her a good life, she was loved and YOU were WITH her in her final moments! :( She is also no longer in pain. I know all of that is probably repetitive and NOTHING that I say will make you feel any better.. but my heart and my prayers go out to you! Its SO hard and breaks the heart more then people who DONT have pets would EVER know!! Take care and maybe take something like a tylenol pm tonight so that you can sleep. Otherwise you will just stay up all night crying w/ your heart aching!! :( Keep your head up and try to keep your spirits high. Again, remember that you gave her a GOOD life and she knew she was loved. Thats all you really can do!   ~Kat", 10143, "RYLK3rCnaa", 1],

Cellular respiration produces a significantly larger amount of energy, typically fermentation serves to regenerate intermediate electron carriers so that glycolysis can run continuously.  Cellular respiration involves the kreb's cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and TCA) and the electron transport chain to occur.   Alcoholic fermentation begins with pyruvate converts it into acetaldehyde and subsequently converts that into ethanol Commercial applications include use fermenting microbes to produce ethanol for alcoholic beverages, for example wine and beer Yes, anaerobic happens in the body during intense exercise where the body's need for energy exceeds the oxygen supply.
