	57596 : ["Well that depends - considered young by whom, and in which context? Obviously to a 6 year old, 40 would probably seem very old. A 20 year old college student might think a 40yo professor seems pretty young compared to other professors who are older, but when they think of dating a 40 year old compared to someone their own age, then it does seem old (though some people are drawn to older partners). Well, I wouldn't say 40 is young, even 30s aren't that young really, but it's still on the younger side of life. Your 40s are the beginning of middle age, but  it's still the prime of your life in many ways, and with people living much longer now on average, ageing isn't perceived the same as it used to be. Just remember, James Bond is in his late 30s to mid 40s. When Roger Moore played Bond, he was between the ages of 46 and 58!

If you are over 18, then you are supposed to be treated like an adult, and that includes people addressing you politely as 'sir'.  If you expect everyone to address you as 'bro', 'dude' and 'man' like you're some kind of perpetual frat boy, then you probably should ask yourself why you're so damn immature and reluctant to grow up and live in the adult world.", 7986, "None", 3],

	57625 : ["In order to understand the concept of \"sociology\", you have to understand the dichotomy of thinking among humans.  There are 2 ways of interpreting the World--one is through the lens of emotion and the other is through the lens of objectivity.  Your wife falls into the first category.  See does not view the world objectively through dispassionate analysis.  She uses emotion and sociology is a tool for the emotional thinkers to justify their \"feelings\" about society.  They claim a completely neutral approach without bias, but immediately categorize people into the roles that justify their feelings.  She was drawn to sociology, because it satisfies her need to \"feel\" a particular way about society.  In a world with only objective thinkers--there would be no such field as sociology.  Sociology focuses on subjective theories and opinions that serve no real purpose other than to deepen the emotional thought of the participants.  As such, your wife has academic sanction for her emotional thought.  ", 7992, "H2h8fnTpaa", 1],
	57626 : ["Sociology is the study of group behavior in social situations, which means finding the typical way certain groups of people behave in certain environments.  I suppose that can be interpreted as stereotyping, but is it merely a stereotype if the data backs up the assertions?  For example, one of the research projects I am managing include examining feelings about consensual non-monogamy.  Part of that is examine religiosity - does trying to determine whether one's religion affects their views on polyamory make for stereotyping?  I would argue not.   Another is about how parents of children with type I diabetes tend to use social media to alleviate stress.  Does this lead to stereotyping?  Again, I would argue not. Sociological findings are not about prejudice and closed mindedness, in fact quite the opposite.  It is about finding whatever we can that generalizes onto a broader population.  We can then determine what is typical and atypical in any given situation.  I think the problem here is that society has condemned all such exploration of the nature of reality.  A stereotype is mistaken idea or belief that people hold about groups.  The conclusions that come from Sociological research, though not necessarily universal, are generally true as it related to the group to which the generalizations are made.  It is not prejudice, it is not bias, it is a series of accurate assertions about the nature of the world and the groups in question. Truth has long been a defense (though in Canada, that has been taken away, and agenda trumps truth today under Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission v. Whatcott, hopefully that never comes to the United States or elsewhere), and the truths found in Sociology are not intended to hurt, harm, or lead to prejudice.  They are what they are.  ", 7992, "74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa", 1],
