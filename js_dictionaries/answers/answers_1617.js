	86512 : ["For this, you REALLY need to know your history.  Carter gutted the CIA back in the 70s.  What few operatives we had left, were all of WW II vintage.  No ne, not even George Bush (Sr. -- once head of the CIA) had sense enough to correct the situation.  Now, fast forward to Somalia and our presents in the gulf region.  We had a small contingent of Army backed by CIA working in Mogadishu.  The Army was working on intel provided by the spooks.  Trouble was, the spooks \"intel.\" was out dated by almost a decade.  Working on the premise that they were to secure the opening to the gulf, their mission was to try and stabilize that warlord run country.  With bad intel, the Army attempted to conduct an op.  It went from bad to worse and no one was willing to pull the plug.  People died needlessly and foolishly.  The Commander In Chief knew not what he was doing and had openly stated on more than one occasion that he had no love or use for the military which now served him. Hillary Rodham-Clinton.  America was still living with the ideal of a \"First Lady\" being someone like Jackie Kennedy, Betty Ford or Nancy Reagan.  America was no ready for the likes of Hillary.  She wanted a pet project to call her own -- and it wasn't to be something on the lines of redecorating the Whitehouse (again).  Given to her, was America's \"Healthcare System.\"  The political spin was that it was broke.  Her idea, turn the decision making process over to the insurance companies.  THIS was somehow supposed to drive down the cost of healthcare.  It was a disaster.  And now, rvised, she wants to again turn our healthcare over to the insurance companies, making it mandatory that we ALL must carry insurance.  Oh?  Or what?  Debtor's prison? Is your statement a fair assessment?  Yes.", 9232, "0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa", 2],

She also sang lead vocal on Seduction's You're The One And Only and was half of the duo Two Tons O Fun who were the backing singers for Sylvester. Because Martha Wash was a \"big\" girl; C+C Music Factory AND Blackbox would not let her be in their videos and instead hired the skinny actress seen in all those videos...  but make no mistake, it's Martha Wash The Most Underrated Soul Singer Of Our Time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)", 9231, "3cae1a173ced8370d2a6d3af83b9b006aa", 2],

It goes into more detail in Slash's autobiography. ...I can't find that right now (it's somewhere in my room but there's too much crap in here to find anything :P) but you should google it and you'll probably get something from there. Basically Axl made it too crazy what with leaving shows early and being SO unpredictable. Slash thought it wasn't fair on the fans and he didn't think that GNR was what it used to be.  ...So he up and left :(", 9230, "5HvdcWvBaa", 0],
	86520 : ["Mainly because they couldn't get along. Besides Axl was composing songs alone without consulting other members. This was, among many other things, another issue.

	86521 : ["Hellary is exactly right!!  (or LEFT!!)  I have a friend whose son, Jamie Smith, was killed and dragged through the streets of Somalia.  He was a Ranger as were his Dad, a Vietnam vet who lost his leg in the war, and his twin brothers.  Jamie was a hero who had to deal with the war and the lack of equipment which was denied him and his comrads by none other than Bill Clinton.  Bill was a disgrace and always will be though the Liberals choose to call him a hero.  Hellary is the same as Bill and will destroy our Country if she is ever allowed to be in charge.  She despises the military and both he and Bill would not allow anyone to wear a uniform in the White House while they served there.  They hated the military, the CIA and the FBI.  I guess they were too close to the corruption that the Clintons made a part of their lives.  It makes me sick when I think how many are willing to put socialists in charge of our Country. God forbid that Hellary gets in office.  Please do your research before you cast a vote which will change our lives forever and will definitely put us in harms' way.", 9232, "T0pkW783aa", 3],
	86522 : ["That would be an affirmative.  Somebody give that first answerer some old newspapers... Bush 1 was long out of office when Somalia went down. Total slick willie failure and that is a fact. Edit: Chuck below  Civil war disrupted agriculture and food distribution in southern Somalia. The resulting famine caused the United Nations Security Council in 1992 to authorise a limited peacekeeping operation called United Nations Operation in Somalia, known as UNOSOM I. UNOSOM's use of force was limited to self defence and it was soon disregarded by the warring factions. In reaction to the continued violence and the humanitarian disaster, the United States organised a military coalition with the purpose of creating a secure environment in southern Somalia for the conduct of humanitarian operations. The coalition, called Unified Task Force or UNITAF entered Somalia in December 1992 on Operation Restore Hope and was successful in restoring order and alleviating the famine. In May of 1993, most of the United States troops withdrew and UNITAF was replaced by United Nations Operation in Somalia II, or UNOSOM II. Somali Warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid saw the UNOSOM II nation-building efforts as a threat to his power. In June 1993, militia loyal to Aidid attacked UNOSOM II Pakistani Army troops in Mogadishu inflicting over 80 casualties. Fighting between Aidid forces and UNOSOM II elements escalated until 19 American troops and more than 1,000 Somalis were killed in a raid in Mogadishu in October 1993. As you can see and as almost all has said here, the proverbial crap hitting the fan fan did not take place until well into Clinton's administration ...he was so weak......", 9232, "14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa", 6],

To defend when needed and preserve.  We need  a good military and intelligence and how could that be when her mission is to cut them down.

Huh...Lets try to get the facts correct. Clinton did say that he as Commander in Chief handled the Blackhawk down situation poorly (ever hear Bush say he made a mistake?)   One result was he made sure there was a Damn good plan in place before becoming involved in Bosnia and Kosovo.  Despite a lot of pressure to jump right in, he held back, made sure our European Allies were shouldering their share of the burden Of course in the last four years we have spent several Billion $ making a permanent Base in Kosov.

But calculated they can be deflecting each other's fray, as she was during his elections... and then we get the womens vote playing here. It's another Clintons status quo machine manuever.  From what I have read and understand even Newsweek has a piece this week Ex Pres has been asked to tone it down.  Because ultimaely they are splitting the DNC and the party. Sending en masse people toward Independent or Republican votes. SO we wonder is Ron Paul set for his launch as an Independent and swing vote candidate? Was it planned well before? Shall Blooberg come in and clean house?  In my opinion this is the most deplorable behaviour and worse than any previous displays by WIlliam Jefferson. He can lie to his family, lie to a nation and now he is just proving the world with his true colours and they are shades of grey. Sad. Even I did not expect this. Yet their is a plan you can bet.
