	5652 : ["Frozen means in a solid state because it is below the melting point of that material. Frozen does not just mean ice or cold. Metal becomes liquid if its hot enough.", 940, "cyIPEOLYaa", 0],
	5653 : ["For the metal it is at a frozen temperature. Different substances have different temperatures at which they melt or freeze. I suspect you may be in the USA. Most people on here seem to be. As far as I am aware you still use the Fahrenheit scale for temperature. That is quite a flawed scale. Here in the UK we use the Celsius scale. It is better but not perfect. On either scale the person who devised them set arbitrary values. Both Fahrenheit and Celsius decided that at standard pressure ice melts and becomes liquid at zero degrees and it boils and turns into a liquid at one hundred degrees. What Fahrenheit did not realise is that to do this correctly the substance must be pure and he used impure water. So on his scale pure water turns from solid ice into liquid water at 32 degrees F. Go to any high school physics lab and you will be able to get the teacher to pour boiling water over your hands without it scalding you. This is because boiling point depends on atmospheric pressure and not only temperature. Lower the pressure and water can be boiled (turned from liquid to gas) at a temperature that would not scald you. I still remember my school physics teacher telling us you cannot brew a decent cup of tea up Mount Everest because water boils at about 60 degrees C which is not hot enough to brew tea properly. So different substances change physical state at different temperatures. The temperatures at sea level that determine the physical state of water are not fixed constants for every substance. Therefore, something does not have to be below zero/32 degrees C/F to be considered frozen.", 940, "kz04oBhsaa", 0],
	5654 : ["Two ways of looking at this: don't call it frozen if you consider freezing to be only a function of temperature (another way to express lack of heat), or consider that \"freezing\" is object-specific so the temperature of freezing depends on the object (freezing is not temperature specific, it is object-specific). Which world do you live in?  The world I live in sees materials become solid under particular pressure-temperature conditions that are particular to the object itself, and no P-T conditions are identical for any substance.", 940, "WbVE1cXKaa", 0],

	5663 : ["The vaccines all provide above 95% immunity. The Pfizer vaccine, for example, provides 96% immunity. That is assuming you're not immunocompromised, like because you have lupus, cancer, HIV, or some disease that compromises your immune system. So, for me, 96% immunity means I have 4% the chance I had of getting it before. Say that I'm in New York City at a gathering of 10 random people for one hour in an average size apartment. Currently, in New York, that means there's a 10% to 19% chance one of them have COVID, so let's split the difference at 15%. If none of us are wearing masks or following social distancing guidelines, I have a one in three chance of catching the original COVID, one in two chance with the B.1.1.7. variant, which now makes up about half of all cases, making it a 1 in 2.5 chance or 40%. So 40% times 15% times 4% means that I can still catch COVID at that party once vaccinated, but the chances of me catching COVID have been reduced by my being vaccinated to 2 in 1,000 or 0.2%. As herd immunity is achieved by 80% to 90% of people being vaccinated, that 0.2% will decrease to 0%, or so close to 0% as to be no higher than one in a 100 million.   ", 935, "None", 2],

	5689 : ["I am an oldtimer in astronomy, having learned to read from astronomy books and other science books about six decades ago. I thought I knew it all, but being on this site has shown me that the most important thing to understand about astronomy, and also the most difficult to master is the psychology of the subject. The physical stuff is the easy bit, even though it should be pointed out, that it takes many years to get a correct and intuitive picture of the scale and structure of the universe. However trying to get one's head around how and why astronomy is presented to the public the way it is, and why people in general have so much trouble with concepts such as distance scales, timescales, the difference between fact and fiction, or bothering to seek facts when often their only exposure to astronomy and space is through sci-fi movies, why they are obsessed with esoteric topics that really should only be the concern of professionals, and why they hold beliefs with the tenacity of religious fervor, are all challenging to comprehend. I have learned that what astronomy urgently needs is a branch called astropsychology wherein students can learn why the public perceives astronomy the way they do, which is clearly based on all manner of social, religious and cultural factors that have little if any relation the the physical sciences of which astronomy is a member. When YA shuts down, we unfortunately lose a convenient way to look into the minds of the scientifically illiterate (not meant to be an insult) who seem to have a passing interest in astronomy and space, and perhaps get them to question their own beliefs and perceptions and thereby encourage them to obtain a more accurate understanding of the universe and the world we are in. Without organs like YA, I sense that astronomy will nosedive into myth, fantasy, delusions, fraud and the murky darkness from which it emerged, as it trends ever deeper into the pseudoscience that is taking a grip on it today. And that would be a great waste of centuries of work in astronomical science.", 939, "bXMPytYEaa", 1],
