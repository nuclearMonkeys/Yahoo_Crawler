Scriptures like the Vedas are mythology, and mythology is timeless rather than historical.  Scriptures like the Quran are the supposed dictates of a god, not the history of God's interventions with humanity. The Quran makes claims about Jesus 600 years after the fact, e.g., denying his crucifixion. The New Testament scriptures were all written in the same century as Jesus.  We have many more good, early copies of them than we have of any other writings of the ancient world. Cheers, Bruce", 10931, "Sn0CViR7aa", 0],

	127334 : ["The word antichrist only can be found in 1 and 2 John. 1 John 2:22 states, \"who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?  He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.\" Therefore, the antichrist denies that Jesus was the Messiah (Christ).   1 John 4:2-3 states, \"hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now is already in the world.\" Jesus Christ coming in the \"flesh\" is speaking of his physical body.  The important word is \"Christ.\"  The emphasis is whether or not one believes that the Christ has physically come in a flesh body.  Many of the Jews rejected Jesus was the Messiah.  That is why the verse says that the spirit of antichrist was already in the world; it is denying that Jesus was the Messiah who had already physically (in the flesh) came.  The coming antichrist will also deny that Jesus was the Christ, and anyone who does likewise is in the spirit of this coming antichrist. 2 John 7 states, \"for many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.  This is a deceiver and an antichrist.\" Again, we have people saying that Jesus Christ has not come in the flesh.  Coming in the flesh is speaking of his physical first coming.  It is denying that the Christ has ever come, in effect saying that Jesus was not the Christ.  This is the spirit of antichrist. Many have the the opinion that the antichrist is a false religious leader in the Church.  But you can't derive that opinion by looking at the context in which the word antichrist occurs, which says he will deny Jesus is the Christ. In 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 the \"man of sin\" is shown sitting in the temple of God.  The two main thoughts are this is either speaking of the Church or a literal rebuilt temple in Jerusalem.  If the antichrist denies that a Messiah has ever physically come then that would not fit someone in the Church.  However, many of the Jews are still awaiting the arrival of the Messiah.  If this is someone the Jews accept as their Messiah, of necessity he would have to deny that Jesus was the Christ, and they would accept him in the temple.   I believe the antichrist is a Jewish false messiah whom the Jews, who have rejected Jesus as the Messiah, will accept in his stead.  The Greek word \"anti\" means against or instead of, and I think both are implied.  He is against and instread of the real Messiah.   The second beast (Rev. 13:11) is described as a lamb whose words come from the dragon.  Lamb is the symbol for Christ, and dragon the symbol for the devil.  So, he appears like Christ, but is really from the devil, a false Christ.   Moreover, Matthew 24:23-24 says that false Christs will deceive people by \"great signs and wonders.\"  The second beast is said to deceive people by doing great wonders and miracles (Rev. 13:13-14).  And the man of sin is said to deceive people by \"signs and lying wonders\" (2 Thess. 2:9-11).  He fits the criteria of a false Christ.  So, I don't believe the antichrist is someone in the church.  So, I believe the antichrist is the second beast/false prophet, not the first beast/world leader. All it takes is the right political leader.  I believe this antichrist (false Messiah)will someday encourage the rebuilding of the temple. Just recently 70 rabbis formed the first Sanhedrin since the first century.  They are tracing linages, and claim to have candidates that can trace their ancestry back to king David, a must for anyone who is the Messiah.  And they believe the Messiah is coming very soon. They are practicing temple rituals and earnestly want the temple rebuilt.  They have candidates for a red heifer that is a required sacrifice to dedicate any a new temple.  They wait until it is a few years old to see if it will remain perfectly red.  If any other color develops on it's coat it is disqualified. Under the current leadership a rebuilt temple is unlikely, but that will change.   In the O.T. times the priest and king are separate offices.  What the Messiah does is combine the offices of prophet, priest, and king.  Jesus was rejected by the Jewish hierarchy as this priestly king in part because he was not one of them, holding the office of a priest.   Jesus predicted this in John 5:43 where he said they would reject him and choose another in his stead.  That verse states, \"I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\"  One meaning of the Greek word \"anti\" is \"instead of.\"  The antichrist is instead of the true Christ, and is why the antichrist's emphasis in 1 and 2 John is in not believing that Jesus was the Christ. The coming false Messiah will be a president of Israel.  This is the role of king that the Messiah must have.  He will also be the supreme religious leader in Judaism in his priestly role.  One of the reasons Jesus was rejected was because he was not one of them, from among their priests.   So, my guess is one of these Sanhedrin will take the leadership over those priests as their Messiah and also be elected president, solidifying the role of prophet, priest, and king, whom Jesus already fulfilled.  He may be the president who rebuilds the temple. He will convince them by performing great signs and wonders (2 Thess. 2:9-11; Rev. 13:11-14). I gather these convincing miracles will not sway true Christians since they know who the real Messiah is.  But that will not be the case for those in Judaism who are in the spirit of this coming antichrist because they don't believe a Messiah has ever come in the flesh.  Matthew 24:26-27 states, \"wherefore if they say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth; behold, he is in secret chambers, believe it not.  For as lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even to the west; so shall the coming of the Son of man be.\" So, Jesus is distinguishing himself from being misidentified with a false Christ.  The secret chambers may refer to the inner rooms of the temple, which would line up with the man of sin sitting in the temple in 2 Thess. 2:4.  If the Jews do accept someone as their Messiah, I think it is unlikely that a third temple would not be rebuilt.", 10926, "GItBUBL9aa", 0],

Marriage and the Family: Marriage was divinely established in Eden and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman in loving companionship. For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God as well as to the spouse, and should be entered into only between partners who share a common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, closeness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church. Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some family relationships may fall short of the ideal, marriage partners who fully commit themselves to each other in Christ may achieve loving unity through the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses the family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete maturity. Parents are to bring up their children to love and obey the Lord. By their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving disciplinarian, ever tender and caring, who wants them to become members of His body, the family of God. Increasing family closeness is one of the earmarks of the final gospel message.
