	79808 : ["Sadly no, many women (and men) who call themselves Feminists have not done any research at all it seems. This applies equally to people I know in real life and to those who answer on this site. Note I say MANY not ALL. Some Feminists have obviously a clear understanding of the issues.  In my opinion .... If you support Feminism  you should understand why you do so. You should also have an understanding of the history of the Feminist movement. You should also live in accordance with those beliefs.  If all three statements above do not apply to you then you should not call yourself a Feminist.   Conversely some Feminists support human rights and equality and, in my view, wrongly label themselves as Feminists. I believe society would be better served if we scrapped the Feminist label in developed countries altogether.", 8994, "None", 2],
	79809 : ["I used to support feminism until I looked at the feminist 'research'. It was so blatantly biased (e.g. the inflation of statistics on rape by expanding the definition of rape to a ridiculous degree) that I had to do a lot of rethinking on the subject: \"[t]oday's definition of date or acquaintance rape stretches beyond acts of violence or physical force. According to common definitions of date rape, even verbal coercion or manipulation constitutes rape” (Roiphe, 1993, pp. 66–67) and “with such a sweeping definition of rape, I wonder how many people there are, male or female, who haven't been date-raped at one point or another. People pressure and manipulate and cajole each other into all sorts of things all the time” (Roiphe, 1993, p. 79).  I think it is pretty sick that some feminists will hijack a serious issue like rape just to score political points, not least because it undermines the validity of claims by women who are actually raped.", 8994, "None", 5],
