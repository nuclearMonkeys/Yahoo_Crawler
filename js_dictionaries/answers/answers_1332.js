	72194 : ["According to the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, about the year 33 C.E., the structure of the Church was set up by Jesus Christ before His Ascension and then the early Christian Church was born on Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and disciples. This same Church has referred to itself as the “Catholic Church” at least since 107 C.E. (about 10 years after the last book of the New Testament was written), when the Greek term \"Katholikos\" (meaning universal) appears in the Letter of St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Smyrnaeans:  \"Wherever the bishop appear, there let the multitude be; even as wherever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church.\" We do not know how long they had been using the term \"Catholic\" before it was included in this rare surviving letter. All of this was long before the Council of Nicea and the Nicene Creed from 325 C.E. which states, \"We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.\" With love in Christ.", 8667, "AA11440601", 5],

These devices are based on the false notion that disease-causing agents and diseased tissues emit radio-like frequencies that can be detected and cured by matching their frequencies   Royal Raymond Rife believed that that cancer was caused by bacteria (it isn't). During the 1920s, he claimed to have developed a powerful microscope that could detect living microbes by the colour of auras emitted by their vibratory rates.  His Rife Frequency Generator supposedly generated radio waves with precisely the same frequency, causing the offending bacteria to shatter in the same manner as a crystal glass breaks in response to the voice of an opera singer.   He sincerely believed in it, but it's nonsense. Unfortunately wherever there's cancer there's a greedy charlatan willing to part desperate and vulnerable people from their cash in exchange for ineffective quack treatments, and the Rife machine is now one such scam Some further reading for you:  ", 8671, "FicyC2TXaa", 2],

	72198 : ["My list mostly mirrors yours. 1. Answer character limits. A character limit is fine. The fact that we have no way to assess what the limit is while writing an answer, using the functionality of the website, is not fine. A simple way to expand the character limit functionality might be to increase the limits for better established users, either determined via user level, best answer percentage, or some combination. 2. Private message functionality. Lacks basic features that make it even remotely useful. There's a character limit, which is fine, but which is pointless because when someone exceeds the limit they just send an additional message. 3. Privacy setting functionality. The privacy settings are good of course, but lack features when referencing what you want to show/hide and who from. For example, there's no way to hide your questions from your contacts (I imagine some people might want to do this, as this is what necessitates the unofficial Y!A policy of allowing a second account for the purpose of asking more anonymous questions) but allow them to see your answers, as an example. There's also no way to show everything to your mutual contacts, show your answers with fans, but hide your questions from fans (or vice versa). 4. The \"Clippy\" clone. I mean, the wonderful popup to the side of the answer box, that almost invariably tells me that I've used too much punctuation. Even if I stray into the Mathematics section, using math symbols alerts me that perhaps I should use less punctuation. It's extremely annoying. I'm sure this might be helpful to some users, especially those who are still using ancient browsers that don't integrate some kind of spell check natively, but it probably would just be easier to make it a setting that's by default enabled and that users can disable, or at least disable once reaching a certain level.  5. The \"Clippy\" clone and resizing the answer box. Since I inevitably resize the answer box almost every time, I've noticed that the position of the \"helpful\" popup isn't offset by the box size. It's fixed. Causing it to pop up over what I'm writing, and making it much more annoying. 6. The points and levels system. It needs a redesign. There's no functional difference between levels 4 through 7, aside from increased ability to vote (at least from 4 to 5 and 5 to 6, but not from 6 to 7), but what percentage of the user base votes more than 200 times per day? How many vote more than 25 times per day (the limit for level 1 users)? There's very little incentive to vote on questions, and that's a problem (both in unresolved questions, which are annoying for users and which don't generate revenue for Yahoo!), and that could be easily increased by a point/level system redesign. 7. The reporting system could be improved all around. The appeals process is poor, the system is easily abused by malcontents, and reports generate almost no useful feedback to the reported user (could easily reduce the number of appeals, streamline appeals, and inform users of things they weren't aware of) and none to the reporting user (some people might misuse the system with good intentions, and have no idea about doing so). If the issue is the time-intensiveness of human review, it'd presumably be fairly easy to insert a classifier (trained from data presumably collected regarding reports) into the process either before or as a substitute for human review. The search functionality you mention would also be nice, but I suspect that part of the reason the ability to search by a particular user isn't implemented because of the potential for abuse.", 8668, "VbXWXC2Jaa", 8],

	72202 : ["No, it doesn't. Republicans SAY that Liberals call them stupid and racist white people, but Liberals don't actually do that.  No one ever said disagreeing with a liberal made one a bigot, but assuming that Obama only won because of black people and \"white guilt\" does make one a bigot.  Not every Republican does that, but the ones who do are rightfully called bigots. No one rants about Capitalism.  Mostly because we have not had pure Capitalism since the early 1800's.  Liberals only remind Republicans of that fact, and by extension remind Republicans just how much Socialism they take advantage of at the same time they are attacking it.  You know, Socialist ideas like vacation time, sick leave, a 40 hour workweek and overtime pay when asked to work more, holidays off and holiday pay when asked to work more, insurance through your workplace (dental, medical, vision), the police department, the fire department, the road system, workman's compensation when you get hurt doing something your boss told you to do without providing you adequate safety measures, being allowed to stay home to take care of a sick family member (like your child), maternity leave, and the military (which is the most Socialist thing in this country).  Capitalism, PURE Capitalism, sucks--just ask Mexico.  The Liberals are simply trying to remind Republicans that what has worked best is the Capitalist/Socialist mix we have had for centuries now. The problem is not that Republicans watch Fox News, but the fact that they insist it is news.  No one, not even the people on MSNBC, ever once called MSNBC news.   I believe that it would be hypocritical to attack Democrats for blaming Bush for things they did, if you will not attack Republicans for blaming Obama for things they did.  Like the economy.  Obama has drastically CUT spending, yet Republicans have lied about the deficits to suggest otherwise.  The job loss rate was 450% MORE under Bush than it is currently under Obama, but Republicans blame Obama for the 10.2 unemployment level. Obama has made mistakes, specifically not standing up for the truth about the fact that BUSH DID THIS.  But since he wants bipartisanship, he continues to make that mistake.  And rather than help Obama help them, Republicans seem to rather want to take his efforts at reconciliation as weakness and attack. Republicans can have all the protests they want.  I don't have a problem with them protesting, it would just be nice if they protested something that actually existed, instead of the \"Dachau healthcare\" signs and whatnot.  Obama has not taken their rights to guns away, and in fact has expanded them.  Obama has not taken their healthcare choices away, in fact he is trying to give it to them.  Obama has not taken their money away, in fact he has CUT taxes.  Obama is not spending like crazy, in fact he has cut the deficit in half.  It is just Republican lies that make it to where no one can see it. We didn't come up with the term \"Republican.\"  In fact, Republicans insist that it was Abraham Lincoln who came up with it.  And it is not derogatory; or it shouldn't be anyway, though Republicans seem intent on making it so.  And the Tea Partiers were the ones who started the Tea Bagger thing; that is what they called themselves when they first started.  We didn't start that mess. And it is actually Republicans making up the numbers on the public option.  In EVERY POLL done, whenever asked if they want the public option or not, the poll numbers have consistently shown AT LEAST 55% approval, usually more.  It is currently at 67%.  And it has been above 50% ever since Teddy Roosevelt first suggested the idea of a public option; it has NEVER fallen below 50%. And no one denied Obama's drop in the polls.  But Republicans have been making up how big that drop is, as well as their own numbers.  In fact, Republicans have just gotten back up to 30% approval.  It had been lower.  In fact, over the summer one poll had Republican approval ratings in the high teens, and no poll had them over 28%. As far as Palin, she is no idiot.  She needs work, but she has strong potential.  But if she is willing to do the work necessary, she could be a great candidate.  I'll absolutely agree that Obama is no Communist, and that Republicans should stop saying that one.  Again, neither Fox News nor MSNBC are legitimate news sources.  As opinion shows, they are fine; but NEITHER is news. In other words, your summary is wrong.  Neither side acts idiotic, but both sides should check their facts a little better before going on here with something Glenn Beck or Keith Olbermann said.  Nevertheless, your perceptions are not exactly correct, either. _________________ You do know that Janeane Garafolo doesn't actually speak for the Democrat party, right?  She speaks for herself. Saying \"breaking news\" is not claiming to be a news source.  It is simply saying that there is something coming from news stations on the fly right now, and they wish to discuss their OPINIONS about it. Because of the length of the proof, I cannot write here how Obama cut spending.  But click the link, and go down to my answer (under Shh Little Beck) and read the proof. Perhaps you should re-read your own question, you most certainly did say \"Republican,\" not \"Rethuglican.\"  Now that you have corrected yourself, I can properly respond.  And my response is, \"who cares.\"  It's a stupid attack, but no worse than \"Democrap\" or \"Libtard.\"  Let the losers fight it out with those attacks, and if you have a problem with it then just focus on the discussions of the adults.", 8669, "E9XL5x3Paa", 0],

	72209 : ["Danny; The fact that I am the first answer in four hours implies that, yes, you did get a might wordy.  Is this because you seem passionate about this?  More to your credit.  I will do my best to answer that which I can. Jesus appointed Peter when he gave him \"the keys to the kingdom.\"  This is the action of a King to his prime minister.  Perhaps you have seen the old science fantasy movie \"Krull\"(it will be on ENCFA 21May).  At the end of the movie, he tosses a set of keys for his friend to unlock a set of manacles.  When he tries to give them back, the prince says to keep them.  The former thief questions that these keys can only belong to the King and his prime minister, the man who is in charge when the king is away.  The Prince nods his head and replies \"I know\".  By giving Peter the 'keys', Jesus was leaving him in charge.  This is further exemplified when Peter was the leader at the council of Jerusalem with Paul speaking for the Gentiles.  Pope is just a Latin nickname for Bishop or Father, he is the Bishop of Rome. The Church was not established by Constantine.  He simply legalized Christianity. I have a question.  Why are you using the old Hebrew name YHWH, but you spell out Yeshua.  Old Hebrew, as I am sure you know, had no vowels.  That means that Yeshua didn't either.  Vowels were not added to the language until the middle ages (about 800 AD) Christians meet on the first day of the week, because that is the day he rose, because you are not supposed to travel on the Sabbath, Early Christians would meet, read the scripture, and share the meal in memory of him.  He said \"Do this in memory of me .\"  So, we do this in memory of his Life, Death, and Resurrection. I do not expect you to listen to me.  I can hear the hatred in your words.  If someone has read this far, they are at least open minded enough to think and pray on this.  Still, you will be in my prayers.

	72221 : ["\"why do cathlics think that jesus founded the catholic and appointed peter as a pope?\" Because He did. The Bible records this and it is testified to by the ante Nicene Fathers. Certainly in Matthew 16 Jesus is referring to the prophecy of Isaiah in Isaiah 22 and in doing so He is fulfilling the prophetic imagery prophesied by the prophet Isaiah. The prime minister referred to by Isaiah is a type for the appointment of St. Peter to be the leader, steward and authority over His family or household. It further emphasizes by Christ's actions in His appointment that He, Jesus, having received the throne of David by virtue of His Father is asserting His claim to the throne of David and as the rightful successor as king of all of Judah and Israel. He fulfills this by asserting the legal precedent necessary to fulfill prophecy and appoints St. Peter as the steward over His kingdom. He is claiming by this action what He came to do which was to establish a new and enduring Covenant with His Kingdom. But was this Kingdom fully established at this time or was it just a stepping stone to the establishing of His Kingdom in His appointment of St. Peter in Matthew 16? Certainly, the time had not yet come for the Prime Minister, St. Peter, to exercise the power of the keys for Christ had not yet revealed His glory or made claim to His kingdom with the establishment of the New Covenant. This would not happen until Calvary where Jesus would from the cross drink of the cup of consummation from the hyssop branch and then utter the words, “it is finished” after which He gave up His Spirit and His glory was revealed. He would finish His redemptive work three days later when He raised from the dead. Only then was all prophecy fulfilled and the law satisfied. St. Peter was now endowed with the Authority of Christ to be the royal steward over Christ's kingdom. So great was this authority that He had the authority to bind or loose on earth as well as in heaven and became the spiritual father of Christ's family. The keys represent the supremacy of the power bestowed on St. Peter and he is fastened on a peg and carries the weight of maintaining the King's (Christ's) house. So great are the parallels between Eliakim and St. Peter that it is implausible to deny that Eliakim is a type for St. Peter. The new kingdom is not a kingdom of land and of a people but it is the establishment of a spiritual kingdom of God and not of men. Keeping with the typology the office of Eliakim was an enduring office and so too is the office that St. Peter to which he has been appointed. Only the prime minister holds the keys of supreme authority and not only the first among equals but the special and singular authority among the disciples and visible head of the Church. Let us look directly at the parallels between Isaiah 22 and Matthew 16. The prime minister in David's household had successors: Isa 22:15, 1 Kings 4:6, & 18:3, 2 Kings 10:5, 15:5, 18:18 We see the full authority given to the prime minister: Isa 22:22, Mat 16:19, Rev 3:7 Further teaching of the authority of the prime minister: Mat 24:45, Luk 12:42, Gen 41:40, Gen 43:19 God bless!

	72232 : ["I work in the utilities industry, and those figures seem ridiculously high - average UK household uses around 3500 kWh a year. You can make a complaint to British Gas to dispute the meter readings and report that you believe the consumption is too high. The charge they are claiming is to send out a Meter Operator (MOp), but if you claim there is a problem with the meter this charge should be waivered. However, the only issue is that if the MOp finds a problem with the meter - for example, that it has been tampered with - they will inform the Supplier who will request the Revenue Protection Services (RPS) take a visit. If the RPS find a fault with the meter, the owner of the meter will be liable. That, in theory, will be your landlord. However, I don't think he'll be too pleased and will probably try to pass on the charges to you. There is no way to determine the electricity usage for each wire unless an additional \"Check Meter\" is fitted for each wire. Currently, that meter records all electricity consumption at that metering point, and this includes all the wires coming off of it. The wire in the photo looks like an aerial cable (??) and I have no idea why it is attached to the meter. However, I'm no expert on the technical specifications of the meter so I can't really comment. You should definitely ask for the meter to be secured so as nobody outside of your flat can tamper with it.", 8670, "nFGgxjJxaa", 0],

	72236 : ["Your asking a question about history.  Therefore the only way we could ascertain the answer to your question is to look at historical facts. 1.  Jesus established a church and he prophesied to Peter (means rock) that it would never be destroyed by Hades. (Mt 16:18-19; 18:17-18) 2.  This church was led by the Apostles appointed by Jesus and guided by the Holy Spirit (see scripture if you don't believe me).   3.  These Apostles and their companions also wrote the NT books (see authors of the NT). 4.  It was the Catholic Church who compiled these books into a canon at the council of Rome in AD 382 (long after Constantine was dead).  This decision was ratified and the canon left unchanged in the councils of Hippo (393), Carthage (397, 419), II Nicea (787), Florence (1442), and Trent (1546).   5.  The term 'Catholic Church' was being used to describe the entire Christian church as early as AD 107 by St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, who said 'wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.\"  This term gets used also by other Bishops and church fathers to describe the entire church in the 2nd - 4th centuries prior to Constantine.  This illustrates that it was the Catholic Church who was actually using the scriptures from above point 3 prior to Constantine. 6.  The historical evidence from these early Christians prior to Constantine is that they believed that the Eucharist was truly the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ.  See St. Justin Martyr and St. Ignatius.  (ie.   ) 7.  The evidence from the early Church Fathers (and scripture) is that the Apostles appointed successors to act as bishops of the church.  And that these bishops appointed successors.  And that this mark of Apostolic succession was used by the early Church to identify the true Church. (see for instance St. Clement, bishop of Rome's letter to the Corinthians written around AD 80 where he describes how the Apostles went around appointing bishops to succeed them.  As well as St. Ignatius' (Bishop of now France) writing called 'Against Heresies' in the 2nd century, where he describes the succession of bishops of Rome to his time and how every church should be in agreement with her because she was founded by St. Peter and St. Paul). 8.  The Catholic Church has Apostolic Succession to St. Peter. (see   ) Therefore, if Jesus is correct that the gates of Hades would not prevail against his Church then the church that Jesus started with St. Peter is still the same church today that has Apostolic Succession to St. Peter.  It is the only church that has a clear historical connection to Peter and thus Jesus' promise. I don't see how you can refute these historical facts and their logical conclusions.  There are many, many more historical facts that lead to the fact that the Catholic Church is the original church.  In fact there is so much evidence that most historical Protestant scholars will agree that the Catholic Church is the original church.  (And BTW for my Orthodox friends who like to remind me, the Orthodox Church was also part of this one Catholic Church as the split did not occur until much later).
