	57333 : ["This is an interesting question that could be interpreted several ways. Yes non-human life can be concious, but I don't think that's what you're asking.  I think the door opens from both sides. Our conciousness is largely a product of sensory input from the world around us. Yet we impose our conciousness on the world around us. But that may not be what you're asking either. You're probably wondering about things like remote viewing, astral projection, souls and apparitions. And I'm inclined to think you know more about these things than I do. But I would say yes, sometimes conciousness in some form does exist outside the human body. And I'm not always happy about it.", 7962, "CD1T7gaXaa", 3],

	57335 : ["Actually the British walked away with a victory having made it to the capital and burned it. American militia had hardly proven to be more than a roadblock to the British army on its way to DC. That did a lot for reinforcing American's realization that we needed a large enough professional federal army to defend itself after being let down by poorly performing militias. This argument was still going on whether we needed a permanent federal army or if we could rely entirely on militias for our defense, something many people had wanted. The Brits never had the intention of reoccupying the states so they left after their punitive expedition was completed. They achieved their goals including preserving Canada as a separate (from the US) Provence. The real show was in Europe where the continent and Britain were preoccupied with Napoleon.", 7947, "BrWnVTnnaa", -3],
