I have always believed in ever good man's life, there's a good woman. Be it his mother, sister, wife, secretary, president or vice president. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as a team would make a triumphant match and a force to be recon with. As a woman I know most men try to look at all sides of a problem however very few can. In my opinion Obama doesn't have a good understand of what the average middle and poor class communities needs. I know and have benefited from what a Clinton will do for the average man or woman; I just don't get a good feeling on Osama's insight of the average Joe or Joann. In politics He would be wonderful because he sees the bigger picture of what's good for all. However for the small man or women my bet would be on Hillary. Yes, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama together, would be awesome!", 9182, "XXqs44LZaa", 0],

	85089 : ["Hi There, Install a good anti virus... choose most suitable for your computer from the following .... One more thing... you can take advantage of a variety of decent free programs given below.... * Grisoft's AVG 8.0. AVG has a long history, and has been through loads of modifications to provide a better service on its way to the current version, AVG 8.0. The company makes its money by selling virus protection to small businesses, and offers free home-user versions as a means of promoting its professional service. It's protection is reasonably thorough, though it doesn't offer any real tech support. It's quite unintrusive, doesn't use too many resources, and it will regularly auto-update. * Alwil Softaware's Avast! 4. Alwil software's Avast! 4 is free for non-commercial users and offers regular updates, as well as proper technical support via e-mail or phone. Protection-wise it's very similar to AVG, covering all the same bases and not hogging system resources, but it has a funkier interface (for those who like a pinch of fashion with their computer security). The only downside is that you have to re-register it after each year of use. * AntiVir. AntiVir by Alvira actually offers better standard virus detection than both of the above, but lacks in other areas. It won't scan your emails before you open them, uses more resources (less of a problem if you've a more powerful PC), and maintains a perhaps-too-visible presence on your desktop. You'll also have to occasionally re-register it to keep it going. Whichever of these you choose, there's one important warning... Hackers develop new bugs constantly. All these free anti-virus services offer regular updates, if you don't download them, you're not protected. Yet it's not just about how up to date your software is. If you're not using it, what's the point. Try to fit in a full 'on-demand' scan (that is, one where the virus scanner flicks through all the files on your hard drive) once a week. This should make sure nothing slips through the net. Free online virus scanners for further protection Whilst they shouldn't replace proper software, online scanners provide a secondary scan and can sometimes be more up to date. So if you're worried your software isn't working well enough, or want a second opinion, these are worth a regular play with. * Trendmicro's Housecall 6.6. Updated daily, Housecall 6.6 will rummage through your whole machine, identifying infections as it goes. As a bonus, it'll also look for other vulnerabilities in your machine, and in many cases fix those it finds. Feedback's generally excellent for the service, though be aware it might pique the interest of your firewall since it runs using ActiveX or Java (you choose which). * Panda Security's Activescan 2.0. In a bid to sell you its paid-for security programmes, Panda Security also offers a free online scan, which will be better for some as it can be customised to only scan certain sections of your hard drive. A note for those with new PCs Often companies throw in free anti-virus programs hoping you'll subscribe to them out of convenience once the free trial ends. By all means take advantage of the free offer, but then ditch and switch to a free version when it expires. Make sure you uninstall the trial too; it may interfere with the new virus scanner, and even if not it'll certainly slow down your PC. Note for Norton users only: It can be a bit of a pain to get rid of all Norton AntiVirus's components from your machine. If you're having trouble doing so, try Symantec's own Norton Removal Tool, which is designed to solve this very problem. All the best, Thanks, Ava", 9186, "JGImQK5gaa", 2],

He attended a racist church for 20 years. 4. He called the pastor of that racist church, renowned racist Jeremiah Wright, friend and mentor; allowed him to perform his marriage ceremony and Baptize his kids. He only quit the church recently due to the media fallout, but Michelle and the kids still attend. If he truly disagreed with Wright, he should have quit years ago like Oprah did. 5. He is a follower of Black Liberation Theology which calls for reparations from Whites to Blacks and basically calls for racial separatism. 6. His annual budget proposal is about $220 BILLION MORE PER YEAR THAN WHAT BUSH SPENDS. There's simply no way to spend that kind of money, cut taxes for the majority of Americans and NOT go bankrupt. 7. Even if he does manage some small tax cuts for a small ... portion of Americans he will make good on his promise to significantly raise taxes on business and capital gains. The business tax increases will cause: a) many businesses to fail (unemployment goes up) b) some businesses to move overseas (more unemployment) c) all remaining businesses will raise their prices to consumers (ie: less money in your pocket). Just as an aside, contrary to popular liberal myths, taxes on the wealthy were higher under Bush than under Clinton, and taxes for the middle class are lower under Bush than they were under Clinton. His voting record – 130 present votes and 6 ‘wrong' votes in the IL State Senate. His lack of moral courage and skipping out on or capitulating on important votes in the U.S. Senate. FISA chief among them. • His daily playing of the race card to advantage himself. • His 20 years of nefarious, crooked, and divisive business and personal associations with Rezko, Wright, Ayers, Auchi, Khalidi, Al Mansour, Pritzker, Jarrett, Pfleger, Meeks and more. • His major policy reversals on critical issues, i.e., FISA, Israel, don't ask don't tell, public financing, NAFTA, Iraq, women's rights, gun control; touting Bush's faith based initiatives, and wanting to keep Blackwater going. • His desire to spread the wealth around with economic policies that do not work. It's like asking Michael Phelps to give up some of his gold medals to those who don't swim, just because they'll never have one! • His illegal activities to win the primary, including ... over 2,000 documented instances of caucus fraud and blocking re-votes in MI and FL. • His receiving huge contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the organizations at the center of our current economic mess. • His lack of any governing, or executive experience and his lack of knowledge on critical issues of domestic and foreign policy – as he has demonstrated repeatedly on the campaign trail. Russia's recent aggression on Georgia comes to mind. • The fact that you can never get a straight answer from him on any of his policies or associations – just more double talk and distraction.
