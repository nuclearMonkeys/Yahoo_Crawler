Many women are suffering in this world because of the reason that men take unfair usage of their powers.... So somewhere when I see men working under women, it feels good that men respect and obey a woman...  Other than that, women are more creative and innovative than men and can work much more harder and fairly than men. They can fulfill more than one responsibility at a time.  They have great working skills. They stay calm and can take better decisions. Edit: In my first reason, I'm basically talking about countries like Pakistan and India. Secondly, The truth is that women are more innovative. She can perform multi tasks. A women can take care of her house as well as work but men can't do both these work at the same time.  Thirdly, women prefer men as their boss because most of them get their integrity hurt by working under other women the same way like most men would not work under a women in Pakistan/India because they would think that women don't deserve to be their boss. Hope you understood....Any other questions? Edit: If you look around, you will notice that women stay more calm than men.  Example: When a husband and wife have a fight, most of the times it would be the wife who would stop arguing, even if it was the husband's mistake, to let the matter go. Also, whom do you find more calm? Mothers or Fathers? Sometime ago, I read that most men would have more mood swing problems and frustration than women Women try to look at things from the positive angle. They don't hurry in taking decisions. They have more patience than men. Any other questions? Have a nice day! :)", 8147, "kTxeGj1aaa", 7],
