	131373 : ["medication is helpful, but there are 2 forms of therapy which have been shown to help decrease depression in people. 1.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - The therapist will help you explore your thoughts and feelings and how they are connected to depressive thoughts and mood.  You can work on changing these thoughts through talking to the therapist, practice, and homework.  It is a very practical way of dealing with depression. 2. Interpersonal Therapy - The therapist helps you choose an interpersonal problem area (grief/loss, interpersonal deficit, conflict, or change in role) that is related to depression.  By working through this problem with the therapist, you will feel less depressed. There is also an exciting new treatment called Mindfullnes Based  Cognitive Therapy, which is a group format where people are trained to deal with negative thoughts in a positive manner.  I am not giving MBCT justice through my explanation, but it is a wonderful treatment program, designed specifically to deal with the chronic nature of depression and to help prevent relapse.  Research has shown that people who are trained in Mindfullness are less likely to experience a relapse of a depressive episode.  You may have to deal with low grade depression for the rest of your life, but I think Mindfulness is a good way to decrease the chance the depression kicks in hard again.  In addition, mindfullness can help you cope better with negative thoughts, relax, and experience more feelings of well-being and contenetment!", 11099, "dbd36cb3f29064eb9d7d3bac8447b938aa", 0],
