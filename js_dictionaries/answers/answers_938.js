	52265 : ["1) Easter celebrates the day of Christ's bodily resurrection while also celebrating the liberation of the pagans from their enslavement to 'Eostre' the demon masquerading as a fertility goddess and which used the rites of spring, (the same power used to resurrect Christ), to deceive and exploit them for many centuries previously. We can now honor GOD as we watch spring burst forth from the death of winter without defaming Him; 2) Only the Cadbury bunny lays eggs and his are chocolate. Rabbits symbolized evil to Christians who recognized that they were cute, cuddly and docile up close but bred out of control and destroyed their gardens and entire agricultural areas if they were 'tolerated.'  Originally, there was a great Easter 'rabbit hunt' (including the children), which occurred at the start of spring when their populations would explode. The kids would trade in the real rabbits their family caught for chocolate or candy equivalent to encourage families to catch as many as possible. Rabbit was served for Easter dinner. This helped to control their populations while teaching the lesson that evil isn't what it appears to be, (2 Corinthians 11:14); 3) Eggs are just symbols of fertility and new life and fish are symbols of miraculous abundance. Jesus mentions them both among the 'good gifts' we give to our children, (Luke 11:12, Matthew 7:10), which is why the Church uses them in the Easter celebration. The eggs were given bright colors to make them easier to locate during egg hunts and games; The practice of eating only fish for Lent, (not Easter Sunday itself), was designed for two reasons. One was to help fishermen who were often neglected when people had ready access to red meat. Two, it was to help the poor, since people were encouraged to eat only fish every Friday, (especially on Good Friday when even the lapsed Christians would come back to services), then use the portion of red meat they would have eaten to feed a poor person. This way the poor got red meat once a week no matter what and especially on Easter.", 7315, "fp8i8udTaa", 0],

	52299 : ["It isn't so much about being \"wrong\" - it is about how it just won't always work.  They process things differently and just being told \"no - you can't have that\" results in a melt-down because they can't process their emotions to handle not getting what they want. There are various distraction techniques to try to deal with these issues and some autistic children are more severe than others with respect to how badly their melt-downs will be if they don't have what they want.  This parent should be working with her child and a therapist for methods on how to deal with disappointments and how to deal with it when she does need to stop him from doing something.  Never saying \"no\" to anything is not a realistic option.  Personally, I think she needs to find a better therapist to work with her and her child.  (and if she is not in therapy with her child - that needs to happen - parents need to learn how to deal with their child's autism - it isn't just about sending the child for help) Just to put things into perspective.  Imagine the worst emotion you have ever experienced.  Maybe it was extreme anger or maybe it was extreme disappointment or sorrow.  Now - imagine being stuck in that emotion and you can't calm yourself at all.  You are completely stuck in that worst moment because you don't know how to deal with emotions.  This is part of what some autistic children go through.  They often get stuck in an extreme emotion and can't deal with it.  And just trying \"discipline\" also doesn't work.  Then they are stuck between two extreme emotions.  The parent needs to learn how to calm their autistic child without always just giving in.  The methods for discipline that work on other children usually won't work on most autistic children. Not every form of autism causes these kinds of issues.  There are many levels to autism and many types of autism.  Some children have such mild autism that it is barely noticeable while other children have extreme cases and it can be hard to manage.", 7337, "None", 1],
