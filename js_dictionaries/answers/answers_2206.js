	116088 : ["You want the truth? You can't handle the truth! (sorry Jack, i had to do it) A big part of it boils down the the sad state of the music industry today. Not one wants to pay for music anymore, so the music companies are afraid to go out and \"grow\" or nurture new talent. \" i wanna get sum new sungs, and i wanna get em 4 free  NOW !!!!\" They know it takes awhile to let a new band with talent, but not much experience, develope. And they aren't willing to take the risk, spend the money developing them, when the rewards aren't there anymore. We want the companies to go search out new talent. Sign up all the hot new groups. Everyone wants to be sponsored, before they prove they can draw people, sell records. But we complain when they make money doing it? Sure there are some Maddonas out there making too much, but that is the very SMALL minority. (We can't judge the whole music world, by a few overpaid celebrities.) So the companies have withdrawn. They are looking for proven sellers, because the market is shrinking. Are CD's too high? I agree, $10 would be a better price. So I don't buy CD's that are too high. But the simple fact is that everyone that steals music is helping kill music. Then it's ironic, when \"we\" complain that we don't like the new stuff coming/not coming out?", 10450, "UAHjJpC0aa", 5],
	116089 : ["I don't think it's always for the money. I think many just have no originality. The bands usually 'know people' and then they get into the business and just hope they make it. Look at Metro Station, did you see how they formed their band? They were together on a Hannah Montana show, and saw they both played instruments and decided to make a band, BUT it was never in their mind before, I bet, to have a band, they just went out on a whim. Look at how popular they are now. It's not like they were trying for years and years to get popular, all they do is get these 2 crappy guitarists and make some stupid songs about having sex. They sound the same as the other bands in the music industry because it ended up that way, they probably aren't taking it as serious as they ought to because they don't care.' I looked at the music Miley Cyrus listens to, lol, and she listens to all those bands and the band Boys Like Girls....so you see her influences. She sounds the same as those bands, they all take after eachother.", 10450, "keoqsK5Laa", 4],

Enough details are already there in this yahoo answer   yet I will add some more mahathmiyam Thiru Allikeni is one of the most important among 108 divyadesams and famous for thiruvaradanam and utsavams that are conducted as per kramam without fail. The prabhanda goshti is very huge and is a bhagyam to get sevai of the ghosti during the veedhi purapadu of Brahmotsvams. There are two Brahmotsavam conducted with precise timings one for Parthasarathy swami and another for Thelliya Singar (Narasimhar). The dwaja sthambams are seperate on either side ie Eastern entrance and Western entrance. This is unique to Thiruvallikeni only.

	116107 : ["Because there's very little originality nowadays. I personally love pop, and I get sick and tired of all the bashing I see here on R&P. I've said it before, I'll say it again - people who think all pop is talentless and worthless are just as ignorant as those who think all metal is about using drugs and worshipping the devil. Eh, don't judge an entire genre on the mainstream stuff, because it usually sucks (here, anyway). Plain White T's = GROSS. I LOATHE that Delilah song! I hate it! It was played ALL the time on the radios when it first came out. And I tried to listen to that Cute blahblahblah band, but it just disgusted me. Now, I dunno - maybe some people really love those bands. It's just not for me. I'm sure someone who had never listened to Wintersun or the like would say all your fav bands sound the same, simply because of the vocals. *seems to be digging herself a deeper hole* That's not to say that all of the mainstream pop is bad ..... I personally love Madonna's older stuff, and Dido, and Sarah McLachlan, etc. Anyway, to close things up, I couldn't imagine listening only to rock day after day. Yes, there are a bazillion other genres, but pop is too fun and dance/singable for me to give up.", 10450, "pLPKo6mBaa", 2],
	116108 : ["Honestly I don't personally think that they sound all that much alike. I'm a fan of all of the above, and they each have a style that differs in one way or another.

	116110 : ["Not a lot, actually. Many people have contracted religion which, as you know is incurable and they do build offerings to their god.

	116111 : ["My best friend in college had a Mormon wedding. I was a bridesmaid, but I could not go to the wedding. In fact, only married Mormons can go. They can't have a temple wedding unless she converts. She needs to end the relationship, because the longer she waits, the more painful it will be, since she doesn't want to convert. (A good idea, the church promotes hatred and women are second class in the church. - This is not stereotypes, this is fact based on Mormon teaching.)  She needs to find someone in a faith that is willing to accept her faith. Is she willing to NOT be married in the Catholic church? When my Catholic sister married an atheist, three days before the wedding the priest suddenly decided that he couldn't marry them if they didn't agree to raise the kids Catholic.", 10455, "FSkttJxNaa", -4],
	116112 : ["A wedding in a Mormon Temple is similar in many ways to weddings in other Religions. However in order to be married in a Temple you must be a WORTHY member of their church and all in attendance must also be WORTHY members.  I have a good friend who was married and was not able to have his father there in the temple at the time because he had had an affair shortly before and so was found unworthy to enter the Temple.  The specifics of the wedding and what is said in it's entirety is not fully disclosed outside of the Temple but what is told and sets those weddings apart from ceremonies held outside is mostly the verbiage. Like most religions the Bride and Groom kneel at an alter and exchange vows. The vows are similar to many other religion's vows (ex: \"to love and to cherish . . . in sickness and health\", etc), but the one big difference is that unlike other religions that state that the vows last \"til death do you part\", the vows in the Mormon Temple are considered to last forever, in this life and on to the next.   This is what members of the LDS Church (Mormon) feel sets the ceremony in their Temple apart from other ceremonies. In all honesty the fact that he wants to marry her in his religions Temple shows that he wants to be with her forever and should be taken as a compliment.  That is all the specifics on the Temple wedding that I have heard, read, and learned about.", 10455, "ct4T6QEMaa", -1],

	116114 : ["Maple, being a dense hardwood, is a good choice.  For a sink I would use a \"farmhouse\" style apron front sink that has a integral vitreous china front that extends parallel with the front of the counter top.  For one thing, it suits the rustic style of butcher block counters and it eliminates the maintenance problem of having water seepage that you might have around the edges, back and front of the sink if you use a drop-in model.  Some of these are quite costly but IKEA makes an economically priced unit in both single bowl and double bowl versions.  I have the single bowl and am very happy with it (see link). The two-bowl version is around $300.  I installed the IKEA Elverdam high rise faucet with pull-out -- again, very happy with the product (it works better than an expensive Delta faucet I had in my last house.)   I only had to cut the counters flush on each side and then silicone caulk them along the edge where they met the china sink.", 10453, "92a52b22ba85afb653e97e30ca2bf316aa", -1],
	116115 : ["I have had oak butcher block counter tops for 22 years and I never regretted it once.  Every five years or so, I sand down the counter tops and apply a couple fresh coats of Salad Bowl finish.  Salad Bowl finish is not an oil, it goes on like and it reminds me of and may very well be, a urethane. I do not use my counters as a cutting board but every now and then someone invariably does, but the cuts are easily sanded away, without a trace. We all know that wood and water do not mix, so I would be weary about an under mounted sink with a butcher block counter top.  All of strips of wood are glued together and the end cuts will then be exposed at the left and right edges of the sink.  I would imagine that they could be susceptible to water damage and swell being so close to the water and all.  However, I do not have experience with an under mount sink on a butcher block counter top. Hmmm, On second thought, if you ran a wood strip of trim  to cover those end cuts, the glued together strip ends would not be exposed and therefore be protected from the water.  So, I suppose it could work if you really keep up with maintaining the finish.", 10453, "Gf9Vt3Iyaa", 0],
