When I got my cats here in Germany I removed all house plants as I wasn't sure which would be poisonous. I went to a really big garden centre and asked for advice on which plants I could safely display. They were absolutely no help whatsoever. Really strange as many plants would also be poisonous for children. So now I only have artificial plants in the rooms where the cats go.

You should be more worried about spider bites, snake bites, lightning, and other people. They all cause more death and injury than black bears. Chances are that you won't come face to face with a black bear because the bear will hear and smell you approaching and hide long before you would be aware of its presence. If you are lucky enough to come face to face with a black bear: Do NOT run. Running can trigger the chase response. Do NOT play dead. Black bears are scavengers. You are only encouraging it to approach you. Do NOT look away. Look directly at the bear's eyes. Within their own social structure, bears interpret looking away as a sign of submission. Stand your ground, make yourself look large, don't make any aggressive movements, and thank your lucky stars you were given the rare opportunity to get close to such a shy and magnificent animal. I recommend reading DeBruyn's \"Walking with Bears\" or Kilham's \"Among the Bears\" for a better understanding of these remarkable creatures.

If you are unlucky enough to run face to face into a black bear and it actually approaches you the best thing you can do is try and scare it off.  Bluff it, make yourself look big (if you have a jacket, hold it open).  Make loud noises and thrash at any bushes near you.  Look large and dangerous and noisy.  Black bears tend to be more shy and easily spooked than the larger brown bears.  Also, don't run unless you're a good distance away and have a safe place to get to immediately within reach.  Bears can run faster than humans and running away could invoke a bear to give chase.

	138516 : ["# Keep your distance. If you see a bear from a long distance (greater than 300 feet), leave the area. If you need to continue on, make a wide detour around the bear. If the bear has not seen you, do not disturb it: retreat calmly and quietly, and then make ample noise when you are well away to prevent future chance encounters. If the bear sees you, begin speaking in a low, calm voice (it doesn't matter what you say) and retreat slowly, keeping an eye on the bear but avoiding direct eye contact. Your goal is to communicate to the bear that you are human (i.e. that you can defend yourself and are not frightened) while also letting it know that you are non-threatening, and that you are leaving its territory. # Stand tall, even if the bear charges you. If the bear sees you and is closer than 300 feet, or if the bear is approaching you, remain calm and try to look as large as possible. Try to back away slowly—do not run—and speak softly. If the bear continues to approach as you back away, stop and stand your ground. Speak more loudly in a deep, calm voice, and wave you arms to make yourself look bigger. Keep an eye on the bear, but avoid direct eye contact. Do not be aggressive, but do not crouch down, play dead or otherwise show fear or vulnerability. If the bear charges you, muster all your courage and stay where you are: the charge is most likely a bluff, and if you stand your ground the bear will turn away Fight a black bear attack or any predatory attack. If the bear is a black bear, or if you have determined that the bear sees you as food (this is actually quite rare, and more common with black bears and, some say, polar bears than with grizzlies), your only chance of escape is to fight it or scare it away. Hit the bear with rocks, pots, pans, sticks or fists—anything handy, really.

I put it by the window in which he would spend more time looking at other cats and getting upset (he is allowed to go out but he does only to do his needs, he is afraid of other cats, dogs, human beings, anything in what is a new surrounding for him).  The diffuser has to be on all day and night without interruption and with nothing on top of it.  Other remedies are the Bach flowers. They have special formulas for pets without alcohol. And a calming natural drug called Zylkene. Other owners with the same problem had good results with both.   See here more info about Zylkene in this link:  I could not personally use them as my cat takes any attempt to give him something as another source of stress. The feliway diffuser suits him better for that reason. After ruling out allergies or dermatitis, I haven't brought him to the vet anymore, as that was another source of stress (well unfortunately I had to bring him for a cat abscess and that caused a relapse).  First thing to do is in fact to eliminate any source of stress. If I were you I would stop by using the collar as it must be very stressful for him. As someone told you, you should also control your reaction, I am sure this situation creates stress on you, but that means that you'll end up transmitting him that stress.  Last thing, there must have been a trigging episode. My vet has explained me that cats can hold lots of stress until there is a last trigging episode that make them explode. In my case was to bring him on holiday with us, after we had moved house not much before.

	138528 : ["First off, phone your vet and check that he's been checked for 1) Urinary tract problems and 2) Hyperactive thyroid.  Both of these can be linked to overgrooming. A mild allergy can be involved too, but finding what it is can be a needle in a haystack, especially as the cat may have got into the habit now.  You could try cereal free food for a while (warning: look at whether a food is 'complementary' or 'complete'.  If it's complementary it will not have all the nutrients needed and your cat should not be fed it alone for more than a short time)  If you are in the UK then 'Classic' is available in supermarkets and is a complete cereal free food.  You might also ban all dairy.  Label reading time... Next if he's still stressing when he sees other cats outside, you might want to consider making it so he can't see them.  This can be done by putting paper over the bottom part of window.  If this is not the case, you might want to consider building some kind of outdoor run so he can go out.  This would help with boredom. I agree boredom could be a major factor.  Things you can do... play with him.  Make him work for his ration of dry food: hide it around the house, in treat balls, in small boxes, paper bags, cardboard tubes. Pots of grass.  Water fountains. Big boxes to play in (put the food containers inside a big box if you like).  Make sure he has places to climb up high, places to lurk, places to scratch.  Apparently carpeting a wall works really well for some cats!  Get a cat dvd for him to watch. Think about if your stress is transferring to him.  Are you stressed yourself?  Do you react massively if he starts on his fur?  If so, ignore what he's doing, just keep some fishing rod toys handy around the place and distract him if he starts.

She's just had a vet check and is fine, but looks a lot different to a few years ago. My neighbour had a 19 year old cat, she was very much as you describe. Does she actually 'pull' it out?

She was given more attention (she'd never really been that interested in people, but when she couldn't play outside, we had to compensate), more love and we would go into the garden with her. Once she realised the other cat wasn't about, she'd settle down. But she would actually attack her own tail - it was very obviously a stress thing.

	138532 : ["I've posted this before, but I'm posting it again because I really hate seeing surveys and other ‘internet get rich quick schemes' being pushed as a way to make money at home: I may not have tried them all, but I've tried enough to tell you 99% of all the 'make money on the internet' deals are scams, especially the surveys (what a joke) and the ads you see for starting your own internet business on TV (checked them out too.  Nothing but a rip off designed to separate a fool from his money).  In all honesty, I've only found one thing that really works, and doesn't require a cash investment, and that's selling sex toys on line.  Whether you're morally opposed to this type of product or not, which it sounds like you may be based on what you said about a \"phone actress\" for adult themes going against your beliefs, the fact is sex sells.  It always has and always will.  I run two websites,   and   (adult's only site), and I'll tell you flat out, we've sold more sex toys with free websites in the last few months than everything else combined.  That's saying something considering we make a lot of sales in other categories.  You can get the free sites and just submit them to search engines, and you'll make some sales, or you can do like we've done and promote the free sites from your own site.  You should get about three to five times the traffic, and sales that way since you have more control over your content and SEO.  This isn't a get rich quick scheme, so don't think you're going to retire in three months with a six figure income.  I've crunched the numbers and I figure it will be two to three years before I can retire with a six figure income from the sex toy sales we're making.  The free websites don't require much work, but running your own site does, and any website takes time to get indexed on the search engines, especially if you don't use an SEO service or software.  If you want more information about the sex toy sites, visit the employment section at Buddy & Oscars.  If you want some information and tools to start your own website, visit the webmasters section at Buddy & Oscars.  I'll tell you up front that if you do want to start your own site, and you want help with your SEO, we only list a few SEO products, because they're the only ones we've found that work.  They're for real businesses, and they're not cheap, but they get your site ranked faster, and get it off of page 2,000 and into the top ten quicker than doing it yourself.  If you just want the free sites, you can go that route and never spend one penny.  You won't even have to spend more than a few hours to get them started and submitted to search engines, because they are managed and updated by the companies that run them.  If you like wasting your time with surveys, I'll pay you the same 25 cents you'll earn for the hours worth of work you'll do to build web pages for me, and you won't get the 100 or more spam emails a day you'll get from signing up with the survey companies. If you really want to give your money away, and your dumb enough to fall for the scams where you get a ‘free website' and it only costs you $400 (which is what those TV ads are all about), you can send me the money instead as a way of saying thank you for the heads up and the info on how to do it yourself for a lot less, or even for free.", 11392, "None", 0],
