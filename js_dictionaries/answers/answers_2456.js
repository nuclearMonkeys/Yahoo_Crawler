	128621 : ["\"Why are scientific laws unverifiable?\" Because they are based on observations and axioms which are not proven, and cannot be.  Same as with the church, we take it up on faith that our understandings are correct, although I'd give science the edge because it admits that it can be fallible and has a system of rules to replace understandings that are incorrect. So yes, in that sense, miracles that violate the known laws of nature are possible because we cannot claim we know all the laws of nature.  However, the known laws of nature are pretty rock solid and applying them yields the correct result often enough to call them true.", 10986, "1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa", 1],

	128642 : ["Well really the definition of a miracle is the doing of the impossible.  If a thing is possible....then it is not a miracle (although it could be a very unlikely fortunate event...or a \"freak of nature\").  It's impossible, so therefore it would not be rationale to believe in it.  Do I believe for example that a man can command that a arm instantly grow where a arm was severed?  Or a truly blind man be given sight by command?  Etc.?  No generally I do not believe that can happen.  I have never seen anything even approaching that happen either. I do think however that God (and that as Christ as well) can do the impossible.  It would follow that a almighty God could do that which was, to us, impossible to do.   I do believe in the miracles described in Scripture.  I do not think these occur today however, nor have I ever seen such a thing (yet have heard plenty of false claims that they have).   I would suggest The Final Word by O. Palmer Robertson (quick and easy read) for a theological look at this.", 10986, "RermzbWgaa", 1],
	128643 : ["Miracles are possible but I have no reason to believe in them because I've never seen an instance of a scientific law that's been violated. Most of the problems with Hume's account of the unverifiabilty of scientific laws can be resolved by using incremental (rather than absolute) confirmation when verifying scientific laws. The argument you've given (everything after however) also makes the category mistake of claiming that scientific laws and our understanding of scientific laws are equivalent.  Hume argued that our understanding of scientific laws was empirically unverifiable, but that doesn't rule out the possibility that there are absolute laws of nature that we simply don't have access to.", 10986, "HOKJNHFoaa", 3],

I have asthma and to top it off one lung collapsed and I was very septic with pneumonia throughout my lung fields. After being worked on and not revived, but still had some readable vital signs,  I was placed on a ventilator, and spent 6 long weeks in the hospital before being released to go home.  I was told that it was truly a miracle. So, yes, I absolutely believe, because science has no explanation of many things, and is not exact in many areas.

	128653 : ["No. As you probably know, Christianity is based in the Bible. The last book recognized by the Jews (Malachi) before Constantine converted Rome to Christianity was recognized (at latest) around 450 BC. These dates already predate Zoroaster's.  In term of the things you've mentioned, I haven't done enough research on virgin birth mythology to answer that one, but I can address the son of God and resurrection. I'm just going to use some obvious examples (since I already covered Zoroaster), let me know if I miss anything you wanted to discuss in particular.  Let's take Odonis, who is probably the ancient god for which we have the clearest data about. He was indeed raised from the dead, however, we only have 4 accounts for this information. The earliest one is in the second century AD. So immediately, we can rule that one out.  You might know of the Attis cult, who have a similar story. Unfortunately though, the earliest account we have for Attis is third century AD. And of course Attis was referred to as a god, not a son of God, so there goes that idea too.  You could consider Isis and Osiris, certainly pre-Christian. Except...there is no resurrection in Isis and Osiris. So now we rule that one out too. Of course since Isis was a goddess we can naturally rule out the \"son of God\" idea here too.  Or you could consider Dionysus, but, since it seems you've done your research I'm going to assume that you already know Dionysus is NOT pre-Christian, particularly the resurrection. Similarly, Dionysus also was not referred to (in any way) as the son of God. He was simply a son among many gods.  Some people also mention Mithras. While Mithraism did exist, Mithras was not known as the \"son of God\". Mithraic scholar Richard Gordon says unequivocally there is no death, burial, and resurrection of Mithras. None. Mithraism didn't gain foothold in Rome until after 100 AD. No Mithraic monument can be dated earlier than the end of first century AD.  To be honest, I'm pretty much doing this off the top of my head. Like I said, I'm not an expert in terms of the virgin birth but I know my \"resurrection\" mythology in particular quite well. I can tell you for sure that we don't have any resurrection stories predating the second century, in fact the earliest come from the fourth century. Jesus, as you probably know, walked the Earth during the first century.   Of course I'm not so close-minded to not accept other arguments. I've given you my conclusion based on the research I've spent years doing. So, to those of you who are making blunt statements like \"yes, the story was plagiarized\" without adding any additional information to back it up...please return and back up your opinions. I'm genuinely interested to see where such strong assertions come from.  Anyways, hope I helped. Have a good one :)", 10996, "MJMS2Y8eaa", 1],

	128666 : ["There is an interesting correlation between the Gathas of Zarathushtra Yasna (the sacred texts of the Zoroastrians) and the chapter of creation and book of Isaiah in the Old Testament. This can be largely attributed to the influence that the Mesopotamians held over the Israelites during the time the Israelites were living in Babylon. Strangely, the book of Yasna asks questions which are answered directly in the book of Isaiah. There are countless other examples of influences from Zoroastrianism, but this one is very compelling. Some examples of these similarities texts are: Yasna 44.3 :4-5:“who made the routes of the sun and stars? By whom the moon waxes and wanes?” Isaiah 40:26: “Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these things: who bringeth out their host by number, and calleth them all by their names: by the greatness of his might, and strength, and power, not one of them was missing.” Yasna 44.4:1-3: “who fixed the earth below and kept the sky above from falling?” Isaiah 40:12: “Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and weighed the heavens with his palm? Who hath poised with three fingers the bulk of the earth, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? In the Persian scriptures of the Zoroastrians, the Avesta tells the story of how Ormuzd created the world and the first two humans in six days and then rested on the seventh. The names of these two human beings were Adama and Evah. These texts date back as far as the 10th century B.C.  Zoroastrianism & Christianity  Over time, as Jews encountered the religion of Zoroastrianism, the faith of their Persian masters which contained many similarities with Judaism, many of these Jews adopted and adapted Zoroastrian tenets in order to make their religion suit their present needs. Over the centuries following the exile, a new branch of Jewish theology arose, which in turn gave rise to Christianity.2", 10996, "aM5fjuESaa", 0],
