With my second baby, my labor started but my water didn't break.  I was in full labor and the water never broke.  The doctor broke the water before the baby was actually born.  This happened after I had been in labor for about four hours.  So - I had four hours of labor - water did not break - the doctor broke the water and the baby arrived in less than 30 minutes after that.", 7552, "None", 1],

	54140 : ["                             For Math Solutions  •Snack time math Give your child a small serving of finger food — Goldfish, grapes, that kind of thing — and have your child count them before eating. Have your child eat one — but only one! Now how many are there? Gradually as the snack gets eaten, the counting will evolve into mental math. •Making math models Nope, nothing to do with runways. In math, modeling means using real-life objects or pictures to show math problems. Ask your kindergartner to draw a kid who has 5 cookies and is getting 1 more cookie from a friend. That drawing counts as a math model! •Use your hands Before they can add 2 + 3 or subtract 4 – 1, kindergartners need to understand what adding and subtracting means. You can help! Collect a small pile of buttons. Have your child create a pile with 4 buttons and a pile with 2 buttons. Push those piles together to make a new pile with 6 buttons. Count the total together and explain to your child, “That's addition!” Next, take 2 buttons away from the big pile. Together, count the 4 buttons left and explain to your child, “That's subtraction!” •Send them on a scavenger hunt Which is bigger? Kindergartners need to be able to compare things by size. First, give your child a chopstick and send them on a scavenger hunt around the house (or a room) to find two items that are longer and four that are shorter. (That way, they practice counting, too.) Then hand your child a small ball and have them find two round things that are bigger. Is everything really bigger/smaller? You may get to test out your child's logic skills with some of their answers. •What should I do with these numbers? Does your kindergartner know that when they hear a word problem about   eating cookies from a plate on   Eve that subtraction is involved? Build this understanding by sharing lots of math stories with your child. Then stop and ask, “What's happening? Do we need to add or subtract to figure out what is happening in this problem?” If talking about it doesn't make sense, have your child draw a picture or use blocks to help bring the problem (and solution) to life. •Which is smaller? Kindergartners need to learn how numbers compare to each other. Help your child understand how the numbers four, five, and seven compare to each other by asking your child to draw a picture of four stars, a picture of five stars, and a picture of seven stars. Then ask your child to put them in order from low to high, and then high to low. Once your child masters these, try again with larger numbers (up to 20). •Picture a place (value) Counting, recognizing, and naming numbers is sooooo preschool! Now your kindergartner needs to know the value of each digit in a number. Drawing it out can help your child visualize the value behind a number. Ask your child to draw the number 13 using circles, for example, with one group of 10 circles and three loose ones. Once they can do this easily for 11 to 19, give your child larger numbers to draw. •Get into shape! Or shapes. Your child can probably point out and name basic shapes pretty easily, and even tell you how many sides each has. But can they make new shapes using a combination of others? Pull out the shape blocks and have your child create a rectangle or triangle. How many triangles do you use to make a square? Do the same with more advanced shapes, like pentagons and trapezoids. •Think patterns Is your kindergartner getting much pattern homework? A pattern is something that repeats, like square-circle-square-circle. It turns out, patterns are the foundation of algebraic thinking. And kids need to start early! You can help your child think in terms of patterns by pointing them out in art, music, or on clothing — whenever you notice in a pattern in your environment. Ask questions like, “What comes next to make this pattern repeat?” •Tell me more Explaining one's thinking is a big part of Common Core math. When your child draws a picture to solve a math problem, ask them to explain their drawing and their thinking. Ask, “Where did you get those numbers?” and “Why are you adding instead of subtracting?” Lots of practice will help your child get comfortable explaining their thinking and prepare them for the higher level math that's just around the corner.                      For English Solutions  •Play simple word games like I Spy and seek out things that begin with a certain letter. In the car, play games with road signs or license plates, such as having your kindergartner spot words or plates that begin with a specific letter. •Perhaps the single most important thing you can do at this stage to foster your child's reading and writing skills is to read to him every single day. •Reading to your child isn't the only way to ensure that they become a strong reader as they get older. Singing songs together and familiarizing them with a range of lyrics will also help develop language skills. • Also Using Flashcards, Watching Kid Friendly \"Leaning English Words\" YouTube Videos, and Online Vocabulary Games would Help :).         ", 7545, "None", 2],

	54170 : ["Luck=Moloch=demon.Gov't is killing you with highfrequencyelectricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbringsthemupalevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put thesewreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism/COVIDrestrictions will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.
