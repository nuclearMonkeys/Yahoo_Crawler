	64151 : ["This reminds me of Daniel 9:24-27 The Seventy \"Weeks\" of Daniel. Its a prophecy regarding the appearance of Messiah. The wording is difficult and much of it is figurative language  24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. 27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate. In prophecy a \"week\" is not seven days. It is actually seven years by the biblical principle of a day for a year.  Seven days = seven prophetic years  Seventy weeks = seventy weeks of years OR 490 years (70X7)  Okay, Daniel explained that God gave Israel a probation period of 490 years to get right with God. if by that time they hadnt then he would disown them, destroy Jerusalem and the temple and scatter the Jews around the globe. The probation period began with the OT commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem and the temple which had been conquered and trashed. It ended 490 years later. That was the time of Christ. 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: >>>and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary;<<<< and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. That describes the events of 70 AD when God sent the Roman armies against Jerusalem and the temple and they utterly destroyed them. Messiah had been \"cut off\" 40 years prior - crucified but not for anything he had done.  27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate. \"He\" is Jesus. He \"confirms\" Gods new covenant of grace with his Christians for one week (seven years). And after 3.5 years is crucified  As a result the Temple was destroyed (70 AD) and that caused sacrifices to cease.

	64173 : ["Not so much.   Christ was without sin, not as a result of \"doing\" or \"having\" anything, but a result of what he 'is' and have 'become'.  There is nothing \"special\" or \"out of the ordinary\" about Jesus, as he is the example God intended us to follow in.  As a fully 'God/Self-Realized' Being, Jesus could only walk and speak by 'The Truth', which is 'all there ever is', or 'could possibly be'. Jesus, as did The Buddha, used 'sin' as another word for 'ignorance', which is just \"spiritual error\" of the ego (both figures considered to be without sin and ego).  We are not born sinners because we're \"wicked\" and \"evil\", but because we don't know any better.  If we did; we would.  Humans are born only knowing how to choose what is good and right, but limited by not knowing what they actually are; thus the \"Original Sin\" of Adam and Eve. Christ came to make the New Covenant with humanity, because how man typically portrays God as \"elsewhere\", as in the Old Testament.  How is it possible to be \"separate\" and \"apart\" from and 'Omnipresent God', expressed as 'Everything', 'Everywhere' at 'All Times'?  The God Jesus spoke of, in the New Testament, is described as a 'Transcendent Reality' as well as 'Immanent'. This is what Jesus meant by, \"I and the Father are one\", and, \"I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.\"  Christ taught that we are all God's children, and that the same 'Divine Essence' dwelling in himself, dwells in us all (\"...ye are gods\", \"the Kingdom of Heaven is within you\").  Jesus used his freewill to surrender \"free agency\" from God, to serve a 'Higher Purpose', greater than the sake of his own.   Adam and Eve, were unaware that God was offering them freewill, when He warned them about eating from the \"Tree of Knowledge\".  If God told them His Plan, it would had robbed them of the opportunity to choose for themselves.  Had Adam and Eve known better, they'd had refused God's offer out of the recognition that God had already made their existence 'perfect' for them.   Having lost their identity as \"spiritual beings\" of God, Adam and Eve mistook themselves to be material beings, in search of material knowledge.  Knowledge belongs to God, because only He can be Omniscient.  God is 'All-Knowing' by way of, 'Being All', and is therefore, 'The Almighty!'.  The human mind and intellect cannot know all there is to possibly know.   We tend to end up with answers that only lead to more questions to be asked, because \"knowledge only begets evermore knowledge\" to acquire.  Adam and Eve weren't punished for \"disobeying God\"; but fell from Eden for accepting a fallacy that cannot hold up in the Celestial Realm.  Biting into the \"apple/quince\" was the catalyst that created the \"dualistic split\" between man and God. The Bible and Christianity do not have a specific word for it, but teaches the concept of \"karma\" as, \"an eye for an eye\", and \"you reap what you sow\".  The Buddha mentions that we are not punished \"for\" our sins, but we are punished 'by' them.  Jesus said, \"By the judgment you pass shall be passed on you, and by the measure you apply shall be applied to you.\" Christ didn't come to identify as \"human\", but came to 'relate' to us, so that we may have faith.  Jesus taught to have 'Forgiveness' towards one's fellow man, including oneself, for being \"less than perfect\".  We come into Salvation through 'higher mindedness' and regarding each other by what makes us the 'same', rather than different, hence, 'The Golden Rule'. \"Ignorance/sin\" is just a byproduct of inheriting freewill.  Had God made us already knowing everything, 'choice' would never be a possibility for us.  Without freewill, we'd all remain stuck on the level we start from, without chance of advancing.  Freewill is what allows us to operate outside of \"divine bounds\", but not without consequences. Out of His Unconditional Love, it is God's will that we have freewill, so that we may choose Him on our own, which demonstrates that He doesn't rule by force.  Love that has to be \"forced\" cannot be 'Love' at all, thus he does not interfere with our freedom to choose for ourselves, without our consent.  God offered Christ to humanity as way out of sin and ego, so that we may return to our 'original position'. ", 8230, "af30aa6a15187dff31c5d8c00db90e55aa", -1],

	64175 : ["Well, there's the rub. The people involved in setting up and carrying out the Inquisition claimed it was necessary because they felt the need to root out of Catholicism claimed 'heretics' - i.e. people they said were not Christians at all but enemies of Catholicism. Given the Catholic stance, that 'true Christians' were obedient to the pope and papal doctrine, they used that to root out as many as possible who had objections to papal doctrine. In 1302 Boniface VIII declared in the bull 'Unam Sanctam' that this church has \"one head, Christ and his vicar Peter and the successor of Peter... For all men, it is absolutely necessary for salvation to submit to the Roman Pontiff. This we declare, affirm and proclaim.\" (DS 872; D 469)  That was followed by Pope Clement VI (pope from May 7, 1342, to December 6, 1352): \"No man outside obedience to the Pope of Rome can ultimately be saved. All who have raised themselves against the faith of the Roman Church, and died in final impenitence have been damned, and gone down to Hell.\" (Source: Pope Clement VI, \"Super Quibusdam,\" as cited in \"Apostolic Digest, Book V: The Book of Obedience\") That included defying papal decrees about not reading or writing the Bible in languages other than the Catholic Latin version. The Inquisition caused various Hebrew and Greek scholars to be burned at the stake because of their work in providing Bibles in their original and/or vernacular languages. The Tridentine Index was brought in in 1559 to try to counter the printing of Bibles in the common languages of the people, such was the hierarchy's desperation to stop the common people reading it. It banned the Bible in other languages, plus very many other books, leaving virtually only Catholic-approved literature to read. About three-quarters of all books in Europe were banned. That Index was only ended in 1966. Of course, the Catholic church said they never burned anyone to death because it was the secular government of the country involved that carried out such death penalties. Catholic Inquisitions were started at the Third Latern Council of 1179 (against the Cathars in France). The Dominicans became the foremost order of the Inquisition. In 1226 bishops would judge and the State would deal with 'heretics'. Pope Innocent IV produced the bull 'Ad extipanda' in 1252, incorporating all previous papal statements about the Inquisition plus condoning the use of torture. The Church knew how to do a Pontius Pilate - washing their hands and claiming innocence regarding the blood of such martyrs.  The Inquisition was based on the belief that Catholicism was 'the true Christian church' and that those who would not submit to papal decrees were not 'true Christians' but heretics who must be rooted out and even killed if torture would not get them to recant. That is a hall-mark of a controlling cult. The Inquisition has caused revulsion in billions of people, putting many of them right off Christianity as its horrors proved hatred against Christians who begged to differ in critical respects. The love of God and of Christ was trampled by it, in its determination to control the masses, to rule over them via abuse of its power. It could well be argued that no Christian would support the Inquisition, but the damage has been done and history testifies to the evils of men claiming to be Christians who viciously turned on Christians they considered to be a threat to their authority.", 8241, "0aN1xIxfaa", 4],
