Repeat this several times and they will realize that you will be back.  Do not worry about having to leave them, many people have to work and leave their dogs at home.

	107656 : ["Once again, regardless of 'having to work', adult dogs should not be left alone, especially crated, for more than 4 hours in a 24 hour period on a regular basis.  As has been said here, this is why so many dogs end up with behavioural problems.  Okay, most will 'tolerate' this sort of a solitary life, but dogs are social animals, and condemning them to being left on their own for so long isn't the life I want for my dogs!!  Okay, circumstances can mean this has to happen, and obviously keeping them like this is preferable to having to think about rehoming them (been there, temporarily) but it makes me weep to read of all the dogs, these days, who are being brought into this sort of situation deliberately.  I know it's more and more necessary for people to be working full time these days, but in that case, surely more thought should be given to whether it's fair on the dog/puppy, to be having them in the first place.  Cats cope with living a solitary life, in the main, dogs don't. I didn't have a dog until I could (afford to) give them the life I feel all dogs deserve.  I'm not placing all the blame on owners here - I'm shocked at the fact so many breeders are willing to send their puppies into this situation.  I didn't - or at least I made certain arrangements were being made for somebody to come in during the 8 hours, to be with the puppies I sold.", 10009, "None", 0],

The universe and literally everything in existence is dependent upon the integrity of God's perfection; if He was to make even so much as 1 error, all of existence would be destroyed (he won't ever do this by the way). As such God is bound by His own words. The words of God are so powerful that once said they remain in affect for all eternity. God's word was to once contradict itself than everything is destroyed. If God was to once be found a liar or once go against His own word, all would be lost.

You're going to raise a daughter with an eating disorder if you're not careful.  Rules like \"only one treat a day\" are fine and a good idea, but come on, let the kid live a little on special occasions!

The sad looks as you leave are more likely because they'd rather go with you, but it doesn't mean they'll get terribly upset while you're gone.

If so than you are probably dealing with seperation anxiety. Some ways to help this are trying to make your arrivals and departures very boring and low-key.

	107691 : ["Long story short, the root cause of separation anxiety is that your dogs believe that they are \"alpha\" over you. Dogs are pack animals, and in the wild, only the leader of the pack is allowed to leave the group without permission of the pack, and the rest of the pack members must obtain permission from the alpha dog if they wish to leave; otherwise, the alpha dog becomes upset. Before you leave and when you come home, try not to act overly excited when you see the dog. Instead, try to leave discretely; that way it reinforces the notion in the dog that it is not a big deal when you leave and that you are the alpha dog. You can also try leaving a radio or television on while you are gone, so that the dogs hear human voices. Last but not least, another method to combat separation anxiety (at least in the short term) is to leave a toy that will keep them mentally stimulated. One example of this is a Kong toy; you can smear the inside with peanut butter and stuff dog biscuits in them so that you dog can keep busy trying to figure out how to get the treats. Kong toys are commonly sold at pet stores, and come in varying levels of harness. Once again, over the long term, you'll have to teach the dog that you are alpha over him. In the short term, you can try leaving the radio or television on and leave a toy that will keep your dogs mentally stimulated. Hope this helps and best of luck, R.", 10009, "jiUJn3Bpaa", -2],
