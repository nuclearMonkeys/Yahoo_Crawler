Native Americans lived and even thrived for a LONG time before the message reached them...many were happy, lived in harmony with nature, and had a rich spiritual life...far richer than many people alive today!  I don't have a clue why God didn't choose to let those people know about Jesus...maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but whatever the case, I don't think any of us can possibly understand his reasons because we can't see the \"big picture\"...heck, we can barely understand how he created the world we can observe all around us...how could we possibly understand what he has in mind for the future...for eternity?  More importantly, we don't have any clue what might be happening or what might happen in the future to all those people that died without the opportunity to learn about Jesus.  Some people want to assume the worst...I prefer to assume that God is loving and just and that he alone has the wisdom and the legitimate right to decide the fate of everything he created!", 9554, "AA10945101", -1],
	95584 : ["The Bible and plan of salvation has been around for over a thousand years. There are many cultures that worship other gods. For example, I know many Native people and they worship the creation - not the Creator. Some may worship the Great Spirit - however, the Bible does state that Jesus Christ is the only mediator between man and God. There is no name under heaven whereby man must be saved.  Jesus even says that HE is the Way, Truth, and Life - no man cometh to the Father except by Me. Mankind still rejects God's plan of salvation today. Jesus came to this earth and His own received Him not. Many people today love their lifestyle more than God. God wants everyone to know that salvation is an individual plan. Each soul must give an account of her or his life at the end. WE can't blame anyone because we have every opportunity now to seek and find God for ourselves.", 9554, "qpKwZ7B9aa", -2],

There have been sent missionaries to their reservations who taught them about Jesus. We are His body here on earth.

And how do you know that someone didn't tell all the others, and they just killed them, like they killed all the prophets God sent? Have you ever seen the \"End of the Spear?\"   The Mayans sacrificed people all the time. What makes you think they would accept someone coming in and trying to teach them anything different? Lots and lots of missionaries have been killed for spreading the Gospel, yet they still take that chance, because they truly believe what they are doing. The disciples themselves were tortured and killed because they were spreading the Gospel. They died believing. Have you never read the Bible, Brian?  You always try to make things more complicated than they are. You screw things up in your own mind with all your so called \"intelligence.\" It's not hard to figure out.

In fact, God did send messengers to every nation.

The Saving Gospel of Jesus Christ is for Native Americans too. ------ Spiritually sealed & filled Christians (Born again Christians) didn't purposely give small pox to Native Americans.

Christians get the blame for evils in the world; But as a Christian myself, I can't see how any Christian would have even begun to think of doing a crime like that. Because even when I struggle forgiving someone, the Holy Spirit convicts me of my sin & I repent & Jesus makes me right. --- God had a back up plan in Genesis3:15.

They had a little girl who lived in the house, but all the boys were too naughty and had been locked into the cellar, and weren't ever talked to or let out. One escaped and was living in the walls.

	95621 : ["Native Americans have for centuries continued to exhibit a stronger resistance to the Gospel and the “White Man's God” than perhaps any other culture in the world. The result has been that the Native American Indians today have a higher rate of alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling-addiction, poverty, and suicide than any other culture in the world.  Many natives, however, did receive the Gospel through John Eliot's Bible. The 1663 Eliot Bible was the First Bible Printed in America which by the way, was translated into the Algonquin language.  In learning the concept of “written language”, and in learning the message of salvation in the written scriptures, many natives found their lives enriched beyond measure both spiritually and intellectually. The Pilgrims brought with them the Geneva Bible and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. British missionaries in the early to mid sixteen hundreds came here as well to spread the Gospel to the natives.  The RCA's (Reformed Church) mission to Native Americans began with the early Dutch settlers in New Netherlands (New York City). Bastiaen Janz Krol, was mandated in 1624 to instruct the Indians in the Christian religion out of God's holy Word. These early efforts in Native American mission work in the Hudson and Mohawk River valleys came to a halt about the turn of the 18th century. The increasing hostility of the European settlers made missionary efforts unlikely. Almost 200 years passed before the Native American people were again included in RCA mission efforts. The revival in Native American mission work started in 1895 when Reformed Church women called Frank Hall Wright into service. He was a child of a Choctaw Indian pastor and a missionary/teacher mother. He faithfully carried his ministry to the Comanche, the Fort Sill Apache, the Arapaho, and the Cheyenne, all in Oklahoma. He followed the tribes from place to place, pitching his tent nearby and talking with them around their campfires.
