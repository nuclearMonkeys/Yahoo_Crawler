	93699 : ["I'm a little confused by your question.  In a premature birth, the baby can survive and live a full and healthy life. You'd do best to ask your gynecologist at how many weeks they change the term from miscarriage to stillbirth.  But none of those things have anything to do with pro-life or drawing any line.  All those things have to do with nothing that can be controlled for the most part.  Miscarriage and stillborn babies usually occur because of something wrong with the developing baby, not by anything the pregnant woman has done.  Pro life has to do with knowing that abortion is murder and murder is wrong. What is mentioned in the bible is that if anyone assaults a pregnant woman causing injury to just her or if they also kill her developing baby the punishment should fit the crime with worse punishment if the baby is also harmed.", 9490, "GBKaftrJaa", 1],

There's a HUGE difference between aborting a child intentionally, miscarrying and having your child sooner than the usual 9 months. Your question doesn't really make much sense to me.  What is the dividing line between a miscarriage and a premature birth?  Well, the dividing line would be that your child died prior to birth and that your child was born alive, but before they should have been born. And are you trying to justify abortion by saying the Bible doesn't specifically say \"thou shalt not have an abortion?\"  It DOES say thou shalt not kill.

I may have a copy and paste about it. Let me check... [Receding footsteps] Okay, here you go. This summarizes a newspaper article printed in 2008. Some people sweat enough that wetness and odor affect their lives, and they need medical advice or intervention. That's called hyperhidrosis. OTC antiperspirants work by temporarily plugging pores with an aluminum chloride solution of 10% or less. Until 2007, the only products effective in combating heavy underarm perspiration were available by prescription only. They contained 20% aluminum chloride. Two 12% brands were available OTC, Xerac and Certain-Dri. Aluminum chloride does indeed stop perspiration but also tends to irritate skin. Many equally effective products introduced late in 2007 are available without prescription. They rely on aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex GLY, which is not only more effective than prescription-only aluminum chloride but substantially less irritating. Brands include Degree, Secret, Gillette, Old Spice, Right Guard, Sure, and Dove. Look for “Clinical Strength” on the package front or for the active ingredient. All protect against wetness, and all contain odor-fighting ingredients and skin conditioners to counter irritation. Some are scented. All are meant to be applied at night, before going to bed, for the best effectiveness the next day, including after showering the next day. The \"sweat doctor\" in the article stresses that antiperspirant and deodorant both need a \"dry canvas\" to work effectively. Drying with a towel, then applying, is not dry enough. He recommends either applying at night, before bed, when you're calm and not overheated, or using a hair dryer on the underarm before applying (yes, even if there's no hair there). He also advises lifestyle changes. Avoid outdoor activity between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Drink plenty of water early in the day, before you notice thirst, so your sweat is not concentrated. If your urine is nearly colorless, you're drinking enough. If it's yellow, drink more. Wear 100% cotton or linen clothing, including undergarments. If underarms are a particular problem, seek \"dress shields\" which block wetness from reaching clothing. Avoid nylon panties. Oral medications such as antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants have a blunting effect of sweating but come with side effects which makes them poor long-term solutions. One big-guns solution to excess perspiration's odor and wetness is the Botox injection, which costs about $500 per underarm and lasts six to nine months. Many insurance companies cover some of that cost. The most extreme solution is endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, a surgery which cuts nerves to control overactive sweat glands. ~~~ Me again. My teen and young adult kids swore by Mitchum unscented gel or liquid, which takes too long to dry but otherwise left them absolutely dry and odor-free. Their overactive sweat glands seemed to calm by the time they were in their early 20s.   BTW, make sure your towels and clothing are being laundered in the hottest water they can take, in detergent rather than a soap product, since they can be hosting bacteria that contribute to the problem.", 9487, "y3iKcyPGaa", 0],

	93739 : ["Hi there, Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition in which a person sweats excessively and unpredictably. People with hyperhidrosis may sweat even when the temperature is cool or when they are at rest. Sweating helps the body stay cool. In most cases, it is perfectly natural. People sweat more in warm temperatures, when they exercise, or in response to situations that make them nervous, angry, embarrassed, or afraid. Excessive sweating occurs without such triggers. Persons with hyperhidrosis appear to have overactive sweat glands. The uncontrollable sweating can lead to significant discomfort, both physical and emotional. When excessive sweating affects the hands, feet, and armpits, it is called primary or focal hyperhidrosis. In most cases, no cause can be found. It seems to run in families. If the sweating occurs as a result of another medical condition, it is called secondary hyperhidrosis. The sweating may be all over the body or it may be in one area.
