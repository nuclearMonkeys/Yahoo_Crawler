Mine was pushed to the limit. After the questions about some profile, e-receipts, pushing touchpads...I just said \"I just want to pay cash for this and leave\" I don't know if i can blame the cashier, she HAS to do this upselling nonsense, the usual junk in retail or she could lose her job - I did the routine a long time ago, it stinks.

	133669 : ["Lots of reasons.  Some are understandable and others are not. 1.  Zealous Muslims seem to hate all other religions; so Jews fall into the same category as Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and so on. 2.  Traditionally, according to the Christian view of history, the Jews delivered Jesus of Nazareth to the Roman occupying forces to be executed - or rather murdered for no crime in Roman Law.  So Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus.  The problem with this theory is that the Son of God was prophesied to die, necessarily, for the sins of the world.  So the Jews, and the Roman governor of Judea at the time, were all acting out the will of Almighty God.  So how are they at fault?  Anyway, the attitude is still there in fundamentalist Christian circles.  Only the English Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell realised the futility and unreasonable nature of this attitude.  Jewish communities from all over Europe were invited to set up industry and businesses in London, Bristol, Norwich, Leicester and York in 1657.  But the rest of the Christian world held onto the old attitudes for another 150 years. 3.  Because of their religious beliefs and those of other around them, Jewish financiers in the 10th-16th centuries were happy to lend money to European monarchs and war-lords, to help fund wars, crusades against Mohammedans, revolts against empires and so on.  They lent money to both sides.  Obviously, and predictably, half of their debtors lost their wars and battles, and were aggrieved at the Jews for backing the other  [winning] side.  Gradually over 500 years, the Jews came to be thought of as unprincipled, greedy, grasping and unreliable business operators.  This is the basis for Shakespeare's character Shylock the moneylender in \"The Merchant of Venice,\" first performed in 1605.  Actually, this is a calumny: the Italian bankers of Venice and Florence also financed wars and insurrections, but no blame is attached to them for some reason.  4.  In recent times, Jews [more correctly Zionists] have claimed a historical right to occupy the area previously known as Palestine; between Egypt and Turkey.  As part of the deals struck by France and Britain in 1914, to finance the Great War, it became a goal to find a homeland for the world's Jewish population.  The British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour made it a statement of British policy in 1917 to support such a claim as soon as the Ottoman Empire was dismantled after the War.  Unfortunately, the Prime Minister David Lloyd George had already struck a deal with the Arab leader Ibn Saud in December 1915, that the Arabs could occupy lands they helped Britain to recover from the Ottomans.  And, in the event, that included most of Jordan, Jerusalem, Syria, what is now Lebanon, and the coastline from Haifa to Gaza.  This contradiction in policy thwarted Jewish [Zionist] hopes for a homeland throughout the 1920s and 30s.  In 1946, it was agreed by the new United Nations to assist Jewish resettlement with the result that millions of Arabs were dispossessed of their homes and lands in the name of international rapprochement towards the Jews after the sufferings of the Holocaust.  Obviously, Arabs are still not happy about the process or the outcome as it is today. 5.  The Jewish state in the form of Israel has shown itself to be aggressive, discriminatory and diplomatically challenged.  It seems to many people that the Israeli approach to international dispute goes like this: \"You frown at me and I'll bash your face in.  You throw a punch at me and I'll kill your entire family.\"  This may not be true but the apparent stance and attitude has not made many friends but plenty of enemies.  Add to this the support given to Israel by the USA.  The Israelis cannot criticise the USA; and the USA is committed to support whatever Israel decides to do politically, scientifically, diplomatically and militarily.  Not everyone is keen on the American way of handling international affairs, and Israel has been tarred with the same brush because of its close association.

The education of general populations did not come universally until the invention and general use of the printing press. The most educated in most areas of the western world were the clergy and leaders of the Roman Catholic church. As such, they represented the Christians of western civilization. The invaders, of what is today Europe, were North Africans (Arabs) accompanied by Jews and the clash of Muslims, Jews, and Christians led to the expulsion of heretics (Muslims and Jews) or their execution. The leaders of the those who expelled the heretics were Roman Catholics (leaders of the Inquisitions) in now established nations of Europe.
