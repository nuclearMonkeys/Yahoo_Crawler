	75372 : ["I think you could get a better package in a deal involving Rodgers. He is probably the best fantasy player in the league outside of maybe Cam Newton, who is a rookie and does not have the track record that Rodgers does. Your team is pretty weak all around, so I'd look for a deal where you trade away Rodgers, Battle, and Jones and receive a Schaub/Romo-quality QB (Rivers is really struggling, he doesn't count), a stud WR like Mike Wallace, and a solid starting RB like Ahmad Bradshaw or Ryan Matthews.", 8805, "H0qXqBvQaa", 0],

	75404 : ["Human bones, in general, are not bendy, but this mainly depends on which bones and at what age of life. At birth, a baby has soft spots on its head, called fontanels. These soft spots were squeezed to form the head shape (if the child was born vaginally, not by cesarean section). As the baby ages, these soft spots turn into hard bone to form the skull and its layers (pia mater, dura mater). As for other bones of the body, they are not bendy. Rather, they are connected by joints, which allows us to move our body in many different ways. I believe, though, there is a disorder that can cause people to be extra flexible. It is called Eller Denlaw's disease (mid the spelling, i heard the disease on the health channel), and it can be life-threatening and somewhat beneficial. It gives the victim nearly unlimited mobility, but it can cause major bone dislocation. Hope this helps!", 8799, "AA11743029", 0],
	75405 : ["Yes, they are a little bit \"bendy,\" but don't get over-confident.  Most of them break more easily than they bend. There are some notable flexible parts, like the cartilage in your nose, which you can wiggle.  But that can also be broken or broken loose from the adjoining bone.  It's a really odd look, that is not fashionable any more. Small babies have bones that are much more flexible (bendy) than adult bones, but they get stiffer as the baby grows up.", 8799, "AA10164889", 0],
	75406 : ["All human bones start out as cartilage in the womb, so fetal bones are extremely flexible.  As a person ages, the living bone cells inside each bone replace the cartilage with calcium carbonate, making them much less flexible.
