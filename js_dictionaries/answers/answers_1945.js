Those who do not care for their children will be answerable before God for neglecting them. If the child wants to live with the father, praise God and let it be. The child should not be put under pressure as to who the extended family or the community wants him/her to live with. Some mothers after knowing the mess they have done and it irrecoverable try to hold onto their former husbands through the child and therefore the child suffers. Let the will of the child met.

	103008 : ["My grandmother lived with me the last 5 years of her life and one night while she was getting ready for bed she fell and broke her hip. I called 911 and got her to the hospital but the doctor showed me that the hip broke first and then she fell. The bone looked just like the bone of a chicken leg if you broke it in half. She was 94 at the time and they had to do surgery and put a pin in her hip but she died a week later. The surgery was just to much for her. The doctor said she just had brittle bones because of her age.", 9835, "ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa", -1],
	103009 : ["the first thing that goes out or breaks when you fall is your hip (unless you fall on your knee but usually you end up on the side of your leg and not on the knee).

They are at an increased risk of death from the hip repair surgery, from blood clots in the legs that travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism), and from infection, especially pneumonia. In short, the elderly as a whole do not tolerate such an event, and due often die as a result. So it is best for the elderly to get their pneumonia shots and better yet their flu shoes too.", 9835, "7qqMPm0oaa", 3],
	103011 : ["This is not as true as it used to be.  Speed is important so if a person is found quickly after a fall and taken straight to hospital and has the operation to repair or replace the fractures joint the healing process begins very quickly after the fall.  If however, a person is found many hours (sometimes next day) after such a fall the outlook is not so good.  I can quote 2 very different examples here.  One lady I knew broke her hip aged 81 and called for help. A neighbour heard her and got into her house and sent for the ambulance. She had her operation the next day and died aged 95.  The other lady was 90 when she had her fall and was left lying in her doorway on a cold stone floor overnight and found next morning. She died in hospital a fortnight later after having the necessary operation. The long period before getting attention would have contributed to her demise far more than the fact that she was much older than the other lady.  She was extremely fit prior to the fall, doing her own shopping, housework and gardening so was no FRAIL little old lady. The term 'speed is of the essence' really applies to these kind of accidents.", 9835, "AnpFhXGOaa", 2],

If I am home alone, I leave the door open.  Who's gonna see? I don't lock the door for security.  i always find it comical when people walk in on me.  It doesn't bother me.  I mean, look for the light under the door, bud.  I just lock it because I just have a thing where I don't like to be bothered with people I don't really know when I am using the toilet. Like, if my mom knocked on the door while I was doing a #2 and asked me a question, i'd have a short conversation with her and answer her question.  I would do that because I am comfortable with them. If the cable man was over and knocked on the door, I'd tell him to get lost.

	103027 : ["The complications that can develop after a hip fracture are what make the injury a life-threatening problem. Some complications can result from surgery, but many can occur whether the fracture is treated with surgery or not. Most of the complications that occur after a hip fracture result from having to put an aging adult on bed rest. In general, this seems to make all the medical problems the patient has worse. Some of the more common problems that a hip fracture can increase the likelihood of include 1.   Anesthesia:  A very small number of patients have problems with anesthesia.   2.   Pneumonia: Bed rest can increase the risk of developing pneumonia in older patients.               If anesthesia is required for surgery, the risk is even greater.   3.   Pressure Ulcers: Bedsores   4.    Thrombophlebitis: Blood clots. 5.    Mental Confusion: Stress,unfamiliar surroundings, pain medications, and the stress of the injury can lead to changes in a patient's behavior. This is sometimes called the Sundowner syndrome because it seems to get worse at night.  Getting the patient out of bed and moving can reduce the risk of developing all these complications. If an operation is necessary to stabilize the fracture and get the patient out of bed quickly, this will actually reduce the overall risk of developing these complications. That doesn't mean that the complications may not still occur after surgery, but they are far easier to treat if the patient can be mobilized.", 9835, "6IXPnC3laa", 4],
	103028 : ["I have seen two elderly people recover from breaking a hip. They tend to fall into  a great depression trying to recover from something so painful. And it takes so long to heal. So many are confined to a wheelchair after that, and can't get around by themselves. So they tend to sit and have nothing to do but concentrate more on their state of affairs, and mope. Without anything to live for, they really fall into a depressive state. And therapy is often too much of a hardship to do. So they give up on wanting to keep up on  their meds, nor do they want to eat. And so often, they develop pneumonia, and sometimes a coma after. I believe that they will themselves to die in the long run. It's hard enough for some to see themselves growing old, but to be old and in constant pain is something else.", 9835, "t7F9noqRaa", 0],
