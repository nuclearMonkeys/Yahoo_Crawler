I worked for a small ISP (Internet Access Company) years ago and during a meeting the owner wanted to let us know that he had a stack of nice quality, frame ready prints of the 10 Commandments for any of us who might want to hang them near our desks. When no one (or not enough people) took one, we all found them passed out on our desks. I only recall one or two people hanging them.  A few years later when the same man found out that quite a few of us working in tech support were Pagan, he decided to institute mandatory drug testing. Imagine his surprise when it wasn't the Pagans who failed the drug tests. :) edit - ugh.. P - Provider, it's been so long my mind has gone.", 8472, "s1zitZMOaa", 7],

	68887 : ["No, engineering is not right for you. Seriously. \"I am very egoistic. I care what people think of me.\" That is a horrible attitude, and one which will be detrimental to your [engineering] career. For one, it is a very serious profession, one that requires the utmost diligence and respect. Secondly, although civil is one of the easier disciplines, engineering is very difficult. If you aren't doing it for the love of it, you'll do poorly and find yourself struggling. Earning an engineering degree from a reputable institution can hardly be considered a side activity.", 8477, "69480d6b90362c310cba3e0ec3d93d6baa", 1],

	68889 : ["Hey, I know that this kind of question is opening yourself up to a TON of spamming from people with online get-rich-quick schemes... so i'll try to give a serious answer. If you like to travel and get tired of monotonous things, I recommend flight attendant. I have a friend whose cousin works as a flight attendant and says that it's amazing. He gets to see the whole world, he has a pretty flexible work schedule, and there's a good amount of job security. Also, like you said, you really like learning new languages, and that would be a large part of your job in that area. But, if you don't like dealing with travelers- I recommend acting! I'm an actor myself and I do it for fun. It's really enjoyable, and it's something different every month. Also, you make really strong friendships in acting. It's like a family. Good luck with the search, I know all about counselours pressuring you into picking a career interest. Just make sure to never settle for anything- always do what you WANT to do. There's never any reason good enough to sacrifice that.", 8476, "6e0vKnYoaa", 0],

You can travel and entertain at the same time, that is if you do not get bored with singing.lol.

But you can also still change at a later time in your life and go back to school to learn a new career.  Don't get pushed into anything.", 8476, "AA11029380", 0],

They will work longer hours for similar or less pay in more stressful jobs.  Engineers work hard in school. The reward is an easier life with shorter work hours, more benefits and vacation time, more challenging and fun work (something different everyday in most cases).  I know someone who just graduated with his MBA. He got 3 job offers. Two in sales and one in marketing. One company offered him $30,000/yr and the other two offered him about $45,000 per year. As an entry level engineer, I was offered $50,000 right out of college. And 6 months later, it was increased to $52,000/yr. My buddy in Computer engineering got offered $85,000 with Zerox right out of college. My gf got offered $58,000 as an engineer out of college.", 8477, "addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa", 0],

For the money?  For the ease of getting a piece of parchment?  Whatever your motivation was, it wasn't from the heart and no one should dedicate that much energy to something half-hearted. There are plenty of musicians that will tell you about hard work, long hours, and little reward.  Still... they do what they feel is theirs to do. The work was difficult, but it was rewarding to me... and I did it more than once in my life.  Try going back to University after 20 years and then you'll know what difficult is.  No one understood why I , a practicing engineer, would come back to school just to learn another discipline. I agreed with them that they could not understand.

	68917 : ["Engineers have the curiosity required for such accelerated learning. A non-engineering person would fail in an engineering curriculum, not because they aren't capable, but because they don't have the heart to continue. Us engineers would similarly fail in fields we don't like.  Yes, engineering is hard. But it definitely makes your time worthwhile. Even if you don't get paid a lot or you lose your job, the knowledge you've gained and your capabilities stay with you forever. You might learn something new everyday for the rest of your life, but the bulk of your capacity for learning is obtained in college- and through the rigorous engineering program. Most people can only afford college once - you may as well do it right and get the most of your time. If money and job security mean more to you than personal development and doing what you like, then by all means, switch your major. But I urge you to continue, because there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. I really think you'll be rewarded for your troubles in the end. I also urge you to enjoy life as much as you can, even when you're entirely too stressed out. Do not let the engineering program take over your life - let it improve your life.

	68924 : ["you got a LOT of wrong information (people telling you that the 40GB can play PS2 games, for example).  I'll clear it all up for you. backward compatibility for the PS3 with PS2 games is as follows on NTSC systems: 20GB (4 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - YES 60GB (4 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - YES 80GB with 4 USB slots (fat, no longer in production, bundled with MGS4 or Motor Storm) - YES 40GB (2 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - NO 80GB with 2 USB slots (fat, no longer in production) - NO 160GB (2 USB slots, fat, no longer in production) - NO 120GB/slim (2 USB slots) - NO 250GB/slim (2 USB slots) - NO any other up coming PS3's - NO PAL systems only have one backwards compatible system, and that's the 60GB. THAT'S 4 SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN FACT COMPATIBLE WITH PS2 GAMES!!! NOT 1 SYSTEM, NOT 2, 4!!! in short: if it has 4 USB slots, yes. if it has 2 USB slots, no. and as you can see, there are 3 systems that are fat, but can NOT play PS2 games. just because the system is fat does NOT mean it can play PS2 games. all PS3s play PS1 games. the download that others are referring to is for the PS3s that already are backwards compatible. downloading it to a non-backwards compatible PS3 will do NOTHING but take up space on your hard drive! it will NOT make your PS3 play PS2 games!!! \"If a PLAYSTATION 3 is not backward compatible, you will not be able to add this function through any hardware (i.e., changing the hard disk drive) or software (i.e., updates, homebrew) upgrades or modifications. \" that came DIRECTLY from Sony's own website:  and no, not all PS2 games or PS1 games will work. the 20GB and 60GB come the closest to being fully backwards compatible with PS2 games, but they still do not play 100% of those games or PS1 games. if you buy a backwards compatible PS3 and want to know which of your PS2 games work, check this link:  I dare anyone to steal my answer again. this is MY answer.
