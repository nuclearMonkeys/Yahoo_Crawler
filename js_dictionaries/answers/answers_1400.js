	75614 : ["So many of these answers are based on ignorance. If you don't know anything about the writing and preservation of the original manuscripts of the gospels and epistles of Paul, why bother answering? Pick up a book and learn a little church history, please.  The rules applied to the authenticity of the New Testament texts are the same rules applied to the other manuscripts of antiquity. That does not mean you have to accept every word written in them if you don't believe it, but please don't ignorantly dismiss something that has been the subject of a great deal of study and research by both Christian and secular scholars.  There is a HUGE difference in arguing that Jesus didn't exist and arguing that he was who he claimed to be.  I will say, Luke did not know Jesus, and the argument that he existed because people died fighting about him is not persuasive.", 8809, "None", 0],
	75615 : ["Actually, I am surprised at how many people do mention him...like Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny, etc...  seeing that he was one Jewish man amidst the vast Roman Empire.  I mean, how many other Jewish man have anybody write about them? This is pretty significant if you ask me. And to deny he existed is as stupid as the 3:10 Brits that deny that Winston Churchill existed. Then to compare them to Hercules, which is pure folklore...the Easter bunny, &   is nuts!  Some, I guess, are desperate to not deal with the truth that he did exist because it would open up another can of worms.", 8809, "b170d0becb56146cf665addf49ca5b4baa", 1],

	75617 : ["You are assuming that because you are a good person then you can earn your way into heaven. This is not true because all any body's good actions equals in the sight of God is exactly zero. It is not about how good you are or how well liked you are or how nice to people you, it is about accepting Christ as your personal Lord and savior because you can not reestablish your connection to God by yourself, only through Christ are you able to do this.", 8803, "b0IYXTcBaa", 0],
	75618 : ["If you can't believe, why are you so worried about what He will do if it happens to be true?  That must mean you hold it to be at least plausible.  Otherwise, if you really don't think its possible, then you must just be trying to get us to respond to your hypothetical, and your alleged concern for yourself is insincere.   As for ability to believe, you are right.  You cannot create belief on your own: Romans 8:7  Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  Furthermore, those who do become true Christians are on a one-way track.  There is no going back to being a non-Christian.  God has made it impossible: 1John 2:19  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  We are all, by rights, doomed to the consequences of our sin.  Our will is a slave to our sin.  It is not free.  But God has mercy, and all who look to Jesus will be saved, yet not by their own choice: Joh 1:12-13  But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  Man's will does not set him free from sin, but the mercy of God, which does not fail to liberate all whom God has chosen for salvation: Rom 8:29-30  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.", 8803, "None", 0],

	75620 : ["That goes both ways. How do men plan on satisfying their wives sexually for decades? Cheating is easy and you get the same results.......an orgasm. Then your lover wants you to choose between them or your spouse with the underlying threat that if you don't choose them, they will tell your spouse. And who wants that drama? Go to adult toy stores and find ways to keep the sex life fulfilling and desirable. Don't just depend on one person to carry the weight of keeping you entertained in all aspects of your life.

You might try realizing how judgmental and mean you've been and start apologizing. If you can mend the relationship with them, maybe they will invite you back into their lives.  Hint. What I love the most about my parents is that as an adult, they are very tight lipped about mistakes I might be making. They let me be me and so far, it's worked out very well.", 8808, "None", 1],
	75624 : ["I don't know why your son is doing this, but you need to respect his wishes.  As far as his wife is concerned, it doesn't matter what you think of her, it only matters that he chose her for his life partner.  As long as you hate her and make it clear that you feel this way, your son will reject you.  If you want to be part of your grandchild's life, swallow your feelings and accept the wife as she is.   Very few people are completely bad, so look for her traits that you can appreciate.", 8808, "AA10966502", 1],
	75625 : ["You should write a letter to your son in which you should explain that you do care about him, and that even if his decision to marry someone you don't like, your love for him is more important, that you still want to be in touch. Make sure he reads the letter (perhaps sliding it under his door, mailing it to him, whatever, but I recommend not sending an email because emails can be easily ignored). I figure if your letter/care/desire to talk to him touches him at all and if you leave him alone for a while, he would eventually drift back to you. But don't impose on yourself on him, don't try to force him to do anything; such would antagonize him even more. Be patient and welcoming.  Hope that helps!", 8808, "rkw7ht3Caa", 1],

	75636 : ["What do you not understand about the fact that there are no contemporary writings whatsoever and the the various gospels are \"according to\" which surely gives you the clue that someone else wrote them long after the supposed writer was dead!! There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!! He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record? Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!! At best he was an amalgam of those others!!", 8809, "None", -1],
	75637 : ["No one may have died for Sherlock, but they did, indeed, die for Hercules.  The Cult of Hercules was very important in early Rome, and like Constantine at the Milvian Bridge centuries later fighting under the sign of the Chi Rho (for Christ), many fought and died under Hercules' banner. You've trotted out the old, \"people died for this, therefore it must be true,\" argument before, but you never explain why this applies to Christianity and not say, Islam, where you have people dying for their beliefs constantly.  For that matter, early Communists believed so passionately in their Godless cause, they suffered torture from European Secret Police in Czarist Russia, and martyred themselves for their cause.  For that matter, re: Christianity, who is right?  The Catholics who martyred themselves to Romans, or the Protestants who were Martyred by Catholics.  What about the Cathars?  They believed in Christ, but also believed in a co-equal Satan who was a creator, not a creation, because they would not believe that God had ever created anything evil.  They were completely wiped out for this Heresy.  So they must have been right?  They wouldn't have died for fiction.", 8809, "AA11690436", 0],

	75640 : ["What do you mean freer?  Do you feel having morals is restrictive towards \"fun\"? I think you need to figure out your feelings towards morality. And you need to re-think your judgmental tone.  It's none of your business what another adult does with his life.  If he's abusing his children (beating or sexually abusing them) report him.

As a result of all this he does not want you around her or in his life.  If you really want to be involved in your grandchild's life, you're going to have to swallow your pride and apologize humbly to them both.  Then when you see how she is toward your son you're going to have to remember that this is his life and that woman is his choice and you have to deal with it and show her respect as his wife and your grandchild's mother.  If you don't think you can handle watching how his wife treats him you're going to have to give up on the idea of being involved in your grandchild's life.

When you marry a person, you always would like to say that you married your soul mate. I think that was a email that should have never been sent. Some things are better left unsaid. She need to be honest with herself and with you. I think you need to have a talk with her, I know that could be hard, because of her finding out your looking at her emails but its either a talk with her or having animosity  towards her even when your not trying too, or do something that you could regret later. I'm not one to put thoughts in anyone head but its almost like she is settling for your marriage because she couldn't have what she really wanted.

I keep my eye on her if i were you it's obvious she doesn't feel close to you she hasn't bonded to you yet and most likely never will until she has some kind of closer with her ex. A wife just doesn's send e-mails to an x lover unless she still has strong feelings for him. She feels it's unfinished and she needs closer. Sounds like your wife could be a little jealous of his relationship he has with his wife. She mentions about what a great husband  father and man he is but he was not those things for her..

	75654 : ["If you think a child should not see it, then you have no business watching it either I think. This question should only be answered by people who do have children. As a parent you have the right to raise your child as you see fit. Your child's behavior will be a reflection of your upbringing so adjust accordingly. Should all children stay out of R rated movies? No. It depends on what context of the film is giving it the rating. For example Mirrors is make believe just like any other fable of a \"kid's movie\" As long as the child knows it is all fantasy its okay in my opinion. If there is bad behavior due to it or nightmares then it should stop immediately. Nothing aside from nudity will you not see on the evening news. Violence is out there and exposing it to children, I believe is another way of teaching them right and wrong. Being scared shortly every once in a while is healthy. It keeps that natural defense on its toes. Bottomline, making a big deal and sheltering a child can be far worse. Teach them right and wrong, good and bad, and show them that make believe and real life are 2 opposites. Knowing the difference is the main key.", 8813, "None", 0],

All three of the Synoptic gospels are rehashes of another earlier text that has never been found, or an oral history. Jesus is not recorded anywhere by any contemporary Roman writers, although Judas of Galilee, who seems to have had brothers named as Jesus' brothers were named, was. There were many prophets and preachers abroad at the time.  It is likely that \"Jesus\" is an amalgam of more than one of them. And just to blow your theory completely out of the water, there have been many writers who dealt with Martians and others who dealt with made up historical figures, but they are not \"true histories\", they are what we in the real world call \"fiction\".", 8809, "keB9neboaa", 0],
	75659 : ["Even the most devout biblical scholars agree that the gospels were written decades after Christ supposedly lived. A clear indication that they were fabricated can be found in the fact that they can't even agree on key points about the life of their main character. You would think that the \"gospel truth\" could at least agree on where he was born, when he was born, the star, the manger, etc. It doesn't.  Paul, who never even met Jesus, seems to know nothing about this \"virgin\" birth and never mentions it. You would think that would be a big selling point. The earliest-written gospel, Mark, also never mentions this \"miraculous\" birth.  These stories are clearly allegories and parables written to sustain the divinity of a mythical character from history. People have gone to church, and to war, over far sillier and stupider things.
