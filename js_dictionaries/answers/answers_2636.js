He just won the title at Lockdown in April, and he fought like heck to get it so they won't have him loose it that quick.  Booker T or should I say King Booker again will, unfortunatly, win the title in the coming months because there is a Joe-Book fued brewing. They aren't ready to give the title back to Christian Cage, but when they do I will be right there supporting.  Rhino and Robert Roode are just there to fill spots and add more people to the match, but have no real significance. Krystal V get the hell out of the wrestling section you punk ask troll.

	137635 : ["Chris Jericho - He will propably win the world title from Cm Punk at Unforgiven, thats what I'm hoping for anyways. Shawn Michaels - Since WM is in Texas I see HBK winning the Wolrd Title then. Against who I dont know. Jeff Hardy - Shouldnt and wont win the world title. He has only one strike left, How can the wwe give him a title run? How would it look for the companies top champion is busted and fired for drugs? I dont see the McMahons taking that risk. Matt Hardy - Matt will be a world champion, sadly it will be the ecw champion. Shame too cause Matt deseves to be at least Smackdown Champion. Kane - No Kanes time has come and gone to be the head of the wwe. ", 11360, "D22oZZWjaa", 1],
	137636 : ["Chris Jericho - It really sucked that he had a HUGE build up (though we all guessed is was him), he tried to \"save_us for Orton\", but things happened he had a feud with JBL and just went backwards down the line to having the IC title (yeah it's a great title but for somebody who was the first Undisputed Champ being pushed to going so what down the rank? WTH). Kane - It is unbelieveable that for a guy who jas been in the WWE for more than a decade only ever held a major championship once, and that was an accident. He really is getting srewed out of some championships. And like you said ECW... NO ONE CARES. I really doubt there is anyone that really has a passion to represent todays ECW. MVP - That guy instantly radiates potential and screams future champ. He easily could have been the guy to go against HHH but no. We all have to see a semi repeatitive match (first Cena then Batista now HHH I think we can guess who's going to win). Matt Hardy - He would have had a perfect run (though probably short) with the WHC if he went against Edge. The storyline is already there! ", 11360, "oJN0e7dEaa", 2],

Danielson is a great talent, and his run in WWE (Daniel Bryan) will do well for him, I hope. WCW World Heavyweight Champion - Vampiro.  The guy was a great talent at the time, and had a huge following.  WCW didn't know what they had, because they never let anyone get into the upper echelon under the age of 40 (hence why DDP made it), or someone that WCW was pushing as a superbeast (Giant and Goldberg). WWF World Heavyweight Champion - \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase.  The guy was in the top seat for soooo long, being the bad guy in so many different stories...  but he never got the big gold band.  Why?  Who knows... everyone knew he deserved it. WWF World Heavyweight Champion - Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.  Another guy who put himself in the limelight just by being an awesome character.  I would have loved to see him at least be Intercontinental Champion... but alas, WWF didn't even think he deserved a run with the tag titles, and he is the only \"legend of the ring\" to never hold any championship. WWF World Heavyweight Champion - Rowdy Roddy Piper.  This guy was one of the best bad guys in the business.  In fact, he constantly stole the show, and really should have gotten himself up into the main event to finally be the foil in Hulk Hogan's plan... but WWF never wanted to give the bad guys real chances when Hogan was champ...

	137665 : ["1.  Christian and Mesias are both trying to be pushed yet TNA shoves them together in a match.  Judas is heel.  Christian well no one really knows so I guess he can be a tweener.  They should have let Christian be in the Joe/Angle segment and let Mesias dominate some poor little jobber (hopefully Sharkboy) and let him show how vicious he can be.  Instead they put them together to kill the momentum Mesias had making him seem weak and vulnerable against Abyss for the PPV. 2.  AJ Styles and anyone can be Main Event PPV because Styles is that damn good.  And with Tiger Mask in the mess that can sell out anywhere.  Technical and High Flying and most of all finesse.  These guys are incredible and it should be known.  Not to a Impact audience but to people who buy to see it.   A few other things. TNA gives away great matches on TV that people would pay for. TNA needs direction and to learn from WCW mistakes. TNA is atleast paying Daniels who is doing the Curry Man gimmick.  Atleast they are keeping him around.", 11361, "MziiSfxzaa", 3],

ISNT TNA TRYING TO PUSH JUDAS YET THEY HAVE HIM JOB IN THE MAIN EVENT TO A GUY WHO LOST AT THE FOLLOWING PPV DOESNT THAT KIND OF KILL THE PUSH JUDAS IS GETTING? Right now I don't think TNA knows what it's doing.  Some of their decisions make no sense.  If they're trying to give Judas a push, then Cage isn't the one to do it because he seemed to lose a lot of clout when Angle came to TNA. 2 WHY IS TNA WASTING TIGER MASK VS AJ STYLES ON IMPACT?  MAYBE ITS JUST ME BUT ISNT THAT A PPV QUALITY MATCH IF DONE RIGHT? It would be a great match if done correctly, but again, the problem with TNA is that they ruined Styles with the whole basketcase who doesn't know what to do about Angle storyline.

	137672 : ["I say yes they could. What they should do is have four of these supercards a year, have them be 3 hours long and have only wrestling matches no promos or if they do have it be one interview segment or something, and have them live not pre recorded. That would be able to show what tna has to offer as an alternative and it can help showcase more of the roster that doesnt get shown on tv as well. The reason i say four a year is so they dont waste alot of money on these, and also have them away from the impact zone have it in other places. Now having it on a different channel is perfect, but it depends on if they can get another channel to agree with it, i would say try and go after tnt or tbs for it. Maybe even espn. And more exposure is good for tna, and having great cards with great matches 4 times a year for free, and have it be live would only help it gain fans this would help tna out alot. So its a great idea.", 11361, "yl5Pleaqaa", 0],

There's little to no way that this guy can look like a monster, especially with that horribly fake blood coming from his mouth (looks like Kool-Aid). Judas Mesias in a main-event is weird, though, because he's not exactly a main-eventer. 2. I said the same exact thing.  The match was still well-worked, though.
