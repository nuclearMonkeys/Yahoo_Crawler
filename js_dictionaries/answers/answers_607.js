And then you have canola oil, coconut oil and cocoa butter.       Beyond Burger is just a big glob of fat bound together with peas and rice.  I guess if that appeals, go for it. I am not vegan, but I eat plenty of vegan dishes.   Salads, pasta dishes, hummus, grain dishes like tabbouleh, roasted vegetables, vegetable soup with barley, etc.  It's not that hard to eat plant food.   The thought of a highly processed Beyond Burger is truly BEYOND me.   Yuck.

A dozen or so players scored more power play goals (and a couple of those, HE was the guy that set up a lot of them), but he has the lead, by far, in even-strength goals, and he is the all-time leader in short-handed goals.
