I remember opening Elton John's \"Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road\" (It was a double album, and the cover opened like a book), and just seeing how the artists who did the inside art created a flowing story out of song lyrics that really had nothing to do with each other. Rather, you saw that this was a slice (or several) of life, with different layers; or even a spiritual journey.  The cover art for Alan Parsons Project's \"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\" was fantastic as well.  When you have the art work alongside the music, it makes the whole experience more visceral, more real; something you so beautifully expressed here, 8 Track.

When ethanol is burned through combustion, it produces emissions that are substantially higher than gasoline in aldehydes, the carcinogenic precursors to ozone. Much of the fuel dispensed at pumps in America today is a blend of both ethanol and gasoline. E85, a typical gasoline blend that is 85 percent ethanol, was found to emit more ozone pollutants than gasoline, especially during warm, sunny days. Diana Ginnebaugh, a doctoral candidate who worked on the study, explained that even on cold days when ozone is typically not a problem, E85 could result in problematic levels of ozone.\" Learn more:  \"", 9642, "NqGkbDetaa", -1],

(eating the fish raw does mean ingesting the bacteria, but in sufficiently low numbers, the human body can keep them in check.)  keeping a dead fish in the refrigerator uses cold to slow the growth of the bacteria, but does not stop its growth. raw beef has most of its bacteria and pathogens isolated to the surface of the meat.  however, once you grind the meat the bacteria and pathogens get mixed into the body of the meat.  once the bacteria gets into the body/volume of the meat, the situation looks just like that of the fish -- the cold of the fridge will slow the growth of that bacteria but not stop it.

I've been told everything from \"it's a sin in the Bible to mark your body\" to \"it reminds people of criminals because prison used to be about the only place someone would get one\" lol. I wanted a tattoo for years and finally went ahead and got one, and I absolutely love it, and I don't think I will ever regret it, but it is a very personal choice. One thing to consider is just how much do you really care what people think? I got a tattoo of a Celtic sun centered right above my cleavage (hee hee) and I have gotten a LOT of mixed reactions.

But as you can see, I can laugh it off, while someone else may be bothered or even crushed by these women's reactions. As far as the job thing goes, it all depends on what career you are going into and what the standard policy is amongst companies within your career choice.

However you need to explain why it burns more cleanly. There's actual chemical reasons as well as refining reasons why it burns more cleanly. Without mention or proof, the marketing has no ground to stand. 2. It's MUCH cheaper than gasoline. WHY?!?!?! In reality HOW MUCH OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION IS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED?!?!?! Do some research on how much the GOVERNMENT is paying for ETHANOL production. And we all know that the government gets it's money for free right????? NOT Taxing the heck out of people to make ethanol cheap. If ethanol was truly as cheap as you're claiming, beer should be like... $.50 for a 12 pack. Oh and another way the government makes ethanol for $1.15/gallon. Charge more for gasoline. Gasoline doesn't truly cost $3/gallon. About 1/4-1/3 of your gasoline is going to TAXES. THE GOVERNMENT IS TAXING YOU TO DRIVE. So PLEASE GET YOUR FACTS Straight. If you think when ethanol takes off that the government will continue to subsidize ethanol, I think you're sadly mistaken. AND if you don't think the government will not only stop subsidizing it and start TAXING it you're living a dream. 3. Explain this horsepower increase with ethanol? Ethanol contains less stored chemical energy than gasoline. So by default it will give you a DECREASE in horsepower. DO A LITTLE RESEARCH on this please. NOT ONLY DOES Ethanol contain less stored chemical energy than gasoline IT IS A MUCH HIGHER OCTANE than gasoline. PLEASE DON'T CONFUSE OCTANE WITH POWER!!!! HIGHER OCTANE MEANS HARDER, YES HARDER TO BURN!!!!! LESS COMBUSTABILITY!!!! 4. How do you increase your MPG with a fuel that supplies less energy than gasoline? This again you'll have to explain to me. MOST PLACES WILL CLEARLY POINT OUT THAT YOU'LL GET 30% LESS MPG than with gasoline. 5. It should also be noted why E85 cars can run gasoline and not the other way around. BECAUSE Ethanol is CORROSIVE!!! Yes more corrosive than GASOLINE! E85 cars need to be redesigned with better rubber seals to prevent the COROSSIVE Properties from eating away the rubber. Now that I've given your oppostion something to work with.  Here are some points for you. 1. One thing the US has is land. Especially in the mid-west. Points to make include - our soldiers do not have to be dying to support our oil habit. If we could produce a renewable energy source we would not have to fight or care about what other countries are fighting over. (Oh and don't mention the point that currently we are dependent on foreign countries like Brazil for our ethanol addidiction) 2. We can be independent of other nations.
