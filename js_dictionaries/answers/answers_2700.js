They source high-quality ingredients, they follow good manufacturing practices, and they have a vet on their staff formulating the nutritional composition of their foods who seems to not have read any new research since The Dark Ages. They recommend a low-protein diet for senior dogs, when current research suggests that senior dogs probably require 50% MORE protein than younger dogs. They offer a weight control formula that is mostly carbs, when current research shows that overweight dogs reduce best on high-proten, moderate-fat food in limited portions. They do not recommend Wilderness for senior dogs because they say that protein makes senior dogs gain weight... this is from my personal communication with the company, and it is simply WRONG. I am not sure why they do not recommend Wilderness for puppies... some of the first grainless foods (EVO, for example) were too high in calcium to be appropriate for large-breed puppies (excess calcium can cause skeletal growth problems in large breed pups)... the calcium level in Wilderness is NOT excessive for puppies, and Wilderness is perfectly appropriate for them, in spite of what they recommend. ADDED LATER:   This article addresses protein and growth (among other interesting things). It is excess nutrition in the form of calories and energy which leads to rapid growth, not high levels of protein.  There is no such thing as \"too much protein\" for carnivorous animals.", 11481, "ZxGAKWHQaa", 3],

You then pay for prints on top of that. It might help to understand that professionals tend to shoot in \"RAW\" format. This is not what you're used to with a point-and-shoot camera that does a lot of things automatically based on \"good enough.\" The RAW files a professional works with are highly malleable, and don't really have a fixed form. The photographer has to do a ton with color adjustments, sharpening, etc., after the \"image\" is captured. It's mandatory. Your little point and shoot camera does stuff automatically -- but that's why the photos the pro gets are so much better than yours. Anyway, a pro will get your images to a \"proof set\" stage where they've had some basic adjustments done. At that point based on subject matter you'd pick the photos you'd want finalized based on content. You might even need to discuss things like colors with the photographer. The photographer then has to manually adjust the images -- and the color space used, the sharpening, etc., are all dependent on the final format. A true professional would have very different files for web use, for printing on their personal printer, for making enlargements getting sent to a specific printer at a specific lab, etc. They're all handled differently, and a pro needs to control the quality of their work. Even if their name isn't visible on something, their reputation gets impacted when you're asked who did your photos, and so on. Anyway, a lot of what you're describing sounds like it very well could be \"common practice\" depending on what kind of photography you hired. Unless you made other arrangements, the photographer maintains the copyright to the images. It would also be on the unusual side for the photographer to send you your 500 unretouched photos as you're expecting -- the proof set generally isn't for sale. And depending on what this was for and what your general arrangement was, it may very well be normal for the photographer to pick his best work and the images he thinks are best, and those are provided to you. And especially if this is an \"art\" photographer, it's going to be pretty normal you get 2 or 3 high quality things, chosen and adjusted by the photographer, and that's it. Anyway, you'd need to provide a lot more info about what this was for and what you think your basic agreement was to get a good answer. But the thing that sounds most \"off\" in this is you expecting this photographer to provide you the 500 unretouched photos, especially if he was the kind of photographer who charges \"lots of money.\" You don't get those unretouched things -- at best they're a proof set used for reference.", 11484, "OHs8yJiOaa", 3],
