	38271 : ["The story of Leicester Cathedral has its beginnings in AD 680, when Cuthwine was named the first Bishop of Leicester. Around 870 the invading Danes invaded the Midlands and the last Saxon Bishop of Leicester fled their advance. It has been a place of worship for at least 900 years, but has been a cathedral only since 1927. The cathedral began as a simple parish church dedicated to St Martin and my great grandparents married there along with several of my great aunts and uncles The first record of St Martin's church comes in the Domesday Book of AD 1086, when it was one of six churches in Leicester. When Leicester Abbey was founded in the early 12th century all the churches of Leicester were given to the Abbey, and the monks appointed the vicar of St Martins.The church was rebuilt and enlarged in the 13th century, and again in the 15th century when the nave and aisles were extended. During the medieval period, St Martin's became the civic church, used by the city guilds that administered civic business from the timber-framed Guildhall immediately beside the west end of the church.", 5665, "afcLu9YMaa", 1],
