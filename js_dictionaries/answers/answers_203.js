	10157 : ["Nice theory, but not the one adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The Supreme Court held about eight years ago in a case involving the equivalent clause in Article I that \"legislature\" referred to the legislative power.  (As a matter of historical reality, it would have to refer to the legislative power.  At the time of the framing, the thirteen states had thirteen different sets of rules for what it took to validly enact a law.)   Furthermore, in most, if not all states, the legislature has delegated its power (which is constitutionally permissible) to the Secretary of State to make regulations implementing the statutes. As such, the legislature has approved allowing the Secretary of State to change those regulations as long as the revised regulations are consistent with the statute.  And it's up to the state courts -- not the legislature -- to decide if regulations are consistent with statutes. Similarly, because we are dealing with the legislative power, it is up to the courts to reconcile different laws passed under the legislative power which would include the legislative power of the people of the state to adopt and amend a state constitution.  ", 1662, "e6V3xf8zaa", 0],

	10176 : ["First, he exploded the deficit.  Anybody who thinks that debt matters has to see Reagan as one of the big villains in our fiscal irresponsibility. Second, he dramatically altered the tax system which has had long term consequences for income inequality.  Reagan's changes to the tax rate contributed to the pay for top executives going through the roof.  Before Reagan, the tax rate on top incomes was 70%.  By the end of the Reagan presidency, the top tax rate was 28%.  Because the top tax rate is only imposed on additional income, prior to Reagan, there was a strong disincentive for people in the top bracket to ask for additional current compensation.  Instead, they sought forms of compensation that spread out payments.  Now, the difference between the brackets is so small that the incentive is to get as much as you can in current compensation.  As a result, the salaries of top executives has skyrocketed.  While this change was supposed to encourage economic growth, most economists have found that there has been little or no economic growth that can be attributed to the tax cuts passed by Reagan.   Third, he was rather ruthless towards unions.  Historically, a strong union movement has been associated with more workers earning middle class incomes.  Since Reagan, income for blue collar workers has stagnated.  ", 1666, "e6V3xf8zaa", 3],

	10196 : ["The VERY FIRST thing the LIEberal left socialist demoCROOK'S need to STOP doing is COMMITTING these MASS MURDERS trying to vilify firearms!  Now think about this: When Obummer was POTUS there were a 24 total of \"mass shootings\" BUT under Trump there were 4 FOUR TOTAL \"mass shootings\" or 6 SIX TIMES MORE shootings under Obummer than Trump although Obummer was POTUS twice as long as Trump! Since 1966 and if you count these now 3 new shootings under Biden there have been a TOTAL of 55 \"mass shootings\" or virtually HALF of ALL \"mass shootings\" occurred under Obummer ALONE! So the REAL question is Why were there an almost equal amount of mass shootings under LIEberal left socialist demoCROOK president Obummer ALONE than ALL republican AND demoCROOK presidents since 1966 COMBINED AND when you total ALL the presidents since 1966 ALL demoCROOK presidents had MORE mass shootings under THEY'RE presidency than ALL republican presidents combined?? It seems to me the REAL root of the problem is the demoCROOK PRESIDENTS being the common denominator!!! The ONLY other factor that COULD explain it is these shootings are being carried out by demoCROOKS and they're supporters to provoke a governmental response of \"HEY let's ban firearms as the cause of all these shootings\" that also JUST happens to be one of the demoCROOK politicians MAIN targets for they're agenda to keep the people subservient to THEM when the demoCROOK party gains the majority of the control of our federal government and FULL control of the judicial branch!! The differences are the PRIVILEGE of driving a automobile is a PRIVILEGE and NOT a RIGHT while the RIGHT to keep and bear arms is a CREATOR GIVEN and CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT privileges are Privileges BECAUSE they are NOT a RIGHT bestowed upon us by our creator and are REVOCABLE by the government at ANY time for ANY reason the government sees fit!!!! The same argument applies to cell phones causing distracted driving cell phones are NOT a RIGHT! IF firearms are the cause of crimes where firearms are used then WHY in the ENTIRE history of our country hasn't there EVER been ANY armed robberies, mass shootings or ANY and I do mean ANY other type of firearm related crimes EVER happen at ANY of the HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS or more of the gun shows ANYWHERE in our country where there are literally THOUSANDS to TENS of THOUSANDS of FIREARMS, MILLIONS of rounds of ammunition and TENS of THOUSANDS of people attending????? Using LIEberal left socialist demoCROOK logic of \"firearms are the cause of firearm related crimes\" then a gun show would be the most DANGEROUS place in the WORLD to visit NOT the SAFEST AND there would be a MASS SHOOTING EVERY WEEKEND SOMEWHERE in the COUNTRY because there are DOZENS to HUNDREDS of gun shows EVERY WEEKEND EVERYWHERE in our country EVERY weekend!!!!! In fact there's a gun show tomorrow in Tampa and I WILL be there!!!!", 1678, "miCdtifGaa", 2],
