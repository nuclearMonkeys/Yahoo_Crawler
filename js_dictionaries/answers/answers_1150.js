A step-by-step guide is available at:   (follow the link to ‘Cassette to CD‘) The recording software is the key, there are some free software downloads available at: I have used ‘Magix Audio Cleaning Lab' and ‘Audacity' – Audacity is particularly popular since it is free! If you record to WAV format, expect file sizes of around 10MB per minute, or 1MB per minute for MP3 (at 128kbps). Once you have your digital versions of the recording on your PC, simply burn them on to a CD (Nero burning software or similar..). If you use Magix Audio Cleaning, the software will burn an audio CD for you without needing additional software (assuming you have a CD writing drive of course!) You will need the additional 'lame_enc.dll' file to export into MP3 - this can also be downloaded from the free software page. You can also download a free PDF version of the step-by–step guide from the download page mentioned above, the guide is complete with diagrams and screen-shots. Hope this helps", 8193, "9bd02e0eb04ac62bc729b2533dc4555eaa", 0],
	62996 : ["The USB device itself does a great job of recording the vinyl records, but of course if the records are scratched then it will record the scratches or bumps as well. Still, I got rid of my vinyl collection a long time ago after transferring everything. If you can manage to part from your LP collection, then I would say it is worth it. I don't know about the TTUSB05, but it seems to get good reviews here:   and looks like its available for under £70 here:   so it looks like a good deal.", 8193, "4W9Tiwcuaa", 1],

I have read some reviews of USB turntables and they nearly all say that they are okay but you will still hear any clicks and scratches that are on the vinyl. And one other thing to remember if you are buying a USB turntable is that you have to assemble it yourself, it doesn't come already set up in the box. I was surprised to find that out and if the reviews are true then you cannot buy one already assembled. Something to consider if you are thinking of buying one.", 8193, "IfzSyw6naa", 1],

Major bands are labeled as sell outs because a lot of people listen to them. Also, a lot of the original fans that liked them because they liked the music get pushed around because they fall into the \"trend follower\" crowd. It's popular to not follow the trend. Kind of. You can only follow the trend if you don't really like it, or if you kind of like it, but if you really like it, you're not trendy. Savvy? I used to really get ruffled about this when the whole \"retro band\" craze started. I was mad because people were pushing me around for saying that I really did like Pink Floyd, and that I was just being a \"poseur\" and trying to be cool by wearing their shirts. Heck, one person got a look at my PULSE shirt and asked if I had gotten it at the nerd convention.

	63027 : ["VERY subjective question. Naturally, most would end up picking the decade they grew up in. But I'll try to look at each objectively: 50s: Rock is born. The innovators like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, & Buddy Holly get the flames going. Elvis puts it on the pop culture map for good. 60s: Beatles, \"British Invasion\", socially & politically aware songs, peace, love, the upbeat Motown songs, etc.. The 60s are a HARD act to follow in terms of idealism & overall innovation. 70s: rock fragments into many diff' sub-genres. Disco, 60s idealism is dead. It's all about escapism w/ disco, soft rock (James Taylor, Fleetwood Mac, et al) or hard rock (eg: Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath etc) 80s: MTV changes everything. For the worst to some. The scene more than ever before is all about image over substance. More & more producer-driven music. \"hair metal\" dominates airwaves. Hip hop gains mainstream popularity. By end of decade, making a video to get exposed is a must. 90s: After grunge, rock takes a back seat to hip hop, rap & pop. (Spice Girls, boy bands etc) Short shelf life pop tunes dominate. Now: It's all about producer-driven music more than before. (w/ a HANDful of genuine singer songwriters) Just look at American Idol. Few are making groundbreaking music anymore, so we have to vote for our new music heros on tv. IMO, all the best, most refreshing new rock is indie rock. You sure won't hear it on MTV....Indie rock is really the only rock left now that's \"un tainted\"... So which is best? Heh, well by MY standards, I'll take the 60s & 70s, w/ a HUGE deal of respect for the 50s, thank you...", 8188, "AA12135515", 2],
