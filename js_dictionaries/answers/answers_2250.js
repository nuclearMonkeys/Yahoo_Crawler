	118289 : ["Well, since I don't exactly know what you mean by \"get on\", I'm going to assume its love compatibility between a Capricorn and a Leo. A Capricorn's biggest assets are their money and their family. They admire their family circle, a good solid savings account and a well educated person. They can be considered a snob about these things along with what class status they should be and the community they are in. They can also be somewhat selfish. To defend themselves they call it self protection.  Mention someone who is proud or arrogant and you'll soon see a Leo appear almost immediately. Regardless of their extreme arrogance they are quite affectionate and enormously generous. They will proudly stand up and roar their arrogant roar as they look after the little guy. They will defend the defenseless and shield the exploited. This is ‘their' self protection.  Leo and Capricorn are similar in that they are both highly intelligent, authoritative, practical and quite stubborn. Perhaps Capricorn possess these qualities a touch more than Leo but it does not stop the curious nature each one has for the other. The Sea-goat will delightfully watch Leo as they sashay through their colorful and witty conversations wearing outfits that are just as colorful and witty. They are in awe at the seemingly impossible goals Leo tends to strive toward and their ability to delegate authority to reach these goals. Then there is the overwhelmingly kind and generous nature they possess as they frivolously spend money with no regard for financial stability. The bond between Leo and Capricorn gives way to the differences between them. Capricorn's tolerant, frugal, timid, tender and carefully calculating attitude is quite different from Leo's eagerness and their frivolous, well-expressed, dramatic, courageous and impetuous attitude.  The interpretation of each of their qualities is somewhat different in the other's eyes. Leo seems to see Capricorn as bitter, egotistical, callous and oppressive whereas Capricorn sees the Leo as extravagant, hasty, narcissistic and futile. The two can learn and grow from watching each other. Capricorn can build a sturdy foundation that Leo can build on as they are discovering a dependable friend or associate in the Sea-goat. If they looked through Capricorn's calming and sensible eyes at life they just may be able to see what they can gain. The ability to admit mistakes or being more patient with things are some of Capricorn's finest virtues. Leo's ability to set such high goals will benefit Capricorn if they choose to discover this. Capricorn should witness life through Leo's eyes. This way they will gain knowledge of being more independent, warm, sociable and a bit more extravagant.  Even though they may try to learn from one another, there is nothing like a good competition between the two. This will make them rivals either openly or secretly. They are both dually bright and very stubborn and neither of them will budge from their own part of the world to which they built their empire, each one thinking theirs is better than the others. Capricorn may be influenced by Leo's bright and sunny disposition, but they get easily irritated when the proud Leo tends to pat their own backs. Capricorn has a lot of the same qualities as Leo such as being authoritative, stubborn, intellectual but so much more so than Leo. However, they don't flaunt it so much. They are less obtrusive about it.  The differences in each other, if seen and experienced, will bring a sense of freshness and renewed attitude to this relationship. To understand what motivates the other is always magical and will open up their minds and souls to each other. The affection and compassion experienced between Leo and Capricorn will increase unexpectedly, therefore making the bond between them much stronger.", 10538, "aR1Opnx3aa", 0],

	118295 : ["Michael was a very lonely and unhappy man. It is a tragedy that nobody understood him at all not even anyone from his family. This is very evident in that nobody heard his cry for help. The cry was evident in the things he did… this is manifested in the many plastic surgeries he had. He was crying out for the childhood he missed when he built the magnificent Neverland and allowed children to come and play with him.  i have never ever believed any of the accusations made against him and always will think he is an innocent, very misunderstood man. he simply didnt have a childhood, and lived a hard sad life. performing was the only thing he could really enjoy and im so glad i could be involved with that. being a dancer myself he has left a legacy in the dancing world, he is an inspiration. the music and dancing world just simply will not be the same without this legend.

	118298 : ["Keep your hair well conditioned with a rich moisturizing product. The hairstyle is also important. If your hair is very frizzy you don't want too many layers. Have a few longish ones that will allow your hair to flow. Always use a diffuser when blow-drying which will help control the frizz but will not remove all the body. We suggest John Frieda Frizz-Ease Hair Serum, which smoothes texture and adds great shine to frizzy, dry hair. It works brilliantly when used with the other John Frieda Frizz-Ease products, but can also be used alone to successfully control frizz. It has UV filters to protect your hair condition and hair color against the damaging effects of UV rays. It also comes in 3 varieties: lite for thin/fine hair, original or extra-strength for coarse hair.", 10537, "80QkXNi8aa", 5],

What I have found in the Taurus Cap matchups is this: The woman in either mix and match is the one who is really obsessed. My friend is a Taurus female and she LOVES her some Cap men. Me I am a Cap female and I love Taurus. So being that you are the girl bull you may find yourself chasing him a bit, just I am chasing your male counterpart:) I will tell you than Cap at times dont really tell it like it is. I have seen this Taurus chick get so snappy and thinking that she KNOWS everything when she doesnt want to hear the truth it turns the Caps off, but we may not say anything at first. Taurus women can be really crabby. So keep that in check. Also Taurus and Cap do have the same life ideals, but it always seem that Cap is more grounded in their approach. Like my friend talks day and night about having an entertainment company, yet she is homeless??? And when you try and correct something she says or does she just snaps like 'I KNOW' and this turns the Caps off. Her new Cap beau even called it quits because he said that he didnt see their thing going anywhere and he couldnt get close to her emotionally, but hey at least they saw each other. My Taurus has been running from me because he is afraid to love. This running and not being open with emotions is not something I can tolerate from the Bull. This is a compelling relationship, one that can work if insecurities and a need to 'fit in' doesnt get in the way by the Taurus- Capricorns hate fakers. Also if they both realize they are working for the same things in life and have the same ideals and values. Also Chris Brown is a Taurus and Rhi Rhi is an Aqua and this goes to show you how obsessive this link can be, but violent as well. Violent for the reasons I have described. Cap can get so enraged at Taurus and their inability to move and make a decision about things that it brings physical violence. Taurus is a very physical sign and demands  actions if subtle requests dont work and if you arent hearing him telling you not to go out, he may just grab you at the door and pull you back in the house!

Then try to start by choosing what your main character may be like and try to write as much detail as you can about them, name,age,how they dress, act, personalitt traits, likes, dislikes, where they live,when were they born, their parents, if they're at school, what grade are they in, if not in school, then what are they doing, working, going to uni/college, living off their parents, are they a rich person, trust fund baby? Maybe include their friends, their relationship, does your character have a gf/bf? Are they allergic to anything, are they addicted to anything, drugs/alcohol/sex/coffee etc... This will give you a start, then try to write the first paragraph with an opening to introduce your character, try visualising how you see them, are they at home, school,work or shopping etc...Try to not give too much away, but just enough to give the reader an over view of your character. Then consider what your character is about, what are you wanting them to do? Are they in a drama? Comedy? Romance?Fantasy?Sci-fi?Thriller?Horror? etc...what is the basis for your story and character? Try to think about some of the issues that may be important to know, even if it's only a couple of things to focus on at the moment. Try not to give too much away too quickly, but just enough to keep your readers wanting more, it's always good to keep them guessing about at least one thing, then for that to be revieled at the end of your story. Once you have a main character structured, and a genre your basing your story obn and a scenario or issue, then just try to incosporate what you can in each chapter, if you do it that way, I find when starting out it's easier.
