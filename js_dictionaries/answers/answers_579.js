I just saw it on YouTube about a half hour long with Carra and Neville pick their England squads. Carragher was just coming at Gary the whole time. I do think Neville comes across as a bit stupid sometimes but I thought he was making some very fair points about his team selection and Carra was just coming for his throat every time Gary opened his mouth! I'd say it was the worst I've seen Carragher going at Neville. Did Gary sleep with Carra's wife or what lol As for is it scripted it probably depends what your definition of scripted means. I don't think it's that someone tells them what to say but they'll be given the topics beforehand to prepare. Do they then share with each other the points they want to make? Maybe. Doing a practice run is common in tv I know they do it for some talk shows where they do a mock interview before the real one", 5020, "q1BX2eXuaa", 1],

	32766 : ["Carlo is doing a good job with Everton like it's Everton you know? They should really go out this summer with the intention of building a proper top 4 team. The problem is Carlo seems to like the players he's been using and they seem to like him. So will he have the ruthlessness to replace players who have been pretty decent for him but not up to the top level? I think that's always a trap managers fall in to when they don't bother upgrading on players because they player is a nice guy and does a decent job. How many stories do we see where a manager comes out and says \"we didn't need X, we had Y and Z\". X then turns out to be a world class talent and Y and Z were just some bang average mid table players.  Contrary to popular belief I think Jose is doing fine at Spurs too. It's Spurs we're talking about you know? Like when they went out of Europa nothing was wrong with his team selection, nothing was wrong with the subs he made to try and win the tie. It was all down to the players and they bottled in typical Spurs fashion.  The fault here lies with Levy. You don't appoint Mourinho to manage a Pochettino team, likewise you wouldn't give Poch a Mourinho team. The manager needs to be able to sign and sell whoever he wants. We'll see how things go in the league cup final at the end of the month, if Spurs lose that game then the season has been a failure. If they win it then it's been a success because this is literally Spurs we are talking about here. Top 7 and a cup final win? Great season for a Spurs team", 5013, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],

That's why the Olympics is really popular but a lot of the individual sports within never get much attention outside the competition.  Women can't compete with men at physical sports, so it's not the best of the best, so people don't watch. ", 5004, "JNrbxQIvaa", 0],
	32782 : ["OK I'll speak from England... Number 1, move it back to a summer sport. The one thing I admire about the womens game is how they appeal to families. Used to watch Sunderland ladies in the summer when the mens game had finished and it's family centric. Cheap family tickets, stuff for the kids to do there, plenty of interaction. They basically copied the basketball model. However by moving the game to a August-May calendar, for a large part of the year, the families won't go. The kids will struggle to have fun in the cold, rain and wind and the parents are even less likely to take them. Move it back to March-November or even go January-September. Basically have the bulk of the games in the warmer months where families are more likely to go. This will also have the effect of taking in the fans of the mens game who also want their football fix through the summer. Number 2. Keep appealing to families and don't divert from this. You get the kids interested early, you will keep them interested. 3. Don't clash with the mens teams games on kick off times. I'd like to go watch the men and womens games live. However if there is a fixture clash, I've supported the mens game for longer so will always pick that. If the games have to be on the same day, kick off at 12 if the mens game kicks off at 3. If not, move the womens game to a friday night or a Sunday afternoon. 4. Keep progressing. Any idiot who expects the womens quality to be the same as the mens is an idiot. The mens game has took 160 years to get where it is today. The first mens world cup was 1930 and the FA Cup has been around since 1871. The first womens fa cup was 1970, the first world cup was 1991. If you look at the mens game in 1930 and compare it to today, yes the quality would be lower. And yes because of the advancement in the mens game, we can expect the womens game to get better quicker, however expecting it to be on the same level when the mens game had a 100 year head start is a joke. The comparisons need to stop. Let it develop and focus on itself.", 5004, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	32789 : ["It's the stupidest idea in football history. Imagine being FSG or Sheikh Mansour, literally heroes at their clubs.  FSG come in to Liverpool and make all the right decisions bring in Klopp give him the players he wants don't worry about the price and they go win a 6th Champions League and a first league title in 30 years. Apparently these achievements mean NOTHING to the Americans over at FSG, so what was the point what was all the investment for, why hire Jurgen Klopp? Sheikh Mansour comes in and takes over Man City in 2008, a crap mid table club. By 2011 they have their first major trophy since 1976, a year later they've won their 3rd ever top flight title, first since some time in the 60's. I thought their mission was to win the Champions League, now they don't want to be in it? Look at Spurs sacking Mourinho today, presumably for failing to get into the top 4? Why do you want to finish in the top 4 if you DO NOT even want to be in the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE???? What was the point in sacking the manager? Doesn't matter if you finish 1st or 20th when you want to break away into your own competition. Man United fans have been ranting about the Glazers for years. Those guys have overseen a load of trophies at Man United - league titles, Champions League, FA cup, EFL cup, Europa League. Does all this success mean nothing?  Arsenal absolute joke team, playing like sh*t week in, week out somehow think they are entitled to be playing Barcelona every year? Every year you lot played Bayern Munich in the Champions League you'd get hammered useless c*nts.  Chelsea same kind of thing. Abramovich comes in with all his money wins the champions league he wanted and what, he never wants to win it again? Fans MUST reject this. DO NOT attend the games for you club, DO NOT buy shirts or any club merchandise. Support your other nearest team. If you're from Liverpool support Everton or Tranmere, from London stop supporting your big 6 club support Fulham or West Ham or whoever. From Manchester? Support Salford, Bolton, Rochdale. Doesn't matter. Stop supporting these teams. When their little experiment fails DO NOT accept them back, make them start from the bottom if you want to even let them back into the football pyramid at all.  I can't imagine the managers being in favour of this nonsense. Klopp, Guardiola, Tuchel whoever hand in your letter of resignation if this bullsh*t goes ahead and let the players follow. If this goes ahead these \"super clubs\" can die for all I care. Nobody expected the Germans to take part in this but credit to them for rejecting, but massive respect to PSG. Might be early days yet maybe they're still in talks for it but hopefully they reject it. Rio said on BT last night as well we talk about the PSG owners like they're this or that but massive respect to them if they've rejected this.", 5008, "q1BX2eXuaa", 2],
