But wait a while and as nasa descends deeper into pseudoscience then moves on to antiscience and starts employing astrologers to join the throng of \"astrobiologists\" and others who are just one small step away from ufologists, you might very well find some job openings to do astrological charts for \"outreach\" purposes.

	57785 : ["No, I agree that it seems worse TO YOU, because you just told us it seems worse to you. \"Much worse\" is a subjective term and varies depending on the person asked.

You stay home healing and relive that experience nightly and often during the day. Later, you get tested for STDs a second time and oh boy, you've got gonorrhea. You lock all the windows no matter how hot it gets inside and consider ignoring the mail because fetching it leaves you vulnerable for 60 seconds. You quit your job because you can't be out in the world without panicking. And so far, you never again date because that might lead to sex, even though you'd had a reasonably active and healthy sex life before, because you may never trust a man again, even after all this counseling.
