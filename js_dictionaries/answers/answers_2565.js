	134085 : ["Coyotes will only attack people if they are very sick or have become acclimated to them. If coyotes are in your yard, etc, they should be dealt with before they become a danger (i.e. someone should shoot them). A wild coyote in a rural area will not attack humans and it unlikely to come close to homes - they are naturally afraid of people. But predators that have gotten used to associating people with food via garbage cans, cat food left out, or tasty small pets in the yard, overcome their fear and can attack (like the rash of coyotes attacks recently in California - trapping and shooting them is almost outlawed so there is no safety valve on the population and troubled individuals in the population are not removed). Natural predator/prey cycles don't work in populated areas because there is always more prey available - livestock, pets, people - when the natural sources of prey diminish. The coyotes will continue to multiply and as natural food runs out and human sources don't, the conflicts will only escalate until someone gets killed or the coyote population is controlled through lowered disease resistance in a saturated population or in human culling. For the sake of everyone, provide a lethal deterrent to the coyotes. Any coyote who shows his face close to a house, especially in daylight, should be shot at. The coyotes will either learn to fear people again (as is best for everyone) or all the coyotes who remain fearless will end up dead.

Saying Coyotes are scavengers is like saying Hyenas are. Will they take a free meal if its there? Yes, but they still have to hunt to make up what they can't pick off another's kill.

	134087 : ["Actually the GSD wasn't developed as a mixture of other breeds.  Working herding dogs with a large percentage of wolf heritage were used as foundation stock.  As with sled dogs, crossings between working dogs and wolves was not uncommon especially before spaying was an option. Can you create a new breed out of existing breeds sure.  But it will take at least seven generations for such a line to breed true.  A plan to create a new breed would have to take into account the very large number of animals needed to start a stable gene pool and what's to be done with all the animals, particularly in the F2 and following generations who don't measure up to the breed standard.  They are in effect mutts and of little commercial value.  How would they be homed?  Would they displace other dogs, thereby increasing euthanization of healthy but unwanted dogs? You'd also need to do some extensive genetic research not only into the two breeds under consideration for mixing, but into the bloodlines of the specific individuals from each breed intended for use in the breeding program.  You'd want to select individuals that would each bring something valuable to the mix yet not bring something unhealthy.  For example, Dalmatians have been bred with urinary problems and Cocker Spaniels with missing tear ducts.  If you combine two breeds with similar health problems you don't have a diverse enough gene pool to select for healthy individuals. As a side note, the Dalmatian people have done some out crosses, or intentional breedings with non Dalmatians in order to bring in the genes needed to avoid the urinary problem.  Following generations from the outcross have been bred exclusively to Dalmatians so the resulting animals are now 99% Dalmatian, but without the bad urinary gene.  For all intents and purposes they are Dalmatians, but the parent club won't accept them for registration, choosing instead to maintain a known genetic disease. I'd have to have a pretty compelling reason to try to create a new breed, a compelling need that can't be met with existing breeds of stable gene pools.  It's a huge undertaking. Edited to add explanation of \"breeding true:\" A breed is said to \"breed true\" when you mate two similar dogs and produce a littler of similar dogs.  If you mate two first generation labradoodles, you get a wide variation within the (F2) litter.  Some pups will be rather more poodle-like and some rather more lab-like.  You have to cull from the breeding program any pup that doesn't look like the parent dog.  Then you breed two similar F2 generation dogs to produce the F3 generation.  Again you must cull those pups who do not closely resemble the parents, though hopefully there will be fewer over all that must be culled than in the F2 generation.  And so on.  It takes a minimum of seven generations to get litters consistently looking like the parents.", 11209, "n4pNNcGfaa", 1],

	134100 : ["If you are going to grow carnivorous plants then you need to do it right from the start. You can keep them outside in full sun or in a terrarium, but I recommend that you not keep them in thier origional container because their roots need room to grow and there is not enough air. Also, if you are going to keep them in a terrarium then make sure you do not put the terrarium in direct sunlight. What a lot of people do not know is that carnivorous plants do best outside in the open air and in full sun. They can be planted directly in the soil, but the poorer the soil the better.  They are cold tolerant up to 20 degrees and actually need to be winterized and go into hibernation in order to do well next season. If your temps drop below 20 then you can keep them in an unheated garage or garden shed. If you keep them in a terrarium then you can force them into hibernation or dormancy and I will give you the site that explains how to do this. As for watering, carnivorous plants are bog plants and their soil needs to stay moist all the times. If you grow them in a terrarium this should not be a problem, however, if you grow them outside you will need to place them in a saucer of water and make sure you keep the saucer full at all times. As for feeding them, check out the expertvillage video I've included and it will answer all your questions. carnivorous plant NoNos: No meat of any kind.
