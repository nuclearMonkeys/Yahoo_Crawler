	29843 : ["Sex is a big part of marriage and I don't know how else you'd determine that you're sexually compatible other than having sex to see if the chemistry is there and you're both into the same sex acts. But people for whom virginity is important often don't place that much emphasis on a satisfying marital sex life and I can respect that too as their personal priorities.¬†", 4622, "J3axFJ2Saa", 2],
	29844 : ["Hi, you need to re evaluate your relationship with her. Is she really the one for you? Are you doing your best to court her? Be very careful cos if you marry her, you will know her dark secrets and live with her for the rest of your life. Do think very carefully whether you wish to court her. Ask her friends and your friends whether you two are compatible. This is not a good sign that she rejected your marriage proposal. Is she a demanding lady?", 4617, "None", 1],

	29847 : ["Is English your first language? I ask because your first sentence uses really poor grammar. My online lover \"which we met a lot before...\" makes no sense.

	29849 : ["Yes it is true. Antidepressants have many side effects one of them being a decreased interest in sex, an inability to orgasm, impotency in men. Your gf needs to see her GP and have the medication reviewed. Sounds like these ones aren't working and are having negative side effects. There are different types of antidepressants out there and there may be another type that suits her better.", 4619, "vma2SI1Vaa", 0],
	29850 : ["she's depressed, dude.... YOUR GF IS DEPRESSED and is TRYING TO FIX IT. give her some credit.... it takes awhile to get the appropriate dosage/brand. she won't always be like this. in the mean time, get over yourself maybe?¬†", 4619, "None", 0],

	29854 : ["The idea that a proposal is some kind of ceremony that formalizes what has already been discussed and agreed to is a fairly recent development. Traditionally, a proposal is nothing more than an expression of the desire to marry. Viewed that way, the answer is obvious: the first to express that wish is the one who has proposed, unless they both just happen to do it at the same time.", 4604, "pimhIyYsaa", 0],
	29855 : ["Wearing an engagement ring is a personal choice. History shows that it was originally more about the woman than the man. It is just the symbol of love, devotion and affection that represents an emotional and lifetime commitment to your spouse prior to marriage. In some cultures and traditions it is advised for men and women to wear rings on the right hand during the engagement but the majority of men don't wear engagement rings in our society. It is a personal preference. Some people do not like to wear rings or any kind of jewelry and sometimes due to some practical reasons they do not want to wear engagement rings as they are working in certain career paths. So, wearing an engagement ring is an option for men.", 4623, "h2AMF9Ayaa", 1],

	29857 : ["TBH I'd prefer to spend that money as part of a down payment on a house. Jewelry is nice for those who like it and experiences create memories but in terms of daily life having a nice place to call your own supersedes those to me.¬†", 4620, "J3axFJ2Saa", 1],
	29858 : ["Cruise.. Just because I love travel and seeing different places.¬† I value experiences over material items. Though ..¬† I don't do cruises ..¬† I'd do a nice trip though. My guy though got me both a nice ring and a trip..¬† win win.", 4620, "5YfuWhLBaa", 1],

	29861 : ["Why are the two of you talking about grudges held for many years now? Let it go. Nobody is right to demand an invitation to someone's wedding or any other celebration, for that matter. By definition, its an \"invitation\".¬† I believe you have posted this more than once, so I'm wondering if you aren't satisfied with the answers you've received.

	29863 : ["As you ask what do I think, the dress to me is too much bling, bling.¬† I go for the more traditional white gowns (all about the virginal glow, ha); but, seriously the gown is so dramatic, it might take away from you and your happy face and focus on the dress.", 4606, "TVHItxGCaa", 0],

	29867 : ["If you aren't concerned about his financial responsibility or lack thereof, sure, go ahead and get married, and use anything that goes around your finger, or no rings at all. But if this is an indication of more, if he is seriously under funded and not able to provide for himself, much less you, perhaps you had better give this some more time and thought before jumping off the deep end. Bottom line isn't the rings,its whether the two of you can afford to be married at all and to be financially independent.¬†", 4599, "l3rcYSasaa", 1],

	29879 : ["I'm not a fan of fake stuff for centerpieces, because they're right in the guests' faces and most look cheap.¬† Obviously, high quality silk ones might be different, but they cost a lot more than real ones.¬† If this is the look you want, have you checked with a¬† florist on what they'd recommend?¬† ¬†Also, I assume you're just using this photo to show your plan.¬† As an actual wedding table, it's too long and narrow, and way too many centerpieces.¬†", 4621, "Ohcyim3Kaa", 0],

	29885 : ["I think it's a personal choice, if you want to have sex before marriage then fine. It's none of my business.

	29886 : ["The joke goes like this: 60% of people on antidepressants report it lowers their libido. The other 40% are lying. Yes, it certainly can. Being happy *before* she went on medication and being unhappy *now* doesn't make sense, though. If it's been a few months, she would be wise to tell her doctor what's going on. There's lots of medications she could try, and not every medication has this effect on every person.", 4619, "VNk20PROaa", 0],
