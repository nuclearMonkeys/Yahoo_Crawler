It sure is understandable as to why Moyes isn't every United fans first choice, but I've actually seen people claim that we'll finish as low as sixth if he takes over. That's just ridiculous.

Yeah, in our opinion (being Man Utd fans) he is the best manager football has ever had. It won't be easy for the next manager to walk into the job. Yet i think David Moyes is a great manager, consistent, proven in the Premier League. With the right transfer budget and assistance for the first season or two, i think he could do amazing things with United. You have to remember, many of the United fans on here have supported Man United all their life, and only known Fergie as manager. It's a shock and will be in the mindset that no manager is good enough. Cheers.", 8770, "0G3LCp2Daa", 0],

	74621 : ["I feel compelled to put my two cents worth into the mix. One thing that is confusing to people is the common error that Jews, as they are recognized today, are not the whole of the nation of Isreal .They are mostly from Judah with a smattering of  other tribes. God himself said he woud scatter His nation and they would be lost because of their disobedience.  There are prophesies about the various tribes that can't be gone into here. Gods promise to Abraham was that His descendants would be numbered as the stars and the sand. Can any man number the sands. There are lost tribes of Israel,  but God's promise was that He would have mercy on them band restore them to Himslf, for His glory. Many assume that they live in a gentile nation, but research the history and the prophecy and you may be surprised. As for Jews. gentiles and Christians.  \"All fall short of the glory of God\". I myself am a Christian that observes the Sabbath and the Holy Days as Christ and the new testament church did. I do not observe   because of the mixture of paganism and supposed Christianity.  One of the Jewish father's, David, wrote by inspiration of God in Psalm's 22 \"...they pierced My hands and My feet; I can count all My bones. They look and stare at Me. They look and stare at Me. They devide my garments among them, and for clothing they cast lots.\" Why is it that something that seems so clear to some is hidden from others as though a cloth was thrown over their eyes?  The apostle Paul (a Jew by birth) wrote in Romans 11 that God in part hardened Isreal that some branches may be cut from the tree that the Gentiles (who were unclean) might be grafted into the tree and saved. Their saving in turn would save those Isrealites who believe will be added back into the tree. I don't know why some who are Jewish say that those Jews who believe that Christ is the Messiah are not Jewish. They both believe in a Messiah, some believe He has come and will return to bring peace. Some believe He has not yet come. It gets confusing whether they are only looking at Jews as a religion or as a people. God spoke of the Jews as a people, His people who were given the promise of Abraham. Scripture is very clear (old and new testament) that despite their religious shortcomings and sins, God will fulfill His promise to them. That is the ultimate mercy, the ultimate glory of God.", 8772, "None", 2],

I support every choice equally except Mourinho, he is a great manager but his attitude and the way he's always trying to play mind games is just too much.

	74635 : ["OK, lets start with how you debase your own point before going into why your entire argument shows that you lack the knowledge to understand what universal health care means. The fact that you call universal health care \"pro-slavery\" is enough to remove you from your own argument.  By claiming that anyone who's pro universal health care is at the same time supportive of slavery shows a lack of willingness to take any sort of argument on this subject, hence you've probably stopped reading this by now.  It's not enslavement to add taxes onto the ones you have.  That's like saying that improving the schools in your neighborhood by raising taxes is slavery.  You call your opponents \"morons\" and \"Nazi thieves,\" without any sort of argument as to why.  Nazis, first of all, weren't socialists, and therefore would never have endorsed this system.   Now lets get into why what you're saying is neglectful of those who cannot afford health care.  You neglect all those people who come in with serious diseases such as tuberculosis and various flus, none of whom could have done a thing to prevent their diseases.  You ignore all those people who require broken bones to be set, who without that much can have dangerous and life threatening infections.  You stop any child whose parents cannot afford it from having post-delivery care, especially those who are born too early and require it to survive.  I could go on and on, talking about muscle damage that can't be repaired so people cannot go back to work, or how about a person who crosses the street and gets run down by a car that missed the red light, who then drives away?  You're ignoring all of them, all those people. By the way, is living one of those activities that result in sickness and injury?  Should people who cannot afford medical care not play sports at all, thereby forcing them into an unhealthy lifestyle that can lead to obeisity?  Should no one eat fast food at all, especially if they don't have time to return home to cook themselves a good meal?  Should the poor not have access to health care because they're poor?  Is a 5% rise in your taxes not worth the lives of other people?", 8773, "rttm1SLaaa", -1],
	74636 : ["Are Messianic Jews Jewish? No. A Jew who accepts Christianity might call himself a “Jewish Christian,” but he is no longer a Jew[1]. He can no longer even be counted as part of a Jewish congregation[2]. Conversion to another faith is an act of religious treason in Judaism. It is one of the worst possible sins that a Jew can ever commit. Along with murder and incest, it is one of the three cardinal sins which may not be violated even under pain of death. [3] It's a big deal. Rabbi Moses Isserles demanded a formal conversion back to Judaism for those who converted out of Judaism but who then wanted to return to Judaism.

	74648 : ["I have read the bible, both the new and old testament; it's why I'm an atheist. Jesus was into politics, it's the reason he was killed. Conservatives want the smallest government possible, everyone knows we need some government, we need a defense, we need laws that allow free trade between the states, we need laws that cross state lines. All of which are in the Constitution, but right now the Federal Government has take many of the powers reserved for the state , but that's another story. I'll take your points one by one. Who you can or can't marry has two parts to that, a religious one and a state one. On the religious end, you can marry anyone you wish there are many churches that will marry anyone or a groups of people to each other, so no problem there as government if forbidden in almost all cases from interfere with religion. But such a marriage may or may not be recognized by the government. The government recognized marriage is slightly different, and the question that you should be asking is what business does the government have in regulating marriage at all? The only concern the government has, in my opinion, is the production and raising new citizens in the cheapest way passable. A man and a woman will generally produce new citizens, ie make babies. In the past, not that long ago really, children were raised by mom while dad worked, and the government provided that this union should get special treatment because one person isn't working outside of the home.  This has changed over time now that the norm is both people work.  . This really wasn't that big of an issue unit the government stated handing out entitlements SSI, without the entitlements and a few other benefits marriage wouldn't be an issue. Other benefits such as insurance, are on the employer and they set the rules on who can and can't be on the policy, although they tend to use marriage to determine if an adult can be added to the policy or not.      When you say what a woman can do with her body, I'm assuming you mean abortion, which beg the question of when does citizenship with all its rights begin?  At conception  or when life can be sustained outside of the female body? Most religions already have well established rules on when life begins, and if your argument is purely religious then you lost because not every religion believes that way, and according to the Constitution the government can't pick on religion over another. Now if  you argument is that life is sustainable at x weeks and an abortion can't be preformed after that time because of the damage it would cause another person, who could live outside the body but would be damaged, then you have a chance of passing that into law. Basically when doesn't a person have the RIGHTS of a citizen? BTW Jesus never said the GOVERNMENT should take care of the poor, he said YOU should help them not the government. So he was for YOU helping people, no pushing others to do it. So Jesus didn't look toward the government to help others, he looked at the people around him and told them to help the poor and sick directly.", 8776, "59dd14ff295f773fb9a66a4d4df7e604aa", -1],
