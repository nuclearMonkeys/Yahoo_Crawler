	82862 : ["Best Answer - Chosen by Asker Global warming is at the fore front because politicians found how to use a new platform to get re-elected. The world leaders use it because they found ways to make money at it. This is a made up problem just like Global Cooling in the 1970's. Wake up people. I agree we need to be more efficient with our resources, and we should fine and jail companies who are dumping into our rivers maliciously. I want to stop the raiforest destruction, but to say that global warming is a serious man made issue and we need to destroy the American economy and bow down to the rest of the world certainly does not float my boat. Follow the money on this one and you will see that it is all for political gain and grant money for those scientists who profit off of the government if global warming stays at the front of the issues. Look deep into the Keoto (sp?) Treaty, first of all they took jets to a non-central resort location. Not very environmentally concious. THen in the parameters of the treaty they have a clause that makes it so you can buy or sell polution credits. This is all about shifting wealth and breaking down the United States. This is painfully obvious, just look at peoples agenda. The earth's mean temperature has risen .6 degrees C in the past 125 years. Greenland's icecaps have gotten colder in the past 10 years. The Scientists who do not gain anything on their posisition will tell you that the earth has a natural progression and this is what we are seeing. The UN report is made up of POLITICIANS not a good spread of scientists. THere are as many or more scientists who believe that man in NOT the reason and it is over hyped, but their voice is not heard in the LIberal Mainstream Media. This issue is 99% political, and an attempt to make the USA a socialist nation, and eventually communisim. WAKE UP AMERICA, IT IS TIME TO BE AMERICANS. FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE. STOP THE LIES", 9110, "iI1TX7vnaa", -2],
	82863 : ["I could go on forever on this, but don't have the time...  So I'll keep it brief with my biggest points. 1st of all, the world is billions of years old, about 4.5billion. 4,500,000,000 years old Man has been taking temperatures of the world for only around 300years.  The is 0.000006% of the Earth's lifetime.  The blink of an eye in a human life! 300years ago, there were no electronic devices.  A man with a flame torch had to go walking, sometimes miles at a time in freezing temperatures to go to the weather recording post.  Don't you think sometimes maybe he thought he couldn't be bothered, and made it up based on previous? The world often goes through climate change, it is natural, what do you think carved out the Grand Canyon?  ICE! Today we are actually coming out of a MINI ice age, which has been going on for approximately 60years. When people quote these heat waves, its always, \"hottest day for 100years\" or \"hottest day since the 60's\"... well that isn't really long ago is it!  Which means it has been hotter within the time we have actually taken temperatures. SOME ice caps are melting, the ones you hear about.  Some are actually expanding in northern Europe!  It takes a LOT more than just temperature to change Icebergs, research it! Europe used to be tropical!  USED to be, what made it cold?   We've also had many IceAges, what warmed the world up then?  Did the Ice Age Men use too many aerosols? Basically the list continues.. there is loads of evidence far outweighing the Global Warming so called \"evidence\".  It just doesn't make good news, Global Warming is fasionable! Global Warming is exaggerated by governments to keep people undere control...  The people of the world \"need\" things to campaign against & worry about.  It also takes their minds off more serious matters like war, disease and poverty.  I am not denying that Man needs to do their bit to \"help\" the planet, but we are not \"helping\" the planet, we are helping ourselves.  Man lives on this planet, if the planet changes its because it's natural.  The world will not die because of us, it will happily continue its life!  WE may die because of it though... These facts CAN be backed up, the research is there, but like I say, no one wants to advertise it, its not fasionable news!", 9110, "None", 1],

I am not saying we have not caused local warming. Just look at Phoenix Arizona. The addition of concrete and black top has caused a mini heat dome over the city. But the primary cause is heat retention due to the concrete and black top. This is exaggerated by the fact Phoenix is in a valley and the heat is not able to dissipate.", 9110, "None", 0],
	82877 : ["Personally I was a believer until I read Michael Crichton's \"State of Fear\". While it is obviously a work of fiction, the claims that the characters make are based on real scientific research, and Crichton gives the source for each quote. This book opened my eyes and made me start looking a bit deeper into the subject. My first recommendation is to look at the following link. It is a speech by Michael Crichton where he talks about how disasters get exaggerated. Read it first to open your eyes about how we have been mislead in the past. Even the climate scientists themselves are saying that there is a lot of scare-mongering going on. What finally turned me into a full-blown non-believer was this series of articles by Christopher Monckton. He was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher on science scams. His basic technique was to look at the actual scientific data itself and then judge how it had been represented. If the reported version was about middle-of-the-road compared to the scientific data, then it was deemed to be fair. If, however, the reported version always gave the most extreme figures possible, and in only one direction, then it was not to be trusted. Here are his conclusions... Be sure to read his references and detailed calculations. Important stuff in here too - especially about the infamous \"hockey-stick\" graph. Interestingly, Al Gore, of \"An Inconvenient Truth\" infamy, wrote a letter to the Telegraph trying to dismiss Monckton's views. Here is Monckton's reply... Any open-minded person who reads all of the above will have what they 'think' they know about global warming shaken to the core. They will suddenly realise the following... All scientists agree about global warming? - Not true. It's been proved that CO2 is the cause of global warming? - Not true. The Earth has never been this warm before? - Not true. The Arctic is warmer than it's ever been before? - Not true. The Antarctic ice is melting? - Not true. Polar Bears are dying due to global warming? - Not true. New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina were caused by global warming? - Not true. Etc, etc. For me, the big turning point was the \"hockey-stick\" graph. You take one look at that graph and you can't help but think; \"Wow! Look at that! We *must* be causing global warming!\"  But when you learn the truth about it... That the medieval warm period and pre-industrial little ice age were deleted so that the graph from 1000AD to 1850AD would look flat. That the data that produced the shape of graph they were trying to make was given 390 times more weight than any other data. And that the computer model used to create the graph will produce hockey-stick graphs even if random data is put in. (See page 9 of Monckton's references that has a beautiful graphic showing 7 random data graphs and 1 with the real data - see if you can spot the \"real\" one.) ... you suddenly realise that you've been lied to. Oh, and it's probably worth pointing out that, in the IPCC's 2001 report, the \"hockey-stick\" graph was the *only* graphic shown *six* times. And they have still not apologised for the fact that it's flawed. Now, I don't know about you, but when I find that someone has been lying to me, I tend to be a bit suspicious of them. Especially when they want to use those lies as an excuse to tax me more!", 9110, "a85bd4d28281b52b7bdecfc33cd65da3aa", -1],
	82878 : ["Because he is not going to get any more of the voting base in this round of primaries than he got in 2008. The guy is not going to win a State primary, much less come close to the nomination. The 2008 primary fielded one of the weakest slate of candidates the Republicans ever produced and Ron Paul was on the bottom of that list. There are a lot better choices this go-round so he is not going to go far. I absolutely love his views on fiscal/monetary issues and fully support him on those, but his socially liberal views and his weakness on national defense are not compatible with mine, or the overwhelming majority of the voters in the Republican primaries. Additionally, his supporters are some of the most obnoxious and annoying people I have ever encountered. Any consideration I have for the guy goes away when I hear/read what they have to say. The guy has the support of people who want drugs legalized, homosexual marriage legalized, and pacifists. That is not a core constituency of the Republican party.

	82879 : ["Almost daily we hear about Ron Paul, in fact he's run twice before, and his numbers weren't encouraging for him.  Like a lot of those candidates on the right, he's big in his district, but nationally his stance on civil rights doesn't resonate will enough people to make him a reasonable contender. His positions on women's right don't play well in the larger pool either. The media will pay attention to buzz, and Paul doesn't now and never will have it. Gingrich has buzz now for all the wrong reasons, his senior staff left. Romney stuck his foot in it when he went against the current Republican tide about health care, he's not going anywhere within the party either.  In fact what appeals to the right wing of the party, is looked on with reserved horror by the mainstream Republicans who are losing influence in 'their' party.  And the right wing will make itself happy with someone the nation won't vote for.  I don't think the Republicans want the White House this cycle, I didn't think they wanted it last time.  There isn't much a president can do for now to make it all better, and they will wait it out for 2016 and hope things are looking up and they can slide in on that note rather than deal with the difficulty they can blame Obama for that Bush left.", 9116, "5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa", -3],

Big mistake to put Paul down as he has been for decades a voice to all and the financial networks agree and love to have him on cause he is always on the \"money\".  The legislation in 2001 on \"piracy\" should be done now.  Fortunately the bill about the Fed is gaining and he has over 50 on his side now and I figure it will grow.   I look at people that don't understand him as not knowing him and wouldn't do what the repbu media did and put them down, if they get educated the more they like him.   It's like it would have gone way better if he had been given a little more respect during the debates and not mocked by some of the others. when he made historically correct statements.
