	82224 : ["I can definitely see the logic.  So many people these days are content to just let the military do the dirty work. They are safe in their homes, far removed from the cost of war, from the stress to families, and from the cost to the public. They pay their taxes like they normally do, but have NO clue how much goes to defense and military spending and wars.  I think adding the cost of the war to American paychecks via its own seperate tax is, in a way, a good idea. Maybe if more Americans started seeing how costly it is, they would be less likely to support the use of firearms as a first strategy, and more likely to reserve it for times when our country is ACTUALLY in danger.  If you support the war and want to see America succeed....you wouldn't have an issue paying the war tax would you? And if you do support America and the war but don't want to pay for it, then you're just like all the other Americans who want things, but don't want to actually sacrifice anything for it.  Military families have been sacrificing way more than a 1% tax. I think footing a bill for a war you support is an excellent idea. And if you don't want to support the war, then all the more reason for Americans to stand up and not just sit idly by being complacent with what the government is doing. Edit: To all of you saying you don't support the tax because you don't support the war...EXACTLY. Maybe paying the price out of your pocket is what it takes for people to actually stand up for something. It's a known fact that people rarely stand up for anything unless it involves their money. The TEA parties are an excellent example. Americans just don't care until it hits them where it hurts: pocketbook.

	82251 : ["Your comparison is unequal to the situation we are facing today.  If you want to make an AGW / poisonous food comparison, it would have to go more like this.   The situation is that you have to eat or you will starve.  You have one type of fish in front of you that has a 10% chance of being poisonous.  There is also another type of fish in the room.  It might be poisonous or it might not and even if it is, you do not know how poisonous it might be.  There could be a 100% chance that it is poisonous.  If you knew more about fish, you might be able to identify if the other fish was poisonous but at this point, you do not know enough about fish.  Which food would you eat.  Remember, you have to eat one because you will starve if you don't.  I think anyone in their right mind would eat the fish that has only a 10% chance of being poisonous.  You would be taking a much bigger risk eating the other food. The reason I restated your hypothetical situation, is that this is closer to the situation we are in today.  Because of the way our societies are built, we must have a constant and plentiful energy source or countless people will die.  As other people have pointed out, fossil fuels at the present are generally the best overall way to accomplish our energy needs.  Other forms might be better for the environment, but they are too expensive, dangerous, costly or impractical to implement or it would have happened by now.  I say let the free market work.  Offer governmental incentives and tax breaks to companies that develop viable alternate energy sources.  Keep in mind that it will happen, but it takes time.  People don't want to do things, which could hurt the environment, but they are left with little choice at the present.  If a viable energy source is developed, you won't need to talk people into switching to it.  They will do it on their own because it is cheaper, therefore making their life easier.  You cannot deny that money is the best motivator.  The most powerful instinct in humans is survival, so anything that makes survival easier, will motivate people.  Trying to force something on people, when they see it as hampering their ability to survive, will only build a wall of resistance.  It is basic human psychology.  We can pass all the environmental laws we want in an effort to discourage things that hurt the environment, but it is hardly the best way to go about it.

Until we do, we have no idea how our actions might effect things.  You should never act irrationally out of fear.  Look at what is happening because of ethanol.  If their was ever an irrational actions based on fear, this was a perfect example.  Ethanol from corn is a horrible idea, yet people pushed it because it was environmentally responsible.  People are now starving around the world because we have offset a whopping three percent of all fossil fuels used by auto's in America.  Was it worth it?  Was it the right action?  Would it have been better to wait until we totally understand what is happening before we made rash decisions that hurt people? \"I liken this to eating a dish that has a 10% chance of being deathly poisonous. Would you really risk your life & possibly those of your fellow quests by continuing to eat this dish? Or would you simply switch to a more known quantity that is definitely healthy?\" I wouldn't want to risk their life, but I wouldn't switch to another food in which I had no idea of the poisonous content.  That is what you are proposing.  What if the new unknown food has a 50% of being deadly?  That's right.  You would have been better off staying with the fish that was only 10% dangerous. \"As a side not I already know that the way we are influencing the climate has a 100% deadly poisonous effect.\" That's surprising, considering that their is still so much debate in the science community.
