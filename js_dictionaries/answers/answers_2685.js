I think it is good for the industry that there is competition, I think even Vince is relishing it. For a long time WWE had no one to be compared to and was becoming stale. With Christian jumping to TNA it made WWE sit up and take notice of what was happening over there. I think Christian made a good decision, he was one of the most talented all round superstar's WWE had. His battles with Chris Jericho were great (my pick for best match of Wrestlemania 20). And yet he was constantly overlooked. With Kurt Angle joining TNA now it should really bring them to a bigger audience.
