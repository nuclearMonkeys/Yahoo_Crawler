	75573 : ["Yikes, well, As much as you don't like his wife, if you love and have any respect for your son then you have to value his descision and respect the choice that he has made in a wife. no matter how much it bothers you he obviously loves her and you are making his love for you die because you are putting down the girl he chose to be with forever and most likely will be with forever. Your first step is to apologize. send a letter to him and to his wife.. Send one each to each of them. You need to learn to accept and not be so ... idk childish. I'm not trying to be rude but if my mom did this to me about my husband I'd cut her out of my life too. Actually just recently my grandma who is close to me has been doing this to me about my husband. she doesn't like him and she has told me so and It just made me look at her with disgust and resentfulness. Now i'm done with her. She Crossed the line and She is no longer family to me. She has no right to say anything and i'm a big girl! I know how to take care of myself and what is good for me and what isn't. And i know how to walk away if i feel like i need better.. and the only person i felt that from was her not my husband. So I dropped her like a hot iron. Not to mention she has done this to every person in my family, and now she wonders why she is alone with my papa... He puts up with her but idk how he does it. IF you love someone you don't overpower them and tell them you hate or despise who they love. This woman is the mother of your son's child.... YOu need to find away to turn her into a human being and not a hated object and love her. Obviously she has something good in her to be able to keep him happy and to be a mommy. IF you love your son and want him in your life and his family then you need to step up, put down your hateful ways and change. Life doesn't last forever ... and you'll be sorry if you never put yourself down so you can have them in your life. But If i was him, I would not want to talk to you either. I know how he feels exactly and I don't blame him. I think its all very sad. Plus you have no idea what happens between them. maybe he says things to her too. Its really none of your business. Its his marriage and his business and his life. if you want to be a part of it then do what you need to do and write letters to them, apologize, admit you were wrong and that if they could possibly consider letting you be apart of their lives you would love nothing more to be apart of both of their lives. BOTH is the key word. They are one now. and if you can't do this and be genuine about it, honestly... you will probalby never see your son again .... which would be such a waist.. and if he still says no after you apologize and try really hard, then at least you can say you tried with all your heart... but gosh, i can't express enough how sick of parents i am like you doing this to your sons and daughters.. HOW DARE YOU! if you don't stop you deserve to be alone. I will never speak to my grandma again. and i kow that ***** won't change because she has done it to all her children and now shes starting in on the grandchildren. she's a rotten person. and i dont' even know if i love her anymore. and if you've hurt your son as much as my grandma hurt me, you can guarantee he feels the same way about you i feel about her.   I'm not trying to hurt you, i'm trying to help you. I swear it. I think this is sad. and i'm being brutally honest so that maybe it will make some sort of a diff. but if you take this as an insult and just be a wet rag about it, then good riddance youlll never get what you want lady.", 8808, "VuAmX5e6aa", 1],

In the earthly sense, I believe people without morals, those that do anything they want, to whomever they want, without thought that they may cause harm to another, and without conscience is freer than those that feel the need to restrain themselves because they simply CARE. They are freer because there is nothing holding them back from living how they want to live. However, in the spiritual sense, they are actually in bondage because they are storing up accusations against themselves.  There is a bottle in heaven filled with all the tears they have caused to fall and all the pain they have caused another and they will have to answer to the Most High.  In this respect, they are actually in bondage because one day when this life is over they won't get to enjoy heaven.  But God has called us to peace. I envy them sometimes, but I am different.  I would be ridden with guilt to know that I have caused others to lay down their head and cry; that I have caused emotional pain on another person.  I don't want that burden, so I am free from that because I care. The key word is 'care'.  If you don't care what you have done, then you are actually free to live and be merry in ignorance.

I wonder...Let me tell you what very often goes on in the mind of \"real ladies\" (since you apparently don't know) Sex is but one hour out of 24 hours a day AT BEST.  If you make it the focus of your love and devotion and life?  I guarantee you will FAIL big time.  You can only \"spice\" it up so much...The real glue that keeps men and women loving really does have to do with self-respect and good values - and respect for their mate and the MATURITY it takes to commit and be responsible instead of playing games on the asinine FACEBOOK website in lookiing for \"flings\" and deceiving others as you may well be - being deceived yourself.  C'mon now, wise up and grow up...Kid stuff...GOOD marriages have integrity BECAUSE mature couples \"get\" they've committed, \"get\" that they don't always have \"4th of July\" fireworks with sex and further?  Understand there is a far deeper commitment that goes on daily, monthly, yearly as they grow together as a  couple and individually in their lives. Yeah.  I thought you might not understand all this.  What are you, 20 or 30 something?  Yeah.  I surmise if you don't understand what constitutes a solid relationship - a committed relationship - you'll never have one...No doubt about it. Grace", 8806, "LVlS4y7Caa", 2],
	75587 : ["If my Husband gets tired of it then that just means he wants me to do all the work. When there's no action going on that just means the both of us are tired and don't want to initiate it so we go to bed without it. It's not so bad, we need our \"alone\" times. We can be tired of each other for various reasons, but none that will give us the time to think about wanting to be with other people. We know what we want we're not confused naive little kids. We're married for a reason if we wanted to be with other people we wouldn't have legalized our union and be 100% committed to one another, including the responsibilities of raising our children.  So we're going at it over a decade already, 13 years to be exact, things are lovely and smooth as ever. If any chance down the road it changes, I'll take it as it is and move on with my life. I can't control his actions but I can give him the love that he deserves which if it doesn't suffice for a man to be loyal then the man doesn't deserve me.

	75589 : ["Well, he is doing his duty as a husband and father and putting his wife and child first.  If he feels that you will disrespect his wife, it makes sense that he would try to protect her from that. That being said, if what you say has happened is true, he is likely blinded by love or insecure, or both.  A verbally abusive environment is not the place for a child.  For that reason, I suggest you write your son a letter and attempt to make amends with each of them,  Apologize for your behavior (not your feelings) and ask about trying again.  Express that you would really like to see the baby.  If and when they do respond, stick to your plan, and be cordial to her.  If she says something you dislike, bite your tongue.

For him to not invite you to the wedding speaks volumes about where you have been in your son's life for years! I'm sure you told him in no uncertain terms that his choice in a wife is sub-par. Not only did you dishonor him and disrespect him, but you also sent the wedge deep to your new DIL that you are supposed to love and cherish like your own children.  You've had 5 years to be the parents to these children and all you've provided is disrespect. You've earned your place in in their lives.  \"How's that work'n for ya?\"  And so.........how is this supposed to be mended? It's called \"forgiveness\" and you have got to find the strength to get on your knees before your children and ask them to forgive you for what you've said and done.  And it goes both ways.

If Christ had not been born, I'm pretty sure GOD would have probably gotten tired of all of us sinning regularly down here, and flooded the place again, just like back when Noah was around. Thank GOD Christ did come. His sacriface redeemed us from not only the original sin of Adam & Eve, but also every sin that humanity has ever committed, will ever commit, and so on. That doesn't give us a license to sin as much as we want, but there's a certain freedom in knowing that I've been freed from that. I am a Non-Denominational Christian. My faith is based solely on research from the bible, minus the man-made doctrine, which is fallacy. According to my beliefs, when you die, you fall asleep until Christ returns. After he returns, those that believe in their heart and confess Romans 10:9&10 will go to Heaven. Those that don't will be judged by GOD. At that point you will either end up in Paradise, or will end up in Hell. GOD has the final say. It may not be what you necessarily believe, but it is what is in the bible.

I don't know on the first, and not necessarily on the second.  God will judge each of us perfectly, as only He can.  Just because you profess to be a Christian, does not mean you love Him.  As for being an atheist, only He sees the fullness of your life.  You can show God you love Him by loving His children, that much is true.  Jesus died for your sins as well as mine, so you can be forgiven, same as me.  Someday, you'll see the truth, maybe even after you die, who knows, and then you'll decide you love Him or don't.  And don't think it will be an easy decision, or that you can fool Him.  That faced with Hell, you'll choose Him.  The Devil didn't.
