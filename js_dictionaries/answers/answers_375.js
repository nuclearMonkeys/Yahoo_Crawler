But I've had the privilege of having some close friends who grew up in cultures where the first car they ever touched was one with a steering wheel on BOTH sides of the vehicle (driving instructor mod).  Steering for them is (surprisingly?) not a natural instinct at all.  It is something that they literally have to give a lot of thought to, and agonize over getting it right or wrong... Even if you grew up in a car culture and think you SHOULD know better, don't beat yourself up too bad if your first attempts at steering are a bit sloppy.  We all have to start somewhere.  Practice makes perfect...", 3336, "rCZe4XUxaa", 0],
