They spreaded to the south, toward the Balkans invading the Albanian lands. However Kosovo was always populated by Albanians. Only by ethnic cleansing the Serbs managed to move to Kosovo and have small settlements there (they make up only 5-6% of the population in Kosovo) Kosovo has been under the Ottoman empire just as all other Balcan nations were, Serbs included. Before the start of WWI, in 1913, Balkans just came out of the Balcanic wars which were done in order to reshape the boundaries of Balcans after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The great powers unjustly gave for the first time Kosovo to Serbia as a political deal (Serbia had the support of Russia as they are both slavic nations) despite the upraising of the Albanians aginst this unjust division of the Albanian lands. Historical facts left alone, if you like, the recent reality showed that Serbs denigrated and governed Kosovo with shovinism and terror. A lot of ethnic cleansing happened ever since Kosovo has been under Serbia. Many people killed, Albanian woman raped in order to change the ethnic composition of the population in Kosovo. A much uglier and barbar form of Apartheid happened there. If you know about South Africa Apartheid...  The indipendence of Kosovo is a merited solution, an unjust theft that Europe had in its conscience for the last 90 years. And Albanians have celebrated it with tears of joy.

	103463 : ["POpulation growth is something that Doomsday fanatics have been talking about for years. It was once believed that the Human population could not exceed 4 billion because there wouldn't be enough space on Earth for everyone to live and still be able to eat or even breath. Currently the population is around the 6 billion mark and I for one can still breath and there's still food. In fact there's feilds that are being left fallow for the next year or two so a higher quality of food can be produced. We as a spiecis have the ability to think and plan for future events. No other animal has that ability or at least to the extent that we have. A squirle for example isn't storing nuts because it knows winter is coming and has to make sure it has enough for the whole winter, like a nut a day. It stores food because it's programed into it's DNA and instincts. I've recently read reports, not by a single \"scientist\" but ones that were published by a large group that actually really researched the situation and came up with the model that if we DO NOT improve our current food, housing and basic scientific understanding, that the Human population can reach about 12 billion before we reach serious problems. So it takes us about 10 years to grow by a billion and that's not counting the fact that the world population is rather top heavy meaning that there are alot more old people than young ones. Honestly there will be problems that pop up, no one will see them coming and they will be eventually delt with.

	103464 : ["It is true and only common sense. It is impossible to have infinite population growth with finite resources in a closed environment. We have been able to continue expanding our population in the past due to technology.  However, even with technology, there is a finite limit to the number of organisms that can live in a closed environment. Recently, the discovery of oil has been the resource that has enabled our population to explode.  The world economy is essentially the process of converting fossil fuels into food.  Think about it.  Oil drives the machines that plant and harvest and transport food.  Fertilizer is derived from oil products.  Once the oil goes, the population goes. The only possible way for humanity to continue increasing population is if we were to expand to other planets.  That's not going to happen without a united humanity.  Unfortunately, as oil begins to dwindle, rather than humanity uniting, it will divide as nations go to war for the last remaining remnants of oil supplies. Eventually, the human population will crash once the age of oil comes to a close.  That should bring the population of humanity back to historical levels of around 200 million people.  This assumes we don't fight a catastrophic nuclear war over the dwindling oil supplies.", 9851, "RYNlAF2eaa", 1],

If we are to face the many threats arrayed against we need a major investment in our armed forces.

The USA calls the tune and we have to dance along just in case we need their help when we get in a spot of bother. The UN is also the reason we got into Iraq as well.

	103484 : ["Because they work for George Soros, or they concur with his far left ideas! The liberal news did cover the tea parties, but only to put them down as right wing extremists linked to Fox News. George Soros Open Society and Open Borders James H. Walsh Tuesday, July 25, 2006  George Soros uses a vast network of special interest groups and non-governmental organizations, in the United States and abroad, to support his global objective — a one-world government. Open borders are a stepping stone in his efforts to put into action his open-society philosophy. What form will a one-world government take? Not surprisingly it will be a billionaire oligarchy. What sort of billionaire? To begin with, try one George Soros. Soros provided the following definition of an open society in his article, \"The Capitalist Threat,\" in the February 1997 \"Atlantic Monthly\": \"Societies derive their cohesion from shared values . . . religion, history, and tradition. When a society does not have boundaries where are the shared values to be found? . . . the concept of the open society itself.\" In the intervening years, his more-than-generous financial support of a society without boundaries has contributed to the current open-borders immigration crisis being experienced by the United States, his adopted homeland. The Open Society Institute is the cornerstone for the Soros Foundations Network, a group of Soros-funded organizations in more than 50 countries, which promote open-society concepts by influencing governmental policies. The various branches and paid instrumentalities of the network include Democracy Alliance, MoveOn.org, America Coming Together, America Votes, The Center for American Progress, and other leftist front organizations, which advocate open borders for the United States — not for other nations but for the United States. These Soros-funded groups finance his camp followers, among them the Democratic Party, the National Organization of Women, abortion advocacy groups, various environmental groups, and last but not least, the increasingly powerful immigration special interest groups.", 9845, "Ca8i226Xaa", 0],

So when snake's count increases. Vultures feed upon it. This is just an example. In the history if we see lots of calamities are witnessed. These are shock treatment to human to act without greed and selfishness.To reduce imbalance, the nature's tolerable limit exceeds it gives away these calamities the actual cause being man made. These calamities creates a fear in the affected man, however when the time passes, he forgets the past and once again greed creeps in. This is cyclical.
