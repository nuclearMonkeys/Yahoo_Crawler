I don't think you need to worry about her getting enough Vitamin D in your breast milk but I'm not a doctor so I would check with either her pediatrician or the great folks at Le Leache League (you can find them online or in the phone book).  They used to help me answer questions I had when I was a new mom.  Also, the wonderful people at the March of Dimes are great at answering questions too.

	98589 : ["You are getting bogged down in details (as do a lot of Christians). What matters is Jesus. God the Father said so, and the Holy Spirit came to reveal Him to us. Jesus is the express revelation of the Father, like the image we see of the sun is the express revelation of the sun. Jesus and the Father are One. The Holy Spirit is that oneness. Three individuals; one God, revealed in the person of Jesus Christ. Nothing matters but Jesus, and Jesus is all in all I think, though, that Christians often do worship different gods. Some worship the bible and some worship doctrines. Others worship the new testament \"law,\" made up from all the accumulated misunderstandings of NT \"commandments.\" Some worship the church (or at least they live for it) and some worship family or money or possessions or power. Of course, people who worship these things may be Christians, but they are not followers of Jesus. How could they be?

No there aren't different versions of jesus, just people with strong opinions. Many things are up for discussion in the bible but the basic concept of accepting christ as your savior and spending forever with him should be quite clear.

I absolutely hate the idea of authority. People should be free. To that end, I don't want to ever feel like I'm bossing a girl around or that she thinks I'm making her do something she doesn't want to do. On the other hand, I value my own freedom, and especially since a lot of the complaints guys have about dominant females is that they don't \"let\" their bf hang out with his friends, etc - any girlfriend ever tells me to choose between her or my friends, I'm gone. So I would much rather find a relationship in which we can both be happy with one another The people I know who have pulled this type of relationship off are the people who were just good friends for a while before they started dating.

	98605 : ["The actual water intoxication (called \"hyponatremia\") part was probably (relatively) painless.  The person probably just passed out and never awoke.  However, getting to the point of water intoxication can be quite painful.  It really depends on how it happened. If the person simply drank too much water (which is highly unlikely), there's a good chance the person experienced intense stomach and abdominal pain, due to the huge amount of water they had to ingest.  Vomiting was most likely involved, since the stomach isn't designed to hold that much liquid. If the intoxication happened as a result of prolonged, rigorous exercise without replenishment of electrolytes and salts, stomach pain would again be experienced.  However, if this were the case, they would also have experienced intense muscle pain (an aching), increasing as the salt content of their blood decreased.  Normally, this pain causes one to stop exercising and become very hungry or thirsty, since the body wants to replenish the salt. Most cases of hyponatremia are caused by a combination of the two: drinking too much water during prolonged exercise.  Hyponatremia is quite rare, but unfortunately, its effects are irreversible.  By the time you know something is seriously wrong, your chances of survival are severely diminished. A good way to avoid hyponatremia is to drink plenty of fluids while exercising.  At least one litre of fluid per hour of exercise is a good rule of thumb.  Also, make sure the fluid you're drinking contains electrolytes or natural salts and sugars.  100% fruit juice is a very good choice.  Gatorade or Powerade are also good.  This will help ensure your blood sodium and blood sugar levels are at their optimum levels.  It will also help you get the most benefit from your workout.", 9666, "AA11578892", 1],

	98620 : ["That's a 2-part question.  I'll just stick to the first part -- and by no means do I think I have all the answers -- just a lot of \"what ifs...\"I find it amusing that people who know close to nothing about molecular/cellular biology, are convinced Mary absolutely *had* to have had intercourse or somehow had vulvar exposure to some human pre-***. Not necessarily. In fact, it's highly unlikely *but* entirely biologically/medically possible that the historic Jesus of Nazareth was the product of a \"virgin birth.\"  Any responsible scientist will admit there is more about the world that we *don't* know than we know. So here we go...Be forewarned, if you can't wrap your mind around transgender issues, don't read on...First, know there is a difference between \"genotype\" (our genetic code) and \"phenotype,\" (how the code is expressed/played out).  At some point in each of our embryogenesis, we each develop bipotential gonads that over time differentiate into either testes (46,xy) or ovaries (46,xx).Mary--Immaculately Conceived by her mother through the Grace of God, and free from Original Sin--could have been  46,XX (genotypically and phenotypically \"female\") with *gonadal mosaicism* (gonads that are part testes, part ovaries). We see it --granted, very rarely--in the real world today.  If she were a true hermaphrodite, she would have looked and self-identified as female.  Next, it is theoretically possible that she could have had a fusion of neighboring 23,xy and 23,xx germ cells to make a 46,XY genetic male (Jesus), or have undergone parthenogenesis, the asexual method of reproduction seen in other species in the world today.  If this were the case, she may have been able to later become impregnated by Jospeh.  Another option is that Mary was a 46,XY with testosterone insensitivity and (so will look and self-identify as female) AND have persistent mullerian duct syndrome -- just enough to carry a pregnancy after undergoing parthenogenesis.  If this latter situation were the case, she would not have been able to have been fertilized by Joseph, and Jesus's \"brothers\" may have more likely been his cousins. Regardless, I think it is entirely possible that the historic Jesus of Nazareth was 100% genotipically from the Virgin Mary, and 100% spiritually from the King of David and his Hebrew God, the Most Holy and Glorious YHWH.", 9668, "qwXn0lr9aa", 0],

	98631 : ["Dear friend, the matter is not how your sisters looks like, but your use of the ideas of \"white\", \"black\", and \"race\", as if they were real discriminatory elements between people. I still keep wondering why so many people still use the word \"race\", especially in America. The concept of human race has been declared biologically unfounded and was banned by the scientific community already in 1950, with the Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice issued by UNESCO. This means that the concept of race is totally unjustified and incorrect, scientifically and morally. Who still keeps using it proves his ignorance and narrow-mindedness. Even if you claim to not be racist, the mere fact of using the word \"race\" reveals a discriminatory attitude. There are no racial differences between human beings, since there are no races. The only differences between us are cultural. For instance, even between groups inside a single nation (like White and African-Americans), the main difference is not color, but culture, history, character. Without any doubt, your sister bears the genetic heritage of an ancestor with darker skin, which could have been African, but also Arab, Latin-American or Southern Italian. Genetically speaking, it is the same for you, your brothers and at least one of your parents, even though you do not show that genetic character. And so what? I keep writing that the problem is not her look, but the wrong mentality that surrounds you. And perhaps even your own mentality, or that of your sister herself. It is evident that this wrong mentality is the enemy that you and your sister must fight against. She shouldn't be allowed to suffer for the color of her skin: it is absurd and humiliating. She should radically erase from her life these nonsense matters of race and look. She should strongly stand against any offensive behavior she will find on her way, and be courageous enough to proudly defend her identity and her right to happiness. Rather than continuing to assure that \"she is white\", you should support her in this process of self-defence and self-acceptance. There is no other way.
