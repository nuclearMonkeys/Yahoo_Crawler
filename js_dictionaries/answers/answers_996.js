There are many reasons that make us think that life could have evolved several times at multiple places. However, there's also the possibility that the conditions that allowed life to occur in our planet are so unique that we're (almost) alone. What we know is that complex life should be rare. This is because it requires very stable and specific conditions, and in our planet it evolved relatively late.", 7704, "ANhwSuGIaa", 1],
	55304 : ["What your looking for is to be found theoretically in the Drake Equation. This is a mathematical formula designed to predict how far away is the next alien race. It takes into account how many planets might be able to support life, a thing that has changed dramatically in recent years. Of course, people disagree on what values to place on what variables. But much hinges on whether we find life on other planets within our own solar system.    See, even microbial life on Europa for ex. would be a great sign that life might be all over the universe. But if every other planet in our system is devoid of all life, then we might be the only sentient life forms in the universe. Another big question is the time factor. What if the next closest sentient race of aliens if 50k light years away but we end ourselves before they ever even know we existed? If we are just rare enough that there is on average 50,000 light years between civilizations AND if intelligence is something that usually ends itself in under 50,000 years then there is little hope of ever meeting up with aliens.  A friends of mine is a retired astrophysicist and that was the answer he gave when I asked him a similar question. He believes that they probably are other civilizations but that they are likely too far away to be aware we exist yet. I should add that there is no sign nor reason to believe there is other sentient life within our solar system.  We give off so many radio signals, it is likely another species would as well. Therefore it is highly unlikely an extraterrestrial civilization could be within our solar system and still go undetected.  ", 7704, "3ZerbcnEaa", 0],
