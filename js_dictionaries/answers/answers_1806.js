Despite their girth they are usually in good health because of the exercise they do as their training is good for the cardiovascular system.  Also they do eat large quantities of food but the food they have is mostly rice, millet, vegetables and fish - a very healthy diet. A sumo is bound by strict rules and can not do many harmful things like take drugs or even drive! They do often suffer liver problems as they are encouraged to drink heavily to add weight and provide their bodies with energy from alcohol.

Now coming off of my huge debut against 2 jobbers i am yet again surprised to see how stupid the gm is.The last time you loser fans saw The Siberian Wolverine wrestle in YWWA,bout 2 days ago.He killed 2 jobbers.Now i do not remember the names of 1 but i barley remember the other.Oh what was his name,oh yah his name was The Twister.Now i blew him away.And this stupid excuse for a GM put me in a match against this stupid excuse for a jobber Twister,AGAIN!This is outrageous.After my awesome debut against those 2 jobbers i should have gotten a world title shot. But i knew that i would have to work twice as hard to prove myself to this stupid GM.Now even with  my unfair treatment here in YWWA i thought i would atleast get a hardcore title shot or something. I never thought that in a million years that i would be facing Twister AGAIN.This is an outrage i deserve better than this.And should also be treated with respect.And the GM and all of the superstars here on YWWA have lacked to show me either of those.And i guess im gonna to have to beat the crap out of both.Now about the situation backstage,im been treated very bad.You would think the best addition to the YWWA roster and the future of YWWA himself would be treated with SOME respect if any at all and yet im treated with actual disrespect.Now i think this is awful.The scene after my victory was unacceptable.I got a bunch of dirty looks by all the punks backstage. And worst of all from people like E and C Connection,Psycho Dude,Justin,Golden Falcon,Charlie Scena,and many others.Justin gave me the most trouble.I dont know what that guy's problem is.His fan base consists of 9 year old fans and 14 year old girls.My fan base goes from 1 to 100.Everyone loves The Siberian Wolverine.They just dont have the balls to admit they love me. Especially all the peeps here.Like i said Justin is really my number 1 fan.He just doesnt want to admit it as he doesnt want to lose his already small fan base.The fans are all that keeps him alive. They make him feel good about himself,when no one else in his life ever liked him.Even his own mother did not like him.He was bullied at school.And fired from every job he ever did besides this job.And he should be fired from here.The only reason he gets cheered and i get booed is because his fan base are all rich snobs who can afford tickets to this show.My fan base consists of the common hard working folks.The Justin fans are the rich,easy going,fans who inherited money off their parents and have no job,they are only living off their inherited money. And my fans cant afford to attend the shows.Now back to the point at hand.This is a conspiracy. I DEMAND better treatment.I also demand better opponents.Like maybe a match against Graduation Bear,all the fans would secretly LOVE that.And make it for the title and they would go crazy.Now a message to the spineless GM,i am a 9 time champion,4 of those times were world title reigns.Heck im CURRENTLY living out all 4 of those world title reigns.I should be treated with respect.Now tonight i will destroy that stupid excuse for a jobber The Twister,no,you know what,i take that back,he isnt even good enough to be a jobber.So lets see what the match title should be,Pro vs. jobber that should not even be a jobber,lets see,i think i win. Now tonight,I WILL TEAR TWISTER APART! End of promo. Promo is kayfabe. 5 star card as usual. WQ:They usually have a main person going in,like Stone Cold lead it WM25. So i say Chris Benoit would lead. Ted Dibisae Sr. And others. Chris Benoit=because he was the best,in my opinion the best at submission,awesome at technical wrestling,VERY hardcore,pretty extreme,and my fav wrestler.My pic explains.

The company tends not to like to do business with, including the Hall of Fame, with those who leave on bad terms. I'm not sure that he left on bad terms, but he did leave due to failing the physical required to get a license by the New York Athletic Commission which pretty much killed his WWF/E career as he was never with the company again. (See Source)  But in all honesty, I believe one day he will be in the Hall of Fame, he was a major part of the main event for a long time. I'm not sure when it'll happen, but every year there are fewer choices to pick from as far as legends and hall of famers go, that makes his chances get better and better with each year. As for who would induct him, I'm guessing if not a child or spouse, that either Umaga or Matt Anoa'i(Rosey) would do it. Perhaps they would get The Rock, but I don't know.
