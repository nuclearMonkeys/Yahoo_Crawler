The Torah, or first five books of the Bible, the Law written under inspiration by Moses, dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries B.C.E.  By comparison, the Hindu writings of the Rig-Veda (a collection of hymns) were completed about 900 B.C.E. and do not claim divine inspiration. The Buddhist “Canon of the Three Baskets” dates back to the fifth century B.C.E.  The Qurʼān, claimed to have been transmitted from God through the angel Gabriel, is a product of the seventh century C.E.  The Book of Mormon, reportedly given to Joseph Smith in the United States by an angel called Moroni, is a product of the 19th century.  If some of these works are divinely inspired as some assert, then what they offer in terms of religious guidance should not contradict the teachings of the Bible, which is the original inspired source.

Clarke immediately sided with the Antinomians and was one of those forced into exile by Massachusetts Bay. He learned from Roger Williams that Aquidneck Island (Rhode Island) was available, and he, William Coddington, and other settlers purchased it from the Narragansett Indian Tribe. They left Massachusetts and established Portsmouth in 1638. Clarke is the second of the 23 signers of the Portsmouth Compact, the text of which reads: \"The 7th Day of the First Month, 1638. We whose names are underwritten do hereby solemnly in the presence of Jehovah incorporate ourselves into a Bodie Politick and as He shall help, will submit our persons, lives and estates unto our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and to all those perfect and most absolute laws of His given in His Holy Word of truth, to be guided and judged thereby.\" These Bible citations are in the right margin of the document:  Exodus 24:3-4, 2 Chronicles 11:3, 2 Kings 11:17. In late 1638, Roger Williams, Clarke's compatriot in the cause of religious freedom in the New World, had established America's first Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island, and Clarke established the second Baptist Church in Newport, Rhode Island in 1644.  John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, and John Crandall, members of the Newport Church were arrested in by Massachusetts authorities on July 20, 1651 as they visited William Witter, a sick friend, in Lynn, Massachusetts around 75 miles away. Clarke protested their heavy fines and Governor John Endecott replied that Clarke \"deserved death\" and \"was worthy to be hanged.\" Holmes refused to pay his fine, nor would he allow others to pay it on his behalf. Holmes was severely whipped (thirty lashes) and carried his scars for life. Holmes said later about the whipping: \"... having joyfulness in my heart, and cheerfulness in my countenance ... I told the magistrates, 'You have struck me as with roses.'\" This event (and others like it) served as the basis for Clarke's \"Ill Newes from New England, or a Narrative of New England's Persecutions\" (1652).  After his release from jail, Holmes returned to Newport and in 1652 succeeded Dr. John Clarke, and remained it's Elder for more than thirty years until his death.

	59681 : ["IF there were a Holy Spirit as defined by Christian religions, then yes, its unsolicited intervention would be against free will.  However, if you solicited the intervention by the Holy Spirit, that would conform to free will. Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Whether or not free will is God-given, evolved or an illusion is not really the issue.  We do, in fact, make choices.  The real question is: In a deterministic universe, ruled by causality, can free will also exist? There's no proof for ANY answer.  I, personally, believe that free will coexists with determinism.  I believe living beings can't be viewed in the same light as inanimate objects (stars, planet, atoms, comets, chairs, rocks, etc.)  The free will we have is limited in as much as our options are limited.  We are not gods and are confined to physical laws. The field of neuroscience has made large strides recently but the free will versus determinism controversy is nowhere closer to resolution.  Determinism and compatibilism have both garnered supporting evidence (though determinism seems to have the edge for now).  Google \"CEMI theory\" for more information about a leading theory that supports compatibilism. For argument's sake, I'll assume there is a God who gave us free will.  If he did, then he can no longer intervene in human affairs: that would be usurping our free will.  That means that God CAN'T be a personal God who meddles in our affairs (answer prayers, perform miracles, slay enemies, wipe out cities, etc.).  Once he gave us free will, he switched from personal God to cosmic God . . . from meddler to observer. But if God did NOT give us free will, we are merely puppets dancing to God's tune.  We would have no morality, responsibility or accountability. Christian apologists have tried, for hundreds of years, to explain away this logical conundrum.  But they can't (without resorting to circular logic).  If you insist on a supernatural creator, then God either gave us free will or he didn't.  If he didn't, he judges and punishes us for lives we had no control over.  If he did, then all his interventions described in the bible contradict the free will he supposedly gave us. The question of free will cuts to the core of scriptural legitimacy and reveals the lies that dogma is intended to cover up.", 8053, "Mnm35sjNaa", 1],
