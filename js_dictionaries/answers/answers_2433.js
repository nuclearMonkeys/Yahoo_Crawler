So... JB done, Cydia installed, now to install the good stuff Shocked when Installous failed to show me any download links, worked flawlessly on my iPhone 4S so very unhappy Google search reveals loads having the same problem, no fixes as such (hopefully this will be resolved soon but come on guys the people are busy and its all free remember) So.... how to fix it if the other methods dont work??? Remember, this worked for ME and a couple of others I know, this DOESNT ADDRESS the original problem, its more of a work around, the blank page will still show up, but more on that in a moment Now, firstly, you need to install two programs, but first ADD this source in CYDIA once added, do a search and install the two following items \"Backulous\" and \"Appstorelous3\" Backulous will ADD two buttons to the top of the box that appears when you select a download link, one refreshes the page, one stops the page loading Appstorelous3 will make it easier to download through APPSTORE and INSTALLOUS THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT!!! After these two are added, reboot your device go to installous, and then find a file to download, then when find one, it SHOULD give you the option to open the links with INSTALLOUS or APPSTORELOUS do NOT use INSTALLOUS as you will STILL get a blank screen, use Appstorelous to handle the download links and they should be in GREEN, once you choose that option you will get the Captcha page come up straight away HOPEFULLY SUCCESS!!! Now, this WORKS on my iPad 3 running 5.1.1 I cannot say for sure on other iDevices, but hey, what have you got to lose trying? How about trying, leaving some feedback in here, hopefully we can get you all running again  Best wishes to you all", 10945, "mNEN9ZYvaa", 0],

The so-called \"Jobs Bills\" that were filibustered and stalled were all government expenditures - taxpayer money being used to increase the debt and deficit - to spend money to try to \"create jobs\" out of thin air.  The Democrats methodology is to create a spending bill, claim it will do what it won't while increasing taxes and the power of the government - then blaming the Republicans for \"not caring\" when it doesn't pass.   I'm not sure that McConnell actually did call the pipeline a \"Jobs Bill\".  He may have said that it will create jobs, but it was not initiated by the government and it is not being funded by the government.  It was merely PASSED by the government.   This is not an example of the government over-reaching and trying to do something it cannot do - it is an example of the government getting out of the way and letting private industry do what it does best, for the benefit of us all.   If he did say that, he was wrong - but just in the name.  I believe the pipeline will keep the cost of oil and gasoline down, which will benefit the American consumer over and over again.   The low price of oil is hurting the oil companies - but they'll survive.  The low price of oil is hurting governments who depend on oil revenue for their state-run operations - governments like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Russia -  I LOVE the low price of oil.

We even have religions that say that animals are separate and came after us. So some people do not think of themselves as animals because doing so is like denoting one's self.
