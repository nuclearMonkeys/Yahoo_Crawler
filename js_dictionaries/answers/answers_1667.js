	89029 : [">> Can I be a Christian and NOT believe in the horrible eternal hell doctrine?         Absolutely!  ...because the doctrine of hell has no factual basis in what the Bible actually teaches about the state of the dead and the afterlife.  It is too bad so many Christians don't understand the Bible well enough, and apparently won't investigate it further, so that they can represent God with His Truth -- instead of with the lies of the devil. See these other best answers: What is hell and where is it located? Who believes in hell? Can the deceased see us?         How do Christians get so confused? In this case, they see the English word \"hell\" in the Bible and they immediately assume all the traditions of man, associated with that word, which were passed down to us by the lies originally told by the Roman Catholic church to extort money out of parishioners. But you have to remember that all of God's Word must agree with itself. Thus, you have to take into consideration other passages which contradict the possibility of a literal hell (Eccl. 9:5,6; Psalm 13:3; John 11:11-14; John 5:28,29; Rev. 20:4-6; Rev. 20:7-15; Isa. 47:14; Mal. 4:1-3).         Since those other passages (noted above) are also true, then that means the use of the word \"hell\" is merely a negative euphemism for the grave. But there is still the Lake of Fire; which is not, yet, burning (Rev. 20:7-15) and will not burn forever (Isa 47:14; Mal. 4:1-3). God is Just, but not cruel.         If you really study it, you'll find that the Bible does not teach hell as a real place.  For more info, see the Bible studies listed below.

No proof was shown but since they denied it, they were disfellowshipped.  Other repented of their \"sin\" but they still were disfellowed.  Considering the ramifications of this action according to the belief of the society, I find this appalling since in order to \"live forever on paradise Earth\" one must be a member of the society...in good standing.  It appears to me that they are fast to disfellow and very slow to reestablish someone.    Paul said he persuaded people to see the truth (2 Cor 5:11) He often had tears in doing so.  I ask...have you ever seen an elder cry because they had to disfellow someone?  Have you ever seen an elder shed tears in praying for someone?   Have you seen anyone ask for prayer in a Kingdom hall because someone was lost or they were hurting badly?    Many of the churches the WT condemns so readily have what are called prayer chains.  If an urgent prayer request is given, one person will call another and that person another until dozens if not hundreds of people are praying for that situation.   Does this happen with the KH? As to the holidays, Paul also addressed that. He told us if we celebrate them...or if we do not it is no big deal.  (Romans 14) You say the WT is the truth?   This shows our point because it is JESUS that is the truth.  With every JW walking lock step with the tower, it reminds me of when Catholics were told that the Pope is infallible.  Only ONE person fits that...JESUS.    Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.  Everything Jesus did only clarified the past, new light never cancelled out old light, it only made things more clear yet the WT has had to back track many times on what it said would happen.  If they are GOD's only channel, then they were saying they were prophets yet they were WRONG many many times.  TRUTH cannot be based upon lies.   TRUTH never uses...theocratic war strategy.

	89041 : ["This first thing I do Nick is point them to the definition of eternal in a good dictionary. Eternity does not necessarily convey Neverending. Like many words it has more then one meaning and the one the translators chose to relate to us in this word is seemingly endless. It will take a long time for us to unlearn all the negative things we have gathered around us during our life time. It will take some of us a lot longer then others. How do we know ? The greek word used here aionios is a measurement of time. Everlasting cannot be measured of course because it has no end. It is used as a reference. The mistake most people make when looking at this definition is to try to include all the definitions which is of course incorrect, only one applies. Even some of the Greek dictionaries have a problem with this word and its root word aion. Now lets get to that fire. Is it the literal fire I see in my fireplace? I don't think a spiritual place controlled by a just God has a literal fire. Can a literal fire burn a spirit or soul? If this is a spiritual burning of the mind caused by our refusal to understand the concepts of love and perfection I can understand that. Thats self inflicted, not God inflicted. An eternal burning hell was not taught until the 2nd or 3rd century. It was used along with a concept of perdition to scare the uneducated and bilk them out of their earthly savings.

Sometimes guys ask a girl for their cellphone and secretly record their number in it. He was probably trying to do that, and you wasted a chance to get his number. It's not the end of the world yet though.  *Eye contact = Interested in conversation. If he's staring at something other than your eyes, then he's most likely playing you. Then again, some guys are good at using girls.. use the nice guy card, and turn into a douche later. *Fixes his hair when he sees you? Smiles when he sees you? Always says hi? Yup, he's interested. Maybe not romantically, yet, these kinds of things are tricky to tell, but at the very least, he wants to get to know you. *Shows you everything he thinks is funny? Six words: He is trying to impress you. He wants to make you laugh. Guys don't do that unless they're comfortable around a girl. *Speaking of comfort.. he fist bumps and high fives you? It's an indication he's trying to say \"Don't be shy around me, open up to me a bit more.\" Guys usually do that with their other guy friends, so when they do it with other girls, it could mean three things: 1) He thinks of you as nothing more than friends, similar to his guy friends 2) He's comfortable enough around you to do stuff he'd normally do with guy friends 3) He wants to befriend you and wants you to feel comfortable around him for something more.. it could be he's trying to be friendly, so if he ever asks you out, your chances of saying yes increases *Touches your body? Yup, classic body language. He's interested in a quality about you. I don't know what, you tell me.. *Always turns whenever you say something dirty?

You're in the last days of your school year, I'm guessing, so don't be surprised if he asks for your number for over the summer. It could also mean he's afraid of you rejecting him.. after being friendly to you for so long, he's afraid that'd he'd ruin a good relationship if he asks for your number, and you say no. It'll get awkward after that. My suggestion? GIVE HIM YOUR FREAKING NUMBER! It takes A LOT of balls for a guy to ask for a girl's number.. if that girl is the one he's interested in.

Considering the amount of preaching a Jehovahs Witness does believing that would make you a hypocrite of the highest order. If you actually do care about my reasons for disagreeing with a JW then the big issues for me are -blood transfusions  ('Abstaining' from these stops JW's from having major operations that could be life saving, it also means that sometimes they die of a loss of blood when they wouldn't have otherwise. I view God as loving and dont think he would ever of wanted that. I think the quote JW's use to justify it is vague and taken out of context) -disfellowshipping  (I dont think encouraging organised shunning of someone you disagree with is one of the hallmarks of a loving religion. Didn't Jesus say that a 'doctor does not go to the healthy'? I also think it's wrong to try to divide families for any reason. I was told by a JW friend that converting to another faith is seen as a good enough reason by many JW's since they could be a 'bad influence' and it will encourage them to ask forgiveness. I think you should be ashamed of this, blackmail and threats are not the way Christ would want you to encourage someone to follow him and I dont think it makes any difference whether or not they have already been baptised. The reason God gave people free will so that they could choose to follow him because they genuinely wanted to, we should respect that he wanted people to make that choice themselves.) -The fact that you dont celebrate Easter or    (Surely the birth and ressurection of Jesus Christ are  2 things worth celebrating and I dont buy into the 'pagan festivals' argument. As for Birthdays and Halloween, they are nothing to do with religion so why take a stance on them?)  -Your different translation of the Bible  (Every other christian denomination simply has a different interpretation of the same Holy Bible, why does your denomination need a different version of the good book) - The 1914 and 144 000 issues  (I've not got a big problem with these 2 ideas on principle, I just dont agree with them since they seem to be very complex doctrines that I can't find foundation for in the Bible) -I'm not a big fan of the 'neutral in world affairs' idea, I dont like the reasoning behind this. We may well live in an imperfect world but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to make it better and co-operate towards common goals. -I'm also not keen on the lack of individuality within your church (Not to say it isn't there just that it doesn't seem to be encouraged) or the huge amount of authority the watchtower give's itself.
