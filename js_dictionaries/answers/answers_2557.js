It's the result of the culture that are Kurds are so keenly trying to protect, i.e. feudal system, suppression of women, lack of education and such.  This \"culture\" has prevented them to see through PKK's plans and PKK's terrorism drove away even what existed. They killed teachers and doctors, they drove away enterprise, caused existing manufacturers to go away, stopped cultural tourism. So, if southeast wants prosperity, terrorism must stop and the \"culture\" that suppresses women and takes advantage of the poor must come to an end.

Of course, surely all Arab country leaders must privately hold this view in any case, but it would be political suicide to admit that. It has never been about money. Surely, the oil states can well afford to help their Palestinian brethren financially, and they do on some levels.  But absorption has a political dynamic and an intangible psychological price that the Arab leaders, and indeed the Arab populations, I think, aren't willing to pay. While certainly Arabs sympathize with the Palestinian cause, at the same time it is my experience that the Arab public at large does not want Palestinians to be absorbed because they shouldn't have to be. The question is often asked, \"Why should we help Israel get rid of the problem that it caused?\" And besides, many argue, to absorb the Palestinians would be helping them to give up the struggle, and this is seen as a bad, even immoral, thing.

It's \"ONLY\" the  Native Americans who have been \"legislated\" to systematic oppression.  Your government established treaties. The treaties defined the compensation to be paid to Native Americans to allow \"foreigners\" to occupy their lands. Native American lands have been occupied for over 200 years, Everything Native Americans \"Should have Received\" was \"Prepaid\" by agreeing to that occupation. Yet, your government has NOT made one compensation payment for the land. Your government holds Native American \"Lands In Trust\" (reservations) and collects \"ROYALTIES\" from those lands. Your government holds that money \"In Trust\" along with all other Native American revenue. (land sales, water rights, rights of way) Native Americans get nothing from your government. The money that Native American tribes receive is their own money that the government \"Holds in Trust\".  Native Americans pay for all their own \"Programs and Services\" from that money. In effect, Native Americans compensate themselves for allowing foreigners to occupy their lands.

After a trial in June 2008, Judge James Robertson ordered that the government is responsible for about \"$455 Million\" of missing Native American money. In early December 2009, the government offered and the plaintiffs accepted a settlement in this 13-year-old case.  The settlement provides $1.4 billion to be shared among the plaintiffs (yielding just $1000 per plaintiff).  2008 - 2nd Huge Suit Filed Over Use of Indian Money Tribes File Trust Funds Mismanagement Lawsuit Against Federal Government. The Native American Rights Fund (NARF), filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of over 250 Indian Tribes.
