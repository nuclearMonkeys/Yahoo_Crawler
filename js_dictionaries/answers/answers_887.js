After that day, I purchased a radar detector which is legal where I live here in the US.  Fast-forward 22 years later, and I have never gotten another speeding ticket or moving violation for that matter again. If they're legal where you live, I can't recommend getting a radar detector and/or jammer strongly enough.", 6944, "OczpbeMdaa", -1],

Fact : in the UK generally fixed cameras are installed once you get enough points in a certain distance over a certain period. How do you get points ? - 15 for someone killed, 10 for seriously injured and 5 for injured. If you get 65 in a three year period over a kilometre (? can't remember), you qualify for a speed camera. The stats are all available to the public. For example, google the Sussex Safety Camera Partnership (it's where I live) and for each camera installed it lists the points score that's why they try to deter people speeding.

There are quite a lot of questions on this forum about them not working, especially the Mini 7 & 8.  If it's within your budget, go with the Mini 90 instead. Instead of a new Fujifilm or Polaroid, for about $5-$10 you can get a used Polaroid Sun 600 which is a solid camera made when Polaroid was making solid cameras.  Shop at either adorama.com or B&H for your camera gear.  Prices are the lowest on the internet, they don't allow third-party seller (i.e. scammers) and their site is much better to use.  Here's B&H's link showing all of the instant film cameras on the market today:  If this for yourself and not a gift, just get a used Polaroid 600 or Spectra which was Polaroid's top model.  Film is available for both cameras.  Buying used will save you a lot of money which you'll need for the expensive film.  It's extremely common for consumers to buy these cameras and then get tired of using them, especially when they realize just how much money they're spending on film.  It's very common for these cameras to quickly end up in a closet and forgotten.

Before you switch brands or get a kit lens which is a cheap lens, how about getting another good lens, such as a 50mm f/1.8 AF Nikkor.  It is an older lens that requires manual focusing with your camera, but if you take bad pictures with that lens, there may be something wrong with the camera or the camera settings.

	49412 : ["The Nikon D5600 is a DSLR.  Set it in Automatic Mode. Does it still take bad photos with that Sigma lens?  Does it take bad photos with the Nikon kit lens? Some people have reported problems with the Sigma on that camera. If you have a problem, to make sure your camera doesn't have something set wrong, reset it to factory settings as shown in the link: ", 6950, "UReKGnGXaa", 0],
	49413 : ["First thing: reset your camera (discussed in your manual on page 115). You may have some settings that are hidden in the multitudes of menus that are affecting the exposure. I would guess that exposure compensation is set to some negative value. It should be set to zero. The camera body isn't responsible for un-crisp images. The lens is a factor and the users skill in knowing how to use a camera factor in to the final product. A DSLR requires learning how to use the camera. The large sensor (with respect to a point & shoot or cell phone camera) means you need to be on top of your game to use such a camera. This is true for any camera manufacturer.  Simply pointing and shooting any camera will not give you good results. Things to watch out for: Be sure exposure compensation (discussed in your manual on page 132) is set to zero. Adjust as necessary. This may be the cause of your dark images. Strong back lighting. If your background brighter than your subject? Your camera exposure will be influenced by the strong back lighting and make your subject darker. Are you taking pictures in dark areas and possibly have a bright light in the frame? The bright light is akin to strong back lighting. The dark area will force you to use a slow shutter speed and higher ISO. Go outside during the day and see if you have problems with sharpness and exposure, being mindful of strong back lighting. Lens Aperture setting: If you're shooting at f/2.8, you'll have a narrow range where things will be in focus (depth of field). Try using something like f/5.6 or f/8. You'll need enough light to pull this off. Shutter speed. If your shutter speed is too slow, you will get motion blur. Inexperienced photographers will need to use a shutter speed of 1/100 seconds or faster for this lens (depends on focal length). An experienced user can get sharp images at 1/30 sec. Also, be sure the optical stabilization switch on the lens is set to ON. OS reduces the effect of camera shake which should allow you to shoot at 1/20 seconds. ISO setting. If the ISO is set too high (above 1000), the image will get noisier. This will have the effect of a un-crisp image if set too high. Third party lens. All manufacturers have had problems with lenses. Most of the time they work great. Sometimes, people will get a not-so-great copy and have sharpness issues. Since it's third party, you can't send your whole kit to Nikon to have things adjusted. These sorts of problems show up when using the optical viewfinder (phase focus). You can try live view which uses contrast focus and sets the aperture to the actual value that will be used giving the best focus possible for that lens. How you focus is also important. Your camera may be focusing on the wrong object. This is why I generally use single-point focus (page 87 in your manual) where I am in control of what to focus on. If you're shooting in automatic mode, you have no idea what your camera is doing. However, you can review your images and see what settings your camera is using. See page 188 on how to view information on your images. Learn to use the histogram. This is a helpful tool when figuring out exposure settings. Learn to use manual exposure mode. This will take time to master, but ultimately gives you artistic control over your images. As you can see, there is a lot to learn about your camera system. The above is just a brief overview.", 6950, "HFuI8oVYaa", 1],
	49414 : ["Definitely not.  The legacy camera companies are already playing catchup with the smart phone makers.   Camera companies mostly base their cameras on older lens technology, while the smartphone industry leverage better quality pictures by using the massive processing power contained in flagship smartphones.  Legacy camera makers don't put powerful processors in their cameras and don't have the in house expertise to properly leverage these newer processors.  Legacy camera makers always assumed they would maintain an advantage with the comparatively larger lens' cameras have, but advances in smart phones have made the size of the lens less relevant.   It's very sad when the flagship iphone Samsung smart phones are taking better pictures and videos than $1000 Nikons and Canons. ", 6930, "8KEvbPXyaa", 0],

	49418 : ["The industry is moving away from DSLRs to the more popular, and more importantly, more profitable (due to lower mfg costs) mirrorless cameras.  Nikon, for example, has announced that their current flagship D6 will be their last pro-level DSLR. I would recommend that you start looking at mirrorless cameras instead of a DSLR. Comparing a 12MP camera in your phone that costs $4 to a DSLR at even $50 is not a fair comparison.  It's akin to comparing a golf cart to a Lexus and complaining that the Lexus is so expensive when you've got a golf cart in your garage.  It's got four tires and seats four people just like a Lexus, right?  I'm sure you can see the absurdity of trying to compare a golf cart to a car. Comparing a camera simply by the amount of megapixels in the sensor is not a good way of judging a camera.  Why?  Because the size of the pixel has an enormous effect on image quality.  The bigger the pixel, the wider the dynamic range and less noise will be produced.  The pixels in the D3200 are about 10x larger than what's in a smartphone.  THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! What this size difference means is that the D3200 will have less noise at much higher ISO settings than a $1,000 iPhone X.  It also means that the images from the D3200 will have vastly larger dynamic range.  Phones don't have interchangeable lenses and what lenses that they do have is not in the same league as those available for a DSLR/mirrorless camera.  I mean, how can you compare a $1 lens in a $4 camera to that of a DSLR lens?  You can't.  Not only in terms of image quality, but in control of the focus, zoom, aperture setting, etc... You're giving up a lot for the convenience of having a small camera in your phone.  A phone simply can't do a lot of different types of photo that a DSLR/mirrorless can.  Photos of moving subjects is a prime example.  You can't zoom or change focal lengths.  Taking portraits with a smartphone results in ugly renditions of people because of the 28mm wide-angle lens in smartphones.  Take a look at this chart showing how ugly an otherwise attractive woman can be made to look when using a lens like that in your phone:  There's a reason why there are 100s of questions on this forum asking: \"Why do I look so ugly in photos.\" The answer is that they're using the wrong focal length. The only solution is to buy a real camera instead of using their phones. The D3200 is still very popular and that's why its used price is still relatively high, and certainly higher than $50.", 6938, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
	49419 : ["There is no Sigma 25-70mm lens. You probably mean Sigma 24-70mm lens. Both are pretty sharp, but the Sigma is a lot more expensive because it can zoom out to 24mm. 24mm is better than 28mm when shooting indoors because there may not be enough room to move the camera back.  Both lenses can be focused manually. Just make sure the camera is in manual focus mode and you can then move the lens' focus ring. There isn't any autofocus lens sold that cannot be focused manually. The manual  focus ring may be small but they are there. ", 6956, "None", 0],
	49420 : ["You already have a camera and your only concern right now is a lens. If those two are your only choices, I'd go with the Sigma.

	49421 : ["If the lights are blurry but the rest of the picture is ok it's not camera shake - that would cause everything to be blurry.  My guess would be that the camera's trying to get the right overall exposure, and the lights are over exposed / burned out as a result.  You could try using a fireworks setting if your camera has one, or switch on some more room lights.  I doubt that you'll be able to get the \"  card effect\" without using a more sophisticated camera and an image editor.", 6951, "b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa", 3],
	49422 : ["The lights are blurry because the camera moved during the exposure.  The shutter speed used was too long for you to hand hold the camera.  The solution is simple: Place the camera on a steady surface or use a tripod.  Next, set the camera to self timer and press the shutter button. Your camera has the ability to make an exposure as long as 15 seconds.  It is possible to have the light low enough to require an even longer exposure time.  I would start off at the lowest ISO and see what happens.  If the ISO was too low, only then would I increase the ISO to 200 and retry. You could also increase the camera's ISO, but at the expense of much lower image quality.  Instead, use the above method with the ISO set to the lowest number for the best results.", 6951, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],
	49423 : ["The camera is getting too much movement from your hand when you take it.  Mount the camera to a tripod, or put it on a stationary object and use the camera timer to take the picture.   You can also increase the lighting in the room which should help.  ", 6951, "8KEvbPXyaa", 4],

If the dSLR has features you want/need, then that's what you are paying for. That is called \"value pricing\". Typically, a smartphone camera does not have a bayonet-interchangeable-mount lens system, manual controls are much more usable (focus, aperture, zoom, etc.) and it designed to be a camera for still images - not a phone that happens to have a camera stuffed into it.
