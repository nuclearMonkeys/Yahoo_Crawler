	42448 : ["Just another example of capitalism's failure.   Under a socialist ( public ownership ) economic system , ALL CITIZENS  would be given a job and be required to WORK ( if able ).   Depressed areas of the USA would slowly disappear as would the chronically un-employed.   The war on drug addiction would finally be leveraged into victory , as mandatory drug screening would become an accepted way of life in the Democratic Socialist USA.  Capitalism is dying from a self inflicted and fatal wound. The goal of profit driven capitalism is not to provide jobs for everyone. To the contrary ; capitalism strives to cut the cost of labor whenever possible.  And when the price of human labor cuts too deeply into profits , those capitalists simply move those jobs to another vulnerable population anxious to be exploited.

They love to stir up feelings of animosity, and rile people up, because they think it sells more papers, or these days, internet ad space, and if they blast negativity all day, it boosts their news show ratings. It's same reason people slow down on the other side of the freeway to gawk at a bad accident. And the media is putting that bad accident in front of everybody's faces so they can gawk at it from the comfort of their living room, or where ever they can see the news story. They know we don't like it, but they know people just have an overwhelming urge to look at it anyways. And the media is exploiting this unfortunate human trait, which I think is totally disgusting.", 6160, "HpJ4wwC7aa", -1],
