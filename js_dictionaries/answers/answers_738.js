My personal favourite is the Brabham BT49 - I love all the ground effect cars, but the car that my hero took his first wins in has always had a special place for me.

IndyCars will, on a very long straight, leave both of these behind as their top speed exceeds 230mph but with a woeful 0-60 time of 3 seconds they need time to catch up and pass. All of these are made to look pedestrian when the top fuel dragsters make an appearance. With top speeds in excess of 330mph and 0-60 times below 0.5 seconds, these will be a 1/4 mile in the distance while the others have barely left the start line. Admittedly, they'll all catch up after that 1/4 mile when then dragster needs refuelling, and if there's anything vaguely resembling a curve in the track the dragster may need some manual assistance to get round... But if it's absolute speed you're after (and some pant-wobbling sound effects, sadly missing from F1 nowadays), top fuel drag racing is the way to go.", 6016, "IXUtYqhyaa", 0],

Bad management, lack of good leadership and the italian way help them lose their way, trying to get back to the top they chop and change too much causing more instability and hold them back. They need another strong leader who they are willing to give time to. No co-incidence their best period was when Luca Di Montezemolo and Jean Todt were running things.

If all your focused on is who wins the title then yes its more boring now than ever. However some of the racing in the midfield last season was superb. Then you had the absolute classics like Turkey, Sakhir and Turkey. IMO there was only 2 really boring races last season, Abu Dhabi and Russia. That's better than most seasons. 2001, 2002, 2004, 1995, 96, 92, 88 were not great seasons for racing but i see people call them classics. The longer time goes on, the easier it is to only remember the good races. So because they only remember the great ones, it's easy to think those seasons were superb and todays is boring.

	41180 : ["Because in the world of racing it's hardly the most complex version of the sport. It actually sums up the stereotype of americans really. It's over the top without being complex. The cars are all power and nothing else. The races, 1 direction so there's not really much thought too it. It's a very simple form of motor racing, designed for a simple audience, with commercials in mind. Lets also not get into the fact they can't cope with a bit of rain. I watch a fair bit of NASCAR. It is entertaining at times. However there's no depth to it. I also think if took the best F1 drivers into Nascar. Within 5 year's they'd be winning the title. Take the best Nascar drivers and give them 5 years in formula 1,they'd be mid-rank at best.", 6011, "TdmTjKt8aa", -1],

It's also been heavily stereotyped in connection with rednecks, hillbilly's, and drunkards, so that probably doesn't help.", 6011, "Q9XfjofAaa", -1],
