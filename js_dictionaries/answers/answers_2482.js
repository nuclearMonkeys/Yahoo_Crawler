For example: just yesterday I was taking a bath and my wife sat next to me; we were chatting and she was sponging me (it was nice, and kind of funny since it was HER b-day yesterday. lol)  As this was happening, I could feel her love (her energy) thru the washcloth as she ran it over my skin.  As she kept doing this, i felt a shiver of energy shoot thru my spine, and it caused my whole body to shiver (the type of feeling you get when the hairs stand up on your body).  Well, literally 1-2seconds after my whole body shivered, an earthquake occurred.  My wife somehow didn't feel it at all, and I was surprised that I had (being I was immersed in water). But, I had her go online and check, and low-n-behold we had a 4.0 earthquake centered right in our town! I have been noticing this type of energy even more so than I have been noticing it within \"others.\"  Like I will notice a shift in the energy within my own body, and the weather will shift. Quite amazing experience I must say... but I am blown away by them. Especially the earthquake... that was a new one for me. Now, as far as being a machine programed... of course this is a possibility.  For all I know, every single experience I have could be \"programmed.\" So, how do I verify I am human... I don't. I just go with the flow of the experiences that I am believing to be happening around and within me.  If I human... cool!  If I am not... cool!  It doesn't really matter, cause I find enjoyment in all of it.  There is not a single thing that I fear.  :-) Oh... but you sound so much like me... get to work late, call of more than i should, stay up way late at night (only to have to get up early in the morn), definitely (or should I say defiantly) feel mine and others' sexual energy, etc etc etc...

You shouldn't imply that all Turks wanted him dead.  Dink himself thought of Turkey as his home and in an interview about an article where he was purported to have written that Turkish blood is \"poisonous\" this was his reply:  ==  \"I don't think I could live with an identity of having insulted them [Turks] in this country... if I am unable to come up with a POSITIVE result, it will be honourable for me to leave this country,\".  == He (Dink) in fact wanted to improve relations between the Armenians and the Turks. These are excerpts from his last article. I capped some words for emphasis. == The judge had made a decision in the name of the \"Turkish nation\" and had it legally registered that I had \"denigrated Turkishness.\" I could have coped with anything BUT this.  In my understanding, the denigration of a person on the basis of any difference - ethnic or religious - is RACISM, and there was no way this could ever be forgiven...  Those who tried to single me out and weaken me have succeeded. With the false information they oozed into society, they created a significant segment of the population who view Hrant Dink as someone who \"insults Turkishness\".  What is truly threatening and unbearable for me is the psychological torture I place myself in. The question that really gets to me, is: 'What are these people thinking about me?'  Unfortunately I am now better-known than before and I feel people looking at me, thinking: 'Oh, look, isn't he that Armenian guy?'  \"We stayed in Turkey because that was what WE WANTED - and out of RESPECT for the thousands of people here who supported me in my fight for democracy...  I am now applying to the European Court of Human Rights. I don't know how long the case will take, but what I do know is that I will continue living here in Turkey until the case is finalised.  And if the court rules in my favour I will be very HAPPY and will never have to leave MY country.  2007 will probably be an even harder year for me. The court cases will continue, new ones will be initiated and God knows what kind of additional injustices I will have to face.  I may see myself as frightened as a pigeon, but I KNOW that in THIS country people do NOT touch pigeons.  Pigeons can live in cities, even in crowds. A little scared perhaps, but FREE\". == With that being said, Why can't you do the same instead of flaunting this article here for what?  To show people how pitiful the plight of Armenians during World War I are and how your voice was stiffled? Mind you there are lots of races in the world in more dire situations such as Sudan. Why don't you pick up where Dink left? Trying to create peace without being so \"at your face\" about things? Personally, I don't think Dink would want his name being used as an instrument by Armenians to provoke more discord if not animosity between the two races.", 11043, "None", -2],
