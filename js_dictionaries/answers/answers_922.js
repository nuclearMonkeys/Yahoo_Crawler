	51364 : ["There is no pre-tribulation rapture, it is not Biblical. There is a post-tribulation gathering back to Christ. The \"pre-tribulation rapture\" is a false teaching and this is easy to document due to the number of verses that teach that the gathering back to Christ happens after the Tribulation not before. Matthew 24:29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:” Matthew 24:30 “And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.”", 7217, "NzGZAENVaa", 2],

	51387 : ["The Bible does not mention smoking or other means of using tobacco. However, it contains principles showing that God does not approve of unhealthy and unclean habits and thus views smoking as a sin.Respect for life. “God . . . gives to all people life and breath.” (Acts 17:24, 25)  Since life is a gift from God, we should not do anything that would shorten our life, such as smoking. Smoking is one of the main causes of preventable death worldwide. Love of neighbor. “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matthew 22:39) Smoking around others does not show love. Those who are routinely subjected to secondhand smoke are at higher risk of some of the same diseases that smokers often suffer from.The need to be holy. “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.” (Romans 12:1).  “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1) Smoking is unnatural and incompatible with being holy​—that is, clean and pure​—because tobacco users intentionally consume toxins that seriously damage their body.

For example, the average person from Spain is only 55% Spanish.  In Ireland, people have Spanish, Welsh, French, Portuguese, English and other ancestries dating back hundreds of years. On the census I put my ethnicity as \"American\" but I am only 15% Native American, so ethnicity for the most part is chosen and made up. Also remember, people have been cheating on each other probably since humans first appeared on the Earth.  That means that you have no guarantee that the last name you received from your father is the actual last name that was passed down from each of your male ancestors for many generations.", 7228, "None", 1],
