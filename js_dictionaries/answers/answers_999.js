	55428 : ["1) Is Mars too far for a practicable human base this century....? No...not if a nation or a consortium of nations has the will and finances to accomplish it. A permanent base is certainly possible. It would be VERY EXPENSIVE to establish. It might NOT be outrageously expensive to maintain, especially if something like the Red Dragon becomes a \"standard transport vehicle\" (for both humans and supplies) to and from Mars. Once established the base ought to have an \"escape / return to Earth\" vehicle always \"ready\" in case of emergency. - TWO such vehicles, eventually We could ship supplies to Mars on automated transports and we could replace the crew of the base at regular intervals. (I.e. much as we do now with the ISS, except the intervals would be more like 18 months.) 2) Would the Moon (which has some gravity) or a large space station between Earth and Moon or in lunar orbit be a better 1st step for the 21st century? It would certainly be EASIER and CHEAPER and thus MORE ACHIEVABLE. One could establish \"transfer stations\" (space stations) orbiting both Earth and the Moon and so - standardized transport between Earth and Earth-transfer-station - standardized transport (different type of vehicle) running between Earth-transfer-station and Moon-transfer-station - standardized transport (different type of vehicle) between Moon-transfer-station and Moon Basic reliability testing could be done at the transfer stations to make sure that the vehicles were still in good operating condition. Vehicles could be refueled at the transfer stations. Note that you would need not only people transport, but also allow for supplies transport and safe fuel transport, for this system to be worth the expense. It would also be nice if the system supported heavy equipment transport (so that you could get large items to the Moon without having to use a direct Earth-to-Moon system). 3) Earth spacecraft could then refuel and provision there for the long haul all the way to Mars. Earth base Mars being for the 22nd century? The (potential) problem with a space-based Mars flight is that it's not particularly easy to work on (evaluate, transfer supplies, etc.) spacecraft in space. I mean: you'd STILL have to get the Earth-to-Mars spacecraft in orbit...and the fuel... and the people...and the supplies...and load all of those things ON the spacecraft, and generally that's going to be easier to do ***from the ground*** than it is from space. (I.e. easier to put all of those things in your Mars-bound spacecraft on Earth than it would be to transfer all of those things to your Mars-bound spacecraft in space). But if you have ***reusable craft*** running a ***regular route*** and requiring minimal maintenance - or, if the craft is small enough, ***a repair bay that can be \"aired up\" so that the craft can be serviced in space*** then you have an economical solution because the operating costs will be RELATIVELY small compared to a from-Earth-ground-to-destination-and-back-all-in-one-package solution.", 7722, "g9g3fOYyaa", 2],

It's not that we couldn't do it, with the resources we have, with the money present... it's the fact that *you need to have Congress order NASA to do it* - and that's where the stumbling block is.  In the 1960's, at the height of the cold war, where we were perceived to be behind the Russians in development, a lunar landing was a *politically* favorable effort - and, we had the upper hand in heavy booster development.  The Russians had tried to use their N-1 booster, but in 4 test trials, it never worked correctly. We had the Saturn V, which had engines that had been in development since the 1950's, and had a head-start to lofting heavy loads to orbit.  The \"Infrastructure Bill\" recently passed (with less than 40% of the funds actually designated to the infrastructure) is a good example - with a name like that, people favor it's passage - but, to look at the *details* - they'd likely be outraged...  Now - carry that on to a new Lunar program, or a Mars program -  and you'll read about how outraged everyone is over the 'wasteful spending' of trying to send men back to the Moon, or on to Mars - when there's so much that needs tending to with higher priorities.   No Congressman or Senator wants to lose his job appearing to be in favor of a 'wasteful' program...  And, it's Congress that directs NASA.  They direct funds to programs it feels are beneficial, and can pull those funds at any time. They hold not only NASA's purse strings, but direct exactly how money in that purse is spent.  It's not technology that's the hold up;  it's the United States Congress...   Want to help?  Find out who your senators are, who represents you in the house - and *write* them.  They all have websites; let them know how you feel.  Be polite, be firm, and let them know you'd likely vote for someone willing to expand our reach than for someone who doesn't.  These people want to keep their jobs - so, make them work for you.
