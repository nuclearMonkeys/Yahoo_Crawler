If priests and the devout can't live up to the moralities that they're pushing, then why should I accept them at face value? Basic examination of the Bible showed obvious inconsistencies and biases (many the result of repeated translations and alterations), which led me to reject the idea of divine authorship. The fact that I am a scientist didn't directly lead to my becoming an atheist, but it made it easier to accept. I can look at the wonders of the world and explain them with wholly natural means, and those I can't explain, I can investigate (even if I don't find an answer within my lifetime, there are still benefits from the process of investigation itself). In other words, I take comfort in knowledge, rather than claiming that ignorance is knowledge (or that ignorance is a virtue). So, in the end, I rejected my faith because I couldn't trust those who had taught it to me in the first place. I settled into atheism because I felt no need to explain the world through a divine being or ancient traditions - in other words, there was no \"God shaped hole\" in my life. Just to clarify, I'm not claiming that everyone else is wrong, or that I somehow have \"the answer\". I don't.

	63846 : ["Noah's flood is a myth based on the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh. Here are a few points that show how impossible the biblical description is. (1) There is not sufficient water on earth to cover the entire surface including the highest mountain peaks, such as Mt. Everest which is approximately 29,000 feet tall. (2)  It would have to have rained 750 feet per day to cover Mt. Everest even if the water did not run off.  It would be impossible if the water did run off. (3)  The effect of this amount of runoff would be the total loss of all topsoil on the land surface, making it impossible for plants to return after the flood. (4)  The number of terrestrial species is in the millions and many are found in only isolated areas.  For example, the Alameda whip snake is only found in Alameda County, California.  The kangaroo is only found in Australia.  None of the creatures could have come to Noah. Therefore, Noah would have had to go to each land mass, including islands, and find each species there along with their food supplies.  He would then have to return them to their homes after the flood, even though their ecosystems had been destroyed. (5)  The ship building technology thousands of years ago was not up to the task of going to all of these places twice in a short period of time while it was raining 750 feet per day.  He would have needed a fleet of ships the size of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.  Hand crafted wooden ships could not have worked. (6) To have evaporation sufficient to maintain a rainfall of 750 feet per day, the temperature of the oceans would have had to be at the boiling point.  This would have sterilized the oceans as well as making Noah's fleet unlivable for any creatures.  After all, air conditioning had not been invented yet, especially one that works when the air is at the boiling point of water.  At that temperature, nothing would have survived, including Noah.

	63865 : ["You are a born Hindu...so lets see what Hinduism says about Big-Bang.. Before Bigbang there was no time and matter..it is after BB that time and matter started The Nasadiya Sukta of the Rigveda describes the origin of the universe as: \"Then was not non-existence nor existence: there was no realm of air, no sky beyond it. What covered in, and where? and what gave shelter? Was water there, unfathomed depth of water? Death was not then, nor was there aught immortal: no sign was there, the day's and night's divider. That One Thing, breathless, breathed by its own nature: apart from it was nothing whatsoever. Darkness there was at first concealed in darkness this. All was indiscriminated chaos. All that existed then was void and form less: by the great power of Warmth was born that Unit. Thereafter rose DESIRE in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit. Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent. Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it then, and what below it? There were begetters, there were mighty forces, free action here and energy up yonder. Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation? The devas are later than this world's production. Who knows then whence it first came into being? He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not\" - (Rig Veda 10.129.1-7) But the Rig Veda's view of the cosmos also sees one true divine principle self-projecting as the divine word, Vaak, 'birthing' the cosmos that we know, from the monistic Hiranyagarbha or Golden Womb[original research?]. The Hiranyagarbha is alternatively viewed as Brahma, the creator who was in turn created by God, or as God (Brahman) himself. The universe maintained by Vishnu (The god of presence) and destroyed by Shiva (The god of destruction). These three constitute the holy trinity of the Hindu religion. Once the universe has been destoyed by Shiva, Brahma starts the creation once again. This creation-destruction cycle is called Yuga which is the highest measuring unit of time in the Hindu religion.               ********************************************************* Most of present day physics, believes that the world started off with the Big Bang. To ask questions like \"What was there before the Big Bang?\" or \"What happened 1 year before the Big Bang started?\" are considered as irrelevant questions, because Time and Matter, became extant only when the Big Bang started. Thus in most senses, the Rig Veda in the above mentioned verses, conveys the same idea. The idea of the non-existence of Time or Matter. And in some ways it goes further, as it also mentions non-existence of a Creator, i.e. \"What caused the Big Bang?\" also becomes an irrelevant question.               *************************************** Professor Arthur Holmes (1895-1965) geologist, professor at the University of Durham. He writes regarding the age of the earth in his great book, The Age of Earth (1913) as follows: \"Long before it became a scientific aspiration to estimate the age of the earth, many elaborate systems of the world chronology had been devised by the sages of antiquity. The most remarkable of these occult time-scales is that of the ancient Hindus, whose astonishing concept of the Earth's duration has been traced back to Manusmriti, a sacred book.\" Ancient Vedic texts similarly predict the age of the universe.                     ******************************* Alan Watts, a professor, graduate school dean and research fellow of Harvard University, drew heavily on the insights of Vedanta. Watts became well known in the 1960s as a pioneer in bringing Eastern philosophy to the West. He wrote: \"To the philosophers of India, however, Relativity is no new discovery, just as the concept of light years is no matter for astonishment to people used to thinking of time in millions of kalpas, (A kalpa is about 4,320,000,000 years). The fact that the wise men of India have not been concerned with technological applications of this knowledge arises from the circumstance that technology is but one of innumerable ways of applying it.\"                                ******************************* Count Maurice Maeterlinck (1862-1949) was a Belgian writer of poetry, a wide variety of essays. He won the 1911 Nobel Prize for literature. In his book Mountain Paths, says: \"he falls back upon the earliest and greatest of Revelations, those of the Sacred Books of India with a Cosmogony which no European conception has ever surpassed.\"                                  ******************************** Huston Smith  born in China to Methodist missionaries, a philosopher, most eloquent writer, world-famous religion scholar who practices Hatha Yoga. He has said of Hinduism: \"The invisible excludes nothing, the invisible that excludes nothing is the infinite – the soul of India is the infinite.\" \"Philosophers tell us that the Indians were the first ones to conceive of a true infinite from which nothing is excluded. The West shied away from this notion. The West likes form, boundaries that distinguish and demarcate. The trouble is that boundaries also imprison – they restrict and confine.\" \"India saw this clearly and turned her face to that which has no boundary or whatever... India anchored her soul in the infinite seeing the things of the world as masks of the infinite assumes – there can be no end to these masks, of course. If they express a true infinity... And It is here that India's mind boggling variety links up to her infinite soul.\"\" \"India includes so much because her soul being infinite excludes nothing... It goes without saying that the universe that India saw emerging from the infinite was stupendous.\" \"While the West was still thinking, perhaps, of 6,000 years old universe – India was already envisioning ages and eons and galaxies as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. The Universe so vast that modern astronomy slips into its folds without a ripple.\"                              *************************** Dick Teresi, author and coauthor of several books about science and technology, including \"The God Particle\" \"Indian cosmologists, the first to estimate the age of the earth at more than 4 billion years. They came closest to modern ideas of atomism, quantum physics, and other current theories. India developed very early, enduring atomist theories of matter. Possibly Greek atomistic thought was influenced by India, via the Persian civilization.\" **************************** According to Guy Sorman, visiting scholar at Hoover Institution at Stanford and the leader of new liberalism in France: \"Temporal notions in Europe were overturned by an India rooted in eternity. The Bible had been the yardstick for measuring time, but the infinitely vast time cycles of India suggested that the world was much older than anything the Bible spoke of.

	63886 : ["If you call the science you mentioned \"hogwash,\" then either you didn't study it enough, or you failed to understand it. The \"closed minded\" and \"ignorant\" labels come about because many christians approach any subject with their minds already made up -- which may have been the case with your \"study.\"  If you go into \"study\" with your mind already made up that what you're going to study is wrong, then you're not studying. You say you've \"studied\" evolution -- ok, then what does the history of mitochondrial DNA tell us about human origins and timelines?  How do you account for all of the transitional fossils found?  What biological problems in the human eye can be directly traced back to early eukaryote light-sensing cell evolution?   Here's the deal:  a christian will post something on here such as, \"every single thing in the bible is absolute truth.\"  Many of those have never even read the full bible (I have, dozens of times), let alone researched any of the issues raised by biblical stories -- they just say that because somebody (parents, pastor, priest) told them that's the way it is.  They'll defend the story of Noah's ark, despite no evidence of any kind of a global flood, the impossibility of fitting even 1/10,000th of the world's species into an ark the size described in the bible, the lack of accounting for species not known or existing in the Mesopotamian region Noah was supposed to be from, etc.  Not to mention that the Babylonians had a hero-god story of a man who built an ark to ride out a flood and carried animals with him that was supposed to have happened thousands of years before the story of Noah, and from which the Hebrews obviously borrowed the mythology. You have one large problem with your statements -- there is no \"belief\" required for evolution, geology, cosmology, biology, etc.  Science deals with facts, not belief.  Theories that are proposed that are not supported by facts are discarded, not held on to as dogma and evidence manufactured to \"fit\", as with religion.  That evolution by natural selection has been confirmed by hundreds of thousands of observations, fossil finds, DNA tests, geological records, and direct experiments shows that the evidence -- not belief -- is so strong in favor of it that it is considered fact by every single scientist who works by the scientific method. You say it's wrong?  Fine -- offer proof.  That's how science works.  It's not enough for you to just say \"it is all hogwash\" -- PROVE that it's hogwash.  If you can, any scientist will listen.  If you can't, you have no ground to stand on just because you don't like it. Who is truly closed-minded?  There are none so blind as those who will not see...the evidence before their eyes, and spout dogma that a thousands-years-old myth is more true than hard facts and evidence right before your eyes.", 8202, "None", 2],
