	25949 : ["Yes, it's perfectly safe to give a dog bell peppers to eat, obviously as long as the seeds and stems are removed first. Indeed a dog cannot be fed onions or garlic, as it breaks down the hemoglobin in their blood, leaving them anemic. It's also fine to give them potatoes, as they're a good source of carbohydrates to a dog, so much so that some varieties of dog foods actually contain potatoes, like Wainwright's or Harington's salmon and potato, Winalot beef and potato or Arden Grange sensitive white fish and potato. Many vets recommend giving a dog small amounts of dog safe fruits and vegetables in their diet due to the health benefits. Know however, that the same as with any extras they're having - like dog biscuits, chews or treats - that it should make up maximum only 10% of a dog's daily diet. At least 90% of a dog's diet should be a good quality dog food, obviously along with fresh, clean drinking water which they need to have constant access to. Understand that there's nothing in bread which is harmful to a dog, but since their digestive system is made to digest meat and not wheat or grains, it's predominantly empty calories to a dog, as it's only beneficial in the carbohydrates and fiber content. Most people recommend not giving a dog bread for this reason. Hope this helps.", 4096, "UjX7SRmUaa", 1],

	25958 : ["Put the dog in another room if its staring behaviour bothers you. Its natural  for  most dogs to watch their owners eating, but they should never `beg`or bark when doing so. Are you sure the rest of your family have not been feeding the dog from the humans table at some time or other. It only takes one time and the dog will want it to happen again and again. Dogs should be discouraged from from staring at eating owners, when the dog is a puppy.  Its a lot harder to stop this behaviour in an adult dog, and the best thing to do is NEVER EVER give it food from your table and to teach it to  lay down somewhere it can`t stare at you and stay there until you release it, OR an easier solution, shut the dog in another room when you eat.  MY dog automatically goes and lies down somewhere when it sees me eat at the table.  Obviously some dogs display staring behaviour a lot worse than others, and it can also depend on the amount of respect ( or none at all) the dog has for the person eating.", 4092, "gGQssXS1aa", 0],

	25960 : ["Where I live, no pet is allowed to make a disturbance at any time.  Most likely, there are similar laws in your area.   Also, a dog that barks 24/7 is preventing the neighbors from sleeping at night, or even taking a nap by day.  That can damage a person's health and make them too exhausted to concentrate on making a living.  In addition, they won't be able to relax and read a book, watch TV, quietly commune with nature, or do anything else that they enjoy around their home.  As such, the constant barking will be so unbearable that it will destroy people's lives.   So, your neighbor was profoundly patient to give you a chance to correct the problem before taking any action themselves.  However, you threw that chance away.  So, you'll have to face the consequences of your own choice.  After all, your dog's behavior is your responsibility.   In order to prevent your misfortune from happening again, do an Amazon search for \"anti-barking devices\".  Then, pick and use the one which you like the best.  ", 4059, "Xe6yDelAaa", 1],

And because they spent much of their day in a dog-pen, I'm sure my dogs had boring moments when they were bored. You should add an UPDATE stating what AGE and BREED (or breed-mix) your bìtch is, how LONG you've had her, and whether she is fertile or neutered. Also whether there is a particular PART of the day during which she sighs - and what you suspect she was waiting for at those times.
