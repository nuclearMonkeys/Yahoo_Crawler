Ok even if you think McNabb is great(sorry I don't) you almost expect him to get hurt. You are looking at McNair who is aged body-wise.

Rudi doesn't impress me.  He'll have 165 in a game and then not crack 50 yards the next three games.  Too inconsistent. Jacobs looked like he was going to be primed for a nice year, but the Giants picked up Droughns.  I guess they figured that a big back like Jacobs can't play a lot of downs. I would try to trade one of your backs. Your WR's are decent.  I don't like having receivers from the same team though, so I would try to move D Jack, since he seems to miss 5-6 games a year. McNabb will be okay.  I like the Eagles with Curtis.  He's a nice option for McNabb.  I actually think that Alex Smith is going to play well this year too.  Keep him tucked away, you'll probably have some other teams offering to trade for him by the mid-point of the season. The rest of the team seems about average except for Vinateri.

Then {Optional} you can take a brown color and just add it in the outer corner to add more depth... if you want. 7) Curl your lashes and apply mascara (Like the Covergirl Clump Crusher or Benefit They're Real!) use a really good mascara so you won't need eyeliner. But since it is a special day… line your upper lash line (thinly) with a liquid liner (Like Stila Stay all Day) 8) {Optional} Fill in your eyebrows. This may seem weird, but if your eyebrows are sparse or patchy, use an eyebrow pencil (Like the Anastasia Brow Wiz) and fill in your brows by drawing in brow hairs or use a brow gel (Like Benefit Gimme Brow) and sweep it across your brows. Filling in your brows will draw attention to your eyes without too much eye makeup 9) Take a blush (Like any of the Wet 'n Wild Blushes or any of the Nyx Square Blushes you like) and use a fluffy (But not too big) brush to sweep across your cheek bone 10) {Optional} Take a bronzer (Like Sunny by NYC) and dust it all over your face, then use the same fluffy brush that you used for blush to sweep along the bottom edge of your cheekbone to contour and define. Then, sweep it across the sides of your faces to contour and make the illusion of a slimmer and smaller face. 11) Take a nice baby pink or pale pink gloss (Like Peaches and Cream or Creme Brulee Nyx Butter Glosses) and just apply to your lips Outfit... Just wear a cute sweater with tights and cute boots... add a big statement necklace if it's a plain sweater (no design) and a tiny one if there is a design. Hair...

When i think of British Boxers, i think  the top of the tops  boxers in history ( including amateur boxing) along with Americans,Mexicans,Eastern Europeans,Cubans!There also can be included French specially in the first half of 20th century,Argentinians and Germans, but Brits are in the first group of the top boxers! So when i think of British top boxers i think of people like : Jimmy Wilde Val Barker Ted Kid Lewis Ken Buchanan Lennox Lewis Joe Calzaghe Nigel Benn Naseem Hamed Benny Lynch Rinty Monaghan Jim Driscoll Chris Eubank Freddie Welsh Harry Mallin (One of the greatest Olympic boxers ever) and many other legends! Your attempt for a top 10 British boxers today is a desperate attempt (no offense mate but you know how i always being honest) of the same league with Americans including in the top 10 P4P, people like the \"juiced\" artist Mosley,the unproven but  talented who has not fight none worthy  Paul Williams and the best boxer in fighting men over 40 Chad Dawson! I mean not even one of the top 10 you are mentioning is the top boxer in his division  like Joe Calzaghe or Lennox Lewis were and if you disagree let's talk about it! Haye is an overrated boxer who fought vs nobodies in cruseirweight division and in HW he picked the freak of nature and he run circles around him to avoid fighting with him,let's see how he will do against any of Klitschkos,Chambers,Povetkin Chagaev n Boytsov or Solis,Haye is the most overrated in the world right now maybe second to Paul Williams only! Hatton lol no comment and Froch he has a lot of heart but not boxing skills,Khan is a way worse edition of the true legend Prince Naseem and you will see in near future how right i am about him! Rest of the boxers you mention, with the bright exception of Nathan Cleverly from whom i expect GREAT THINGS in near future, are mediocre and i am being nice i think calling them mediocre and not something worst! British Boxing is as bad as American boxing is lately and you will see what happens as soon as Haye will fight vs a TRUE HW BOXER,even Bernard Hopkins wants to fight him to get the belt,everyone can beat this big mouthed man!If you were not British you could see clearly that he really did not win against valuev but ok credit to David for running fast!", 10703, "None", 1],

I hope the Klitschko's are more willing to fight him now. 2. Carl Froch - Still unbeaten despite a poor fight with Dirrell. His fight with Kessler will be better but he will have to step it up. 3. Ricky Hatton - After devastating loss to Pacquiao I thought he would retire so I was surprised to see Marquez being lined up. Hatton needs a big performance to lift him back up to the top level. 4. Amir Khan - Looked good winning the title and his partnership with Roach works. I think he should come through against Salita. 5. Junior Witter - Just for now though as, after his loss to Alexander, I can't see what option he has left as fights with Hatton and Khan have gone. 6. Kell Brook - Future world champion in my opinion. I'm looking forward to his fight with Michael Jennings. 7. John Murray - Easily beat Thaxton and he will now want bigger prizes. 8. Kevin Mitchell - Has been frustrated by injuries but defends his British title against Ricky Burns. 9. Nathan Cleverly - Has looked really good so far and could win the European title soon. 10. Rendall Munroe - Defends his European title on Friday and, if he wins, is in line for world title shot.", 10703, "i99wjcNYaa", 0],

Having a keen eye and a sense of style would be a help, but there is nothing wrong with starting from scratch. Simple things such as being inspired by the various urban street styles, being observant with the clothing styles in fashion magazines, and familiarizing yourself with knowing which colors complement each other best, are all small steps that each make a big difference in knowing how to dress better.  However, above all that, knowing which pieces of clothing look good on you and with what, and knowing which accessories add the finishing touch to your outfit like a cherry on a sundae, is the key to giving you an ultimate boost and self confidence in knowing how to dress better. Afterall, fashion isn't all about what's in style and the latest trends, so don't be afraid to experiment with clothes, colors, textures, and styles. Don't be afraid to pair up eclectic vintage boots with laced tights or a bright colored tee with dark jeans, moccasins, and a beret. Fashion doesn't require the perfect outfit 24/7.  All it requires is just for you to be you.  Hope this helps, and good luck!", 10707, "M1YxFZZtaa", 0],
