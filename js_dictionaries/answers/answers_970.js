Sadly I lost the first one and then when it started happening again with the second pregnancy I just assumed I would lose the baby but the bleeding stopped and everything turned out fine. He's turning 18 this year.   The fact is that 1 in 3 first pregnancies will not go full term. I wish I could give you more hope but sometimes it's just not meant to be.  I would go to the ER in the morning (they're always super busy at night) because tbh if you are having a miscarriage at 3 months there is nothing they can do to stop it. ", 7529, "None", 0],

Everything turned out OK, but only because I had a very old and very experienced doctor who had seen this before, I won't go into details, but he saved my daughter's life, we almost lost her, she would have been stillborn. Don't take any chances and don't waste any time - go to the ER - I have, 3 times. 2 were false alarms, the third was life or death. My daughter is only alive because our doctor picked up on my itchy feet which I thought was an allergy and turned out to be a major liver malfunction. When we checked into the ER we had no idea how ****** we were and how close we got to dead baby. She lived, with a heart monitor for the next three months, precariously - she almost didn't make it, unless our doctor made the decision to induce, then to move her into the NICU, to suction her lungs from mucus and hopefully stave off infection and pneumonia.

Some things such as putting pins on your seat could be a crime. Maybe see what they can do maybe have some sort of suspension or detention or even corporal punishment. The little shits deserve to be hit with a belt it sounds like. See what discipline works as well and how they respond to it. Try assigning seats, see if there is some sort of thing where they have a card you sign, can you give them before or after school detention, have you tried talking to the parents of exactly what's going on, while some parents think their kids can do no wrong others will put a stop to it. Kids with parents that correct this sort of behavior are usually more scared of going home then the office. See if you can give them more work or harder work. Don't let them talk, take things away from them, make them sit or stand in a corner, etc. There will always be a parent that thinks that their little **** is a perfect kid who can do no wrong.
