	78503 : ["Not exactly.  It would be very hard to blow up all of the USA, because there is so much of it.  What they will probably do instead is set the Hydrogen bombs to go off a few miles above ground and sort of 'tamp the country down' rather than 'blowing it up'.    This will cause local weather conditions to become very hot for a short time, and atmospheric pressure may be quite high. They will probably miss.

Please do not put anything in the ear other than ear cleaning drops either from a vet or the pet shop.

Chances are they will settle down to either one or the other when the dog has finished teething.   The Corgi people (whose dogs' ears are supposed to stand up) sometimes have this problem, and they brace the ears with Dr. Scholls moleskin.  It may work or it may not.  Sheltie people make a loop with the moleskin and fold the ear over, since Sheltie ears are supposed to tip.   Anyway, unless you are going to show your dog, what difference does it make?
