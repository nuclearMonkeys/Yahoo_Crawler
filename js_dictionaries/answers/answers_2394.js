I come a Christian family who also wouldn't allow me to fast my first year of Ramadan.  Half way through Ramadan they eventually got the hint that I wasn't choosing my family over God.   According to Islam the only time you may disobey your parents is when they urge you to commit something against the will of Allah.   Don't argue with them treat them kindly, just do as you as save the food and wait.  They can't force you to eat and if they go that far its just silly.   A lot of families are like this so don't worry about it, most Western families tend not to take the same seriousness into religion.  If fasting is something you truly believe in and find it cleansing for the soul do so.  If Abraham listen to his Uncle and continued to worship Idols how would God's religion have turned out.  What if Muhammad convinced himself that he was only hearing things, or if Jesus refused to help the sick in fear of being accused of witchcraft.

	125535 : ["Be Nice to them and see the rights of Parents in Islam. It is a basic rule in Islam that all parents, whether they are Muslim or not, are entitled to good and kind treatment from their offspring. At the time of the Prophet, many of those who embraced Islam had difficulties with their parents, but Prophet Muhammad taught them to be kind to their parents and to obey them except if they demanded actions that were contrary to God's laws. [And if they contend with you that you should associate with Me what you have no knowledge of, do not obey them, and keep company with them in this world kindly, and follow the way of him who turns to Me, then to Me is your return, then I will inform you of what you did.] (Luqman 31:15) This verse specifies the way in which Muslims should treat their non-Muslim parents. It is clear that obedience to parents is required of every Muslim, but if that obedience comes into conflict with obedience to God, then a Muslim's' duty toward God comes first. The Qur'an specifically criticizes those who are blind to the truth and follow the wrong path simply out of obedience and loyalty to fathers and forefathers. The verse also says that even though Muslims should not obey their non-Muslim parents if the latter try to divert them from Islam, they nevertheless should be kind and give them \"good company,\" and be helpful to them so long as they show no aggression toward Muslims and Islam. It is important to remember that when parents grow old, they may be in feeble, mentally and physically, and so they can become impatient, oversensitive, and less tolerant. Muslims should therefore be patient and kind to them, refraining from disobeying and rebelling against them.", 10835, "None", -1],

	125541 : ["You are getting all confused because Fundamentalists want everybody to believe that the minute you die you go to hell.It's more complicated than that. The wicked, the really wicked do do that. Most people are not wicked, just confused. More about that later. Please read Samuel, Chapter 28. 1 Samuel 28:6-8 King James Version (KJV)  6And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.   7Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.   8And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.    Now, I have not quoted the whole chapter. I have limited space here. Saul successfully conjures the spirit of Samuel the priest. He speaks to him and according to the Bible it's the real Samuel. Why can't there be doors from heaven to earth? So, accordng to the Bible spirits of the dead can return and speak to talented mediums. OK?     Hell, is a loose term. Damnation, condemnation all that just mean that God ignores you. You are free to go. Ghosts remain on earth because of a trauma that they cannot overcome. There are ghosts and many people have seen and experienced them. The Bible simply says that after death is the Judgement but it does not say what space of time there is in between does it? Judgement would be a relief for these souls, and then they would probably reincarnate, because even the disciples asked Jesus about reincarnation. Jesus didn't really answer. The early Church believed in reincarnation. Heaven is the dwelling place of Christians that Jesus prepared for us. Others go to other dwelling -places of differing sorts, depending on their desires and beliefs etc. Most people go to a place where they relive their previous lives and rejoin their families.  This is NOT the Christian heaven, but it is a kind of holding place. You have to ascend to heaven. It takes much time to complete the process of Salvation.", 10838, "XjgJ17WLaa", -3],
	125542 : ["You have been taught wrong, Sweetie. Read over your question. Does it really make sense to you? The bible teaches that the dead are dead. They remain in the ground until they are resurrected after Armageddon. If you read Genesis  2:17 you will see that God offered Adam life or death not heaven or hell.  Heaven belongs to God and hell is  a man made concept not taught in the bible.  If you are reading  KJV of the bible it contains over 30,000 errors of translation and although it does contain the truth it is very difficult to find. You would be better off with a more modern translation. If you really want the truth and to be pleasing to God please contact Jehovah's witnesses.

This has led to all kinds of false teachings. Do humans have a spark of the divine - in the sense that God gives us the breath of life. This does not make humans as Jesus Christ. _______ \"Incarnation\" opens the door to \"men\" being as Christ Jesus.

	125544 : ["The thought that follows: \"but you will die like men\" gives more credence to the face value of the declaration. When we speak of satan as the god of this world, it is for the reason of usurping the authority God gave Adam, Genesis 1: 26. So it bears to reason that if Satan who tempted Jesus, saying if He would bow down to him and worship him he would then give Him all the kingdoms , for they had been delivered to him, usurping them from Adam, See Romans 6: 16 for an accurate rendering of becoming a servant to. Satan temptation to Jesus was a bonifiable one, because the kingdoms and the power of them had been delivered or given over to him. It wouldn't have been a temptation if it were not true, Jesus was not a dense head. Now all the glory that Adam forfeited was won back by Jesus Christ who is seated at the right hand of God and I also am in Him there, 1 Corinthians 12: 13 and Ephesians 2:1 and 4-5. When Satan tempted Eve with being come like God knowing good and evil, the thought of being come God, did not originate with him, God is the one who said: \"Let us make man in our image after our likeness\" Genesis 1: 26 the sin was thinking you could become as God by eating a piece of fruit, placing the ENE result at mans' own hand, and facilitation. God said; \"let us\" and as there has always been a second time, with God, Moses being rejected when he killed the man , supposing they would know that he was their deliverer and by his hand, and failed to see it, but when Moses came the second time.... And like when Jacob sent his sons to Egypt for grain and the sons did not recognize Joseph, but came back a second time, so as with Israel who did not recognize their Covenant man and Messiah the first time, but comes a second time; WELL THEN, THERE YOU HAVE IT We who are in Christ will rule and reign with Christ over all the earth and all who are in it, yeap sounds like god's and sons of the Most High to me", 10839, "None", 3],

There are studies that indicate that taking a half of teaspoon of cinnamon each day will lower blood sugar dramatically. When I was diagnosed, my A1C level was 11.0. A1C is the average blood glucose level for the previous 90 days. This is the test used to finally diagnose diabetes. The doctors typically want A1C level to be less then 7 for diabetics and less then 6 for non-diabetics. For the first three months I took only my medications and altered my diet. My follow-up A1C was 6.3. I added cinnamon,and three months later my A1C was 4.7. Side benefits,my cholesterol dropped from 173 to 135 and shoulder pains that had plagued me for years, disappeared.
