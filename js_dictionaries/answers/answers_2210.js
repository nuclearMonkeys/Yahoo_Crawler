I do find that some black women label black men as if they own them and what they don't understand is that they make themselves look really racist too. We don't own anybody, except for the things we buy! These type of woman have issues that they need to get in control of. Black men are free to date whoever they want to date, and just because it happens to be a white woman doesn't mean that he doesn't like black women.

The truth is, your stuff comes straight from people who read Anti-Mormon materials or from material found off the web itself. Since the missionary discussions are rather prescribed and pre-determined, it is doubtful that you even spoke with them because Missionaries don't go into details about specifics in Temple ceremonies.

Women have more social strength.\" The sentiment is great and I get the impression that it comes from a very noble place but you're way off in saying that women's recent prgression has anything to do w/ them having less instinct in cavemen times. Originally, both sexes had just as much or little instinct as the other. Instinct is pretty much the opposite of learned behaviour and if anyone sex was lacking in instinct humanity would not have made it this far. Caveman's instinct was related to his surroundings and cavewoman's instinct was related to the home and child rearing. Finally, as much as we'd all like to believe that both are an absolute requirement, the reality of it is that right now, a child can theoretically created w/o a man as long as you have a womb.
