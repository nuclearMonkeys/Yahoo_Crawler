BUT some times the Sound Recorder doesn't record that long time. 2.After plugging the Mic, you can use a Sound \"recording/editing\" program Like (Adobe Audition) Or (Cool Edit) Or (Sonic Acid Pro)etc..., and the procedure is regularly the same after running the program Find the Record command, and then start the phonograph. after recording the music, the program gives you alot of Saving options, Like .Wav, OR .MP3.....

	68286 : ["several people have asked what a phonograph record is and they have been totally ignored.For those who have parents who are younger than 45 or so a phonograph record is a black plastic-like disk(vinyl)that looks something like a fore-runner of a CD disk.They can be big;Long Playing records(LP records) that have several songs recorded on both sides of the record or small for single songs. They have a single, fine tiny groove that spirals around the disk from the edge to the center. They are placed on a turn table which spins it around and a needle on an arm is lowered onto it. somehow vibrations picked up by the needle in the groove are turned into music.  The reason why any one would want to record music from this seemingly ancient format is pure nostalgia for a more romantic innocent time; sometimes one longs for the days when guys didn't compare girls to jeeps and girls didn't accept the disrespect today's men dish out to them in the media as normal. and believe me, Napster does not have everything, only what some guy at Napster thinks you guys need to hear", 8455, "AA11297242", 1],

Since i was little i was always shy and quiet 5 years ago it all started i was 14. I was depressed went on independent studies only had two friends. Scared all the time I started hating people. I didn't really care about anything gained weight it sucked man. A couple months ago I realized i didn't want to live like this anymore. I was at home all the time. I went to Disney Land and had a horrible time..... Who has a horrible time at Disney Land?!!? I hated everyone. But there is a big difference Im a girl. When It started happening i would panic, get scared and have to pee. So last year i started working out started taking care of myself and became a happy person haha. I still panic don't like being around people. But why let that control my life you're lucky you can probably hold your pee in! I can't. There so many things you can do man. Just take baby steps like me haha Im going to a totally tourist attraction in a couple weeks the Griffith Observatory. Throw myself into something different i'll have a couple panic attack get scared and want to run out but, i'm not gonna let myself.

Speak it over with your parents. There are MANY students who are borrowing money right now and that's mainly how students CAN go to school. It's not like money grows on trees in our backyards. You just got to do what you got to do. You have to learn to deal with your problems without thinking about suicide all the time becuase what if you REALLY encounter a problem that was a bigger than you ever encountered and you don't know how to handle yourself? Do not let your anxiety consume you. That's why you're so dain miserable all the time. People are not out to get you, i promise you. You're the ONLY one convincing yourself of that. We're all human beings, we're in this world together, we may as try to get along and love each other. Understand that you are in a part of the world where you were given your freedom the moment you were born. Other people in certain countries can't really be in your shoes. If you want something to eat, you can always get whatever you want, when you want and however much you want. Can people in Africa do that? What about your senses, do you ever count your blessings for those? Imagine being blind all your life and having others wiping your butt for you? imagine not having taste buds you miss how hot steamed shrimp and strawberries etc taste like.

My heart goes out to you, because it wasn't to long ago that I said the very same thing: 'my life is going no where and I want to die.' You see I too have been working at a no where job for the past 6 years of my life. I have all but dug my own grave at college to the point where I will have to pay off a large debt just to go back, and I was evicted out of my own home. I was scared, alone, confused, angry at myself and at God, and I just felt hopeless. I've been antisocial for a large portion of my life, simply because I was worried about being laughed at.  So one day after I had cried for three days straight I really looked at my situation. Everything can be fixed if you desire it the most, I told myself. so now I pass along the same words. You can fix yourself, your not hopeless, if socializing scares you so much then do what I did. Take a drama class or a public speaking class. It really does help I promise you, people now can't even guess that I use to panic when I was spoken to. A good way to practice working with people is to volunteer. Try nursing homes or food shelters. You'll gain valuable experience there, I promise. Work out your problems slowly, volunteer first, or take a class at your local community college. Try talking to yourself in a mirror, might sound crazy but it helps to build talking skills. People aren't that  scary I promise you. Fear is all in the mind and you can adept and overcome the situation. And if you really want to push yourself out of your comfort zone try the air force or any branch of the military that you like, might help build your confidence, get you a better job, and pay for school. Hope that helps. Ps. I can tell that you don't really want to die, you just simply are waiting for life to get better. You have the power to be whoever you want to be, so just go out there and find yourself :)", 8452, "bhjWbwpIaa", 3],
