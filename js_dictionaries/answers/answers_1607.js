	86050 : ["You're right, I can't be really sure that Jesus will take me to Heaven, because just like I've been taught, I'm not supposed to judge anyone.  And I would imagine that includes myself!  Will I go to Hell?  I doubt that I'm such a bad person that I deserve an eternity in pain and suffering, but hey, who knows.  I'll suffer for my sins in life, that's for sure. I can't prove to everyone that my religion is truth, because they have found others that satisfy them far better than mine would -- everyone's different, so maybe Buddhism is a better fit.  As far as I can tell, all religions are different ways of believing and understanding the concept of a Higher Intelligence.  From my point of view, it's God, but maybe it's not to the Native Americans who still hold their beliefs in the spirits of nature.  I respect their faith as much as mine.  Now the Bible teaches many things, some of which society already agrees with and which I know has to be true.  For example, I don't think murder is right, nor do I think stealing is a good thing to do, both of which my religion and society accept.  However, like you've suggested, there are differences.  While I don't believe that premarital sex is moral, this is not just because a book tells me so.  It's because I think two people should save that special bond solely for the product of love, which is finalized in the process of marriage -- notice I didn't mention God there; He adds to my reasoning, but that's just the simple version.  I won't lecture on that though, because society values the completely opposite idea -- it would be pointless to argue here. As for Jesus saving us all, what I understand is that God embodied Himself as man on Earth to show us that He understood what life was like for us.  That he wasn't just a fearful, unseen ruler.  Assuming that you accept the possibility of a person who held divine power came to the Earth, then you will understand the rest of my statement.  Jesus didn't teach that we would be saved just by believing that he existed and that he was right in all his ideas -- he wanted us to live them out too, and show God that we were willing to do good in our lives.  The Catholic church teaches that salvation comes from good works and faith.  So if I believe in a Higher Intelligence that loves the world He created, and I am a good person during my life here on Earth, I will have taken a big step in the right direction. A big distinction to make is that Jesus and God are the same being.  Jesus was God, but with a human side as well.  God is completely divine.  So why do we bother going through Jesus first?  Why not just skip to God?  Because Jesus is God.  Jesus is just... the part of God whose duty it is to bring us with Him to Heaven.  He is the connection between God's divinity and our human qualities.", 9209, "None", 0],
	86051 : ["A) Where did you EVER get the idea that \"common sense\" has ANYTHING to do with God's relationship to man? Show me what's \"commonsensical\" about love! B) As for the first part, it's called \"faith\". And I have it. Now lemme ask YOU something. How do YOU know that the next time you enter a dark room and flick the switch that the light's gonna come on? What do YOU know about exactly how electricity works, huh? You don't know. You have faith that the switch will do what's it's supposed to do and the light will come on. But suppose there's a storm and the wires come down and the light DOESN'T come on. Will you never again throw a light switch because the power went out once? Hmmmmmm? C) I'm not called upon to prove one doggone thing. Merely to offer others a wider range of choices about faith than they may have heretofore considered. D) Not never, not nohow to sin again? Oh, baby, how I'd like that! But, face it, luv. being a Christian does NOT mean I'm no longer a human being with a human nature. That nature may be redeemed, but it is STILL fallen. And temptation is as inevitable as sunrise. Falling is always an option. The glory is that falling ain't the end of it. I just get back up, (repenting) and try again, hopefully having learned something in the meantime. E) Your final panegyric is a bit hysterically unrestrained, but if I understand you correctly, you want to know WHY God can't just let it all go, let us do whatever the heck we want and then say, well, it's ok, kiddies, you just come on home anyhow. Is that it? If so, try this. He's a FATHER. Now what kind of Dad raises his kids that way? A really, REALLY lousy Dad, that's who. You do a child no favors by not reining him in and teaching self-control, self-discipline and respect for others.
