	60883 : ["It can really be a challenge to make healthy food choices on a budget!  Students have a double challenge, because if they're living in a residence there may not be much storage for foods or time to prepare healthy meals.  (Oh, I remember all too well!!) Some good tips are: Shop for meat and produce at smaller ethnic grocers (if your city has a \"Chinatown\" that's a fantastic place to start!)  Actually, in general get as much of your grocery list from these stores as you can.  Your dollar goes a lot further, the veggies are fantastic quality and often half the price.  Plus there's excellent variety!  Variety is entirely under-rated, nutritionally speaking.  So get adventurous!  If you see something you've never tried before, buy a small amount and look it up online to see how to prepare it.  (This is an excellent way to expand your culinary horizons.) Mornings for students, more than anyone, tend to consist of a quick coffee on the way to class.  I'm aware that it's not very realistic to tell students to cut out coffee, so instead of cutting the coffee, try to balance it with something healthy for that all important first meal of the day.  Time saving and still nutritional?  Make a fruit shake - protein powder and some frozen fruit with some almond milk, whip it up in a blender and voila!  Tasty, easy, fast AND good for you. On that note - frozen fruit and veggies are okay.  They may not be ideal, but if you're having troubles with food going bad in your fridge before you can eat it, opt for frozen. Invest in some nut butters (almond, cashew, hazelnut) and some tahini... A dollop on rice crackers with a touch of honey is a yummy, healthy snack while you're studying in the afternoon.  And it's easy enough to take with and eat in class. Learn to cook lentils and beans!!  These uber-cheap darlings are oh-so-healthy and just pennies a meal.  Make soups and stews in a crock pot, so dinner is ready when you get home (and you have left-overs for a few days.) Crock pots/slow cookers in general are a lifesaver.  Especially at exam time!  Pick up a slow cooker cookbook (even better if it's a vegetarian one, because vegetarians have scads of great bean and lentil options.) Good luck with the healthy eating AND with your studies!!", 8095, "CHiEKZrLaa", 1],
	60884 : ["I'm totally with you there, I'm in the same spot. The best thing I do is try to learn as much as I can about food and cooking in order to utilize everything.  Say if you like chicken then buy a whole chicken make ch chicken breast and use the carcass to make chicken broth and you can get two meals out of one chicken.  Things like that help, now if you're talking vegetables the bagged vegetables in the produce section are about the best you can do.  Avoid organic, it's really not better as most people would leave you to believe.  The best way to get good vegetables on the cheap is to find a local fruit and veg stand if you can.  Local produce is is always the best food for you at the best prices.", 8095, "QeP4TrxLaa", 0],

	60896 : ["The intend of \"marriage\" has never been for love.  It is only in the last 100 years that love has become a major consideration in marriage.  Rather it purpose was to create a stable environment in which to create and nurture the next generation of humans.  It combined the sexual, social and the legal rights needed to protect the family. A child should have the right to expect that they will be raised and cared for by the two people who created them.  Anytime you break up that institution, whether by the death of a parent, divorce, abandonment, or whatever, the child suffers for it.  There are countless studies that confirm this. In an same sex relation, procreation is not possible.  As such, there is no need to create such a relationship the social or legal status of \"marriage\".  It can not produce the one thing for which the institute was intended - children. Granted, there are a small of number of heterosexual couples who are also unable to have children.  Hopefully you are aware that is grounds for the annulment of a marriage of either parents wants out of it.  Because most couples have no clue that they will be unable to hae children before they marry, the institution has never forbidden such marriages or has it required testing in advance (something really not possible until the last couple of generations - and then those test are often wrong.) Because a same sex relationship is unable to produce the unit for which marriage is intended, it has no value to them and there is no reason to extend that institution to them. If two people of the same sex wants to live together, nothing in the current marriage laws prevent that. They in no way discriminate against such couples.  They just do not extent to them a institution that has no value for them or for society. Simple enough argument, with no religious overtones at all.", 8089, "AA11622701", 1],
	60897 : ["You're not going to find a cheaper more versatile carb source than oatmeal. Oatmeal you can get at Costco or Sam's club at well under a dollar a pound. In the morning (or whenever) you can have oatmeal + protein powder shakes (can't even taste the oatmeal, just chug it) to replace meals. Canned tuna is cheap, beans are too. Ground beef is on sale a lot, just drain as much fat off during/after cooking. Though oatmeal is high in fiber, other sources such as Green Leafy Vegetables should help give you a feeling of fullness while you are on a calorie deficit.", 8095, "JMP5Cc9paa", 0],

	60899 : ["I lost around 30lbs during my 3rd year of university. You are right about it being expensive to buy healthier food. However, I discovered some strategies that I use to today in order to make it less expensive to eat healthy. -Check the fliers. Stock up on frozen food when it is on sale. You can keep frozen veggies and fruit frozen for a long time before they go bad. When they are on sale, you can get a bag of mixed veggies, etc, for around $1.00.  -If your parents have a garden, get them to plant some veggies for you. You can freeze peas and corn, and potatoes, carrots, and other \"root\" veggies keep for a long time. -If you are buying processed meat (hot dogs and mac and cheese are college staples), go for the all meat or low fat variety. Also, ham, turkey, and chicken are better than balogna, salami, summer sausage, etc. Look at the packaging to see how much sodium and fat are in the meat before purchasing it. Also, cans of tuna, salmon, etc are still better for you than some of the alternatives, and they are cheap. -Buy fresh veggies and fruit that are in season. They tend to be a lot less expensive than ones that aren't.  -Buy generic brands. Usually store brands taste really similar to the name brand foods, but can cost less than 1/2 the price. It can be really hard to stay in shape in college. I used to take the long way between classes when I had time, and walk to school instead of driving. I also took the stairs instead of the elevator to my classes on the 6th, 7th, 8th (etc) floors. Also, check to see if your college gives you a free gym membership. We had an on campus gym, and had a membership fee built right into our tuition.", 8095, "wzM5WB8Xaa", 2],

	60910 : ["Being a recent college graduate, I think maybe I can provide some insight.  First, I suggest don't live in the dorms or eat dormfood, that will save you a substantial amount of money.  Dormfood is typically not only expensive but also unhealthy.  Also, as a college student, do not shop at Safeway or other expensive grocery stores.  If you have a car, drive to some wholesale foodstore like Foodmaxx or Fooddepot that offers the lowest possible prices, don't be afraid to use coupons.  Find great deals on namebrand food, generic brands are usually unhealthy.  Buy MinuteMaid instead of Sunny Delight for orange juice.  Learn how to cook basic meals, eggs, potatoes...potatoes are always very cheap..you can buy a big bag for 1.60.  Find other healthy fruits/vegetables that will keep you fed inexpensively and living healthy!  And talk to your friends.  Take whatever good advice you can eat.

Marriage before having kids and living together has been gone for years.  50 years ago it was terrible for a girl to be pregnant and not have a husband.  She usually left town to live with a relative.   If the guy down the street wants to marry his dog, go for it.      The moral absolutes are changing in America, gay marriage, gay in the military, abortion is fine, tax payers shell out millions to raise children without a legal father. etc.  Next Maybe a guy could have 2 husbands and 2 wives.

Since our current culture is so rampant with sexual promiscuity, we no longer see it as a disorder - which is disordered.   Many studies have shown that people with same-sex attraction have had many external problems - such as an overbearing and/or critical mother, a distant or harsh and unaffectionate father, childhood ridicule by classmates and peers, severe loneliness, sex abuse, bad heterosexual relationships and more.  The same-sex attraction comes as a result of the pain the person has endured - either for a longing for a father/mother figure, a \"safe\" relationship, a desire to be understood and approved by the same gender... etc.   There are many external causes.  There has been no proven \"gay gene.\"  There has been no proven genetic link. (It's nice in theory and there are studies being done, but nothing has come up conclusive... only people who want their theories to be right.\"   So what has this to do with a marriage law?  Would you think it wise to pass a law to let someone marry their pet dog?  No.  Why?  Because it's not healthy and the guy is suffering from something.  That's like saying we should pass laws to permit anything that anyone wants to do... it's absolutely absurd.   If something is disordered, then the person should be given loving care and help with this sensitive problem.  We shouldn't endorse the disordered behavior by saying that since many people suffer with it, it's \"normal.\" *side note - ADHD has also increased over the past 20 years.

It's not too expensive since it's going to be spread out over probably a month of eating.

I make a hellacious Asian salad from ingredients I find on sale - any items that aren't on sale, I leave them off and add something else. Start with Romaine lettuce, add some chopped zucchini squash, yellow squash, matchstick carrots, a half a can of drained mandarin oranges, a small diced tomato, and some form of protein (grilled chicken breast or thawed petite salad shrimp).  Add Newman's Own Ginger Sesame dressing or Ken's Steakhouse version (both are fairly lowfat and reasonable calorie-wise). Top with a sprinkle of toasted almonds. By the time you finish, you are soooo full, and sooo satisfied. One other idea - nuke a large baked potato. Add some lower fat margarine (or spray butter or the powdered type Molly McButter).
