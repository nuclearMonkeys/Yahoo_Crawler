	36710 : ["There are other reasons a man ends up paying for sex: - Disabled men often find it difficult to get a partner, or they can't have sex in a conventional way. - Married men sometimes find their wife stops having sex with him. He could divorce her, but then he might never see his children again. Or he could have an affair, but an affair is more likely to disrupt his marriage than paying a sex-worker. - In some cultures it is an accepted way for young men to get sexual experience so that when he marries a virgin woman he at least knows what he is doing. - Some men may have unusual kink or fetishes, and find it difficult to attract a woman who is into the same thing. - Some men are sociopaths and genuinely want to live alone, but they still have a physical need for sex. - Some men were hurt so badly in a previous relationship that they don't want to let any woman into their life again. - Some men are in occupations where they just don't have time to date. - Some men just want casual sex. Maybe they could get a drunk woman in a bar to have sex with, but sex with a drunk woman is rape. You make an assumption that any man who finds it difficult to attract a woman is a \"loser\" or a \"creep\". But there is a lot more to these guys. The word \"creep\" is really just a word for a guy who makes an approach to a woman if she isn't attracted to him. She will welcome exactly the same approach  from a man whom she is attracted to. Some men aren't very attractive physically. Others have severe social anxiety and find it difficult to ask a woman out. Some are socially awkward. Prostitution is prevalent because it fulfils a need in our society. Many women actually choose sex-work. Only a minority of women are coerced into it.", 5485, "sppePx0gaa", 2],

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 5508, "None", 0],
