I wore makeup when i first started working here 5 years ago but everyone on my floor is either married or gay so why should i put makeup on for them. But just like you once in a while when i decide to unchain myself from my desk and leave our building it never fails, i run into McDreamy pants somewhere.  My mom is always on my but about how i am going to meet Mr. right while I am at the grocery store, she is always saying how can you leave the house without your lashes or lips on. I just tell her if I'm gonna meet Mr. Wonderful he is going to have to love me without the makeup because we don't go to bed like that or wake up looking like we were at a Vogue photo shoot.

As I am very fair and there's a history of skin cancer in my family, I don't take any chances with my skin.  I usually wear makeup everyday.  And you'll even see me at the gym with makeup, but that's only because I go to the gym later in the day, long after I've applied makeup.

My rule in my head is always to look like you would want to look if someone unexpectedly took your picture while you were out.  I think about it that way because I see all these pictures in magazines of celebrities without their makeup, looking terrible at Starbucks, etc.  And I think to myself that even though I obviously don't have paparazzi stalking me all the time, I still would want to look as though I did, well put together and ready for anything.

	139302 : ["I go out w/o makeup all the time...in fact, I wear very little other than 'special occasions' or if I'm going out partying...some eyeliner and lip color is all I generally wear to work or out and about. My thought re: looking nice to meet men is: a guy we date is typically going to see us sans makeup at some point anyway, so any guy who seems interested when we're in our 'natural state' is worth more than those that won't give us a second look unless we're all 'dolled up'.", 11423, "AA11447210", 0],
	139303 : ["Leviticus and Exodus are both Old Testament. Romans and Luke are both new testament. Therefore you are looking at the prophets before Jesus teachings promoting the eye-for-an-eye way of thinking, and then Jesus and who-followed teachings of peace and love. So it is a logical and ration idea to think that MAYBE, just maybe God had began to try to teach his children in the way of punishment - do not hurt your brothers and sisters, or you too will be hurt. Alot like a parent spanking their child if they hit their sibling. However, given humanity descended and became worse as Jesus' birth approached, it's rational and logical to think maybe God altered his parenting technique - instead of using the back of his hand to strike, he decided to try using the inside of his hand to show compassion and love instead. So maybe he is not a hypocrite, but actually just a man who is trying to figure out the best way to teach his children?", 11420, "None", 0],

If after a couple of months of listening to said bands you still can't get used to the vocals, give up. It took me a while, but part of the fun is trying to work what is being said. I find death metal etc. to have better music because it's not the first thing I hear or pay attention to. So, start with melodic death metal and maybe Meshuggah then go to death metal. A good death metal band to begin with is Death and start with their newer stuff then go to the older albums.
