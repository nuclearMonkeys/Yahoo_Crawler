I had waited years between volumes of that one, and he put out some other books that I really liked. Lisseys story, the girl who loved Tom gordon, Black house and others. I began to notice how he has tied so many of his stories together with past novels too. The Mr. Mercedes trilogy was very good too. I think he's still a talented writer who still is on top of his game. I don't think the fountain of his imagination is drying up at all. I have to say though, that his recent stories often have some lame political reference inserted that does nothing to enhance the story, and annoys me.", 952, "7v8lt8gHaa", 0],

I've heard good things about The Institute but have yet to read it.   He's written a lot, and his work can be uneven.  Some of his earlier works weren't very good, like The Tommyknockers.  But I do think he's improved with age.  ", 952, "None", 0],
