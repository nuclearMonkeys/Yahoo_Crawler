However, it doesn't excuse Ribiero from slashing Oz across the chest. Osgood was complaining of sore ribs? With all that chest padding where the stick hit him. Must have happened during his perfect \"10\" dive to the ice. Knocked out for 3 minutes? He looked like a soccer player faking an injury. Rolled around the ice till he got the call, then jumped up as if nothing happened.Next time, Ribiero should just drop the gloves and go after him with his fists.", 9457, "yHvh7tFlaa", 3],

I do think black women and all people for that matter should be open to the thought of dating outside their race and opening up to the possibilities of love and not limiting themselves. I don't think black men are running to the arms of different women for the hell of it. Their is always a reason. Sometimes the reasons are good like they like the individual for them while their are other reasons that are negative like black women are to high maintenance, drama, have a bad attitude, etc., etc. etc. which isn't true; men who say this usually have a negative image of black women in the first place and low self-esteem.", 9456, "3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa", 4],

Also, just a few years later, the US went toe-to-toe with Britain again, and held their own.

	92857 : ["Live, in real time I didn't see osgood move out or move his stick to put it in ribeiro's path, I just saw the stick hit osgood after the whistle and he crumpled. At first it looked like the stick hit osgood in the throat area under the throat protector peice that he wears. He crumpled like syndey crosby or an NBA player but was actually ok afterward. During the replay and the aftermath it was clear that osgood moved over and tried to force ribeiro to break stride to duck the butt end of the stick.  Osgood could have done a lot more to interfere with or hurt Ribiero like trip him with his skate/leg or stick, hook/slash him, elbow him. Plus, due to the angle of the stick and the motion of ribiero this could not have done much damage to ribeiro unless he hit his eye. Ribiero overreacted by a mile by doing a 2 handed slash that actually broke his stick. He could have done a bunch of other things under the circumstances like skating around and running into osgood, starting a fight with osgood, waiting to the next game and doing something, etc. that wouldn't be so egregious and have such a potential for injury. The best thing Ribiero could have done is grab his face and crumple to the ice which would have easily drawn a penalty and given the stars some kind of advantage to take into the next game. Osgood and all goalies take tons of slashes anytime there is scrum for the puck in the crease so he probably overreacted to the slash and everyone fell for it.", 9457, "ddc16727255698711ce64b8c7d5e3b4daa", 1],

I mean I really think it comes down to you being comfortable enough with who you are and not what other people think. Men will be men despite what race they are, so why not explore the different types of men that's out there. I just so happen you be happily in love with my other half who is white. We have yet to experience any ugliest from people, but, even if we did (god forbid) experience it  as we continue to share our lives together, so what about what others say or think as long as our love stays strong, no one else can break that apart. But, I have to admit that in the past I have had some negative views on why black men choose to date, not just white women but women outside their race period, but, I soon realized that it wasn't MY negative views if was the views of peers around me that I just followed along with, that personally I thought if that's who they choose to love then who am I to object. I don't think interracial dating is for everyone but, I don't think you should view it negatively if you have not experienced it first hand.

The Dallas player disagreed, and took a shot - not at his head, but his pads.  I thought both players were at fault, and both should have been fined - and both were.  Frankly, like Ozzie said, it's over - game on.  The league handled it correctly in my opinion.  I don't think either player needed to be suspended.

	92881 : ["Osgood dove like EVERY goalie in the NHL would have, Turco included.  I seem to remember a little dive by Turco earlier in the game.  I hate it, but all goalies do it.  ALL goalies feel that they have some halo around them that they can do no wrong.  Anytime there is contact with them they whine, and usually its because their own players push the opponents into them.  As far as hoping for some altercations in the next game, I don't think there will be anything out of the ordinary.  The Red Wings are too focused to worry about that crap and Tippet will get his players focused on what they need to do.  He will not tell his players to run Osgood, because he knows how deadly the PP is and knows the refs will be looking.  Tippet is a smart guy and knows his team doesn't have the luxury of payback because of their 2 game deficit.  The playoffs are not time for normal physical retaliation, the playoffs are a time for retaliation on the scoreboard.  To win in the playoffs shows focus and determination to put out all the extra crap and focus solely on doing the little things necessary to win.  As far as McCarty retaliating on Ribeiro, I guarantee Babcock has instructed him and anyone else to ignore what happened and keep playing their game. This whole incident was ridiculous, Osgood \"might\" have had intentions to protect Lidstrom, but is definitely not without blame.  Ribeiro just let his emotions take over and he is lucky he didn't hit Osgood higher.  I would like to have seen Ribeiro maybe give Osgood a little punch or cross-check instead.  Slashes like that are just too risky, not only injury-wise, but also they look very malicious and are easily grounds for suspension. This whole incident reinforces my dislike of all goalies.  I've played against goalies like that in rec leagues.  I've really never seen that from Osgood... but I still am a huge fan of Osgood, and Turco for that matter (U of M guy).  The league just needs to start fining goalies more for their actions.  As a Wing's fan I have witnessed many of Hasek's diving antics, which drive me insane.  Too often goalies get away with things that would be instantly called on a skater, this is due to their perception of their invincibility and unaccountability.  But the league has a \"protect the goalie\" mentality and the goalies will have continued preferential treatment because of this.  Also goalies know that if they take a cheap shot, their teammates will NEVER allow retaliation no matter how \"gutless\" or malicious the foul. GO WINGS!!!!", 9457, "KyCJOR2paa", 4],
