	2108 : ["I can't remember when I last read someone say that the LotR was ALWAYS prestigious and critically acclaimed, let alone have perceived this as something people go on about continually. But you know what? While the fact that a work has been viewed differently over time might be some interesting data point, I don't actually care about this that much. I try to read books that I enjoy; what other people think (and that includes you) doesn't matter to me as long as it doesn't directly impact me. (Like, if a series I love remains incomplete because sales are so disappointing that the author abandons it, that would other people disliking it having a direct impact on me.) Someone telling me that what I read is crap is not in that category. I love fantasy, science fiction and horror, and you probably would call a lot of that trash, and that's fine with me. If you think it's trash, don't read. Problem solved. Your problem solved, that is; I never had a problem in the first place.", 331, "fgRkfYcoaa", -1],

If anyone--including the network, the writers, the actors, or the company that provided lunch--can recognize \"Dino Squad\" with some changes, you can be sued for copyright violation.

But if someone produces an ebook or print book, even if they give it away rather than sell it, the legal team at CBS will be on it. You will lose.", 332, "dYA8AerXaa", 6],

They RIDE like TRUCKS whereas the FORD tends to FEEL like a GROOMED CAR inside! G< also has VERY UNRELIABLE DIFFERENTIALS! i have seem more than A DOZEN of them! The OTHER one to consider is the TOYOTA TACOMA! it is ALSO built VERY VERY WELL! The DODGE HEMIS are FUEL WASTERS and the TERM HEMI is PATENTED to CHRYSLER! TOYOTAS are HEMIS and so are BMWS AUDI and HONDAS it refers to the SHAPE of the COMBUSTION chamber ONLY! NEWER FORD TRUCKS are made from ALUMINUM and they have ALWAYS been NUMBER ONE TRUCKS that keep their VALUES! Go to CARS.com, CARGURUS< YAHOO cars, and CARVABA to find GREAT DEALS with GREAT loan numbers for GREAT OLDER ONES! they even RATE THEM and have CARFAX for FREE! it si the BEST way to BUY I have learned! I BOUGHT TWO BENZ CARS from CAR GURUS and they were BOTH AWESOME but OLD! BOTH got 32 MPG all day long! BOTH needeeNOTHING and had PERFECT bodies and FINISHES! The TOYOTA is ALSO so very exellent! GM NVER gets thigns RIGHT and even NOW all their engiens in tiem wil LEAK no matter WHAT you do! They are NOT very efficeint! and teh GNM DESELS get CRACJKED HEADS! Use CARCOMPLAINTS as a guide or CONSUMER REPORTS as well! FORD is NUMBER ONE for GOOD reasons! Tehy FEEL like LARGE CARS and NOT bouncy TRUCKS! Try the FORD SUPERCHARGED truck USED!

Be prepared to look nationwide and pay someone to do a prebuy inspection. Don't get in a hurry.   Car Gurus is a decent website. Craigslist has a lot of scammers, so be careful there, but I've had good success with it. Paid ad sites are better with fewer fake ads.  Try to buy a one-owner vehicle, or two owners at most, only owned by middle age or retired person and never driven by a teen and not used as a work truck. It's worth checking for bank repos too.  Do not buy anything turbo-charged. Try to find a 6-cylinder Toyota or F-150  with manual transmission and under 100k miles. Those are the two most reliable trucks there are, cheapest to fix, they get around 18 mpg or more on highway and will serve you well. Third choice, Nissan Frontier. I've owned multiple examples of those 3 (all used) as well as all other brands over the last 40 years and Toyotas and Ford's have been best by far. To illustrate what's possible, last month I found a 2002 F-150 4x4 six-banger single cab 700 miles from me. Estate sale. One owner. Guy bought it when he retired. Only 85000 miles since new. Almost perfect condition. I saw it within an hour of it being advertises and called immediately. Got it for $4,000. It's worth 8. Was first caller and had to jump immediately but made the score.
