	8904 : ["Don't listen to all of these naysayers.  Although I was born here I couldn't speak English when I started school at seven years old. I failed first grade then middle school and high school were a pain!  I barely graduated from high school at age 19 in 1968.   A month after graduating from high school I took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB).  I enlisted in the Air Force.  I spent the next 24 years in the military.  When I retired from the military at age 42 I had an Associate degree in Computer Technology (San Antonio College), a Bachelor's degree in Psychology (Troy State U, Alabama), a Masters degree in Education (The Ohio State U Columbus ) and had started a Doctorate program in Adult Education at Texas A&M when I was reassigned for the last time in the military.  Oh, after I received my degree in Ohio I applied to the USAF Officers Training School and thus retired as a Major in 1992.  The government paid for all my education.  Those naysayers and those teachers who punished  me for speaking Spanish in school would have been surprised to know that because I spoke two languages the military paid me extra the four years I served in Latin America. Go for it Anonymous! Do it for yourself.  Don't give up. Be persistent!  I applied for the Air Force Officer Training School seven times before I was selected.  You are the master of your success!   ", 1426, "7JZjIhCUaa", 0],

	8947 : [" if you Google the professions that psychopaths tend to go into “Police officer” is always near the top of the list. Psychopaths derive gratification from inflicting physical and emotional distress upon other human beings. Having guns allows them to do that more efficiently.  In other words, cops get a kick out of displaying their firearms and terrorizing people with them, making them think that they're going to be shot and killed. Just like they did with George Floyd. Psychopaths have no conscience about torturing and killing other human beings because they lack of capacity for guilt and have no consciences. That's why many of them  go into police work. Some of them are also ex military because in both of those professions you can legally carry firearms and use them to kill other  human beings and you have a much better chance of getting away it than a civilian would", 1433, "None", 0],
