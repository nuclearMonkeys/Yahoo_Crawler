	42700 : ["Firstly, in response to what Sandy had stated, any idiots who actually READ your question would know you're talking about a PS3, not a PS5. So the price had already gone down dramatically to the point where you can get one for around $60 to $100 at most. If someone as stupid as him or her is gonna say crap like that, at least know what the hell they are even talking about. As other people had stated, Sony had just stated they will be making it so you can't buy any new games on there anymore but whether you can still redownload any purchased games is still unclear but hopefully that's the case. But anyways, its still not a terrible device to use & unless if I'm mistaken, the announcement Sony had made regarding all that PS Store/PSN, you can still use PHYSICAL copies of the games. Which means that provided you managed to track down a PS1 game's disc, it means you can still play it.  On top of that, the ONE thing about it that makes it better than the PS4 (not sure about the PS5) is that its actually very easy to transfer digital movies onto the HD provided you have a FAT32 formatted portable drive. Meaning that as long as you have a compatible media file (google it if you want to know), then you can just transfer it directly into your PS3 and play the movie onto it. Also, as of the time of this writing, YouTube still works on this console. Probably won't be for much longer as the device is nearly 15 years old at this point. ", 6189, "RRmqjm6Yaa", -2],
