If you're up for it, start flirting with a girl, even if you just become friends, you're bound to meet new people. Also, speak up in classes.. think about the people in your classes that seemed pretty well liked.. they all made their presence known:  if you're funny then joke around, if you're smart then challenge the teacher.. start a debate in class or try to distract the teacher as much as possible by asking crazy questions (it'll be fun, you'll have less actual work to do in class and the other students will appreciate not doing busy work).

Try Random acts of kindness, little compliments, be a gentleman. They compliment others, they touch others, they ask questions, they listen , they don't offer criticism, they don't only say negative things about others, Have you heard the saying\"if you can't say something nice, do not say anything at all\"? This applies too, and if you think  of someone you like who is a nice person, they probably do some or all of these things.

And then suddenly you have to make a decision to go on a small road trip or not.  That's a big deal.   It was just one of those crazy days it sounds like when the lines of communication get crossed.   Next time something like this happens you might try to slow everything down and ask if the other person can wait fifteen minutes or a half hour while you collect your thoughts and try to make a rational decision. It sounds like a teachable moment has passed but, you could say, \"Hey remember when you showed up at my house and I said I couldn't go but then I called and said I could?  Well I just wanted to apologize for that if I came across rude or inconsiderate.  My cell phone was dead all day and I wasn't expecting anyone to show up where I live and ask me to go on an awesome road trip like that.  So I just wanted to say thanks and I hope everything  is cool.\"   Then just leave it at that.  That might even be overdoing it a bit.  I don't know Don't worry about it.

	101548 : ["I spent many years of my life following how I felt. If I awoke feeling depressed, I was depressed all day. I didn't know at the time that I could resist these emotions. I had to learn to be aware of my emotions and know how to manage them correctly. One way to do that is by recognizing different personality types and knowing how they react differently to similar situations.  Just as it is often said that some personality types are more emotional than others, women are thought to have a stronger tendency toward emotionalism than men.  Emotions, as most of know, are a powerful tool in motivating actions. When someone does something that we don't quite understand, they might tell us to â€˜walk a mile in my shoes.' This is because emotion very often overrides reason and causes outsiders to think that one is acting in irrational ways. A person with adequate emotional intelligence takes into account the existence and power of emotions and sees the necessity in situations that others may find unreasonable. Emotional intelligence refers to the effectiveness of an individual's response to his or her own feelings or emotions and to those of others. A person with high emotional intelligence is very adept at understanding and properly responding in an appropriate way to the nuances of social situations. An emotionally intelligent person can use his or her understanding of emotion in harmony with good reasoning skills to make reasonable decisions while maintaining good relationships. A person with low emotional intelligence will likely misinterpret, deny or disregard the impact of human emotion that is present in virtually every social situation. A person with alexithymia, a severe state of low emotional intelligence, lacks the verbal ability to express emotion or to describe emotions in others. Those who struggle with alexithymia report to psychologists feeling no emotion at all, as well as a lack of dreaming, fantasizing and creative imagining. Emotional intelligence, like other aspects of intelligence, lies on a broad spectrum, with a large margin for normal levels of emotional intelligence. Similar to a test for a person's intelligence quotient (IQ), the level or score of emotional intelligence can be determined and analyzed for individual people. These tests aim to show how a person responds to the feelings of others, as well as how he understands his own, how he deals with social situations and the appropriateness of his response through a series of questions that mimic real life circumstances. Well hope this will be some good to you Elizabeth my princess xoxo  The best way for a person to have happy thoughts is to count his blessings and not his cash. lol", 9789, "None", 3],
	101549 : ["A few times more then I'd want, honestly. I remember one .. when we were all sitting on a ship, in the middle of the ocean at night. And then my friend kept calling out for help, but no one would hear, until finally I did, and ran over to see what was wrong. They pointed outside, and the whole ship was apparently sinking, so you know, panic, and all this.. and my ex was there, she's a Cancer too.. but that was a while back, I don't remember much else. I remember another one, where this lover of mine was in. It was late at night, and we were going back 'home,' into this little house, and all the lights were off, but, they had some blonde girl on their arm.. with this expensive looking white coat, and a short dress. It looked like we just came back from a formal event; And I set my jacket down on the couch, even though the lights weren't on.. and they kept 'teasing,' each other, and started kissing their way down the hall, just, getting it on, and I pretended like I wasn't there, and went to the kitchen instead to find something from the cabinets.. it probably shouldn't have hurt as much as it did, but I get jealous~  Surprisingly, I hear I'm in their dreams a few times too; but dreams are cool to talk around with, right? I had a dream that same lover.. walked into the room and randomly pulled a wooden chair along.. and I knew it was for me, but I refused to sit down. What about yours.. ?", 9788, "wXhlVuYAaa", 1],

And then he kept beating me up and telling me to stay in the basement. :C A lot of bad dreams I've had with my crush have to do with yelling, shouting, rejecting me and kicking me out...No cheating for some reason...I just feel horrible and left out.

	101553 : ["He has found the things in you that he is looking for in the woman he wants to share himself and his time with. If you believe that he is so good at everything else, why question his taste in women ?  The best thing that you can do is believe in yourself, be yourself, and let him know that he is the one that you want for yourself.  You must be an incredible young woman to have attracted him in the first place. Keep believing in who you were trying to be before he selected you. That is the person that you were happiest with and that is the person that he wanted to be with. It won't be easy to keep from changing who you were trying to be before him. You will be tempted to change yourself to please him. Don't. Be yourself at all costs. It will keep him happier and you feeling better about yourself in the long run. Only he can make himself happy and fulfilled. If you change yourself to 'please' him you will let him down and make yourself doubt yourself even more.  Do the things that you enjoy doing for him to make sure he knows that you are with the person that you want to be with. Find the little things that make him believe more in himself that you enjoy doing also and then share them with him. If he enjoys listening to you play the piano, then maybe arrange a scenario where you get to play the piano for him in a closed club or at your apartment where you could arrange a romantic experience to share with the playing. Let him know that you are selfish about him. Don't be jealous, but be demanding in the sense that you need him to be your lover and man. That he is the one that brings out you as a woman. Good luck.

If he loves you and he's as great as he is, a little bit of that self doubt can creep in at times. I have to warn you though, that if you obsess about it, it can and will ruin a relationship.  I'd focus more on the fact that your boyfriend is an amazing person and you love him to death.  Just be yourself.  Quite honestly, every guy I've ever talked to, and girl, says that the most alluring part of their partners is that they're comfortable with themselves and who they are. Someone who makes you laugh is a precious gem, and trust is not always easily found either! If you just can't stop worrying about though, I would DEFINITELY talk to him.  Don't leave it alone till it poisons the two of you though. He sounds like a dream, and if he's anything like what you said, I'm sure he'll reassure you and make you forget all about your doubts ;-) .  The best of wishes, honey!!

	101555 : ["Perhaps you should start by giving yourself a break from her for a few months as you seek the right decision for you. It's good that you limit the visits to once a year; maybe you should also either not answer when she calls or cut the conversation short if you accidentally pick up -- whatever you do, don't engage in a discussion about her many plights in life and don't share anything particular about your life. Sometimes using brief, noncommittal responses like \"Gosh that's too bad. I hope it works out for you.\" or \"I know what you mean. These are tough economic times for everyone.\" will help prevent long miserable conversations or interactions. Really nasty racist comments though should be addressed with \"I'm not comfortable when you talk about other races in that manner. Perhaps we should change the subject or talk some other time.\" Emotional detachment is so darn difficult to achieve, but it is important to maintain boundaries (and thus one's sanity) particularly when it involves interacting with an unpleasant relative.

	101556 : ["Children want to be loved by their parents. It is a human need. Having gone unfulfilled all this time, the love you need from your mother continues to bleed like a cut that never heals. At some point you must let the dream die. Write your mother a long letter, telling her how you feel. How you have felt for years and list all the times she let you down.  Write the words of your forgiveness on the final page. Tell her that although she hasn't and wouldn't ask you for it, you still forgive her.  Tell her you now realize there is something wrong with her and not with you. Mothers have enough love to give to every one of their children in full measure. And while you forgive the past, you will not allow her to influence your future. Pour your heart into the pages. Then place the letter in some fire proof place where you can safely burn it and do so. As the pages burn allow your hurt and anger and bad feelings to rise with the smoke and shrivel into the ashes. After you have cried your last tear , dry your face and look to a new day. Let your mother go. Don't continue to allow her to reopen old wounds. No further contact. If she calls you, set a mental timer of 3 minutes, provide no personal information, do not respond to hurtful or antagonistic remarks. Say goodbye, hang-up and go back to your life.
