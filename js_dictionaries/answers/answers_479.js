	26488 : ["Usually rats prefer lower spaces, although they're capable of climbing quite well. If you have an animal infestation in the attic but long periods of silence, you can presume that the animal, whatever it is, can come and go at will. It's more likely to be squirrels, mice, or even raccoons. The noises you hear are those of the animal moving around, making itself at home by eating what it can find or carry in, then rearranging your insulation to make itself a cozy spot to sleep. You won't hear vocal noises, usually. You need to do what it takes to drive them out, then seal all the ways they're getting in. It's important to do it soon, before they nest and have babies where they feel safe. My preference would be to hire an exterminator.", 4172, "None", 1],

There are no moving about noises And then it all goes quiet for about 2 weeks and starts again. Only ever squeaks. If it was birds I would see them on nearby roofs. They always check before entering. I don't allow birds now. I suspect a rat. No raccoons. I am in the UK.", 4172, "v5pkgfyOaa", 0],
	26490 : ["In my experience, with all of my babies, once they reach a year, they just...stop. My ball pythons and my corn all pulled this stunt when they turned 1 AND 2. She's not being picky. She's growing. She's almost being a \"moody\" teenager, LOL. Everything I've seen, read, and every person I've talked to have said this is relatively normal. My corn FINALLY started eating again after 5 months of turning one. One of my balls? SEVEN MONTHS. I thought the worst, made a vet appointment, but the week before he was due, he was out, curious, so I thought I'd try to feed and he slammed down two rats. Appointment canceled and he's been a good eater since.  I'm also assuming that it's spring in your part of the world, and believe me, it's also very common for them to not eat at all, because she has a little somethin' else on her mind right now: she wants to mate. My girl didn't start pulling the \"I'm not eating because I'm horny\" schtick until she was about 3, and that was another scare. She wouldn't eat from end of March till end of June. Now it's just a normal phase we go through and we will give her a pinky/hopper RAT, full of fat, end of March so she has that at least until she's over it. She is now 12 years old, healthy and big as ever. Just fed her 2 days ago and I know it's her last meal for a while.  So it's good she ate one, and keep trying (maybe after a shed would be best), but don't panic. She may not eat until June, like mine, she may eat the next time you try. It may take her a year to get on a normal feeding schedule, then she stops in November until March (not that it's not common, but *SOME* reptiles will still try and go into brumation, their own little way of hibernating, and not come out or eat during the winter months). She's not being picky, she's just off food right now. I have never seen any snake eat like clockwork every two week perfectly. They are still \"wild\" animals at heart and still follow their own schedules and ways of doing things.  *IF YOU NOTICE ANY OF THESE THINGS, yes, there is a problem: Wheezing, labored breathing, losing weight (spine is very noticeable), and overall lethargy and dullness of scales (when it's not shed time) time for a vet, absolutely. But I think she's being a moody teen butthead scaring her human, LOL. ", 4173, "0V875zvYaa", 1],

If the door is shut this may affect the temperature, possibly making it colder. -Is one room closer to the furnace than the other? Most rooms that are farther from the furnace are colder. Document the temperatures at the same time per day in each room. If the room is not warm enough, find a supplemental heater that is considered safe in a sleeping room. Never use a heater that could cause a fire if it tips over. Electric blankets are wonderful! If you are not eating enough, you may feel colder.", 4167, "p7ZdohGTaa", 0],

	26506 : ["What you need to do is to get yourself a digital thermometer. And you need to go from room to room and you need to record if there is an actual change in the real room temperature with the digital thermometer write it down on a piece of paper. If there's no real change then you know that it's all in your head. If there is a real change you might want to consider. Marketing yourself as having the superpower to be Mr freeze enter a room and make it cold just by being in it you can get paid substantial money if you can actually show this with a real digital thermometer. But it's my guess that it's just in your head because you have low blood pressure. When you get up and move the blood pressure temporarily rises and it feels warm while you're doing that. And then when you stand still your blood pressure drops again and now it appears cold. So try the test that I've talked to you about and then. Check your blood pressure while it's feeling cold. Get up and move to a room where you say it's warm. Now check your blood pressure again. When it gets cold then check your blood pressure again. you're going to find out what I'm telling you is the truth you have a low blood pressure condition or a slow heartbeat. After you've documented it on paper then you can go to a doctor and say hey look doctor I'm having a low blood pressure problem.", 4167, "G225L5Tdaa", 0],
