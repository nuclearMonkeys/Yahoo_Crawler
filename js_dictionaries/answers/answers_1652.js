Bush.  There were six candidates for President on the ballot in my state in 2008 and I didn't like any of them, but I still picked one that was neither McCain or Obama. The media sure realizes that Barack Obama is not a radical leftist.  They call him centrist all the time in their efforts to marginalize moderates and conservatives.  Do people realize that true conservatives did not support George W. Bush?  The only difference between Bush and Obama is competence.  Obama sometimes thinks for himself and uses English grammar.  Both expanded the government and ran record deficits and both are further eroding the freedoms on which this country was founded all in the name of security. Edit: ROBERT is exactly right.  I was very concerned when the most liberal man in the Senate chose the third most liberal man in the Senate as his running mate and called it reaching out to the middle.
