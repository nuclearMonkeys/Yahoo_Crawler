We are told the Recession is \"over\"!  Worry not...the 2nd one or worse is on it's way! He is not even able to relate to the word average.

Weed killers are absorbed by the roots and leaf stomata, and distrupt the cell walls in chlorophyll production, making it impossible for the plant to photosynthesize and grow, you are basically starving the plant by breaking its cells, the equivalent of ripping a human stomach or breaking the jaw...it inevitably dies one way or another from a lack of food.

The nearest other Solar System is 4 light years away which is the distance light travels over 4 years. Light travels about 300,000 km/s.  You can't exceed this speed and to get anywhere close 2 it u need an enormous amount of energy - something our current technology certainly can't obtain.

	83917 : ["It seems to be pretty common among these folks that they don't really have the kind of perspective you are talking about.  I think a major factor in their thinking and one which is a cornerstone of their belief system, is the notion that anything is possible. It has become vogue for scientists to be quite self-deprecating in this regard. Experts of the past have so frequently been embarrassed by placing limitations on the future of science and technology. In addition, I don't think you are going to find too mant physicists who will claim that we might have reached the wall -- that we are darned close to knowing the universe now to a degree which makes further theory trivial. This notion is outright heresy! Those who are unaware of some of the real limitations of the universe believe that any technology is possible and interstellar space flight is as easy for some as it was shown to be in Star Wars or Star Trek. They consider it unreasonable to suggest technological restraints.  After all, we have been wrong so many times in the past. IOW, I disagree with Smilin' Bob, who does tend to represent the majority on this.  I do not believe our understanding of the universe is primitive any more. Bob, what I'm saying is that I don't believe we have been visited and interstellar travel is daunting, if not virtually impossible, for any technology. My comment about what we know has little to do with what we can do.  I make a serious distinction between science and technology, here. I'm saying I think we understand enough about the laws and limitations of the universe, to make extremely pessimistic assessments of the probability of alien life being here.", 9141, "UkjnSyAvaa", 0],

	83922 : ["EDITED: I would like to thank you very much for showing your colors.  Evolution is practically fact?  Really?  Well dearest, perhaps you can tell me how evolution holds up when evaluated strictly by using the scientific method.   First, let's look at the scientific method.  It is when an hypothesis is identified, then data are gathered, based on observation and empirical evidence to either support or detract from the original hypothesis.   Can you tell with without question that you or anyone else was around 1 million years ago or more to actually observe evolution taking place?  Have you seen it with your own eyes?  Yes or no?   Given that the world's oldest person is around 115 years old, not 1 million years old, I'm guessing you have NOT seen evolution with your own eyes.  Therefore you have NO empirical evidence and no observations upon which to prove the evolution hypothesis. Evolution CANNOT be proven using the scientific method, therefore, it is NOT science.  And it most certainly is NOT \"practically fact\".   Since it is not science, what is it?  It is a theory.  ONLY a theory.   Extreme positions? She believes in the inalienable right to life as given by our Creator.  The Founding Fathers believed that so much they included it in the Declaration of Independence.  They believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Sarah Palin believes that.  Guess that makes our Founding Fathers extremists. Does Palin want Creationism/Intelligent Design taught ALONE in the classroom, or simply as an alternative to the philosophy (not science) known as evolution.  Chances are she wants it also, not instead of. By the way, the phrase \"separation of church and state\" is not in the constitution.  Read it for yourself.  The phrase simply isn't there.", 9137, "pDz28kqnaa", 6],

The North Slope creates many jobs for Alaskans, and alot of revenue for the state, not to mention, a lot of oil for AMERICA.  She is worried about having to close of that area to save an animal that MAY or may NOT be threatened by the ice shelves melting . . .

I agree with her actions, and commend her for them!  Would you honestly rather have to depend more on Iran or Venezuela?!?

Quite frankly, I don't see why anyone in the Obama campaign should waste a minute trying to help Hillary pay off her campaign debt.

	83940 : ["I'm sorry.  I don't find Sarah Palin's stance on abortion in the extreme at all.  What you seem to be saying is that anyone who chooses life over death is an extremist?   What I do find extreme is people who say, Okay, in nine months I wasn't able to make up my mind (weakling), and now that I'm actively giving birth to this baby, I think I've decided that I DON'T want it, so just grab that ice pick and pierce my baby's brain and kill her so I don't have to deal with it.  Yeah, it will hurt her, but you know, it'll only be for a minute and then I can go on about my life doing what I want to do.   Or just as bad, Yeah, I had the baby, I'm holding her in my arms.  She's three minutes old, but . . . no, I really don't want her.  Can you take her to the trash room and lay her on a cold, steel table and leave her alone and don't treat her - just leave her until she dies from exposure, let's say, anywhere from 45 minutes to ten hours from now.   Both of these things are happening right now in this country.  One is called Partial Birth abortion and the other is called Abortion by Neglect.    If you call choosing life \"extreme,\" what do you call Partial Birth Abortion and Abortion by Neglect?   Science has shown that the earth exited what they call the Mini Ice Age only in the late 1800s, in the Victorian Era.  Look up mini ice age and see what you find.  Isn't it just as likely that the earth is heating up to its pre mini ice age temperature as it is that it is 'global warming'?   If you can teach the THEORY of evolution in school, why can you also not teach the THEORY of intelligent design?  The truth does not fear investigation, so why are YOU afraid to let people have ALL the information instead of just a lopsided portion of it? Our Forefathers did indeed have a concern about Separation of Church and State, but as usual, the average well-meaning American, such as yourself, does not understand the tenets of SCS, but just use the phrase to browbeat others.   SCS simply states that there shall not be a State-run religion; i.e., the Church of England or Communism.   I am very concerned about books being banned from  a library, but I am just as disturbed that when I was a kid in school, you could go and check out a Bible from the library but now as an adult I cannot.  Somebody somewhere got the idea that since libraries are funded with public money, Bibles should not be allowed in there.  But . . . I can go check out porn on public computers at the library all day long.   Seems a bit lopsided to me.   I am a registered independent, not wanting to be tied down by either party and not wanting to get into fisticuffs over ideologies.  However, the fact that Barak Obama thinks it's okay to leave little babies to die alone in cold rooms on steel tables by themselves so sickens me, I cannot bear the thougt without becoming physically ill.", 9137, "8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa", 6],
