	128334 : ["Most likely. Many women experience heartburn for the first time during pregnancy — and though it's common and generally harmless, it can be quite uncomfortable. Heartburn (also called acid indigestion or acid reflux) is a burning sensation that often extends from the bottom of the breastbone to the lower throat. It's caused by some of the hormonal and physical changes in your body. During pregnancy, the placenta produces the hormone progesterone, which relaxes the smooth muscles of the uterus. This hormone also relaxes the valve that separates the esophagus from the stomach, allowing gastric acids to seep back up, which causes that unpleasant burning sensation. Progesterone also slows down the wavelike contractions of your esophagus and intestines, making digestion sluggish. Later in pregnancy, your growing baby crowds your abdominal cavity, pushing the stomach acids back up into the esophagus. Many women start experiencing heartburn and other gastrointestinal discomforts in the second half of pregnancy. Unfortunately, it usually comes and goes until your baby is born. WAYS TO HELP Though you may not be able to eliminate heartburn entirely, you can take steps to minimize your discomfort: •  Avoid food and beverages that cause you gastrointestinal distress. The usual suspects are carbonated drinks; alcohol (which you should avoid anyway during pregnancy); caffeine; chocolate; acidic foods like citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes, mustard, and vinegar; processed meats; mint products; and spicy, highly seasoned, fried, or fatty foods. •  Don't eat big meals. Instead, eat several small meals throughout the day. Take your time eating and chew thoroughly. •  Avoid drinking large quantities of fluids during meals — you don't want to distend your stomach. (It's important to drink eight to ten glasses of water daily during pregnancy, but sip it between meals.) •  Try chewing gum after eating. Chewing gum stimulates your salivary glands, and saliva can help neutralize acid. •  Don't eat close to bedtime. Give yourself two to three hours to digest before you lie down. •  Sleep propped up with several pillows or a wedge. Elevating your upper body will help keep your stomach acids where they belong and will aid your digestion. •  Gain a sensible amount of weight, and stay within the guidelines your healthcare provider suggests.", 10973, "9beba8fed80fbdacaf5a7958ad645882aa", 3],

America is controlled by people who have Zionist interests, many of whom are Jews, though not all.  And a great part of their strategy as well as money-making tool is the Holocaust.  They invented the claim of millions of people being killed in gas chambers, specifically 6 million Jews.  Through their propaganda through the use of pictures, documentaries, books, and Holocaust survivors that were told to maintain world Jewry, they have been able to sell this product to the masses at a high price and people always fall for it.

	128339 : ["The Mariana Trench (or Marianas Trench) is the deepest known submarine trench, and the deepest location in the Earth's crust itself. It is located in the floor of the western North Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Mariana Islands at 11°21′N 142°12′E, which is near Guam. The trench is the boundary where two tectonic plates meet, a subduction zone where the Pacific Plate is being subducted under the Philippine Plate. The bottom of the trench is further below sea level than Mount Everest is above sea level. The trench has a maximum depth of 10,911 m (35,798 feet) below sea level. Taking into account its latitude and the Earth's equatorial bulge, this puts it at 6,366.4 km from the centre of the Earth. The Arctic Ocean, on the other hand, is 4-4.5 km deep, which would put its floor at ~6,352.8 km from the Earth's centre, 13.6 km closer. It was first surveyed in 1951 by the British navy vessel, Challenger II, which gave its name to the deepest part of the trench, the Challenger Deep. Using echo sounding, the Challenger II measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 m) at 11°19′N 142°15′E. This sounding was repeatedly made using earphones to hear the return of the signal as the stylus passed across the graduated depth scale, whilst the timing of the speed of the echo-sounding machine, a necessary part of the process, was made with a hand held stopwatch. For these reasons it was considered prudent to subtract one scale division (of 20 fm) when officially reporting a new greatest depth of 5,940 fm (10,863 m).", 10977, "AA10396402", 1],
