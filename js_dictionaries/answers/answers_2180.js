	114792 : ["Usually only the belay stations are bolted. So that means the climbers puts his own anchors into cracks using cams, hexes or nuts", 10402, "mMFJrPbvaa", 0],
	114793 : ["Yes, it is safe, though not ideal. See the following questions: Where do you attach the belay device, from which you will be catching a falling climber? Where would you attach carabiners when clipping into an auto-belay? Where do you attach a rappel device? Where would you clip the biner on an alpine butterfly knot while climbing with 3 people? All of the answers are to the belay loop. The belay loop is designed for clipping into carabiners. The dual tie in points (of most modern harnesses) are designed to attach directly to a rope. As I said before, having a biner between the rope and harness is not ideal for the following reasons: 1) Adds unnecessary complexity to the system. More complexity increases the possibility of something failing. 2) I assume they are using a fig-8 on a bight and clipping the biner into that. If they are alwys leave it tied in, the self sinching knot can break down the rope faster. Also the force of any falls will always be on the same point on the loop where the biner is clipped to. This is additional wear on a single point in the system. 3) If they use one biner, they should use 2. Gates opposite and opposed so as to avoid the posibility of the biner opening while climbing. This also distributes the force of the fall over a larger length of the loop mentioned in 2). I dont really see the pros for have a perminent knot tied into the rope and attaching with a biner. Climbers should know how to tie a knot. There is NO reason to not know the knot. I'm in the process of teaching my 3yr old right now. Note: he cant even tie his shoes yet but can tie a fig-8 follow through... -Good luck", 10402, "None", 0],

	114814 : ["Climbing on El Cap is done in the \"trad\" or traditional style with protection (cams, nuts, hexes, etc.) placed by the lead climber into cracks, etc. and removed (\"cleaned\") by the second (or following) climber. The wall is usually climbed in sections or pitches generally equal to the length of the rope connecting the leader and the follower. At the end of a pitch the leader re-racks the protection removed by the follower onto his harness in preparation for the next pitch (or the follower becomes the leader). This is repeated until the summit is reached. Where it is impossible to place protection, generally blank rock with no cracks, crevasses, pockets, etc., then climbers may elect to place bolts directly into the rock as a means of protection. Needless to say, this is slow and laborious since holes have to be drilled into the rock, usually with a hand bit and a hammer, before the bolt can be inserted. Many of the routes on El Cap have  been climbed numerous times and bolts have already been placed where needed by previous parties. See below for information on various types of protection including bolts.", 10402, "FdjFSyU6aa", 3],
