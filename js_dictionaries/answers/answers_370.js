I surmised this was only the beginning of the end of unbiased U.S. global news and information media; turns out Nostradamus isn't the only one with foresight.  Yahoo was a quiet partner allied with The Huffington Post--a brazen outspoken anti-Trump global online \"news\" media platform. To read the headline by-lines authored by Yahoo \"journalists\" reeked of communistic propaganda. Had President Trump attained re-election, some Congresspeople complicit in the \"coup\" that stole the 2020 Election for Joe Biden would be facing felony treason and election fraud charges....and the \"Axis Allies\" of CNN, MSNBC, Huff Post and Yahoo would unite stronger in political opposition against Trump by shutting down Yahoo Answers far far sooner.
