	31823 : ["First, a couple of language tips.     Aircraft is one word.  There is no such thing as \"air buses\", Airbus is a company that manufactures aircraft, primarily airliners, but not all airliners are Airbus's.    A lot of the answers were very dismissive because \"Precision approach\" has a specific meaning - it refers to an instrument approach that provides an electronic glideslope.   I think you wanted to say an accurate approach,    I think I understand what you are asking,  Runways have a visual approach aid called a VASI (Visual approach slope indicator) that provides a visual reference o the proper descent angle to the runway.  There are several types of VASI, the most common one is two sets of lights at each side of the runway. If you approaching at the correct angle (called the glideslope) the farther light will lights will be white, the nearer lights red.  If you are too high, both sets will be white.  If you are too low, both sets will appear red.   ", 4884, "z3BxHrMpaa", -2],
