(note that most dyslexic dogs already think they're god).  i dunno, maybe it's one of those mysteries of life we'll never understand, like how they get the white stuff between the cookies. life is strange like that.", 9063, "AA11989316", 0],

	81380 : ["I should start by saying that I am not a Christian, but enjoy studying early Christian history. You are right, the Bible contains many contradictions.  For the answerer who refused to accept this, a couple are the genealogies that start the gospels of Matthew & Luke, which do not match - and the day on which Jesus died in relation to the Passover (Mark, Matthew & Luke all place the event after the Passover, but John does not).  There are others, and some more serious theologically but they are more complex to go into. However, these contradictions do not invalidate Christian faith.  If one accepts that the gospels were written by people then of course they are going to contain mistakes.  However, this does not negate Christ's message of peace and forgiveness.  If you are a Christian, then you would also believe that Christ's death (which occurs, uncontradicted in all 4 gospels) is some form of redemption for the sins of humanity.  As I said, this is not what I believe, but I fail to see how those contradictions act as proof or unproof of Christian beliefs.  All it proves is that the Bible was written by men and is not \"God's word\" as some fundamentalists believe, as by definition no document written by God could contain errors.", 9064, "Wqal5Queaa", 0],
	81381 : ["The Bible was written thousands of years ago, when people were completely uneducated. There were told things in parables and other ways they would be able to understand. There were also a lot of stories told in different ways to be understood by different cultures and then there were the different translations that could well have been miswritten. If you took your time and read the whole Bible, instead of small parts, you would understand it as a whole, which is exactly what tells you the full story.", 9064, "uZ881Ldmaa", 0],

	81393 : ["There are so many contradictions because the Bible was written by many people with different versions of the stories that were passed down by word of mouth for four hundred years before actually being written down, these stories are then reviewed by various other writers and they then put in their own reasoning for the importance of the stories and what the lesson is that has to be learnt from them and because there is actually no proof that any of it actually happened, these writers have a free reign to use each story to accommodate what they want the reader to believe, ironically, we have lots of information from Roman empire times but the Romans have no mention of a man named Jesus but we have records of gladiators and criminals and rulers, so recording these events was highly possible, we also have written evidence from three thousand years before about the Pharaohs of Egypt and life in these times, so why is there no record of a man named Jesus in Roman times, only certain battles written about in the Bible can be verified, nothing else.", 9064, "bqpdjkRoaa", 1],

I knew about the atom smasher, and I'm disgusted that certain people are so hell-bent on discovery that they're willing to risk those who it would benefit. Instead of fighting with each other, we should be trying to, I don't know, colonize Mars or otherwise make it so that we're not as dependent on planted Earth for our survival. It won't defend against everything (and I doubt we could pull anything off by 2012), but it would be a start.
