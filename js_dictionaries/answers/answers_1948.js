	103143 : ["Hi Sarah, I really understand your situation because my dad is alcoholic too and right now i am having the same problem as you do. And it's a great coincidence I read your question and I feel we are in the same situation.  Im 23 years old , I also live alone with my dad coz my mom left us for Malaysia when I was 6 years old. Right now, i left our apartment coz he got back drunk again yesterday night. I am staying right now in a rented room on my own but I am planning to stay for awhile in my younger step sister's place next week probably. My mom is now in Germany and she is now happy with her own family. Right now, i felt so alone. My dad behaves almost the same way your dad does. My grandmother used to live with us but she passed away last year and now it's only me and my dad at home. I am really scared when he gets drunk and more i feel tremendous shame when he keeps yelling at our neighbors or on the streets. He comes home drunk and last year he sold almost every electronic device in our house, our TV, refrigerator, electric fans,the kitchen stove,the air-conditioner..His has some bad friends asking him for money and they spent it drinking.One of those guys even broke into my room and stole my Ipod. He never had a job in his life and depended only on my grandfather and my aunts and uncles for a living. Just last month,he said he will never drink again but just yesterday he fell for his habit again and it breaks my heart. Sometimes I keep questioning why when i am trying to be a good kid.I don't want to be boastful but i tried to do best in school and i graduated with honors in College. I try my best to keep safe and even left my boyfriend bec. I know my dad does not want to me to be with someone who is also an alcoholic,yeah my ex boyfriend loves to drink too. I tried my best not to repeat our sad family life and hoping someday life would be better for me if i ever i get married. Well enough of my own story,  it's really hard, i don't know how i am going to answer you coz i am also looking answers myself.   They said counseling helps. But right now, one thing I am holding on to is prayer and God's help. I'm a Catholic Christian and i seek strength and help from our church and personally with my relationship with our Lord Jesus. I am sometimes question and ask God,when will all this end? Why me? But they said, there is a reason for everything why this is happening. But i am still miserable and don't know what is gonna happen to me in the future. I love my dad so it breaks my heart when he is wasting himself. One time, he was so drunk that he almost passed out outside our house and we need to get help coz he can barely stand up. It so sad seeing him wasted and i tried to endure the foul smell of liquour and vomit as we try to clean him up. But what's so painful is hearing him feeling self-pity,angry and miserable. I feel the reason might be because mom left us and he has no money coz he has no job. I have work now and I help out in expenses as much as  I can.  Dear Sarah, I hope everything will be fine for you and you will have the happiness that you are looking for. What i can say, is that I am sure God is happy that you still love and care for your father even if he is like that. It's easy to love a dad who is a normal great father to us but if he is someone who has a disease and despised by society, but we still honor and respect him.Know that God is aware of your compassionate heart and will never forget the kindness you show to him.You are an angel. You will be rewarded for your love to your father. At this moment, offer your sufferings and pain to Him and ask Him to heal you of whatever hurts you feel. Hang on, you can do it. Try to do your best in school. You need to have good education so you can find a good job so you can have a bright future. Seek help from friends too. You did a great job at 13 seeking help from others like here in Yahoo answers. Way to go! I'm praying for you that may God bless you and keep you safe and your dad.Pray for me too! I hope we can keep in touch..you can ping or email me at v-2annuy@live.com .  Yours truly, Anna", 9840, "pYE6qb6Naa", 0],

	103153 : ["My dad is an alcoholic, too. I'm 32 and out of the house but he made my childhood miserable and scary. I know how stressful it is for you to try to hold everything together when you don't get cooperation from him. It's hard to take care of someone who is suppose to be taking care of you, especially when they are destructive and unpredictable.  The hard part is that simply asking him to stop isn't enough because you're right, the addiction is stronger than anything right now. It sounds like your dad is using alcohol to cope with depression and anger and of course that won't fix it. My dad is the same way, and he is the fourth generation of an alcoholic family so he sees nothing wrong with it.  It sounds like the best results will come from working with your uncle, or a guidance counselor at school. The best thing for you may be going to live with your uncle even if your dad doesn't go to rehab because he is keeping you in an unhealthy environment. I'm sure your father loves you very much. His reliance on you is simply unfair. He's using you as an excuse not to go to rehab when in fact you are the number 1 reason he should be going!!! He is making you share the burden of his addiction when really it is HIS problem.  Good luck with your father.

Your Uncle and you need to have an intervention and explain to him that at 13 years old you are too young to be taking care of him and being his 'rock' and that it is an unfair burden to put on you. If he does not seek help, child services can/will take you away from him and he may never see you again. Tell him again that your Uncle is willing to take you in until he gets help. If he refuses again, move in with your Uncle anyway. I can tell how much you love your Dad, but for your own well being you need to be a home where your only worries are school work and friends.

I know you love your dad, but you cannot take care of him.  He is just using you as an excuse, to keep along the path that he is on.  Yes, he loves you, but this situation is not good for you at all.  You should not be his caretaker.  He is supposed to be yours.  Find a relative or a friend that you can live with for the next five years, until you are 18 and can make other decisions for yourself.  You can still keep on loving your dad, and he can keep on loving you.  Maybe your dad will realize that he has hit bottom and finally get some help, and maybe he won't, but truly it is not your responsibility.  Perhaps you should read some books about living with alcoholics.  You are certainly not alone, and you could benefit from the advice given in AlAnon. (friends/family of alcholics).
