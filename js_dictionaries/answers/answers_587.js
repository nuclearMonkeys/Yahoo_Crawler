	33159 : ["If anything he's underrated. Peyton Manning was always surrounded by elite talent, Brees and Brady were throwing to guys like Lance Moore, Kenny Stills, and Kembrell Thompkins yet still put up All Pro numbers.  I also can't emphasis enough what a shìtshow New Orleans was before signing Brees, arguably the greatest free agent signing ever. When they won the Superbowl in 2010 NO still had the worst winning percentage of any franchise at that point.  Also look at their roster under Aaron Brooks. Exactly the same team, they got lucky drafting Marquis Colton late but that was all Drew Brees. Instantly changed the culture there. ", 5051, "81wf0wBKaa", 9],
	33160 : ["It's all about the big tournaments for me so South Africa 2010 was bad, runner-up to USA in the group stage so got Germany 2nd round and totally outclassed and on our way home. Then next it was Brazil 2014 lost first 2 games(Italy & Uruguay) we're out already to rub salt in a goalless draw(Costa Rica)in the dead rubber. But the biggest disappointment was not qualifying for USA 94. Luckily for me my club side(Blackburn Rovers)were in the ascendancy at the time. It still felt like we were not at the party that summer though.(Horrible Feeling) Oh ye I forgot Iceland Euro 2016 I've tried to erase that from the memory.", 5034, "e99lvSBxaa", 0],

	33166 : ["I think we should are enough to focus on finishing in the top three, but that's it. Our EL games have been decent, the last two anyway, although we did have an unfair advantage against our opponents which I think played a big part, but if we focus on winning it and actually do so, then it's not the worst season. That being said, we still seem to find a way to f*ck it up in the semi-finals, but at least least year when that happened in the EL, it was against the kings of the competition and as far as I'm aware, they aren't there this year. We've got a much better chance of winning the EL than the PL, but even then, I'm not taking it for granted, as the English teams can cause issues for us, should we draw them, as well as AC Milan, who we're yet to play.", 5062, "92cb2sq7aa", 0],

	33172 : ["Not even seen todays game, but no need because I feel like I've already seen this exact game between these two many times before. It's a predictable shame United dropped the ball so soon because if they were just 5-6 points closer we could've had some semblance of a title race instead of the current City will win by x points. ", 5058, "cq22NZX5aa", -1],
	33173 : ["Don't know why United fans are so pumped about this. Are wins vs City going to win you trophies? Was it an impressive result? Yes. But it doesn't mean much. City will be league champions, have to play the EFL cup final, still in the CL and still in the FA Cup. Realistically they've a good chance of winning all these trophies. At this moment it looks like all United will be able to celebrate is second place and a win over City.  Like do you really believe this is a sign United have turned a corner? I saw so many fans online complaining before todays game because they knew United would turn up vs City but they don't bother showing up in games like the Crystal Palace one there other day. It's same old same old with Ole one week you're the best team in the world, the next you are losing to some side battling relegation.  So sorry if I think this win doesn't really mean much ", 5058, "q1BX2eXuaa", 2],
	33174 : ["Definitely much better today. I said before that this is the only game where I wouldn't mind drawing 0-0, considering how long City have been dominating, but great win. Great defending, we were obviously playing on the break, so you'd expect City to do most of the attacking and whilst they did have some chances, I think we stopped them from getting to close to cause us any real problems. Martial should have scored too, would have been nice to get a third and James' work rate is brilliant, if nothing else, but I think he always needs support, because he can't do everything on his own. Hopefully now, we can use this confidence to step up in our remaining games and at least be the best of the rest, no less than a second place finish, I hope. Let's hope we bring the same amount of work rate and desire in our remaining games, even if we have to play on the break, as stupid as it may seem to do so against the lesser teams and definitely against Liverpool - I'm so p*ssed off at how every team is beating them at Anfield, whilst we got a draw.", 5058, "92cb2sq7aa", 0],
	33175 : ["Idk Southgate has his favourites, Shaw has rarely even been called up by him. Based on current form then it has to be Shaw he's been attacking and defending well in most games recently. I think if Chilwell can hold down his place in the Chelsea team then he'll get in ahead of Shaw. Especially if England play 3 at the back because that's how Chelsea play. I think Man United have done it at times this season but I don't think Shaw has played there enough to win the trust of Southgate.  Also Saka of Arsenal can also play left wing back as well as on the wing. If he calls up say Chilwell and Saka then he doesn't need a third option at left back. Saka could get the nod for his ability to play in other positions. Want to rest Chilwell for a game? Put Saka at wing back. Want to take Raheem Sterling off for half an hour? Replace him with Saka.  So I don't know form doesn't always play a part in it Southgate really likes Chilwell and Saka and we've seen many players of many nations not get into their national team because of the manger having favourites ", 5059, "q1BX2eXuaa", 1],

	33181 : ["He hasn't. Look Lampard did a good job with Chelsea last season. Sometimes a new change in management changes the mood of the players.  Like a lot of Money clubs, the players know if they don't like the gaffer, perform badly for 3-6 months and he's gone. I do rate Lampard as a coach. I think he did well in his first season. However he took the Chelsea job way too early. He needed more time to make mistakes and learn from them. Honestly, a club like Newcastle would have been ideal as a next step. Somewhere he can make mistakes and learn his trade without the pressure. I hope he takes that sort of job next As for Tuchel. He has a history of making an instant impact. Klopp left Dortmund in 7th, Tuchel got them to 2nd. However he also has a history of falling out with the board. He's a modern day head coach, won't be anywhere for more than 3 seasons. I'll be stunned if he's at Chelsea in 2022/23.", 5053, "TdmTjKt8aa", 1],
	33182 : ["Depends on the match. I've seen 0-0 draws that have been better games than a 7-0 win, rare but they do exist. If you only like the attack and goals goals goals then you may hate 0-0, but may i recommend Basketball as a sport as it has loads of points per game. ", 5056, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	33203 : ["Football refereeing is going the same way as rugby. Every ref has a different interpretation of the rules and the players don't really know what they are supposed to do.
