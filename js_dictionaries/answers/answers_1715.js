	91431 : ["He was probably just defending himself because you were yelling at him and he felt that he didn't deserve it. You admitted yourself that you were irrationally angry with him for being in a bad mood at the airport because he was tired, then you kept railing on him about it after he spent the entire month doing everything he could to please your parents. Of course he was angry and felt like he had to defend himself, wouldn't you if you were in his position? Your husband is right - 90% of guys are nowhere near as kind and giving to their in-laws as he sounds like he was to your parents. Giving them gift cards, paying for five-star hotels, that is really generous and kind of him when he didn't have to do that. He treated them very well and then he was upset because you kept yelling at him for ONE incident on ONE day. Should he have tried to put on a happy face even though he was tired? Maybe. But should you have understood that he was exhausted and let it slide because he was so good to your parents for their entire stay? Yes. I have to say I'm on your husband's side here. He did everything he could to make your parents happy and you're still digging into him about a small incident, and that isn't fair to him at all. I'm sure you're stressed because of the pregnancy hormones and wanting to please your parents, but you have to see this from an outsider's perspective.  I know there are cultural differences and I think there is a lot more naturally given respect to parents in Indian families than there are in typical American families, but he's doing a good job and he deserves some recognition for how hard he tried. Don't compare him to other families who have the in-laws stay for 6 months and mooch off their son-in-law the entire time... just accept that he was very generous for that month and show him that you are grateful for how well he treated your parents. I think you owe him an apology, and the two of you should sit down and talk it out. That will relieve your stress and improve your relationship, which will be better for you, him, and the baby.

	91460 : ["You may owe nothing depending upon your state statute of limitations and the type of debt. If the debt is time barred, then they can not seek legal action to collect. If it is NOT time barred, then simply offer them a pay off figure and include a \"pay for deletion\" from your credit report.  Get it in writing before you make any payments. Try negotiating with them. In most cases, they purchased the debt for pennies on the dollar. The amount that companies pay for bad debt depends on the type of account and its age. In general Debts that have recently been charged off: 6 to 7 cents on the dollar.   Accounts that are slightly older and on which a collection agency or two has already taken a whack: 1.5 cents to 2 cents on the dollar.   Years-old, out-of-statute debts: A penny or less.  A growing number of companies are discovering that these very old accounts, once thought to be noncollectable, are just the opposite. Squeezing even a small payment from these debtors can make collection activities worthwhile. You will not be able to get the original creditors charge off removed from your credit report, the damage has already been done. Under Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c] this will have to remain on your credit report for seven years. The time runs from the date of the delinquency, plus 180 days. Example:   If a payment was due on an account on January 1, 2000, but the debtor defaulted, and never caught up to become current again, and the account is eventually declared a charge-off by the creditor, then the seven year reporting time limit starts running on July 1, 2000, with the item scheduled to expire from his/her credit reports on July 1, 2007.

	91461 : ["It all depends on what the agreement was when you signed the original obligation.  If you agreed to pay the debt and there was a clause (and there almost always is) that states you have to pay any collection fees, or costs associated with collecting the debt, then you are on the hook for all of it.  Just because it was charged off doesn't mean that someone can't collect it.  Depending on the state you live in, there may be a time limit that lenders have to pursue the debt.  If it's been more than a couple of years I would check your state collection laws to verify the amount of time they have to collect on a debt.", 9398, "AA11348979", 0],

	91469 : ["Hello, I think it's pretty decently well written - there a few grammar and spelling mistakes, but minor. My biggest issue was the introduction. You made a lot of good comparisons, but it really seemed like one big pity party, that we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards the character. When she talks about how people are in the negatives, and she feels no pity towards them because they made the decisions, I actually felt a bit annoyed. People don't make the decision to be abused, or raped, or to move and go to a new school. Maybe you did this on purpose, but it made me dislike the character a little bit. This I don't understand: \"essentially the undiscovered gem while I was the earthworm unnecessarily\". She actually seems like she is a discovered gem, considering how the main character is describing her sister as a beauty. You change from \"a lot\" - \"A lot of sisters don't get along and that is inevitable,\" to \"some\" - \"some sisters don't get along, and that is inevitable\" which is a bit non-consistent. Otherwise, keep working at it! Good luck. :)", 9397, "M7JO20nOaa", 2],
	91470 : ["Okay, you know your punctuation is messy, right?  Dialogue punctuation is very precise. A quick Google will give you that information.  I think you have a good start at a story. Try reading the story out loud. Fix the parts you'll know don't sound right, then read it out loud again.  I like the part about her being the \"gem\" and you the \"Unnecessarily elevated\" earthworm. Very clever analogy. Also, the part about her using a filter for everything that was said to her. You exposed human nature there! \"a complexion of ivory and roses\" put that in your own words and a frame of reference a teenager would really use. I'm thinking of zits, blackheads and those other teenage plagues.  Who are you talking to in this story? The first paragraph reads like an essay.  As if you were describing your own life.  Then without any transition you begin a dialogue between two sisters. So if the girl telling the story is remembering back to this conversation, then put your reader in a time and place. Maybe she's flopped herself down on the bed after Rosalind just left the room. After a conversation like you describe I imagine the air would be electric with tension. Maybe she feels like crying?  Maybe she wishes she and her sister would stop torturing each other with words?  That would transition your writing better into the dialoge itself.  Your use of the word facade. I reread your sentence and you're using the word properly.  Kudos to you. But, do teenage girls really use words like facade? Remove \"fourteen-years-old\" and just keep \"whose life began at fourteen\" I don't think it's too wordy. It's confusing for the reasons I describe above which are easly fixed. It's not unrealistic. I can hear those two girls talking to each other and sense the tension between them.  But most importantly I want to know what happens next!  I'm not good at too many things.

You owe the collection agency the amount of the original debt, plus the penalty fees and interest they charge you.  You can, of course, try to negotiate paying less. This usually works best if you can pay it all at once. Then you can ask, \" Would you accept $x if I could pay that in full today? They will of course try to get you to increase the amount. It is worth waiting to ask that until after you call them and hear what they have to say. Sometimes they'll offer to settle for even less than you might think.  If you don't like their terms and they won't accept yours, then hey, you're not forced to pay them until the court makes a judgment in their favor. That will increase the amount, though, with more interest and court fees, too.
