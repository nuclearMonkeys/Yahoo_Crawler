We wouldn't let a pet animal suffer, so why would we let humans suffer? To watch someone that was fighting fit only 2 years before lose their dignity, and her  life force slowly degrade is too hard for even for loved ones to bare. She considered assisted suicide and going to Switzerland (I believe it was), but we all talked her out of it. I think we already have an unofficial kind of euthanasia, but the doc can get into trouble for it. I would personally like to see it made 'official', and I would like it to be accepted in parliament, made law and official legal forms drawn up.", 9512, "None", 2],
	94528 : ["Yes, but the person making the decision should have a long track record of making independent decisions, being self-reliant, and accepting full responsibility for their actions. People who are highly dependent (or Co-dependent), who are weak willed, and who have a long history of evading responsibility for their own decisions are, in my view, poor candidates for legal and ethical suicide (which is not quite the same as euthanasia). Euthanasia simply means a Good \"eu\" death \"thanatos. I favor euthanasia, even in some cases when it is not explicitiely requested, but since it is against the law, and I am an oficer of the Courts, I can't publicly declare that it is OK. But, in a personal and non-public way I think it's OK, compared to its opposite which might be called kakothanasia --- a bad death -- a death in fear, and pain, and confusion, terror, and panic. This is the sort of death that often does occur in Catholic Hospitals where they strictly obey the encyclical \"Pro Humanae Vitae\" therefore refusing to intentionally hasten death. I guess their hope is that God knows best what He wants for the sufferer, and the natural death gives opportunity for conversion, and confession, which may not happen if a death is hastened by giving high dose morphine for example in a drip overnight. The best way to commit suicide or euthanasia is by nitrogren asphyxiation, with no specific notice to the patient of precisely when it will be done. The patient  is put into a deep sleep state. Then nitrogen at room temperature is substituted for the air in the room. There is no pain, no struggle, no fear, because there is never  a build up of carbon dioxide. The patient becomes comatose, brain dead, and then dead in a pain free, fear free, way, it's like passing out, actually its easier because it happens when the patient is already asleep. With no carbon dioxide build-up, the brain never alerts to what is happening, so the patient rarely wakes up. If they do, it's only for a second or two. This is not legal. I couldn't possibly recommend that anybody do it. But in the appropriate case, it is probably the easiest death possible, for those that don't mind violating the law. Very few corpes are sent to Attica for further punishment. You can only get punished if you fail to succeed in committing this crime. Well, the Pope and the Bogeyman might get you, maybe Beelzebubb or Moloch will have you in for a teaparty, but basically, no worries. Beyond legal , and efficient, it should also be fun, if possible. The one who is passing can really send out dated invitations to their wake. Arrange the flowers, buy the drinks, and pay for the decoration of the hall. So, it's like a reverse surprize party. The guests are the only ones who did not know that party was happening -- they find out at the last minute. Songs can be sung, ashes can be tossed out of airplanes, or speedboats, all kinds of approaches that honor the bereaved and celebrate their provident passing.", 9512, "None", 0],

I literally had teary eyes when she performed 'Someone Like You' to the crowd, and then they joined in also. When I saw Adele crying, it really worked me up. Then I put her live album, that came with it, onto my ipod; only to pretend singing her songs infront of the mirror ... Then I cried because I felt what she felt.
