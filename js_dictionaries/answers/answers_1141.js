	62551 : ["First, the most credible evidence shows that Obama (swt) was born in what is now part of Kenya, which makes him constitutionally ineligible to be President. Second, he is actively socializing the auto, banking, and health care industries. Third, he is actively requiring government approval of salaries in private companies. Fourth, he is actively spending (or \"earmarking\" spending for) trillions of dollars which the U.S. does NOT have, thereby placing two or three generations of U.S. citizens in serious tax liability. Fifth, he is actively fomenting economic policies (e.g., \"Cap and Trade\") which will raise prices, destroy what is left of the U.S. economy, and push the U.S. into a fourth-world status. Sixth, he is actively promoting legislation to redistribute wealth in the U.S., thereby creating a socialist (or \"Statist\") country. I could go on, but the above more than satisfies your \"What do you really,really think of President Obama\" request.", 8172, "None", 0],

	62561 : ["Another concept that has captured the interest of some investigators is that UFO's are superior beings that inhabit a “parallel universe.” According to this theory, these beings may be “able to manipulate the electrical circuits of the human mind.” With this ability, they could presumably control human governments. Some say they may be connected with “intelligences [that involve] the world's leading religious movements, miracles, angels, ghosts, fairies, poltergeists, and the like.”—UFO and The Limits of Science, by Ronald D. Story. The Bible also speaks of extraterrestrials, spirit creatures, such as obedient angels and disobedient, rebellious angels who became demons. Down through Bible history, God on many occasions used faithful angels to communicate with men. (Genesis 22:9-18; Isaiah 6:1-7) Satan still uses his demon followers to mislead mankind with all kinds of philosophies, fads, messages, communications, and cults that distract from the message that God's Kingdom, his heavenly government, will soon rule over a restored earth.—Compare Luke 4:33, 34; James 2:19; Revelation 12:9; 21:1-4. The Christian apostle Paul gave due warning of demon influence in the last days when he wrote: “The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons.”—1 Timothy 4:1. Keeping in mind how deep we are into these apocalyptic days, it would not be advisable for Christians to spend their valuable time investigating in depth matters of this kind. Rather, we should concern ourselves with the more important challenge at hand, that is, obeying the command of the extraterrestrial holy angel who proclaimed: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.”—Revelation 14:6, 7.", 8166, "None", 0],

	62580 : ["The use of the concept A.D. was started in 532 by Dionysius Exiguus.   This calendar designated the years from the calculation of the year of the birth of Jesus, which turned out to be inaccurate by a few years. The Julian Calendar which was introduced in 45 B.C.E. was important for its calculation of the months.  Jesus, of course, had not been born then.  The Gregorian calendar was made official In Roman Catholic countries by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 to correct inaccuracies in the Julian Calendar which had caused it to become out of synchronicity with the solar year by about ten days.  However, it took almost two hundred years for the Gregorian Calendar to be made official in all Protestant countries and it did not become official in Russia until the twentieth century. Today scholars use C.E. (=common era) instead of A.D. (=Anno Domini=Year of our Lord), as non-Christians do not believe that Jesus is Our Lord.", 8169, "O7zKc6jVaa", 2],
	62581 : ["The calendar we use has been around for several hundred years, the Gregorian Calendar, before that the very similar Julian Calendar had been around for over a thousand years. I don't know exactly when they started using it.  Our calendar is based loosely on the birth of Jesus, but is not really accurate, he was born 4 or 6 BC, so it is off by a few years. Previously several cultures had calendars, including the Jews, who still use their calendar for religious reasons, also the Muslims, the Chinese, people of India, etc. all have different calendars usually starting with some religious event or other cultural or historic event.", 8169, "gW0nD5cEaa", 0],
