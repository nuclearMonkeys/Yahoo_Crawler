	2352 : ["I'm surprised that you couldn't find anything about anaemia on the Net. It means not what you say the doc says. Anaemia means you do not have enough haemoglobin. That is the red-coloured protein in your red blood cells that makes them red and which carries oxygen from your lungs to all other body tissues. If you are only 25 years old your doctor should be investigating the underlying cause of your anaemia. There are a huge number of them. Ultimately, your doctor may need to refer you to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in blood disorders). Listen to your doctor and not others. Far too many people readily jump to the conclusion that you do not get enough iron in your diet if you have anaemia. That is only one of many possible causes. There are causes where your intake of iron is more than adequate but the blood making tissues do not properly utilise it. Make sure your doctor gets to the bottom of this, referring you to the specialist if that is necessary. Only follow her/his advice regarding your anaemia.", 357, "kz04oBhsaa", -2],

It is the best thing you can do for yourself. Could it be possible that the person never meant to harm you and it was an accident? Maybe you can talk to the person about it? If you feel that you have sustained damages, talk to a lawyer and see if you are entitled to compensation.  If this is a common occurrence, you might have anger management problems, maybe IED? Please talk to a trained psychologist in your area. They can get you help. Contrary to popular believes, many psychiatric conditions are curable/treatable. Everything is confidential, as outlined by the The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) act unless you are an imminent threat to yourself or someone else.

	2368 : ["The argumentum ad verecundiam fallacy is more specifically an appeal to insufficient authority, for instance if one argued that we don't need to wear masks because Donald Trump said so. Trump has no expertise on science and medicine, so appealing to his authority on medical matters is fallacious reasoning. However, appealing to the body of scientific research and studies is not fallacious because it is based on an authority that has credibility on the topic. The reasoning behind wearing masks is simple enough though. We wear masks in order to protect other people from any diseases we have that may be spread by respiratory droplets. It is the same reason surgeons wear masks so that they do not infect their patients. And the reason masks are so important for CoViD is that it has a significant occurrence of asymptomatic cases, which means people who aren't even sick can have it and spread it without ever knowing it. So we wear masks in order to not spread CoViD (and other respiratory diseases) to other people, and in turn expect that they will return the courtesy and wear a mask so that they do not infect us. The common misconception is that people assume they are wearing the mask to protect themselves, thus why you get people saying things like \"I don't care if I get it, I'll survive.\" Unless you have an N95 mask it isn't being used to protect you from contracting the diseases, the standard paper surgical masks and cloth masks all the stores carry are only meant to help reduce the spread of your own respiratory droplets in order to limit your ability to spread any potential diseases you may have so that you aren't infecting other people.", 383, "IWlrRgmCaa", 0],
