That type of weight loss is neither considered as being safe, nor is it even realistically a long term sustainable weight loss. Also protein is not as limited as claimed by one individual. No life as we know it can exist without, or put more accurately the chains of amino acids molecules, that are required to form a a protein molecule. Some lack sufficient of each amino acid needed to create, what is classed as a complete protein chain for human needs. Now if you want to lose weight, let's be realistic about it, and go for about fourty to fifty percent of that.¬† ¬† Now a quick interject here, two of the people that's posted responses has no respect from those who are vegans, vegetarians, and even among those of us like myself that eats meat. They've given themselves away on more than one instance as being fakes or frauds. Neither of them are vegans, although they portray themselves as being, on the rare times they show up in this section.¬† Also don't overlook a small crockpot/slow cooker. Those are great for making simple but tasty meals with. However while it can take a bit of planning, and this is from a non vegan non vegetarian, you can meet most of of your needs, and caloric intake, and not be heavy on the carbohydrates. The two key macronutrients to a sustained feeling of fullness are protein and fats. Also both protein and fats (preferably the healthy ones), are classed as essential macronutrients, carbohydrates aren't at this time. Which even there's some degree of debate over that.¬†¬†Granted generally speaking many vegans do really on carbohydrates, to help cover their caloric requirements, but not all do. Also don't be afraid of the fats, especially the healthy fats, and there are plenty of those available. High carbohydrate diets has had in the more recent years, become more increasingly linked to heightened cholesterol, that fats has been. Also fiber, but not to much, also has been shown to help with give a sense of longer lasting fullness.¬† The advice to buy a book on nutrition is a valid and good starting point. Also I'm not a fan of PETA, and you can find a plethora of easy to make vegan suitable meals online, without relying on PETA. But the advice to get a blender is useful. Throw in those with the small slow cooker (those can be picked up cheap at a secondhand store, and maybe a small electric skillet, and there's almost nothing you can't make, when you combine it with all of the recipes that those things can be used to make. A good well seasoned and savory three bean soup that you can started easily, before you head out to class, and be ready to eat that night.¬†¬† As for the suggested oatmeal I believe you can have a creamier texture using a good quality non dairy creamer in it. Made in the microwave, it doesn't take to long either. However my personal preference is using the old fashioned oatmeal. It has a much better taste, and a texture I prefer. However the one vegan that suggested the oatmeal, would perhaps know how well a non dairy creamer would work in it. He may even have a recommended type to suggest.", 6587, "MD1FznnXaa", 0],

	46127 : ["I am not trying to be sassy with you, but this is the honest truth here~~ just don't buy it. You are an adult now, you know right from wrong, and if you want to make a change in your life then it is up to you to set yourself a goal and stick to it, plain and simple. And trust me when I tell you this, because I am not just some skinny btch sitting behind a keyboard, I actually have had this problem. My place of work was about an hour from home, and instead of getting a meal for myself to eat before I left, and packing a lunch to have at work, I would go through the local McD's and eat that on my way. Every day. It got to the place where my health was in jeopardy. My cholesterol was through the roof and I was starting to show signs of diabetes. That was an eye opener. I had to make serious life choices for myself and it had to start with what was going in my mouth. I had to limit the amount of money available on my debit card to enough for gas money and I had to leave my credit card home so that I had no way to pay for anything, and I started bringing lunch. I am not lying when I tell you that just about everyday I would pass by McD's and I would be in tears that I couldn't have what I wanted, but That is the way it had to be if I didn't want to have a heart attack in the middle of work or on the highway. Not going to lie tho, I did stop once in a while, but for the most part, I was able to quit the fast food. Take stock of the foods that you like, (excluding fast food junk) and go online to some of the recipe sites and just see what is there that you might like. It really is not hard to make different easy recipes, and if you get in the habit of having a decent meal on a regular basis, that will help you stay away from fast food. And seriously~~ it doesn't take a lot to make yourself some of the things that you crave, and have it healthier. I make roasted pototoes in the oven and honestly they are better than fast food fries. Even just take a trip to the grocery store and start buying things that look good to you. You will be surprised at how much there is that is actually REALLY delicious and isn't junk. Don't overlook the vegan/vegetarian options either. I have learned that there are actually a lot of food options there that are as good or even better than regular foods. I will buy a plant based chocolate cheesecake once in a while that is so frikkin' good I am tempted to eat the whole thing in one sitting.¬† So honestly, if you are serious about this then put the honest effort into making a change for yourself. You can do this, really you can, it won't be easy but it will be worth it. Just try. I will leave you some sites to look at so that you can get an idea of what you should be eating in a day, and a recipe site that I use that has really good ideas. I am not sure if you are in North America but I will leave you both the Canada food guide site and the US food guide site. They are good common sense sites that will show you what you need for proper nutrition as an adult.¬†", 6574, "HE8XSehhaa", 3],
