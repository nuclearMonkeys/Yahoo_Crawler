When the front page of your home library fills up, it just makes more pages of library.  You can swipe your finger from right to left to see each next lubrary page (if you have multiple pages).  And from the home library page you can search for any of your Paperwhite books. Because I am a shopaholic and bought tons of ebooks at Amazon when they were cheap or free on sale, I actually filled up an early Paperwhite which had less storage.  It got really slow - I ended up resetting it to factory defaults so it was empty, registered it to my account again and redownloaded lots of my already-owned ebooks from Amazon (just a few hundred, not the nearly 2000 I had before the reset) and my Paperwhite was fast again.  Note - I use List View for my Paperwhite books - I don't need/want to see covers.  Here is how to choose List View:", 3742, "8vGq6cRTaa", 1],

COVID vaccine will kill some of the vaccinated; but the rest who survive it will not only become demon possessed, but their DNA will change for the worst; their immune system will be compromised; they will lose their connection with the LORD. Even before the infamous Filioque, Roman Catholic pope said that he's the head of the church while Orthodox said that Jesus is the head of the church. Roman Catholics keep adding stuff to the official doctrine that the Apostles have taught while Protestants keep subtracting from it. Book of Revelation curse is on Roman Catholics and Protestants (it says: woe to those who add or subtract from this book, right?)...Their part in the kingdom of heaven is taken away and they are sent to hell. Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays).
