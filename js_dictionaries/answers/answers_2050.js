Years later when I got married & took our kids, she was still doing this... I am so glad that she did.  She would put out the photo albums every year & we all got to see how we had changed from year to year. In 2004, her daughter took over the tradition and as far as I know, she'll be doing this again this year. (When we heard that the Hurricane was going to hit the coast, several families from North Mississippi came to the coast to save this lady, her family & the photo albums.) I heard from one of my friends that the albums are safe & will be on display as usual. I might have to go to MS for Halloween. So, if you want my opinion, I say go for it.

	108269 : ["Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is an anxiety disorder in which a person has an excessive and unreasonable fear of social situations. Anxiety (intense nervousness) and self-consciousness arise from a fear of being closely watched, judged, and criticized by others. A person with social anxiety disorder is afraid that he or she will make mistakes and be embarrassed or humiliated in front of others. The fear may be made worse by a lack of social skills or experience in social situations. The anxiety can build into a panic attack. As a result of the fear, the person endures certain social situations in extreme distress or may avoid them altogether. In addition, people with social anxiety disorder often suffer \"anticipatory\" anxiety -- the fear of a situation before it even happens -- for days or weeks before the event. In many cases, the person is aware that the fear is unreasonable, yet is unable to overcome it. People with social anxiety disorder suffer from distorted thinking, including false beliefs about social situations and the negative opinions of others. Without treatment, social anxiety disorder can negatively interfere with the person's normal daily routine, including school, work, social activities, and relationships. People with social anxiety disorder may be afraid of a specific situation, such as speaking in public. However, most people with social anxiety disorder fear more than one social situation. Other situations that commonly provoke anxiety include: Eating or drinking in front of others.  Writing or working in front of others.  Being the center of attention.  Interacting with people, including dating or going to parties.  Asking questions or giving reports in groups.  Using public toilets.  Talking on the telephone.  Social anxiety disorder may be linked to other mental illnesses, such as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression. In fact, many people with social anxiety disorder initially see the doctor with complaints related to these disorders, not because of social anxiety symptoms. What Are the Symptoms of Social Anxiety Disorder? Many people with social anxiety disorder feel that there is \"something wrong,\" but don't recognize their feeling as a sign of illness. Symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include: Intense anxiety in social situations.  Avoidance of social situations.  Physical symptoms of anxiety, including confusion, pounding heart, sweating, shaking, blushing, muscle tension, upset stomach, and diarrhea.  Children with this disorder may express their anxiety by crying, clinging to a parent, or throwing a tantrum. How Common Is Social Anxiety Disorder? Social anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder and the third most common mental disorder in the U.S., after depression and alcohol dependence. An estimated 19.2 million Americans have social anxiety disorder. The disorder most often surfaces in adolescence or early adulthood, but can occur at any time, including early childhood. It is more common in women than in men.", 10051, "0tNCtgzbaa", -1],

Before I would have started to hate him though, I began to change the channel before he went into a frenzy with his mandates. At that point I thought to myself, I'd be running after Daffy Duck if I needed insurance, instead... Then Lo and behold, that adorable, cutest as all get-out little lizard -gecko caught my eye.He is so smart and sedate and helpful and with that cockney accent...well..he just wins a girl's heart. I'll only watch him now, If anything happens to the loud mouth duck, I'll buy from Daffy. But the DUCK is a lame character, I hope somewhere in a Chinese restaurant, upside down, and fully ROASTED!!!

	108276 : ["It depends where you live.  I live in Wisconsin in a fairly small town... NO ONE would think ANYTHING of you taking a childs picture.  It is a blast to have the children come to your house and get to see their costumes. I do not blame you at all for wanting to take a picture of some of them.  Some really do have awesome costumes!  I guess it ultimately depends what you think your neighbors are like.  But, to be honest, unless you live in a cold city where everyone moves around like no one else exists, people probably aren't going to care.  Also, you do have that whole German thing to fall back on :) More than likely if anyone does think it is weird they would say, \"well, she is German, maybe she just didn't know.\" I would appreciate if my neighbor gave me a picture of my daughter (on Halloween, not from behind a tree in our backyard.

	108279 : ["I have been anxiety free, well socially free for almost two years now. I still have some anxiety issues that Im working on. I was diagnosed by a doctor but never took the medicine it made me worse. I didn't leave the house for 3 years, well I would leave but each time it would be one of the most scary and ridiculous adventures ever imagined.  It started with driving, we would load up(my kids and I) and head to town.  I lived a long way from town in a trailer with no neighbors.   Keep in mind that I'm 29 been married for 12 years and never ventured very far from my mom and dads house.  Now that I think about it, there were a number of things that lead to my full blown mental and physical breakdown and the social anxiety.  I can only tell you that I feel your anxiety and it is a hard thing to deal with and also to explain to people who are affected by your issue. Take it one day at a time, eliminating small reasons slowly if you think it has anything to do with your anxiety.. You can do it.  If I can do it I feel anyone can.. I was almost a gorophobic. Someone who can't leave at all scared of the world outside their front door...It was really bad. I feel better but not completely okay, I feel it coming on sometimes and its scary.  I just do my best without meds to overcome it and its not easy but doable...", 10051, "55KK5p1iaa", 0],
	108280 : ["dude your on the same road as me :) Ive put up with it for all my life, i was pretty much born with it. Horrible feeling!! i can say social anxiety is the worse their is as social life is basically life isnt it lol ans its gotta be put to the max i got prescriptions, didnt really help me, helped me a bit but like.. .it was still their, the thing is it isnt really to do with mental health even your doctor may say otherwise, from my experience its just the way your life has been constucted or maybe you were just born with it. But i know the feeling, i can really understand. Sometimes, if the medicine doesnt work, then just say to yourself, \"am i gonna let this stupid disorder control what and cannot do and experience\" its just a deal with it thing :( :( sometimes it can be linked to the past! i have a friend who actually completely got rid of it. I would strongly recommend you get a prescription, and do as your doctor ses, as my social anxiety was very severe. Depending on yours, ask yourself \"Is this affecting my life\" \"Am i coping\" If you have a \"no\" then i would go and see the doctor, the pills can really settle it for a while. :) I learned to cope with it as i eventually found the pills didnt work and i completely just ignored it and concentrated on something else, its hard but you learn from experience, And yeh, if you want my opinion, the medicine just like helps you chill, it lasts quite a while and you can concentate on what people are saying, the medicine is a good start, and will help you as your talking to people and learning to cope while the disorder is knocked out. But its not a cure :( you have to learn, how did this start, why, and find out what is causing it and eventually you will naturally learn to tackle it.
