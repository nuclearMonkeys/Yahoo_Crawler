I loved my kitten when we first got her, unfortunately she doesn't live with us anymore, but I really don't think you should hesitate about letting her in the room, our kitten used to sleep on my feet and keep it warm and stuff, (It was quite cute) or she just used to snuggle up next to me, but if you're scared I think you should just leave it for a while, you'll get used to her, As for the crying thing, Sheba (my cat) used to cry ALL the time when we first got her, but that was just because she was in a new place without her family, after about a week she started getting more used to us, and by a month you couldn't keep her away!

I know of no other religion in recent history that has been as militant, radical, and terroristic as the Islamic radicals.  Almost all terrorist acts have been in the name of Islam, all beheadings, suicide bombing, and torture has been in the name of Islam.  The rest of the world should demand an apology from the Islamic clerics, and a pledge for them to stop the senseless violence done by these so called true believers. The following was provided by another member in response to a similar question, it seems to reinforce the propensity toward violence. Ishaq:544 “Muhammad commanded the people to prepare for the foray [raid, incursion, sortie, attack, or assault]. The Messenger informed his troops that he was going to Mecca. He ordered them to prepare themselves and ready their equipment quickly. He said, ‘O Allah, keep spies and news from the Quraysh until we take them by surprise in their land.'” Fundamental Islamic organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and al-Qaeda offer the same prayer today. Ishaq:544 “Hassan incited the men, reciting: ‘This is the time for war. Don't feel safe from us. Our swords will open the door to death.'” And so it would be forevermore. Qur'an 9.5 “When the sacred forbidden months for fighting are past, fight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them, take them captive, beleaguer them, and lie in wait and ambush them using every stratagem of war.”", 10629, "9373072292dca9e7a17c182ffc43882caa", 0],
