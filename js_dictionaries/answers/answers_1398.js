I am sure this will not be a best answer for you.. 1. No historical or mythological evidence that Isis was a virgin.. 2. His mother was Isis not Meri.. 3. Horus never had a foster father.. Seth was his uncle.. 4. Horus was born in a swamp, not a cave.. 5. No official birthday or Horus ackowledge.. 6. Horus was born in secret, no angles no shephards witness. Find 3 wisemen in the Bible. It was later assumed to be 3 because of the # of gifts.. 7. No documented bar-mitzvah for Jesus. That is the first time I have ever read that one.. 8. Seth tried to kill Horus not Herut.. 9. No 12 disciples EVER RECOREDED, only 8 blacksmith.. 10. Horus died from a scorpion bite.. Listen, I can go forever with this.

	75544 : ["Yes, I consider that this terminology is correct and these are the reasons i have this opinion : for the duration of the short period of 1 century: 1. Democracy was born, meanwhile most international locations have been governed by way of kings. 2. All households (bad or rich) had been taking part within the religional ceremonies which used to be a part of their every day lifestyles (family gatherings,athletism,wars,theatre and so on). Religion was once no longer dogmatic, and it used to be free to be believed or not. Three. Arts reached their highest degree. - Human physique sculpture was on no account more best. - This century's architecture provided monuments of the international culturage heritage which influenced ultra-modern arts. 4. The theoritical foundation for theater and science (medicine, philosophy, arithmetic and so forth) were positioned for the period of this period. 5. The first \"historians\" began writing history (see Thucidides). (Prehistorians were known as logographs - i.E. Herodotus) 6. To my opinion the point which justifies this terminology used to be that for the period of this interval it was proved that : when residents have the freedom of speech and they participate within the public choices then \"golden results\" are performed!!!!", 8810, "IAJLPvScaa", 0],

	75547 : ["Slavery, spousal (punishment) and suppression of other rights came out of middle eastern thought.  They were not morals they were ideas.  Hence the reason Muslims believe in these things still and not Christians.  NOT MORALS BUT MIDDLE EASTERN PHILOSOPHY.  Slaves for the jews were not slaves but permanently hired servants.  Slaves for the Egyptians were slaves.  In the patriarchal society of the MIddle East, women were not seen as they are today.  When one would commit adultery punishment was seen as fit.
