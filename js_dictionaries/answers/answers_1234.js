	67233 : ["I think that possibly his personal doctor gave him something that could cause cardiac arrest. I mean, it seems very possible. Michael called him the night before and asked his doctor to come imminently because he didn't feel well. His doctor simply responded \"Go to sleep and I will come in the morning\" To me that sounds like the doctor possibly had a feeling of what was going on, but wanted MJ to get worse. The doctor is suspected of giving MJ an overdose of an injected pain medication. The only one that saw MJ die was the doctor, and after he was brought to the hospital, the Doctor suddenly disappears and is nowhere to be found for three straight days. Doesn't it seem strange that MJ went into cardiac arrest right after the doctor gave him that medication? I think it is a homicide. I miss MJ so much, i just can't believe that he's gone. Like his beautifully written song, he was \"Gone too Soon\" Rest in Peace, Michael, I love you so much, your legacy will live forever, no one will ever surpass the King of Pop!

This is what is will end up being unless it is stopped.  I have talked with an Aussie family anda british family.  Both are here and the wives are getting special treatment in the states. This is what they said and what you figured, but the people that can afford the better insurance will not have the long waits to get an appointment.  The ones like the elderly on a fixed income will have to wait.  All will be on the state run insurance program.  more doctors will drop out of the program, thus causing longer waits. I help a bunch of elderly people and just found out that if you go to a doctor that has opted out of the Medicare program, you have to pay them everything.  i thought that say the doctor charges $1,500 and Medicare will allow and pay $900 and then the gap insurance, secondary insurance or supplemental insurance will pay 80% of that, so the patient would be responsible for maybe a $180. unfortunately that is not how it works.  If they have to go to this specialist or a doc not in the program medicare will not pay a dime and the secondary insurance will not either.  this is unfair as the elderly have paid in all their life and should get the benefit of the Medicare payment. So this mean that the elderly on fixed incomes will have to wait and if it is life threatening too bad.  Also thin they know this and they also know that the many that can afford the \"cadillac\" insurance will not be using Medicare and that will lower the expenses to pay for the others and the undocumented ones. They say it's pretty bad and like a backed up emergency room as sometimes when going for an appointment they have to pass the long lines.  But Ii see how this will save them money, but really hurt the elderly and ones that are disabled.  It's sad cause it they allowed Medicare payment to the doctors out of the program adn the patients makes up the difference, allowed/made insurance companies cross state lines* and made the medical places charge people without insurance the average of the Mediare and HMO prices (70-80% off) then 75% of the problem would be solved and not have to bury the country. *30 year old in Maine, $800, same in NJ $200.", 8418, "yGXKYptjaa", 0],
	67253 : ["So wait, you're saying that since the health care bill is so long, it's not reform? Where exactly are you getting your logic there? That's the biggest stretch I've ever seen. As for whether you can or cannot insure your health, what you can insure is that you have decent access to health care. A company should provide their employees health insurance, mainly for the reason that health care issues cause the most bankruptcies in this country of anything. Where are you getting this 50% statistic? And what does it mean that the health care expense is \"related to our choices\"? What choices? What are you talking about? It's interesting you say that we can't afford it. Know what we can't afford? Spending 2.2 trillion dollars on health care every year. Know what we do now? Spend 2.2 trillion dollars on health care every year. The CBO pointed out that with the public option, the cost goes way down, and we actually gain money over time. You bring up diabetes as a lifestyle choice, yet it is not the main bulk of health care costs. And then you bring up the black community. Really? Do you want to start down this path? There is no link between race and diabetes. End of story. The fact that you're trying to make that link with made up statistics is ridiculous. And you say you're a doctor? I hope I never have to see you. If your argument here is representative of how well you perform as a doctor, I'd fear for my life.", 8418, "vccQdMXWaa", 0],

I know it is cool to say bo diddley was the first since he just died and all but really its probably ike turner with \"rocket 88\". but even that, which is often regarded as the first rock record, is kind of just another important moment in a string of recordings from various artists that bridged the gap from blues to rock.", 8404, "None", 1],

Remember.... he ended his career a fat parody of himself... crooning 20 year old hits to a bunch of old fat women.... He DID NOT invent his own thing.  He liberally borrowed things like his dancing from the Afro-American pregenitors of Rock, wrote very little of his own music, etc.  In may ways he was a studio creation.  One cannot deny he had a great voice, and a lot of charisma, but he invented little, and \"Colonel\" Tom Parker is who REALLY made Elvis a household name.

	67278 : ["The short answer is an actual bill is different than a draft.  In a draft, you can be brief.  In a bill, if you don't clearly define every term, you are going to be in court trying to settle the meaning of every phrase. Consider two of the health-care reform bills on the table. The House's proposal, H.R. 3200, and Baucus's America's Healthy Future Act. H.R. 3200 is about 800 pages longer than Baucus's bill. But it's not because it does five times as much. It's because H.R. 3200 is written like a bill while Baucus's draft is written in plain English. As such, H.R. 3200 includes a lot of stuff like this: (c) General Definitions- Except as otherwise provided, in this division:  (1) ACCEPTABLE COVERAGE- The term ‘acceptable coverage' has the meaning given such term in section 202(d)(2). (2) BASIC PLAN- The term ‘basic plan' has the meaning given such term in section 203(c). (3) COMMISSIONER- The term ‘Commissioner' means the Health Choices Commissioner established under section 141. Baucus's proposal doesn't. It just says the thing it's saying, not the thing lawyers need it to say. But when it's written into a bill, it will have all of that. It'll have wherefores and subsections and this sort of thing: Section 1171 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d) is amended -- (A) in paragraph (7), by striking ‘with reference to' and all that follows and inserting ‘with reference to a transaction or data element of health information in section 1173 means implementation specifications, certification criteria, operating rules, messaging formats, codes, and code sets adopted or established by the Secretary for the electronic exchange and use of information'; And that's not because it's become five times more complicated or ambitious.

Averages for the most part mean nothing, if one person makes 100,000 and the other make 0, then then their average income is $50,000 which doesn't sound to bad?  Unfortunately, its not the truth. Of course the problem is not solved simply by throwing money at the situation, there are far deeper cultural and community problems with a lot of the inner city schools.   That being said, the biggest problem in funding our schools is its a have and have not system.  Where I live, the vast majority of school funding is through property taxes.   This is how you get one school that has leaky roofs and no text books, and 10 miles away, you at a $100 palace with state of the art athletic facilities that rival most colleges (This is no joke, the really is the case) Do 1500 students REALLY need a $100 million dollar school?  come on.   Public school funding should be on a per student basis re-assessed ever 5 years for the district.  That way schools could have a consistent budget based on the needs of the number of students we have.   One pot for the whole state.
