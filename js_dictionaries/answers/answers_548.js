	30525 : ["Unfortunately, their wedding ..  their choice and being an attendant in a wedding isn't cheap.  Being a bridesmaid is a good $500 investment and if it's a destination wedding then throw the expenses of a vacation on top of that. If she's requiring hair/makeup/nails to be professionally done then she should actually be paying for it but she may not realize that.  If she can't afford it, then she should realize maybe others can't either. This where you talk to your son and your son talks to her but it's unlikely to resolve anything and may cause additional issues. In my own wedding, I didn't want anyone to have any type of financial issues paying for something so everything was a wedding expense to me, without my wedding these weren't expenses that would have existed for them.  We paid all of our attendants expenses (attire, shoes, hair, etc) and for a couple of them that included travel because they lived in another state.  However we could afford to do so, not everyone can. If your son has picked out someone who is high maintenance that is okay because that is his choice. Also assuming your daughter is an adult here she can address this herself. If she does end up having to do the professional makeup, I'd highly recommend doing a trial too.  My SIL was one of those demanding bougie brides who also required this and I decided to do a trial of the makeup job first and I'm glad I did because I ended up being allergic to the first makeup they used.  It was one of those before/after makeover pictures where the before picture was way better.

I don't think you have an obligation to give in to her demands, especially considering they are having a destination wedding that you are traveling for. You simply need to have a conversation with your son and his bride to be where you tell them in a loving way “We have reached our budget for what we can spend on your wedding. If it is vitally important to you for makeup to be professionally done, you will need to provide that, as we do not have that expense in our budget.” And then be ready to hold firm, because it may get dramatic and emotional. But the bottom line here is that you should not be going broke for your son's wedding. Assuming he is an adult, he and his bride should be paying for their own party.", 4685, "KESlvKqQaa", 4],
