	108077 : ["I think in some cases it is totally justified...depending upon the circumstances.  Last summer we adopted an infant through foster care and she has 4 siblings who are in permanent foster care with a biological aunt and 2 others that were adopted out as well.  We have direct contact with one of the sets of adoptive parents for her older sister (the other set of adoptive parents have since moved out of the country) however we only have only anonymous email contact with the aunt who has the 4 other siblings and no contact with the rest of the birth family.   The reason we did that was because the birth mother has contact with the aunt and sees the kids on a semi regular basis.  In the past, even though the aunt has said she would never share the contact info for any of the adopted kids, the mother has managed to keep her eyes open and get a hold of the contact info while visiting her kids and her aunt.  As a result she was charged with (and convicted of) attempting to abduct the child who's adoptive parents we are in contact with.  Not attempting to contact, attempting to abduct the child.   Given that, as well as the birth mothers drug, alcohol and other criminal issues we have chosen to cut off all contact (actually, not even establish it I guess) with the birth family of any sort.  They can and will get cards, letters and photos sent through the post adoption registry (although they have thus far chosen not to register) but other then that we will not allow any contact.   I don't view this as an infringement on my daughers human rights or the birth families human rights as much as a child protection issue.  There was a reason (actually, many reasons) why Social Services and the Courts chose to remove this child from her birth family and I'm not going to put her at risk again.  So, if anyone wants to accuse of us of being \"selfish in [our] desperation to pretend [this child] is [ours]\" then I'm fine with that.  Nothing is further from the truth although I'm sure some people will not see it that way. ETA:  Oh, and before you accuse me of being pi$$ed off that I wouldn't have my own children, my wife and I have had our own as well as adopted two.  Additionally, the two that we adopted are obviously different races then my wife and I so there is no pretending they are born to us that is going on around here.  Now, do you want answers to your question as those of us who are involved see it (on either side of the discussion) or are you looking for a way to sling accusations and derogatory comments? ETA2:  Lets address a few of your baseless accusations: 1)  The family is no less working class then I am.  Auntie works as an office manager and her husband is a Dentist actually.  Now, Dad on the other hand, works in jail and mom works on the streets.  They have been unwilling or unable to work out their issues so thats just the way things go. 2)  Auntie lives nowhere near a council estate but in a 4 bedroom home in an affluant part of town.   3)  If you are so sure I have changed the child's name then you would be dead wrong.  Her name is the same as when she came to us with the exception of her last name.  She is now part of our family with all of the rights and privileges that go with that, including our last name.  Her original last name is now a 2nd middle name.  4)  And yes, I do feel good about doing something for this child and that's nothing to be ashamed about (except in your world perhaps).  If you want to call it \"rescuing\" then that is your choice.  Since when it is a bad thing to rescue someone in danger?  I gladly call it rescuing someone and I also call it going on the waiting list for an adoption through social services and letting both the social service system and court system decide what is best for this child.  All we were there for was to make ourselves available to help.  There was no pre-birth matching, no solicitation, no encouragement for the birth parents to fail at their plan.  Only a safe and secure home for this child to go to when nobody else in her birth family were willing or able to take her in (they were all canvassed as part of the legal process).  We were the ones who sent her for her visits with her birth family prior to the adoption when we were acting as foster parents and we were the ones who were waiting at the door to receive her back when nobody from the family showed up to attend the regularly scheduled visits. 5)  And your comment regarding money is baseless as well.  The Auntie and her husband certainly make more then my wife and I do and to top it all off, we didn't pay a cent to adopt.  We were chosen from those on the list waiting to adopt through foster care so nobody was bought, nobody was paid off to move us up the list and nobody called in any favours There, that about does it.  I think I'm done with you now.  I'll leave you to wallow in your own bias and assumptions.  Its obvious your mind is made up even without hearing what others have to say.", 10031, "2wyDALHgaa", 22],

	108085 : ["It depends. I have seen 401(k) plans all of whose investment options were questionable. A good 401(k) plan is one that offers investment choices that fit various risk profiles, from extremely safe to somewhat speculative (highly speculative would seem to me to be inappropriate for a portfolio of retirement funds, but I see this all the time). It should also offer investments that are appropriate for bull markets and  bear markets. It should have investments whose performance correlates well with high inflation, and those which correlate well with recessions. If it is possible for you to prudently diversify your portfolio not just into different stocks (actually they will tend to be mostly mutual funds), but into different asset classes, and if your investment choices are good, then investing more is essentially \"free money\" because of the tax deferral. But do not contribute so much that your personal savings rate takes a hit. Remember that for most intents and purposes that money is tied up for the long term, and early distributions are likely to be both taxed and penalized. A qualified plan such as a 401(k) plan allows you to put more money away than you can in either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA in particular has some very interesting and useful advantages (remember it is paid for in TAX PAID dollars but there are actually advantages to the deal). Usually, your parents are correct and your boyfriend is wrong. But sometimes an employer-sponsored plan is so bad that you really are  better off on your own. By the way: if you ever switch jobs, and chances are you will, then you can roll the 401(k) plan over to your own IRA, and have more control over the money. You can probably convert it to a Roth account if you like, by paying taxes on it, and then your savings still grow tax-deferred, and you are not taxed on distributions! That is actually a very good deal. With a Roth, you can withdraw contributions (NOT accumulated earnings and capital gains) without penalty if you need to. It sounds like your Dad is a diligent saver, so you might want to go over your 401(k) plan with him in detail, so that you understand what you are getting. You might also want to talk to a qualified Financial Planner with GOOD REFERENCES. BTW: you are lucky to have both parents and a boyfriend who, regardless of their differences regarding where to put it, are favorable towards savings. If you spend the money now it is \"opportunity cost\" which you may dearly regret later. Ready money is like the king's command, and it will both open doors and save you from many sorts of crises.", 10033, "fd5aa9367e9b317bdb319ca1a6989e47aa", 1],

Before the adoption the BM was in the child's life for visits and she called several times a week to check on her. After the adoption was final she asked \"So now I get to quit paying child support\" we told her she had no further financial obligations to the baby but hoped she would stay around. Well that lasted a couple of weeks until she met a man online. She moved to another state and changed her cell phone number. We tried contacting her thru her mother when the baby had multiple seizures but not even her mother heard back from her A relative of her new boyfriend told us that the BM was trying to get pg. So I guess she has decided to forget that she had this beautiful little girl adn move on and have another baby.... Oh and the reason we got custody in the first place is that she left the baby alone for over 3 hours at 8 mos of age to go hang out at the local meth house...She let me adopt because she was tired of the court ordered child support.", 10031, "V4ZmZMNFaa", 0],
	108095 : ["For us this was not an option, the grandparents had no interest in maintaining contact.  Also, if the parental rights are terminated, at times it gets very tricky dealing with secondary family members. For us, their is a sibling out there of my three children, who were adopted by us last year.  They don't remember her very much, but she does indeed rembmer them.  We asked for time for us to bond as a family, and that was respected.  Now we have started phone conversations and soon will do regular visits.  Letting us do it on our time, was in fact doing what was right for the children.  Children need time to adjust to their new surroundings and to understand that they have new parents.  They need time to grieve.  Sometimes the grandparents/other family member may be a trigger for a child who was abused etc.  Sometimes a child just needs to be a child for awhile, depending on teh circumstances.  For us, we know it is important to have that part of their life, and by letting us do it our way, we were able to bond as a family, and introduce visits in a way that was best for our children with little negative impact, which will make the relationships last a long time. In defence of Randy, he, like I, adopted from foster care, and we paid nothing for our children.  Canada is different, it just is.", 10031, "None", 8],

	108099 : ["Urinating cats, especially in a house full of males, is always tricky. The suggestions about more frequent cleaning and more boxes are the first thing most veterinarians would recommend. Even if you decide not to follow those options, it's true that some cats want a very clean litter box all the time. Imagine if you had to use a toilet that two other people were also using and only flushing once a day. Cats are very clean creatures and often picky about this. Changing litter material (sand/clay/crystals/even cloth) may help, but my primary suggestion is to give them more of their own space. It's not clear from your description how much space you have to use, but three male cats in a place that is too small for three litter boxes is probably a strain on them territorially, which you realize. An easy way to fix this is to provide more vertical space in the house. Cats don't count square footage as importantly as they do good high vantage points where they feel safe. Cat trees take up minimal space as vertical installments, or if there is a shelf or bookcase he can retreat to it may work as well.  I would advise that you consult a veterinarian, as infections do not necessarily mean low volume of urine. You may also want to try a synthetic feline hormone analog, like a Feliway spray. This copies the natural contented hormone cats rub on things with their cheek scent glands and in some cases (my house included) can calm and relax tense cats. Just spray it along the walls or furniture where a cat would rub. It is simply a pheromone mixed with alcohol and does not stain or leave a detectable smell to humans after it evaporates.", 10032, "None", 0],

	108102 : ["I think there ARE circumstances where cutting off the biological grandparents is warranted, when it is NOT in the best interest of the child to have continued contact.  When the safety of the child is in question, then absolutely, the APs are justified in doing whatever it takes to protect their child. Whenever it is appropriate, when the child is not in danger by contact, then I think contact should be maintained.   You're presenting this very one-sided: that it's the selfish, desperate, greedy, infertile adoptive parents that are tweaking their mustaches and taking time out from tying helpless maidens to railroad tracks in order to rip apart this family.  The real situation is probably a LOT more complicated than that, but it doesn't sound like you're willing to do the legwork or even give the APs the benefit of the doubt enough to do the research and see what the individual circumstances actually are. No wonder so many adoptive parents disregard these rants.", 10031, "a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa", 8],
	108103 : ["Its depends on the child and the childs ability to cope with the extended family. You must realize a child needs a healthy environment to grow up in; if the extended family starts to meddle then its in the best interests of the child to at least cut off face-to-face contact. If one wants to maintain contact solely via snail mail so be it. if the grand parents and other family are decent and honest people who don't meddle then you still would have to determine whether its in the best interests of the child. Remember every child has their own personality; some will be able to cope some wont. \"If you have the money, nothing is unavailable in this country.\" Shazam, well gollee, surprise, surprise, surprise! toots you dont need money to gain anything in this world. knowledge and people skills go a long way.", 10031, "b4bce65e3c75e7df92929641ccca6247aa", 1],

Its just denying the child their heritage, and forcing them to sever with their past life. Who are the adoptive parents to decide this? Its disgusting, the whole system is messed up.", 10031, "vNSKG4aiaa", -2],
