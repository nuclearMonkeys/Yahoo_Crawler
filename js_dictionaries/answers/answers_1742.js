Too many people try to make this a political issue and that makes it harder for those people to see what they really have. Without the side-ways glances and blatant stares they might make a wonderful couple, but many give up on love because narrow-minded people harass them to conform.", 9456, "0f237781900fdd41630c98d7ea332b88aa", 0],

	92801 : ["I always believed that the ICC ranking system is unfair.  But, they have some system of points, and it applies to each and every player. Edit: The biggest problem with it is it gives too much importance to current performance. I made this point much earlier in an answer to a question, and was given too many thumbs down.

	92812 : ["Interracial dating between any race of people is not all that common anywhere in the world contrary to popular belief.  As for white women dating black men, there are many reasons why: 1.  Rebellion 2.  It's become socially acceptable to have a black bf while young.  You see it in movies, tv shows, etc all the time so no stigma attached to it for high school and university age people; 3.  They grow up in predominantly black neighborhoods and that's what's around; 4.  They fell in love; 5.  They're not worried about being maintained by a man as they are able to maintain  themselves...though it doesn't follow that just because a man is black he's broke or just because a man is white he's rolling in it.  Should I assume that every Asian woman I see is only interested in the man she's with in so far as he can 'maintain' her but will be out of the door the second he can't? Why don't you ask one of them the next time you see one walking with her bf?", 9456, "fKPHLjYPaa", 0],

	92814 : ["I think Ozzie has the ability to do it, but realistically I don't see it happening. Ozzie is amazing in goal (my favorite player), but with the Pens going back home, I have the feeling that they're going to pick up a little bit of momentum.  Of course, even though the Pens are great at home, I think they're underestimating the fact that the Wings are a great road team too and aren't going to back down at this point.  It should be interesting. Go Ozzie!!! Go Wings!!!", 9457, "n0yYMQ2naa", 0],
	92815 : ["First, I'd love to say that I enjoy reading all of the posts from Pittsburgh fans! They're talking as if the Pens have illustrated any sort of power here in the finals. Fleury has allowed 7 goals in 2 games. It's not totally his fault seeing as how he's faced 70 shots, giving him a mediocre .900 save %, but a 3.50 GAA isn't going to cut it. So before you even ATTEMPT at trashing Osgood, look at your own boy that can't even step out onto the ice before falling over! As for Ozzie pulling 4 in a row, it's a slim shot. He hasn't faced a slew of shots, but he is still perfect in the series so far! Add the two games together, and he has stuffed 41 shots! That's a damn good performance, and no Pitt fan can deny it! However, a valid point is that the next two shutouts would have to come in Mellon arena. I just don't think it's likely, but it's definately not impossible. Basically, we have to see what the Pen's can put together at home, although I feel their frustrations are just going to be heightened when they lose game 3. I think Ozzie can pull out one more shutout before the Cup is won, but it won't be consecutive.", 9457, "cbdeb64f97f05d48aaa09e1f49920046aa", 0],

Alternator try. touch the battery terminals with an inexpensive volt meter set @ 20 volts with the engine working. typical alternator charging voltage might desire to be 13.5 -14.2 volts. #2. Alternator try. Have the battery load examined at any shop different than automobile Zone. A battery load try will tell the reserve amperage means. A battery can \"seem\" to be completely charged @ 12.6 volts yet might have little or no amperage means. Amperage spins starter vehicles not volts. #3. Starter try. If the battery and alternator are the two solid however the starter nonetheless spins slowly, a depended on inner maximum mechanic might desire to do a starter amp draw try on it to be certain if it is going to get replaced.

	92830 : ["What's happened is that fewer black men have been 'socially castrated' compared to white men.  A greater percentage of white men work in positions where they have to be careful about what they say, and they live in fear of losing their jobs as a result of sexual harassment.  A greater number of black men by contrast work in positions where they don't care if they get fired since the job is pretty crummy anyway, so they have less fear about acting 'naturally masculine' around women.   White women respect and are drawn to the black men's boldness and masculinity even though those traits can harm the black man's chances of vocational and financial advancement.  So the white women are trading the black men's material success for his qualities of taking charge, and being able to say whatever is on his mind.   White men are more likely to live and die to please other white people in power than black men are.  Many black men surmise that since they will never be fully accepted into the white power elite community, then why should they care what white people think of them.  They figure that they may as well live life on their own terms.  This attitude is often projected in hip hop music.  A number of white women are attracted to these 'counter-authority' black men who don't bend over to please the people in power.

I'm Black, and not into Black guys even though many girls are now. Honestly, I'm thinking about my future and I find that many Black guys I meet don't have much to offer as far as being future fathers or husbands, so I just didn't find much appealing about them, I see no reason to waste time on men who can get easy sex from other women, and I'm not giving it to them, lol.
