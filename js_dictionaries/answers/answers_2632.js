I was really impressed by what he was capable of doing, and he deserved that win because the WWE stopped his push for a while. Although he may not win at WM, its good to at least see him in WM. That fall he took was VERY hard, third time i went OMG while watching wrestling this week. The first being when Undertaker said it was gonna be a streak vs career match, and 2nd when Jericho slammed Bryan Daniel against the announcer table. Morrison however will definitely be one of the people  in the MITB, he will probably qualify the next week or so. Theres 8 superstars, it looks like itl be 4 from RAW and 4 from SD.  I gave SD an 8/10. Good matches, and once again, SD beat RAW in another consecutive week.", 11354, "dBnzq5Wlaa", 1],
