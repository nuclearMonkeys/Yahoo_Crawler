Bush tried his best to antagonize and restoke disagreements with Russia - including installing missiles right at their doorstep (which the people of Poland would vote immediately AGAINST if given the chance in Democratic elections, but the officials who have already received their bribes from Bush and Cheney aides won't allow the elections to happen!) The UN is probably the only thing standing between us and eventual nuclear war, and provides a valuable platform to rally support fo the fight against terrorism.

	95207 : ["There's a question that I don't understand. Why are more those who act/speak like the mainstream become more successful? Because they've aligned themselves with and are more acceptable to those who are in the majority. I'm Haitian-American. Growing up, I felt like Ugly Betty, and actually, all these years later, I still do. I could never figure out 'the code'. The right clothes, hair, language. I learned Standard English quick enough, but then it was \"TOO correct\" for both blacks and whites. They often made fun of and still comment on the way I speak English. I get along best with other bi-cultural Americans. They've had similar experiences growing up in 2 worlds: one at home and one in the larger community.", 9537, "GKZo8lgLaa", 0],
	95208 : ["Truly some great points being made. There is an often told story of crabs...when many of them are placed into a single bucket the tendency to pull escaping crabs back into the bucket is typical. In other words, as one crab manages to make it to the top of the stack and then begins to reach for the edge of the bucket the remaining crabs will grab him and pull him back down. This behavior can be observed in humans as well and it is not limited by race, it occurs within families and peer groups as well. I really feel it has to do with perspective and focus.  When one sees self as worthy, as valuable, others who do not see the same in themselves will be challenged by the differing perspective. It is difficult to experience another person doing the very thing you know deep inside you can and should do.  Add to this ones peers and if you do actually begin to make different choices your peers will begin to resent that fact. Ultimately this can cause a lot of social friction both with others and self.  Gaining new friends, losing old friends, redefining old relationships. A balance, albeit one with a low expectation, has been changed and each of those affected will either come to terms with the change or not. Why this happens is not as important as supporting those who really want a different quality of life.  Do they have the tools to manage the challenges that such a change will present. This is a part of human nature and can be observed in all races and religions. It is great to see such a powerful question asked in such an open way.

	95213 : ["I have mixed views. -The American country has a dominate \"white\" society. So white cultural influence such as lawyers and low body mass have effected the \"minority\" groups in terms of ways of thinking and behaving. Proper \"edict\" and unnecessary rules have seem to be adapted from European society. Such example of unnecessary rules are suits at office meeting. It is as if if other cultures do not submit to the European way of life they are considered \"inferior\" and \"idiotic\". Old supremest viewpoints that one culture is superior to th rest. And that if that the dominate race's traditions that are not followed than the rebel race is considered inferior. Or -African Americana's have not realized their true educational potential. Alot of Africans ARE intelligent but they use it in the wrong way. Some use it to participate in the illegal drug trade. Some use it to ditch school. We can do alot better and surpass the standard set as to what WE can do.  All races have their shortcomings and no one is perfect. We cannot judge a whole community by its worse members. However the African American as a whole CAN do alot more. I have seen black people when they want to, succeed with ease. We have to work together.", 9537, "B4Z9ngataa", 2],

	95215 : ["Maybe because of the prejudice in the past and oppression, many experienced difficulties with higher education, college, etc... and many have come to feel that no matter how hard they try, it's not worth it.

	95217 : ["It sounds like you're projecting your short sightedness onto other people. Money is a means to an end. And independent Americans like to use their resources - including money - to solve real world problems. That's what an American business is supposed to be; someone provides a good or service to people, in exchange for money, which gets reinvested in the business, so that they can keep doing what they already do better and for more people. It's all so we can solve problems and make life better for everyone around us. On our own, and for no better reason ultimately than because we really want to. People are, by and large, a lot better than you're giving them credit. A man's purpose, according to an American, is up to that man to decide. Human beings don't have any purpose assigned to them by other human beings. It's a little sad that you've accepted a philosophy where someone else gets to tell you what you're for, and I'm sorry this concept of being able to not only pursue your own goals, but being able to form them at all, is probably going to be completely foreign to you.", 9538, "AAIMeYeFaa", 1],
	95218 : ["The first amendment says that the federal government are not able to set up a religion, and most state constitutions guarantee freedom of religion. That has been interpreted to intend the federal government can't pick one faith over an additional, or exhibit alternative. No longer all Christians consider the identical factor -- Catholics have a somewhat special 10 commandments, for instance, and lots of denominations (like Episcopalians) have no difficulty with gays. Mary's function is distinctive consistent with the denomination. No longer every faith is anti-abortion. Some believe in an active god, some in a god who created the world and let it boost. Some believe the Christian Bible is literally proper, some produce other holy books. Catholics receive evolution, evangelicals don't. No formal prayers in college manner the constitution is working for all religions. The USA President is not all-strong, whoever he's. Congress units spending, the president would not. The united states won't grow to be a socialist country unless Congress makes it so and the Supreme courtroom and the President agree. That is particularly not going. \"Obamacare\" is not socialist or communist -- it was once simply conceived by using Republicans in answer to Clinton's proposed well being reform plan. A equivalent plan started in Massachusetts underneath Republican Governor Mitt Romney. (I guess your teacher does not suppose Romney is a Christian.) As for some of the different facets -- 1) Why DO Canadians title their land in their children's names? That's a new one on me. Mothers and fathers in the U.S. Do it to avoid property taxes. Is Canada distinctive? 2)the federal government can not walk in and take over a corporation. What happened with the Auto companies and the monetary companies is the federal government made deals with them. In return for bailing them out, the companies agreed to specific stipulations. (stock, loans, change in management.) The companies might have refused and long gone out of business. Many very devout humans feel that Jesus will return after a period of satisfactory turmoil. Feels like your trainer thinks we're in that point of turmoil known as the top occasions.

	95219 : ["It's not just black. I think that there is a general disregard for education in society today. I am black, and I teach at a school that is maybe 20% black. I have 3 black students in my classroom. One of my black students is in the top 3 in my class and her parents are very involved in her education. I have 5 other students(white) who are in the top group. I have some students whose parents don't communicate with me about their child's education. They are all white. My two other black students are in the low group, but their parents are in contact with me and are working with their child. So, I don't think it is a race issue. I think in general that education is not valued.", 9537, "294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa", 2],
	95220 : ["Black people feel why should i bust my azz in school because when i get out the only job i will get is the same job i could of got if i didn't go to school, so a lot of blacks rather go straight to work because they feel that time going to school will be wasted when we can start earning money now, Which is a wrong way of thinking, another thing is the things in white schools to keep kids interested are not in black schools, many black schools use out of date material not to mention the outdated computers, so there are a lot of obstacles to getting an education some choose to overcome the obstacles while some choose not to even bother.", 9537, "None", -1],

	95223 : ["The founding fathers were personally well to do.  Were they not so, they would not have had the time and talent to establish a system of government that has essentially stood up unchanged throughout the most turbulent 240 years in history.  Compare that with the Russian rabble-rousers in 1917 whose system, despite its reliance upon power and brutality, lasted little more than 70 years.
