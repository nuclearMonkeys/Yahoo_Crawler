	103104 : ["You obviously did not watch the film or read the bible very well. A few Jewish leaders arrested, tried, and convicted Jesus then they took him to the Roman governor and asked the governor to kill him. The Roman governor did so. The Catholic Church officially teaches: When she delves into her own mystery, the Church, the People of God in the New Covenant, discovers her link with the Jewish People, \"the first to hear the Word of God. The Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God's revelation in the Old Covenant.  To the Jews \"belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ\"; \"for the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.\" Neither all Jews indiscriminately at that time, nor Jews today, can be charged with the crimes committed during the Passion of Jesus Christ. The Jews should not be spoken of as rejected or accursed as if this followed from Holy Scripture. For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 597 and 839:  With love in Christ.", 9836, "AA11440601", 0],
	103105 : ["First, the reason why Jews killed Jesus: -Its not even clear what role they played in Jesus's death. It was most likely the Romans who executed him because under Roman law, only the Roman government could issue death penalties. The Jews were definitely not too fond of him either, however, because he was claiming that a man (himself) could be the the son of/part of god. A claim which is blasphemy in Judaism.  About Mel Gibson being pope: -In order to be pope, you need to first be a cardinal then get elected pope by the other cardinals. Mel Gibson is not a cardinal. How do Jews feel when accused of killing Jesus: In reality, this accusation isn't even valid because if Jews did kill Jesus, it was Jews living hundreds of years ago. Jews don't accuse all Christians for killing millions of Jews less than 100 years ago and similarly certain Christians shouldn't blame the Jews living now for having killed one man over a thousand years ago. Also, Jews are usually not to concerned with this issue cause in their eyes, not only was Jesus only one man who they may or may not have killed over a thousand years ago, but also Jews don't believe Jesus was the son of God.", 9836, "AfP9bpNnaa", 0],

	103110 : ["Risks of hip replacement surgery Hip replacement surgery is generally safe, but as with any surgery, complications can occur. Although some complications are serious, most can be treated successfully. In rare circumstances, complications can include: Blood clots. These clots in the leg veins can form as a result of decreased movement of your leg after surgery, as well as from injury to the veins during surgery. Your doctor usually gives you blood-thinning medications after your surgery to try to prevent clots from forming. Compression devices, such as elastic stockings, and exercise to increase blood flow through the veins in your legs also can reduce your risk.  Infection. Infections can occur at the site of your incision and in the deeper tissue near your new hip. Most infections are treated with antibiotics, but a major infection near your prosthesis may require surgery to remove and replace the prosthesis.  Dislocation. Certain positions can cause the ball of your new joint to become dislodged. To avoid this, don't bend more than 90 degrees at the hip and don't let your leg cross the midline of your body. Surgery usually isn't necessary to relocate your hip joint.  Loosening. Over time your new joint may loosen, causing pain in your hip. Surgery might be needed to fix the problem.  Breakage of the prosthesis. Though rare, your artificial hip can break several years after surgery. Another surgery would be required to replace the broken joint.  Change in leg length. Your surgeon takes steps to avoid the problem, but occasionally your new hip may make your leg longer or shorter than the other one. Sometimes this is caused by weakness in the muscles surrounding your hip. In this case, strengthening those muscles can resolve the issue.  Joint stiffening. Sometimes the soft tissues around your joint harden, making it difficult to move your hip — a process called ossification. This usually isn't painful. If you're at risk of ossification, your doctor may recommend medications or radiation therapy to prevent it from happening.  Talk with your surgeon about any concerns you might have before surgery. He or she can help you understand your risk of complications. Looking ahead A new technique is being used for some hip replacement surgeries. Minimal incision hip replacement uses the same prosthesis to replace the hip joint, but the surgery is performed in a way that requires only a 3- to 5-inch incision — a departure from the current 10- to 12-inch incision. Some studies have shown that people who undergo minimally invasive hip replacement have an easier and less painful recovery, spend less time in the hospital and have fewer complications. But other studies haven't found this. More studies and longer follow-up are needed to evaluate minimally invasive techniques.", 9835, "AA11592909", 0],

	103117 : ["we all killed the Christ.  This is the R&S so no one has to stretch much to understand that being evil altogether is why He had to die as well as have the full wrath of the father poured out on him.

No need for a pope....Christ lives through the new Israel (true Christians) on earth and is very much alive. As for Jews...they become the chosen again through faith in the Christ's  death and resurrection the same as everyone else.  They were chosen by God to live the history they did, and still do.  And they were the original vine.  And will become so again... And we really didn't kill him against His will.  It was the will of the Father to allow us to kill Him.  It was His will that Jesus pay the horrible price of  His wrath for our sin so that Judgement and Mercy could meet in complete balance.  And it was Jesus Christ's willingness to pay this unimaginable price so that the judgement would fall on Him....the Mercy on us.  God killed Himself, bore His own wrath towards us, and forgave us for the necessity of doing so.  With only one request (same as with Adam and Eve).  That we believe Him, just this once.  Second, but last chance. we all killed Jesus.  God the father, God the son, God the Spirit, the fallen angels, the Jews, you and I.  And He was innocent!

Not to give you nightmares, but it is true. But they are great for alerting you many times of someone nearby, and they are great deterents.

Never answer the door to a stranger, I don't care if he claims he has a pizza you ordered (and you did not!). Outside security and motion light sensors are good as well. Just be smart. I am assuming you live in an area in which you do not necessarily feel secure. I get nervous when my upstairs landlady is gone for a week at a time sometimes at night and I now live in the country, but my GSD lets me know if someone is near. Also, I lived in Miami FL10 yrs and my dogs were excellent watchdogs and deterents. But I never relied on just my dogs to keep me safe.

	103129 : ["Short answer: Technically, yes, but in the grand scheme of things, NO. Long answer: The Jewish Sanhedrin (keepers of the Mosaic Law) tried to convict Jesus on religious charges. When that didn't work, they reported him to the Roman government, claiming he was trying to incite riots to overthrow the government. After Judas' betrayal and Jesus' arrest, the local government official (Pontias Pilate), found no fault with Jesus, but the laws stated he had to punish a rebel with death.  He tried to get out of killing him by using part of their agreement with the Jews to get him off. Every year on the Passover, the agreement was that the government would release one Jewish prisoner as a sign of good faith.  Pontias Pilate offered Jesus, but the Jewish people, at the insistence of their leaders (the Sanhedrin), emphatically chose a murderer instead. At the behest of the Sanhedrin, the Romans were the ones who tortured and killed Jesus. So, the Romans physically killed Jesus, and the Jewish leaders of that time were responsible for both reporting Jesus to the government of crimes he didn't commit, of refusing to have him released when given the opportunity AND of meting out what his punishment would be. The reason behind this was because in trying to uphold the Mosaic Law, they had lost the SPIRIT of the law.   For example:  When Jesus was accused of preaching on the Sabbath, they told him he was at fault, because no work was supposed to be done on the Sabbath to the point of not even being allowed to walk more than a certain number of steps.  However, the Sabbath wasn't about not working.  The Sabbath was about dedicating a day to do nothing but focus on God.  So who was upholding the SPIRIT of the Sabbath?  The men upset because someone was walking more than the prescribed steps for the day?  Or the guy who was actually TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT GOD.  To them it was about following rules, and no longer about serving God.   And they had fallen away from this so much, that they didn't recognize God Himself when He was standing before them.  They merely saw him as a lawbreaker. So, first of all, it wasn't ALL of the Jews.  It was their leaders of that time.  MANY Jewish people accepted Jesus' message and started following the first Christian church. Second, we must all remember the lesson Jesus gave above to both the Sanhedrin AND, more importantly, to us all.   Stop thinking about the fact that Jesus was killed, and start thinking about WHY Jesus was killed.  Why did he die?  What did he die FOR? (Hint:  He died for ALL OF MANKIND, so that ALL OF MANKIND might be saved.) So, who REALLY killed Jesus? We ALL did. Please don't focus on the minor, unimportant details.  Please focus on the SPIRIT of WHY it was important.  Like Jesus did. And the next time you watch that movie, remember that Jesus, God Himself, went through all of that for US pitiful little humans.
