I recall it needing to travel at about 200 mph.  Never mind how they extracted the water from the ventilation air at that speed. I see Jackal missed the conversion from feet to inches.   12*5 = 60. Edit: And a classic from kdanley: Neither do we claim that the water covered Mt. Everest. Mt. Everest was not there. Talk to any geologist about that mountain. He will tell you that mountain range shouldn't be there. It is like two land masses collided. Yes, it should be there, because the Indian subcontinent is plowing into the Asian continent pushing up Everest and the Himalayas.    It just takes billions of years, not the 6,000 that your mythology limits you to. And shirleykins posting links to an 'ark' that has been debunked many times - this is willful ignorance. I am still waiting for a link to the last ark 'find' - the one where they used carbon dating on the wood to prove it was 4,000 years old.   The same carbon dating that they all deny when it produces a date >20,000 years. You can not educate the willfully ignorant.", 10554, "GHdscZ2Haa", 4],

Therefore, plenty of us -- as with many centuries of Christians of the past -- believe that the Noah Flood account is describing a REGIONAL FLOOD.  Therefore, we don't believe that mountains like Mt. Everest in other regions were covered by flood waters. As is usually the case on R&S, you are confusing YEC (Young Earth Creationists) with the vast majority of the world's creationists who have very different views of what the Bible says (usually based on more accurate translations of the ancient text.) You've made a number of other basic errors in your presuppositions but there wouldn't be much point in dissecting the other points when your primary arguments are flawed.  You need to learn some basics of the terminology and about what various Creationist types believe before your generalizations will have much value.", 10554, "Yk1asOK4aa", -1],
