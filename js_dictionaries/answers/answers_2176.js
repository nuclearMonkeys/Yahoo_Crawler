	114586 : ["Buy him a doll.  If it bothers you that much, buy him \"boy\" dolls - Ken, GI Joe, etc.  Even baby dolls often come as boys. But don't worry, you grandson is normal.  You'll only make things worse by ignoring his wishes.   He'll feel like who he is is \"wrong.\"", 10390, "b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa", 5],
	114587 : ["He's just finding himself. He is learning the difference between boys and girls, and to try to stop him from that is just going to confuse him more. He is figuring out an aspect of life that all children try to find, and this is just his way of find out how boys and girls are different. If he dresses in a wig, he will eventually realize that most boys don't have long hair, and stop wearing it. If he wants dolls, then get him the dolls. If he plays with them, then that may just mean he might be a good Daddy one day =D I wouldn't be concerned. He's just learning! All kids do it, so I would just get him the dolls. He isn't old enough to understand sexuality and the difference between women and men, or crossdressing or certain toys, if he was 15, then maybe I would question it, but either way you have to accept him for who he is or he may resent it if he remembers later in life that he was scolded just for wanting to play with a doll! He's only 5 so I guess the best thing to do is, don't worry!", 10390, "tnC7jn47aa", -1],

	114600 : ["Geez. Let the kid play with dolls if that's what he wants. He's 5. Don't stereotype him into being gay because at 5 he wants to use dolls to reenact what he thinks life will be like as an adult. That's all kids do with dolls.", 10390, "AA10672213", 2],

	114602 : ["Yes, they do exist.  However, sometimes we do not know when we meet them that they are out soul mates.  I met my soul mate when I was 22 years old.  When we met, it was as if we had known each other for years.  We had so many of the same interests, and just to be with each other was pleasure.  For circumstances beyond our control, we were separated.  Five years ago, I found him, and we reconnected.  We still feel very comfortable around each other.

I think it all is.....I however am still search for my soulmate......and unlike the common thought that love at first sight is crazy..(at least that is what I have been told)I think its your soul telling you...\"look there, there is you one\"/....we jsut need to identify, allow and recieve the signals...a good reading source on this subject is Brian L.

If you are worried that he is going to be gay, then get out of his life now, instead of waiting until he is old enough to understand that you will think of him as a \"freak of nature\".

	114613 : ["Nope, won't be on the box. The boxes are not unique to the individual machine, that would just make packaging more difficult for the manufacturer. It MAY be on the receipt, depending on where you purchased the item. Also, some companies will actually store this information. If you purchased this PC at Best Buy, you can take your receipt back to the customer service counter at any Best Buy store and they should be able to look up the serial number for you.

If the machine is a Dell, it usually has a service tag # embedded in the operating system (but don't ask me where).    Other laptops almost never have their serial number electronically loaded. If you by any chance still have the shipping box for that computer, the serial number might very well be on the outside label of that box.   That's how current laptops get shipped, for tracking purposes.", 10393, "None", 0],
	114615 : ["It depends on how you define soul mate. From a Christian perspective soul mate makes no sense whatsoever. I am Wiccan. I believe in reincarnation and I see the patterns from one carnation to the next. People tend to stick with eachother through different lifetimes. My fiance and I are good examples of this.

Sometimes people add a crutch, that's a small piece of rolled up cardboard and put in the end, that may have been what you saw in the video.
