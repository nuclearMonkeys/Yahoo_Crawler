I don't think a woman enjoying sex and expressing her sexuality makes her a slut at all.  As long as the girl is having fun and being safe and conducting herself like a lady in public then I don't think she's a slut at all.  I think women get a bad reputation if they are sexual and they own their sexuality.  It's sad.  We are sexual creatures as well, but we are taught and instructed from a young age that we are to not have sex for physical pleasure.  We can only have sex if we are in love or married.  It's ridiculous.  We have sexual needs too. I will say that I have had more than one one night stand.  That I have been with many men.  Most of them called me afterward or wanted to date me for some reason.  I have had many friends with benefits.  I don't think that makes me a slut.  I enjoy my sexuality and I am safe and I am faithful to my boyfriends.  What's so wrong with a woman owning her sexuality?  I think society makes it so that we don't feel that we can express ourselves and so that we feel as though we have to be reserved and remain reticent when it comes to sex. My boyfriend doesn't feel that it makes me a slut.  I have sex with him whenever I get the opportunity.  I would have sex with him five times a day if he was willing to do that.  he doesn't view me as a slut.  I don't view myself as a slut and I don't view many other promiscuous women as sluts either (I do view certain types of women as sluts, but I won't get into that here).
