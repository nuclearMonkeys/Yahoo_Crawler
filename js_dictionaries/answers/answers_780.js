	43303 : ["They cannot. For one thing, Judaism isn't predicated on racial theory as Aryanism is. There are Jews of every race, for example communities of Jews that lived in Ethiopia, China and India for thousands of years. It's not hard to walk around places in Israel and notice black Israeli Jews, proud to be a part of the Jewish people. ANYONE can convert to Judaism too, which by itself utterly annihilates the claim that Judaism is \"the same\" as Aryanism. I know black converts, Asian converts and Latino converts, as well as those from \"Aryan\" stock and... well, let's just say that they wouldn't be welcome in any Aryan gatherings. Lastly, let me point out that many Jews welcome \"half-Jews\" - Jews with only one Jewish parent - as fellow Jews, which is the complete opposite of Aryanism which excluded people who weren't \"pure\" enough. Some may have reservations considering them religiously Jewish, though... but, since they (like all other people) can go through a conversion process, we still cannot compare their Judaism to Aryanism. However, you may be trying to link \"master race\" to the concept of \"chosen people\" that Jews have. Let me say that they're by far NOT the same thing.  Aryanism held that people were superior based on their ethnic background, and given that Judaism doesn't have an ethnic requirement you can see where the two are still incomparable even if the Jewish concept was to be above all people. The thing is... it's not a superiority complex. Jews believe they are chosen to be \"a light upon the nations\"... or, in other terms, the Jewish religion calls on others to set a good example, even for non-Jews. That's... not a concept that's particularly foreign to other religions, or even secular moral philosophies. Both Gentiles and Jews can be considered righteous in the Jewish religion, and it's technically easier for Gentiles to accomplish. I think that indicates Judaism doesn't seek to diminish non-Jewish lives, if anything. Aryanism... literally took lives of those unlike them, so that's a huge departure if you're still counting how different the two are. Edit: I should also point out that A LOT of Jews marry/have kids with non-Jews. It's something like 50% in the United States. Honestly, this alone shows the Aryan comparison cannot be made in good faith. It'll at least make my cousin, a Jewish woman whose father is ethnically Jewish and mother is a convert of Irish background, laugh. Probably alongside her Salvadorian husband with their half-Latino child. For a more Israeli specific example, note that the Ashkenazi (Jews from communities who lived in Europe) and Mizrahi (Jews who never left the Middle East) Jews now intermingle to the point where more kids are born \"mixed\" than fully one or the other. Granted, they're all Jewish, but these two ethnic groups were forced apart for so long that they did consider themselves different, and some of that remains. Still, \"mixed\" kids aren't a big deal in Israel.", 6254, "hKgjv1Deaa", 3],

There is no evidence of any apartheid in, or by, Israel; nor of any \"medical apartheid\".  Vexed at the President Trump peace initiative, the \"Palestinian Authority\" aka \"Fatah\" refused to communicate with Israel over the coronavirus vaccines, and instead made their own arrangements: - - - - Start of extract: - - - - \"[...] the Palestinian leadership refused to even talk to Israel when the latter was ordering vaccine doses, let alone coordinate a complex rollout operation. Before that, the UN's official news site published an article titled: “COVID-19: UN envoy hails strong Israel-Palestine cooperation.

The result of the 1967 Six Day War was that Israel recovered the West Bank from Jordanian control:  The Arabs / “Palestinian Arabs”, since dropped the name “Arab” because they do not want you to understand they mostly originate from Foreign-Arab-Migrant-Workers who came to the land of Israel just prior to, and during the British Mandate, to take advantage of higher wages through Jewish returnee-exiles:   The “Palestinian” Arabs did not start calling themselves “Palestinians” / “Palestinian people, the”, until the 1960's because till then they considered themselves Arab. In 1964 they decided on the new description because fitted with their intention to steal the land of Israel from its indigenous Jews: Brief historical background: Using “Palestine” to negate the name Israel for the land is misleading, as there has never been any indigenous sovereign state of “Palestine”. The only valid name for the land belongs to the Jewish indigenous sovereign states before the Re-establishment of Israel in 1948: “Israel” or “Judah”. The Jewish People are the indigenous people of their ancestral homeland of Israel with unbroken presence there since Biblical times: The Jewish People have had an unbroken presence in their ancestral homeland of Israel since Biblical times, and also previous sovereign states in the land for example - Map of the post-Biblical Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom of Judah (aka Judea) including: West Bank, Gaza, and Golan Heights, capital (what is now EAST) Jerusalem / “Old City”; between 110 BCE / 754 BH and 63 BCE / 706 BH: I hope this helps.
