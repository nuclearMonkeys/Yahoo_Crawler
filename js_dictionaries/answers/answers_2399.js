	125791 : ["~~The Church Is \"Holy\" (Eph. 5:25–27, Rev. 19:7–8, CCC 823–829) By his grace Jesus makes the Church holy, just as he is holy. This doesn't mean that each member is always holy. Jesus said there would be both good and bad members in the Church (John 6:70), and not all the members would go to heaven (Matt. 7:21–23). ~~~~ Here is some scripture to support the Catholic Church, do you have any other Church that can stand up to the test of scripture as well as the Catholic Church? One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. ~~The Church is Visible Jesus said his Church would be \"the light of the world.\" He then noted that \"a city set on a hill cannot be hid\" (Matt. 5:14). This means his Church is a visible organization. It must have characteristics that clearly identify it and that distinguish it from other churches. Jesus promised, \"I will build my Church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it\" (Matt. 16:18). This means that his Church will never be destroyed and will never fall away from him. His Church will survive until his return. Among the Christian churches, only the Catholic Church has existed since the time of Jesus. Every other Christian church is an offshoot of the Catholic Church. The Eastern Orthodox churches broke away from unity with the pope in 1054. The Protestant churches were established during the Reformation, which began in 1517. (Most of today's Protestant churches are actually offshoots of the original Protestant offshoots.) If we wish to locate the Church founded by Jesus, we need to locate the one that has the four chief marks or qualities of his Church. The Church we seek must be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. ~~The Church Is \"One\" (Rom. 12:5, 1 Cor. 10:17, 12:13, CCC 813–822) Jesus established only one Church, not a collection of differing churches (Lutheran, Baptist, Anglican, and so on). The Bible says the Church is the bride of Christ (Eph. 5:23–32). Jesus can have but one spouse. His Church also teaches just one set of doctrines, which must be the same as those taught by the apostles (Jude 3). This is the unity of belief to which Scripture calls us (Phil. 1:27, 2:2). ~~The Church Is \"Holy\" (Eph. 5:25–27, Rev. 19:7–8, CCC 823–829) By his grace Jesus makes the Church holy, just as he is holy. This doesn't mean that each member is always holy. Jesus said there would be both good and bad members in the Church (John 6:70), and not all the members would go to heaven (Matt. 7:21–23). ~~The Church Is \"Catholic\" (Matt. 28:19–20, Rev. 5:9–10, CCC 830–856) Jesus' Church is called catholic (\"universal\" in Greek) because it is his gift to all people. He told his apostles to go throughout the world and make disciples of \"all nations\" (Matt. 28:19–20). For 2,000 years the Catholic Church has carried out this mission, preaching the good news that Christ died for all men and that he wants all of us to be members of his universal family (Gal. 3:28). The Church Jesus established was known by its most common title, \"the Catholic Church,\" at least as early as the year 107, when Ignatius of Antioch used that title to describe the one Church Jesus founded. Ignatius was a disciple of St. John the apostle. ~~The Church Is \"Apostolic\" (Acts 1:23-26, Eph. 2:19–20, CCC 857–865) The Church Jesus founded is apostolic because he appointed the apostles to be the first leaders of the Church, and their successors were to be its future leaders. The apostles were the first bishops, and, since the first century, there has been an unbroken line of Catholic bishops faithfully handing on what the apostles taught the first Christians in Scripture and oral Tradition (2 Tim. 2:2). Jesus assured the apostles and their successors, the popes and the bishops, \"He who listens to you listens to me, and he who rejects you rejects me\" (Luke 10:16). Jesus promised to guide his Church into all truth (John 16:12–13). Peace be with your spirit <<<Devout Catholic>>>", 10854, "jCa8lEHMaa", 1],

	125794 : ["WOW!!! Might I just say... I am more than impressed with not only your question, but also the clear evidence of personal study of the bible. It's refreshing to see someone who actually thinks on here. But to answer the question... in a word, Yes!  My father always told me a story about a man who made a fresh batch of cookies for his kids. Chocolate Chips...the best. They came right out of the oven and had that fresh chocolate chip cookie smell, and they were still soft. When the kids reached for the cookies he stopped them and warned them that it was mostly chocolate...but had just a little dog poop in it, but not much. Just a little. If you were one of the kids would you eat them?  The body is considered in the bible to be sacred, a temple. 1 Corinthians 6:16-19 says the body is not for fornication,...and even in the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 19:28) it is forbidden to mark on the skin, i.e. Tattoo. The body is a gift and should be veiwed with deep respect. So everything you say is right in every aspect.  The word secular comes from the latin word meaning world, or worldly. Anything that resembles that which isn't spiritual, often times is considered in the Bible \"unclean\" or \"worldly\" (1 John 2:15-17). Therefore if the music we listen to, or movies we watch, or associates we keep do not encourage the things that ARE clean,...then maybe we should be just as selective with that, as we should be with what we put into our bodies physically, and consider how much poop really is in it. (1Corinthian 15:33, 2 Corinthians 6:15-18) Thus there is a big line between the secular and the spiritual. In fact that is the meaning of the scripture in Mark 7:15-18. If you read further, it is clearified that what you put in your body is physical, and not spiritual. Thus what you put into your body is a direct result of whats already in your heart (Mark 7:20-22).  Daniels decision was not health based but moral based. Secular vs Spiritual. Although of course we want to be clean in ALL aspects, we look to these accounts to protect our spirituality without corruption.", 10865, "WUBzPg6oaa", 2],

It is not about me and my experience; it is about what Jesus did.  My experience was just an emotional reaction to a larger truth.", 10858, "2MfMyh4Maa", 2],

Easter, annual festival commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the most important feast of the Christian year.

Your sense of being scared, the fog, her lack of cheerfulness, and the darkness cannot be underestimated or misread.  I want to say that something has been holding her back from completing her journey to the Light/Homeward to God, and particularly because her visit occured on the anniversary of her passage - and she was on a passageway after all.  You must know that God's Light has all the power needed to guide her.  Ask God to place his Light on her path and to help her.
