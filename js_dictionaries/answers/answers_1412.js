And then be given Golden plates from which to translate a new book of scripture, and then also be commanded by an angel with a drawn sword to take multiple wives or be killed.  However, what is impossible is that Joseph Smith was a prophet.  He was nothing but a very charasmatic con artist.  Yes, he was very good at what he did.  But he was a liar and a fraud, and did not speak to God in any way, shape, or form. Explain this one to me then.

	76243 : ["YES.  The answer lies in answering MANY similar questions, for example: Is there a non-religious argument against being totally naked in public? Another example: Is there a non-religious argument against marriage from more than one person (men or women)? like more questions? : Is there a non-religious argument against marriage from brother and a sister (especially if they chose not to have biological children between them!!!)  Societies are built naturally to accept what it's majority believes is natural and or tolerated behavior. It is to repel the unnatural or to limit it, because humans are not machines, but they have a very complex sensors of instincts, emotions and feelings as pride, decency, and chastity to name few. Humans are guided and influenced to make laws and rules to keep their society intact and within a comfortable zone as much as possible. One may argue these influences stem out from religious back grounds,  that maybe half true since there are societies that are without religion or atheist, but yet the norms and what is accepted is close to that of a religious back grounded community.", 8826, "A5sWAyupaa", 2],
	76244 : ["Hey, \"Pastor Art\". You said 'yes' and then cited your experience as a Christian leader as your source. That isn't exactly a NONRELIGIOUS argument, now is it? Honestly, I haven't heard a decent, nonreligious argument against homosexuality or homosexual romantic unions of any sort. The only one I've seen come close is the Darwinist argument, that clearly, those who are gay don't reproduce, as they don't engage in the sexual conduct necessary for reproduction. But I can counter this: Look at the world around you. We're insanely overpopulated. Do we need more people to be creating children, particularly when so many existing parents cannot take care of the kids they have? And yet, so many gay men have maternal, rather than paternal, instincts. So many gay women pair off in a butch/femme type relationship (though not as often as the media would have us believe), and if you ask me, the world could use a few more gay people for some population control. In fact, that's my theory on why gay people exist at all. As part of an ancient society, from an anthropological, hunter-gatherer point of view, how incredibly useful would homosexuals be? They could conveniently care for any children who lost their parents. If that were not the case, they could do more, achieve more, serve the community better, without children to tie them down. And it would have no real detrimental affect on the community - if there were one gay couple in every community, everyone else is still having children, and that would keep the numbers and ratios about right.", 8826, "Aw57JOmkaa", -3],

	76249 : ["the original meaning of upset had some of the later sports meaning in it: for instance it was used to mean overthrow, turnover or topple a government or regime.  1) verb:   defeat suddenly and unexpectedly (Example: \"The foreign team upset the local team\") 2) noun:   an improbable and unexpected victory (Example: \"The biggest upset since David beat Goliath\") 3) verb: cause to overturn from an upright or normal position: capsize, knock over, overthrow, overturn, topple, turn over. See  change, horizontal, move 4) verb: to put out of proper order: derange, disarrange, disarray, disorder, disorganize, disrupt, disturb, jumble, mess up, mix up, muddle, tumble, unsettle. 5) adjective: turned over completely: capsized, inverted, overturned, upside-down, upturned. I cannot find dates when these different meanings came into being, but I think it is easy to see that general use about military and governments predated the sports use, Often the language and usage of the battlefield became the language of sports by metaphor. (Not too long ago the largest part of the population did not have leisure time enough to engage in sports, but government and military knowledge were imposed upon them.)

I wasn't real clear on the question, but I do know that parents provide health insurance for their kids up until they are 25 years old regardless of their health condition. Being connected to her in that manner should not effect getting financial aid unless she financially provides for you. Depending on what country and state you are in there are ways around it. I know in the US is has no effect and it is common for parents to keep their kids on insurance until they are 25, and it never stops them from getting financial aid. If you are receiving any kind of financial government benefits because of your health condition then use that as your income and tell the financial aid officer that you provide for yourself and she doesn't help you in the way, you buy your own food and everything. That should clear things up for them and then you shouldn't need her tax info. I would call the officer and ask if that is acceptable. It works in Texas, good luck.
