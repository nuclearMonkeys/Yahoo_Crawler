I would also suggest getting a second remote and numchuck -for two player!  I would also suggest getting a wii card to download games off the wii shop - this also requires you to buy the compatible cords to connect to it - but worth it! You can then download any Nintendo game! I love it because I loved playing the classic Nintendo Mario Bros and such and my son whose five also loves playing those classic games!  I would get a classic video controller - some games require it! and then if your connected to the Internet - you can link your wii to your friends wii - and then send and receive messages between the wii's - pretty fun!  We love ours!!! Have Fun!!!", 10190, "aYLdSTNPaa", 3],
	111637 : ["There's a deal at Gamestop (online) where you get the console, the proper cords for the wii, four games (Wii Play, Super Mario Galaxy, and Mario Pary 8, and Wii Sports) and two nunchucks(it's a controller accessory), and a Wii Mote (controller). Wii Play comes with the second controller. Finally it comes with a Wii Mote charging system with two sets of rechargable batteries, one per Wii Mote, and a rubber back panel that goes over the battery slot on the wii mote, for a better grip.                         The deal costs about $450. That deal pretty much has every thing that you would need. Remember that the $250 wii package comes with all the necessary cables, the wii itself, a game called Wii Sports, and a Wiimote and Nunchuck.  Besides the games, the deal just gives you an extra controller set, and a battery charging system. Both of which, I believe are necessary to get.  The only thing that you might want that is extra is the Virtual Console. It is a system that gives you the chance to buy games for Nintendo's previous consoles, which gets new available games every week. You can get those and certain programs on the Wii Shop Channel.  Another thing on the Wii Shop Channel is Wii Ware. It is coming out with games on that that you could purchase, however, the prices are unknown so far. Wii Ware also has new channels that you can buy for the Wii. Channels are normally free, but the Internet browser, which used to be free, now costs 500 points. In order to buy things on the Wii Shop Channel, you need Wii points. You can buy cards at Wal-Mart that have 2000 points, which costs about $20.00. The money and wii point exchange rate is 1 penny = 1 point.  1 dollar = 100 points. Virtual Console- NES games are 500 points. SNES games are 800 points N64 games are 1000 points TurboGrafx-16 games are 600 points Neo Geo games are 900 points. Imported games cost more, like Sin and Punishment costs 1200 points for the N64, which normally costs 1000. You can buy an official Virtual console controller, called the Classic Controller. It can play any game on the Virtual console. The Wii Mote can play some games, and the GameCube controller can play most of the games. A SanDisk SD Memory Card isn't necessary unless you plan to buy a lot of games and channels. That is because the Wii has internal memory, a very important feature if you ask me, considering that those memory cards can cost about $30. On a plus side though, if you get a Memory Card, they can hold A LOT of data. If you want to use the backwards compatibility to play GameCube games on it, all you need to have is a GameCube controller and a GameCube memory card. (You also need the actual game, but that's it) Remember, only a GameCube memory card can hold GameCube data.", 10190, "82NcoV7Saa", 0],

Optional accessories are coolers and remote adapters accessories (i.e.: The thing that looks like a tennis raquet that goes over the remote, but doesn't do anything) You need an SD memory card to save your gaming progress on. Any brand of SD memory card is OK...you don't have to use SanDisk if you don't want to, so just take your time to find a reasonably priced one. I got a 2gb one for about $18, so don't get tricked into buying some Sony brand one for $35. Most of the more fun games are multi-player. Not ALL multiplayer games require multiple remotes, but its still good to have. You'll most likely need an extra remote and an extra nunchuck remote. Not all games require the nunchuck remote, but its nice to have if you wanna play boxing with someone else. The other optional accessories are, in my opinion, pretty useless. They're just there to make it \"easier\" for you to control the remote, but it really does nothing. The cooler is kind of useless too...unless you play the wii for 15 hrs straight everyday and overheat the damn thing.", 10190, "None", -1],

The wireless router can pick up any wireless devices that are on the same frequency so you can use your phone, PSP, Nintendo DS and other wireless devices to connect to the router so that you can access internet on these devices. I have my modem connected to my Buffalo Router. From the router, a cable is connected to the main PC so it is hard wired, so that PC has Internet Access. The PC in da basement has a wireless adapter which picks up the signal from the router and is also able to connect to the internet. My Tmobile wing can also pick up signal from the router which allows me to use Windows Live on my phone. And to play online games on my PSP using the wireless signal from the router.

	111669 : ["A wireless router is a network device that performs the functions of a router but also includes the functions of a wireless access point. It is commonly used to allow access to the Internet or a computer network without the need for a cabled connection. It can function in a wired LAN (local area network), a wireless only LAN, or a mixed wired/wireless network. Most current wireless routers have the following characteristics:     * LAN ports, which function in the same manner as the ports of a network switch     * A WAN port, to connect to a wider area network. The routing functions are filtered using this port. If it is not used, many functions of the router will be bypassed.     * Wireless antennae. These allow connections from other wireless devices (NICs (network interface cards), wireless repeaters, wireless access points, and wireless bridges, for example).", 10191, "None", 1],

If the device is too far away for that, or you just don't want to run the cable, a wireless connection offers the exact same internet connection minus the cords.  The trade-off?
