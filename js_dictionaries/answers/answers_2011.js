	106305 : ["There was a time in my life when religion didn't play an active part.  Then  a few years went by and realized that I did need the influence of a  higher power because I was messing up and not getting anywhere. I have always been a Christian so it was't hard to know that God is what I needed. Now, I want to say that I am not a religion pusher. No way, I believe what I need to for me to get through this life the way I need to. Well, that has made me a much better person spiritually and I am more in connection with other people, their feelings and needs.  Wow! it makes me feel so good inside when I can help someone else get through their problems.  That's what I'm here for, to help others.  It only took me over 40 years to figure that out.  We all need each other more than we know, no matter who we are. God is in each person waiting to become known to them, so it's not hard, just realization and acceptance.  It's the spirit within everyone and it's there whatever a person wants to call it for their own religion or non.", 9954, "Ks6Ac9SSaa", 2],
	106306 : ["You have brought to the forefront something that most of us take for granted without giving due consideration - myself included. When you stop to think about it religion plays a larger part in our lives than we realise for a lot of the reasons you have raised. I am not a 'political animal' and use my religious view point to dictate my outlook on life. Like you, I have re-evaluated what I think and therefore what I believe. Whilst I am Christian by birth I do not adhere to the black and white perspective that goes with the mainstream interpretation of the bible. For me, religious belief is a personal thing formed by the diversity of having an open mind, a respect for other people's views and accepting what is right for me. Every day I live my own truth and don't worry whether I conform to my religious heritage.  Life is about choices and deciding what is right for us - let's learn from each other what is good and realise that regardless of religious persuasion most of us are aiming for the same thing - a life full of personal meaning.", 9954, "0IRostHnaa", 3],

I have Struggle with something Most of My life and feel like a hypocrite at times, But this is Me ,who I am. And I am not a hypocrite or loser being honest with Myself and others has kept me humble , the faith i have is what keeps me going. Most every day I try or want to be what My faith and beliefs say I should. i get knocked out and get back up snd keep trying. The positive is I have felt the presence of God ,so powerful one it scared me really bad and couldn't understand, then was told the story of moses when he heard god talking to him he ran an hid ( he was also drunk so maybe feel in a bit guilty).

	106316 : ["It used to be of a major influence in my everyday life when I was Christian but not anymore. I believe most of my morals are derived from christian teachings which still makes me of a certain mindset all my life but have changed many of my ideas after becoming Atheist. What was wrong or right was totally related to my Christian teachings and many taboos were not allowed to be discussed. Now my understanding of what is wrong or right has changed dramatically, however there is still many of it rooted in my previous religion. I'm now more in control of what is allowed or not using rational thinking rather than dictated orders from the bible. I guess it affected me both positively and negatively.", 9954, "yuge22jMaa", 1],

	106334 : ["If you had be vigilant in the first place you wouldn't have to worry about tying ribbons around the necks of BackYard Bred mutts. All breeders use ribbons or string around the necks of their puppies to identify them in order of birth so that they can keep a spreadsheet of weight and growth to map the puppies individually.  They also use it to make sure they know which one has had food and medication and to see if any a dominant feeders or weak feeders. It is a normal practice if you know what you are doing, unfortunately you have brought these poorly bred dogs into the world already and without knowing what you are doing you are trying to catch up your knowledge base after the horse has bolted.

However, I see him everywhere from the depths of my soul. There are no words to express the extent of my feelings. I just know I'm very happy within my skin. As you put it, my expression is...not in totality. This is not my life, its a way of life that I choose. Freedom...it's a wonderful thing. I can say today...I care and I love all.

	106346 : ["Well, I'm an Atheist, but it's not a reaction against religious influence, more a result of lack thereof. I had some notions of God when I was younger, but as I got older, it seemed foolish to me, and I stopped believing in him around the time I stopped believing in   and magic in general. I don't think spend much time thinking about the existence of God, because I don't consider it a topic relevant to my life. I simply don't have it in me to be blindly faithful to something. I could claim to believe in God, but I would be lying to not only myself but to those who truly believe and I wouldn't insult their faith in such a way. If I was raised with strong religious notions, I might believe it now, but without influence I found science and logic more appealing. I don't believe in souls, I don't believe in God, I don't believe in the afterlife, I do believe there was a man named Jesus once due to documentation, and I believe he was a great political leader, but I do not believe there was anything divine about him. I don't believe in the divine. In any case, I would say religion plays a very small if not nonexistent part in my day-to-day life.

	106347 : ["aaah the ol' nature vs nurture debate... I think the basic issues are in place, but I also think we choose what kind of a life we want before we are born. We set up some challenges, some learning experiences, some we have set up as \"maybes,\" depending how we evolve and grow... BUT there is a lot of leeway...  I can see a \"distant parent\" in a chart, but does that mean they died, they split or they were just emotionally remote ?  I can see disruption in a home environment, but is that also open to variations. Did they move alot? Were they raised by bohemians with all sorts of oddballs as a given in their life?  So we lay the groundwork before we are born... but we still have choices. Sometimes we rise to the challenges we create for ourselves, and grow and evolve and leave this life in better shape... sometimes we tread water, chase our tails and learn little... so we come back to take the course again.", 9954, "32P3hG0Laa", 5],
