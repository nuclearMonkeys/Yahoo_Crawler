	78209 : ["Article II, Section 1 provides that: In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President â€¦ until the disability be removed, or a President elected. This originally left open the question whether \"the same\" refers to \"the said office\" or only \"the powers and duties of the said office\". Some historians argue that the framers' intention was that the Vice President would remain Vice President while executing the powers and duties of the presidency; however, there is also much evidence to the contrary, the most compelling of which is Article I, section 2, of the Constitution itself, the relevant text of which reads: The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided. The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States. This text appears to answer the hypothetical question of whether the office or merely the powers of the presidency devolved upon the Vice President on his succession. Thus, the 25th Amendment merely restates and reaffirms the validity of existing precedent, apart from adding valuable new protocols for presidential disability. But, of course, not everyone agreed with this interpretation when it was first put to the test, and it was left to John Tyler, the first presidential successor in U.S. history, to establish the precedent that was respected in the absence of the 25th Amendment. ADD:  before election day?  they would postpon the election a couple weeks.  maybe a month.  both parties would agree.  it would then be a party dicision to go with the veep candidate or to do whatever.", 8936, "None", 0],

Years ago, as a teenager, I'm sitting in the back seat of a carful of my girlfriends when the song came on the radio. So I'm sitting back there singing along, \"There's gonna be a party tonight, a party tonight I know\" when someone in the front seat turns around and says disgustedly (as only a teenage girl can), \"It's Heart-ache, not Par-tay. It's called Heartache Tonight.\" Ok, fine - now I know. But I still think my version fits with the lyrics, and makes me smile whenever I hear that song. Woo hoo, a par-tay tonight! **Edit** Ah, yes, named in honor of the Lady Mondegreen:  a classic one is Jimi Hendrix singing \"Scuse me while I kiss this guy.\"  Or John Irving's \"Beware the Undertoad.\" **Edit** So tell me, why does one *need* a favorite Eagles song to begin with?", 8934, "dcMq7juHaa", 2],
