In California you can get a medical card that allows you to buy it, and from what I understand from my friend who moved to Cali last month from NY and already has a card (he's not ill) it's not hard to come by. I haven't smoked in years, and I could care less if they legalize it or not.  Right now its illegal in most states, but it's not hard to come by so it might as well be legal.  When was the last time you heard of a pothead committing a robbery because he needed money to get some tree?  NEVER!  The government criminalization of marijuana is a waste of tax money, but that's par for the course (I hate golf) with this government.

But the bottom line is, no matter what is raised in new taxes, the government spends far more than that and the debt goes up even more. Democrats tend to spend on social programs. Republicans tend to spend on defense programs and wars. Although Democrats have voted with Republicans in support of every war we've fought. Bottom line: show me the cuts first before any new taxes, and new taxes are for ONLY paying down the debt, not on any new social programs.", 9769, "YVyevsUFaa", 0],
