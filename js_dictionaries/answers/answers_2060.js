So is trail mix:  Take a bunch of oatmeal and add lots of melted butter and brown sugar (just enough to coat, don't actually soak it through). Bake at 250 degrees on a cookie sheet for about an hour -- stir every once in a while).. or just buy some granola. Add raisins, cashews, peanuts, sunflower seeds, m&ms, dried cranberries, yogurt covered raisins, chopped dates, almonds, coconut, etc. hardboiled eggs Lunchmeat wrapped around cheese stick Peanut butter on pita bread pita filled with chicken and creamy dressing bananas are high in carbs -- dip them in peanut butter (that has been microwaved), roll on chocolate chips or coconut or crushed nuts.  (these are good frozen) Bake some high calorie muffins you can bring anywhere:     * 3 cups of all-purpose flour     * 1 Tbsp baking powder     * 1/2 teaspoon baking soda     * 1/2 teaspoon salt     * 10 Tbsp unsalted butter (1 1/4 stick), softened     * 1 cup sugar     * 2 large eggs     * 1 1/2 cup plain yogurt     * 1 1/2 cups blueberries, chocolate, nuts,m&ms, dried fruit (anything you want)     * 1 Tbsp flour (if using defrosted frozen berries) Method 1. Set oven 375 2 One bowl: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and set aside. 3. Second bowl: Mix butter and sugar together, beating until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating until incorporated after each one.  4 Slowly add the dry stuff to the egg/sugar/butter mixture. Add yoghurt. Then add the chocolate or berries or whatever.  [If you are using frozen berries, defrost them first, drain the excess liquid, and then coat them in a light dusting of flour.] 5 Coat each muffin cup lightly with butter or pam spray. Bake until muffins are golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes.  Makes 12-16 muffins. **You can even add a bit of protein powder to these if you use less flour. Take these to school and you'll be set. Make yourself a wrap with tortilla and cheese and meat and avocado with ranch dressing -- high in calories. Eat sugar, carbs, and fats all at the same time: cookies, brownies, whatever.

	108758 : ["If these things are important to you as you say they are (and they should be), then maybe you should ask your parents to give you specific things to work on (write them down). I know that parents arent always right but there has to be a reason for them to make these statements. Often times, the real problem is that you dont see each others side of things so try to approach them in a calm way and ask them to make a list of some of the behavior that they think is rude or out of line and then be willing to really spend some time working on these issues. Once they begin to see some lasting changes in you, then you will have earned the right to address some of the behaviors in them that you would like to see changed...but they are first and foremost, your parents. Let me give you an example... My nephew is 17. Hes a complete slob. He doesnt drink or do drugs, he does pretty well in school but he is one of the most unappreciative people Ive met and he tends to treat \"the rest of us\" like servants. I was babysitting his younger brother during a school break and would clean the kitchen and pick up around the house for my sister because she works like 12 hours a day and he would come in and spill stuff on the floor or counters and not wipe it up, leave wrappers laying on the counter and pizza sauce in the microwave, then go to the laundry room and take out the clothes I had drying, throw them on the counter in a wet heap so he could fluff the wrinkles out of 1 shirt, then leave without so much as a \"see you later\" leaving the garage door half open and the light on. Now I got a little pissed for obvious reasons but I imagine that its really disheartening for his mother to come home to that 5 days a week after working 12 hours to pay for all his luxuries like his cell phone, his car, his car insurance, etc. He doesnt see himself as being rude or inconsiderate at all! Maybe what you both need here is a little \"perspective\" The bottom line is that yes, it can all work out and you can repair the relationship with your parents but it sounds like its going to take a little work on your part to get the ball rolling in that direction. It doesnt really matter if everything they say is right, what matters is that you do something about your legitimate part of the problem as a good beginning.", 10067, "None", 0],

	108760 : ["I think that they meant barbarians more in a sense of not sharing the same culture, or foreign, as opposed to the parts of Europe which were conquered and Romanized. I don't think they were completely able to conquer the Germans, and indeed they were suffering raids by German forces. Later on when Rome's might was waning, they started to rely ever increasingly on German mercenaries to make up parts of their legion. I don't know if you know this, but the Chinese who are a very isolationist culture often refer to foreigner as 'barbarians.' I think that it means strangers who don't share the same cultural ties or sophistication of your people. Everybody is going to think their culture is the best, in general, so barbarians are those who do things in a strange way, are unsophisticated, etc. Thanks for sharing that passage Aleena. I admire Germanic people a lot. They've always tried to stand up and protect Europe from outside threats in past times. I wouldn't have thought it so bad if they had hegemony over continental Europe, but I guess it was not to be. It seems kind of interesting how Germanic people treat their women with respect and adoration. I think that most Europeans have this attitude for the most part, but I've always thought Germanic as the best of the white race. I think they have a higher sense of empathy, cooperation and community spirit than average, or found in some other European nations.", 10067, "XyCCNRJMaa", 6],

	108767 : ["One of my nephews has always been in trouble at school because he is disruptive. After years of getting into strife, he had a new teacher who did not know him. The teacher immediately saw that he was bored and concentrated a bit of effort on him. He came first in that class (this is high school), and not just first but by miles! The teacher advised he skip a grade and get with senior kids who were learning more advanced things, as this would challenge him. The school, however, did not have the facility to allow him to do that in one class and not others. My sister followed their advice and as a result her son is now planning to leave school early because he hates it so much, is constantly bored, keeps getting into trouble, etc. For the year he had the new teacher, he improved in his behaviour and his other grades also improved. If the school is supportive and recommending that your son go ahead, they must consider that he is smart enough to 'pick up' the information he needs. Not everyone learns in a linear way, collecting incrteasingly complex information as they go ahead. Some people learn by doing more complex stuff, and going back and filling in the details leter. Your son could be a person like that. I would say, give him a chance, but monitor it and talk to him about it regularly, If he experiences an over amount of stress or feels 'left behind', you could re-assess at that point. Find out from the school if he can 'go back' if things don't work out. Good luck to you both :-)", 10068, "WuYiCqVaaa", 0],
	108768 : ["I am a teacher, and I know that it is uncommon for teachers to recommend a child skip a grade...I'm sure that he is intelligent and would do fine, but you must think of the other factors... 1)Have you talked to him about it? How does he feel? Involve your son in this decision...please!! 2)Does he have behavior problems due to being bored in class? I think you mentioned that, but I would question the teacher on this...S/he should be providing extra practice and various activities to keep him involved. If he finishes work before the other children, he should be allowed to work on skills on the computer or something else that would benefit him. I don't understand why the teacher would allow him to just sit there and then interfere with other children...Maybe the teacher is not making the effort to support your child. 3)Do you think it would hurt him to possibly lose friendships he's had since kindergarten (if he has always attended the same school)? If the answer is yes, I wouldn't have him skip a grade...Social aspects, including friendships, are sooooo important at this age...Think about it, he'll be in a class will all new children and have to make friends all over like he's starting fresh at a new school. Is he very social and friendly? If so, maybe he would do okay. If I had children, I most likely would not want them to skip a grade...In the long run, what is the benefit? They merely graduate one year early which can leave them in an awkward situation...Should they start college early? Are they ready to be an adult at 17? Think about the implications down the road. I was able to graduate early from high school, but instead of starting college, I took an internship at an elementary school (arranged by my high school) and worked instead of beginning college...I needed that time and wasn't ready to attend college before my friends. I didn't want to miss out on my high school experiences...I wanted to be a kid for as long as possible. Others are not like me... You should pray about this, and trust your instincts...Even if that means disagreeing with the school...Trust that you know your child best!!  Best wishes!!", 10068, "ORXm5x7oaa", 1],
	108769 : ["Before I make a hasty decision I would talk to the principal or teachers to see if there is some stuf fhe can do in the summer to prepare him for 4th grade so he won't be far behind the rest of the students.  Juse make sure the teachers will know and watch out for him because there will be an adjustment to new learning level. I would let my kid do it because I know of kids who weren't allowed to skip ahead and they generally just became problem students. Their grades went down and they stopped paying attention because it was easy and bored them. He needs to be stimulated and challenged in order to learn well and stay out of trouble.  And extreme example of this is one of my friend's brothers was extremely bright, but never skipped a grade even when he should have. As a result he got bored with school, became a problem student and just barely managed to graduate even though his IQ would have gotten him into MENSA. Finally after getting married and holding blue collar jobs and having 4 kids, he decided he wanted to go to college to advance his career. Well now he is surrounded by all these intelligent people who stimulate and challenge him mentally that he doesn't want to leave. So as a result he is now a \"proffesional student\" and only works a bit in the summers. His wife meanwhile works 2 jobs just to try and keep the family afloat. Their family has become completely dysfunctional and is hurting the kids. Thats an extreme example. Skipping a grade isn't that big a deal. As I said, talk to the principal and teachers about how they prepare the kid or what you can do to prepare him. Also try to talk to the  school counselor about what kids who skip grade levels go through so you have a better idea of what you will experience as a mom and how you can support your child. From what I have seen the social life doesn't change much and they actually mature faster because they are hanging out with older kids. It is only one grade level, so don't worry, he won't miss out on his childhood. Good luck and congrats on having such a bright child!", 10068, "7OjRXJA6aa", 1],
