	123813 : ["First, in many cases this may be against your ISP's rules.  Just like with CABLE services, \"sharing\" internet with your neighbor is considered theft of services.  ATT, Comcast, Charter, and most other ISP's have specific \"terms of services\" and all of those prohibit sharing with anyone outside the immediate household!  In some locations those \"rules\" have the impact of making a known share illegal as well and subject to criminal charges. Yes, there are several issues that you will bump into. Since you have the internet line, anything SHE does will be traced back to you!  If she downloads illegal material or spams, you will be blamed!  More computers on the same system will \"slow down\" the system as the line only provides a certain level of bandwidth, the more you add the more that bandwidth is divided. IF your ISP has a maximum traffic limit, she will be using part of that or could use ALL of it you have no way to limit her. All connections to a common router are on the same network. That means all computer shares, all local connections, are indeed shared!  So yes any shared folders or unprotected items on your computer is available to all connected.  Any computer connected can use \"packet sniffing\" on the network and can capture all data that is sent or received.  (If she is asking you to setup the system, she probably doesn't have the expertise to use that but you really don't know that now do you.)   Do you know everyone who visits her? Are any of them likely to use YOUR connection?  There are lots of reasons NOT to become a \"mini- ISP\" for your neighbor.  IF you do it, setup a second router so that her network is separated from yours on your end not hers. Then be sure to at least have some monitoring so that you know how much traffic is being generated by your \"subscriber\".    If you connect a ROUTER at her house which connects to your system she will then have the ability to connect multiple computers at her home, do you know how many she will connect?   Yes there are downsides you haven't thought about.", 10764, "10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa", 1],

Too bad that backfired in his face when every officer backed the cop. EVEN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COPS. and 2.

They don't think or do any research they just believe what their oh great dictator tells them. Glenn Beck does his research before he speaks, he wants to be wrong but this is his OPINION. Then he gives his facts the reason he believes it you can believe it or not. Your choice, just put down the rosey glasses and look past your own nose. Do the research find out for yourself. If you like Obama's policies thats your choice, thats your freedom. It is funny how you all hated Bush \"impeach Bush\" \"kill Bush\" and many others.

Secondly, you ARE creating a direct network connection between your neighbour's computer(s) and yours as they are all communicating via your router and all on the same network. This leaves you open to both deliberate, relatively easy snooping AND any virus/worm/malware that your neighbour unwittingly suffers through not having adequate protection. You'll also be sharing your bandwidth so not getting what you pay for when your neighbour uses it... :/", 10764, "1NPVVxW0aa", 1],
	123824 : ["Lots of different elements at play here...  *How to get people to find your machine from somewhere else on the Internet.  *How to serve up files to those people through the Internet (and not everyone who does a quick port sniff of your network).  *How to allow that sharing traffic into your network and send it to the correct machine inside the network *How to limit the logins to specific IP addresses (won't they change? It's unlikely that all your contacts have static IP addresses) *How to maintain login information That's a lot to do in one message! Here goes...  First, you probably want to create a dynamic host name and get some client software that will maintain the IP address information for the host. You can do that at  (Example -- Dynamic DNS host joshua.doesntexist.com) Next, you probably want to serve up the files via FTP. This is a fairly controllable and safe way to expose files on your hard drive without opening up a lot of ports. You could use HTTP and create a directory that will browse, but then the authentication part could be a problem. This is fairly straightforward with FTP.  You'll need to download some software that runs FTP server. Check somewhere easy like Download.com and look for Free licenses so that it doesn't blow up in 30 days.  Now how do you redirect the traffic from the Internet so that it actually goes to the PC? You'll need to get into your broadband router (you're not connected directly to the Internet with that PC are you? If so, forget the logins and your files. That's a hacking nightmare just waiting to happen). So ROUTER. Get into the router and enable one or both (sometimes one enables the other) of these things -- Port Redirection (sometimes called port forwarding) and Firewall Rule.  You want to allow traffic on ports 20 and 21 (common FTP ports), and you want that traffic to go to your PC at the correct IP address inside the network.  Sometimes the router can be smart and do this in one step. Sometimes it takes two different screens to accomplish this. Depends on your router, so I can't really evaluate that blindly. A good resource for router-specific information is  But you need to allow the traffic through the router, then pass it on the the right PC behind it.  Best bet for that is to set up a Static IP Address on your computer. If you're not sure how to do that, you probably should create another question on here. I'm just trying to get through all the parts...  On limiting logins to specific IPs, you can also probably do that in your firewall settings in the Router. You may, in fact, want to go back and delete whatever you just opened to allow in the FTP traffic and recreate that rule several times for the specific IP addresses that you want to allow.  You can probably make it entire IP ranges so that it's within the same ISP, but doesn't limit your friends to the one IP address they have today in case they're dynamic too.  So that firewall rule will have their public IP on one side and the port (or port range) 20-21 on the other side, showing what addresses are allowed to pass traffic into your network and on what ports.  I hope this all doesn't sound terribly complicated, but it's part of what you asked about.  You may end up just opening up access to any outside address and trying to control this with strong passwords and watching your log. It's a lot of trouble to keep creating firewall rules for every person that wants to come in.  The logins you should be able to manage within the FTP server software. Check on that part first if you install some software to try. The first thing you should be looking for is the ability to create and manage users and passwords. Otherwise the rest doesn't really do you any good.  Once all that's done, the end user would point her web browser to ftp://joshua.doesntexist.com (notice that it's not HTTP or WWW it's FTP:// ) and be prompted for a username and password. Once authenticated, a list of files available for FTP download would appear.  It's customary to include a \"readme.txt\" file in the directory so that visitors can see whatever notes you're making about the contents of the folder. You can create a folder tree if needed to dump things into different directories and still make it usable.  Hope that helps. Good luck with your new server!", 10764, "e79d53e21ab8260c444712e53bd7b7b6aa", 1],

Either Obama and the Dems are criminally stupid, or perhaps they have direct comms with the Taliban and Al Qaida. Obama already \"apologized\" to the Arab world, for the heroic efforts of our international troops, trying to bring peace and stability to Iraq and Afghanistan. Why would the \"Commander-in-Chief\" take such an insulting attitude towards our true heroes, and also downplay the cause of their service? Biden tried to push a divided Iraq idea on the situation, that would have destroyed the chance of a new democratic, friendly nation emerging in the Persian Gulf. fortunately Gen.Petraeus saved the situation, and made the withdrawal possible...even though Obama tried to endanger this, by hurrying up the switching of troops, before there were quite enough fully trained Iraqis to do the job. Why would anyone in his right mind try to find a way to still lose the Iraq War? The latest stupidities...dithering on troop increases, sending 30,000, instead of the required 40,000, doing it late, after popular demand forced him to, and then stating his desire to begin major withdrawals soon...just what the Taliban wanted...

This site can contain a gallery of your photos, personal information, list of work, contact details, etc or if you prefer just a couple of photos and nothing else.  It can be password protected and all images will be protected as is humanly possible, or the photos can be available to download. Examples of work can be provided on request.
