Personally, I think it was a bad decision, however, it wasn't uncommon at the time because people thought that if a son wasn't produced, it was the woman's fault. People don't do it anymore for two reasons, 1. Women can now rule, 2. Beheading is now deemed barbaric and is illegal most places.", 10594, "7z5MOpoeaa", 1],

But the respect comes from responding to questions in a mature manner, and responding to others the way you would want to be responded to. Sometimes a little humor is appropriate.

You can either just ignore your friend's comments whenever he/she does either of those things and change the subject, as if he/she hadn't even made them and you hadn't noticed and hopefully the shock effect for them will eventually go away and they will just stop. 2. You can come right out and tell them that it now offends you and even though you used to participate in both of those behaviors, you now realize they make you uncomfortable and would now like to request that he/she not do those things around you.

	119920 : ["If a guy really likes you then he will still likely want sex...but the difference is that he will wait patiently. He will still date you, wait patiently and not try to get it from somewhere else. It's hard to find guys like that...even harder to make yourself wait when you think you're ready for it with someone. I've fallen for it a few rounds myself. It's something majority of girls will do multiple times before actually learning anything from their mistakes. Look back on those guys and guys that you know are only after that. Are there some common personality characteristics there? The answer is yes. Guys who only want sex (and are getting it) are generally more cocky and loud than guys who are in it for more than just that. They are the loud ones who go around whistling at every @ss they see go past. They are the ones who you see around corners and behind buildings trying to flirt their way into someone's pants. Some are more subtle though...they'll get to know you, try to get some and when you say no, they'll throw the equivalent of a fit and threaten to leave you and stuff.  Bottom line: if the guy is pushing you even when you've said no more than once...drop him. No means no and he needs to learn that. ", 10595, "0ky4TktEaa", 23],

Well like you said..there are men out there that want to love a woman, treat her as the princess she is, and be her friend, her companion of life, a lover, all the other things that make the reasons of being in love so beautiful... they are hard to find, but I would not try a bar, or any where else that has to do with parties, and that should be a sign that a guy \"want some\", when he invites you to a party. The one thing that should open your mind when a guy really want to be with you not just for one thing, is when they invite you to places that are quiet, restaurants, walks, cafes, places like that where both can get to know each other in another level, and another things is when he really has a interest for you, the small details that make you happy he notice them and start doing them, for example...your favorite ice cream, color, small things like that is that he really loves you, has a deeper interest for you...good luck in finding your love.", 10595, "7620cafb32e5b2347b8a9d83e1fe8da0aa", 3],
