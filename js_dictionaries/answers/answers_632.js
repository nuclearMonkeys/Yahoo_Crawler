Widler failed and had no answer. thats his fault. if he fights 3rd time,  he better be more than up for it, Wilder.

	35428 : ["It was the way he dealt with the disease that reinforced his greatness. At his peak, Ali was know for his unapologetic brashness and arrogance.  While few doubted his talents or questioned his achievements, his lack of humility rubbed many the wrong way and many questioned his character. When Ali faced his diagnosis with acceptance and quiet courage, and then faced his decline with dignity and grace, many saw this as a personal evolution and depth of character that made him a true role model...not just in athletics but in life as well.", 5339, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", 0],

	35444 : ["Don't really know.  The fights I've seen him in it doesn't look as if he's a hard puncher.  But he is a fantastic boxer.  I've noticed he feels his way into a fight and gradually ups the work rate to the point where his opponent can't compete.  The accumulation of punches to head and body eventually takes it toll.  Plus he's chalking up winning rounds. You can guarantee when Usyk gets in the ring he'll be as fit as he can be.  Chisora in the upcoming fight has the power and would need to get him out early.  However clipping Usyk may prove elusive.  Over 12 rounds I favour Usyk on points.", 5332, "tHxhVr9paa", 0],

	35446 : ["This is difficult because it is kind of hard to define Hollifield's prime.  I suspect it was around the Bowe trilology.  The first 2 very close with each getting a win and fan man losing.  Evander was very sick for the 3rd and should not have even been in the ring.  But I still say his prime was around this time. However he still looked pretty good during the Tyson fights and in the second Lewis fight.  Yes Lewis was the bigger man who was in his prime at the time , but Evander looked good even though he came up short against an all time great. Can we agree Mike's prime was from Berbick to Spinks.  He may have reached his prime a little before Trevor and he could have been on a unnoticeable decline before Spinks. I mean Spinks was beat before the first punch was thrown.  But Mike's prime was around this time. Prime Tyson never fought anyone as good as Bowe and probably not as good as the old George Foreman. But Tyson was an incredible force for a short time and I personally think prime Tyson would have knocked out prime Bowe. It is about styles, and I see Tyson killing his body and then coming up for the finish. Hollifield did not match up as well with Bowe and often made the foolish mistake of trying to stand toe to toe and outpunch him.  Evander may have won the first fight if he would have boxed more and not trade with the much stronger man. So in their prime it is hard.  Tyson was more exciting because of his incredible power.  He also was just very intimidating. Like a young Liston or a young Foreman, Tyson beat most of his opponents before the bell even rang. Evander could be exciting too.  He had incredible heart and stamina.  He feared no one and would fight with all he had.  He had great skills but often foolishly did not use them to his advantage.  And yes, he knew some of the dirty tricks of boxing.  Many great fighters did this so don't be too hard on Hollifield for this. If I had to pick it would be Hollifield.  But it could be either. Now if we put the prime versions of each in the ring, I favor Hollifield.  He simply was not intimidated at all by Tyson.  That is a huge psychological factor.  But his style was unlike anything Mike faced in his prime.  I see prime Hollifield hurting prime Tyson late in the fight and either gets a unanimous decision or late stoppage.  Styles make fights and Evander was all wrong for Mike.  But I still think prime Mike knocks out prime Bowe. Great question and I am sure others  will have different opinions.", 5340, "v6rD4P7vaa", 0],

The WBO, like all boxing organizations, is trying to get paid, so either AJ makes them big money by fighting Usyk, or i am sure if Eddie Hearns pais them on the side they will allow a lesser opponent as a mandatory, by then Fury vs Wilder should be done so AJ fighting the winner is realistic. ", 5341, "xHsQFPsBaa", 0],
