They learn these things somewhere, and the other girls must have seen this kind of behavior somewhere and picked up on it. If you thing this is bad, a special ed teacher told me yesterday that one of her co-workers in the school told her of a Kindergarten boy who tried to mount a first grade girl.

At about 10.00am the winds got really strong and actually weakened the gym roof enough so it was lifting up, and the roof above one of the maths rooms was being pulled off too. Everyone was running around like headless chickens. Bear in mind that the wind was tearing up the roof... And where did the head master send us? Back to our Form rooms. Annnd where was mine? On the 3rd floor. The top floor. Potentially the most dangerous floor.... -_-  Anyways, this isn't about school disasters... I would love to be locked in a library! Especially the one at my new University. They've got a massive library and some of it is beneath the uni, so in the cellar/basement, whatever you call it, and, get this, they have electronic shelves!! They're so awesome. In one part all of the shelves with journals on are crammed close together, so it's one massive block of shelves back to back, so they've got this thing where you press a button and the shelves move apart so you can get the book you want. It's like being at Hogwarts!!!! I'd be sat there fiddling with that all the time. XD", 9081, "8OaZAujLaa", 5],

Scary too, but he was caught so it's all good :) I would probably do the same as you; grab every HP book off the shelf and read like these were my last minutes on Earth.  Unfortunately though, my school library does not have Harry Potter books :( It's a Catholic school so pretty much all the books are about God, saints, etc. If they're not about God, they're educational in some way.

It makes me not want to trust people and backhand people who have such disrespect to God. it doesnt matter how much you or your character dislike God. Its basic common knowlage, you UPPERCASE God. Okay... On the other hand... I like that you used swears... I really detest books that are whiney and anooying and say \"holy crow\" instead of \"Holy ****, **** *** and whatever else there is to throw at the reader.  I don't really think this is my knind of book. You know its a downer and a miserable feling book. Some people like it and some dont... im just not one of them. I would rearange add and take away from the plot if it was mine but it isn't. Judging on your your actual writing and not the idea, i thought you were pretty good.

If they did make a movie, it would have to be something very sensational and like nothing ever before in the hour show. I think it would be an idea if they made the movie about Olivia being a sexual assult victim.  That would be a twist.  Then her own staff would have to help her through it.

They will feel more comfortable..so what if you're Spanish is a little shaky you can always interpret it in English right away if they didnt understand a word or phase you say. Thats the whole point and beauty of learning a new language especially in school. I used to work at Subway and a lot of customers spoke Spanish but I didnt know any (even though I did pick up a few words here and there lol). Dont be like me! I took Chinese a couple of semester in hs and college I still cant speak fluently and I dont use it. It's a waste of time and money because I dont PRACTICE worst part is I am asian lol just like you I was born and raised here in the US. Besides, you're not gonna work in the department store for the rest of your life you're gonna move up from there and speaking more than one language is a plus! A lot jobs nowadays looking for ppl who can speak different languages.  Besides, lets say your manager is watching you on the side and lets say you mess up on an order (like you said something wrong to the customer) haha and your manager askes you what happen.. you can just lie your manager not gonna know.

	81831 : ["I agree with Embarrassed. It depends on the type of fame. There are famous people in business, technology, etc. And then there are, of course, famous people in the media. But there is still different fame in the media. There are those that are famous for no good reason. There are those who are famous for a reason but it's not that great of a reason. There are those who are famous for their success, efforts and what they've actually done. And there are also those who are famous but aren't the most well known.  I think people want to be famous because they want to be known and make money. Money, glamor, fame, success -- that's what they think. But then it leads to too much that they can't handle it. Even though people know how a lot of celebrities end up, they believe that they can overcome that and won't give into it. But before you know it, the same thing is happening to them (I'm talking about the celebrity world here.) I personally don't understand the need for being famous as a celebrity. Being famous for being a sports player or an actual musician or an author or some kind of talent is a different thing -- that I respect. But being famous by being a celebrity who sets the latest trends or lip syncing at performances is something I'll never truly understand. I could be skipping things here or there. I just wanted to sum it up.", 9089, "VWpmbf2xaa", 3],
	81832 : ["I guess people are just satisfied if they're famous. It's just the feeling of satisfaction, and most often than not it's the money, and the fact that everyone knows your name. Hollywood shows that it's a better life, but I've always thought being famous was over-rated. Why would I want the lack of privacy and all of the over-dramatics that being famous brings?

But if I happened to make it into the library, as long as I wasn't alone, I think it would be quite fun. I would probably do what I already do at libraries - walk up and down the aisles picking up the most colorful and interesting looking covers. Then sit down and skim through them until I found one I'd want to read. If I was lucky enough to have my Vince with me, I would curl up next to him and read out loud for both of us.  If I was alone, I'd probably be freaking out, hiding in some corner or other. It would probably be much more fun in a huge library than a small one like the ones I've been in. I've always wanted to go to one of those huge libraries with millions of aisles that you can get lost in. I think it would be fun.

After reading that I felt like I wanted to kill myself, that was so depressing, angry and horrible. I could not relate to the main character at all just based on the description of him alone in this brief section of your writing, and if an author fails to make the reader connect in someway, the book is a failure. Excessive use of \"cursing\" whether you believe it to be a curse or not, is a huge put off and makes me not want to read anymore as well.
