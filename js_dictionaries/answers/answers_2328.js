If you have good skin I suggest little to know on skin makeup (blush, bronzer, foundation, etc) Because you're only in middle school a good mineral foundation will be good if you want coverage.

For mascara, I just put on Define-A-Lash volume from Maybelline, waterproof (that's a must). I apply it mostly on the top lashes, but if I want to, sometimes I put them on the bottom. For blush, I think a pink-peach color would be cute for you, not too dark. Use light brown colors for your eyes...and I don't like using eyeliner. I think natural look is the prettiest.

But trying to demonstrate how hip you are with your exposed lower back tattoos or laid-back Juicy Couture outfit could backfire.  Is a suit always a must in an interview? Absolutely not. My friend, who recently searched for a job in the Los Angeles area, went on an interview in the midst of a bitter cold snap in that region. \"So instead of wearing a suit, he wore black slacks and a sweater,\" said. \"The sweater was large and cable-knit but very nice and high quality. The interviewer actually said to me that it was nice to see something other than a suit walk through his door. And a week later, I got the job.\"  So remember its up to you what to wear to the interview, but make it good because it is all about first impression the interviewer gets of you.", 10693, "None", 0],

So, try some black mascara such as CoverGirl Lashblast, CoverGirl Volume Exact, or Maybelline Define A Lash. You can try some cover up stick or concealer to dab onto pimples when they unexpectedly pop up. And for eyes, maybe a light pink shimmer which gives you a little color but not too much, or a soft brown. Then, lipgloss is a fast and easy way to add color to your lips. Try a sparkly light pink like MAC Bountiful or you could also do some sheer lipsticks too. Anyways, hope this helps! :)", 10687, "Vio6fMrwaa", 0],

	122258 : ["I would definately have to go with Floyd Mayweather, Jr. followed by Manny Pacquiao, and then Joe Calzaghe.  Mayweather has beaten more world champions throughout his career than either of those guys and his skill level and accomplishments outdo theirs any day of the week.  Pacquiao has beaten a lot of great fighters over the past few years such as; Juan Manuel Marquez, Marco Antonio Barrera, and Erik Morales.  He is always in an exciting fight and he almost always results as the winner.  Calzaghe has recently beaten the top guys, but the reason why I have him third is because for the majority of his career, he has faced bums.  His past few fights however cannot be ignored such as; the dominant win over Jeff Lacy, the win over Mikkel Kessler, and the win over Bernard Hopkins.  And just to give you a top 4, I'll just say that I have Juan Manuel Marquez as number 4- even though he's coming off a loss, it was very close and could have gone his way, and he recently had beaten Barrera and dominated Rocky Juarez.", 10702, "aHkpgMgDaa", -1],
