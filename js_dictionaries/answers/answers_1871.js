	99294 : ["Big Fish - A man telling his family stories.  The Town - Cops and Robbers.  The Life Aquatic - A man chasing a fish.  BQ: Big Fish is top five, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou is top ten, and I don't have an estimate for The Town. I'll just say it's a favorite.  BQ2: Not a fan of those films, sorry. I will say, though, I need to re-watch the first two Terminator films, as it's been years. It's not that I didn't like them, I just don't remember them in great detail.    BQ3: I watched four new movies today actually.  Blue Velvet - I guess you could say this was my official introduction to David Lynch. I attempted to watch Mulholland Drive about two years ago, after a former user on here (who was a really awesome dude) recommended that I check out the works of Lynch, but I got half way through before I shut it off. I like so-called \"confusing\" movies, such as Memento or Pulp Fiction, but that was just too much for me. Anyway, I saw that this was free On Demand earlier today, so, with absolutely no expectations, I watched it. Honestly, it's now one of my favorite movies. It's fairly simple on the outside, a couple of curious kids want to investigate a potential murder mystery. But, the film is packed full of detail and symbolism, it's twisted in parts, it's film noir-ish, it's kind of amazing, lol. I watched it at two o'clock this afternoon, it's now 2am, and I can't stop thinking about it, three films and 12 hours later. 10/10  Submarine - I was fairly disappointed by this. The trailer made it seem like it would be an absolute masterpiece, in the vein of Rushmore, but with a more modern (and British) twist. The actual movie, though, just didn't click with me like I thought it was going to. The protagonist, Oliver, wasn't incredibly likeable to me, and the film itself just felt like a bunch of other films mixed together, with very little originality of its own. I did enjoy it, but ten years from now, if I even remember it, I'll just look at it as \"that nice little coming of age tale\", rather than a masterpiece. 7/10 The Must Be The Place - F*cking Sean Penn is a genius. This role deserves Oscar buzz out the a**, and when it comes out in March 2012, I'm hoping it gets a ton of acclaim. For one thing, the plot is as original as it gets. It's hard to even do it justice with a paragraph long explanation. I love the fact that the journey the protagonist goes on doesn't just happen right away, it happens pretty far into the film. The beginning gives time to establish Penn's character, and the relationships he has with those around him. Then it takes you on his journey. The character is so soft spoken and innocent, and his interactions with people are so amazing to watch. The last 20 minutes of the film is just pure brilliance. 10/10 Carnage - The problem I have with movies based on plays is that they always end up feeling like plays. They rarely establish themselves as films. They're short, often claustrophobic pieces that have a certain atmosphere to them. And, although this was no exception, it ended up being a fun little movie with good acting and a relevant story. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it, but I can definitely see it becoming one of those movies I'll just throw on when I'm doing something else and want something simple playing. 7.5/10", 9690, "jiT499PSaa", 5],

	99296 : ["In the last few years, AMERICAN pastors have called for homosexuals to be put into encampments Holocaust style, to pass laws that would allow people to MURDER homosexuals by shooting them in the head, and even put on their church signs that homosexuality deserves the death sentence. As with anything that involves an attacker and a victim, there is no middle ground. If you witness a murder, but do nothing about it, you're helping the attacker. Not the victim.  You allow the attacker to get away with no consequences. The victim is dead.  In many cases, you could even be argued to be an accomplice.  Homophobia is the same way. Even if you aren't in a hate group, you're hatred supports those who are. When you say you are disgusted, and when you undermine the humanity of others you harm them. Not being comfortable with homosexuality is one thing. Fighting against human rights and human decency is another.  Also, no. Saying homophobia is wrong is NOTHING like saying heterosexuality is wrong. You don't have to hate people who love others just because they don't love others in the same way you do.  In fact, I'd say it's rather proof that you're uncomfortable in your own skin. If you're heterosexual, why would you be worried about what others are doing? When it's not aimed at you?

I can't take it seriously with Arnie, to be totally honest with you. I keep laughing uncontrollably when I watch it. Like when I watch LOTR.

	99300 : ["It's the same thing as being racist, it's an opinion nobody appreciates or wants to hear. Hating on homosexual couples just for being gay is why people don't take kindly to homophobic. It's good that you're not taking an active part in your disgust of homosexuality, and I agree that it's your opinion. But take a look at people who make it public that they are racist, they aren't treated too kindly and are looked at as if they've committed a crime. And just cause you're a guy doesn't mean a gay boy or man will automatically hit on you. He's your cousin, do you really expect any of you cousins (girl and boy) to start hitting on you just cause you're a guy?

	99301 : ["You don't have to be open to personally having a homosexual experience. You can live your whole life being attracted only to women and finding the idea of homosexual sex revolting. That's totally fine. It just means you were born straight. But If you try to shame a person into hiding a natural and harmless part of themselves, that is bullying and prejudice. Telling a gay couple not to express affection in public when it's okay for straight people to do so would be like me telling you I don't like your ugly face so you should cover it up in public, although it's just fine if everybody else shows theirs. And if you don't support the civil rights of an oppressed minority group, that is crossing a line into discrimination. There is no neutrality when it comes to human rights violations. If you are not opposed to the persecution of LGBT people, then you are defaulting to the oppressive status quo, which is obviously homophobic and wrong. To say that the human rights of oppressed gay people are not your struggle and therefore do not deserve your empathy or attention is essentially to say that either you're too self-centered to care about human rights, or that LGBT people are simply subhuman. Neither position is acceptable. If you were to say that you support gay rights such as marriage, adoption, and anti-discrimination employment laws, but that you simply don't care enough to go out of your way to vote on them or involve yourself in gay rights activism, then I would think of that as apathy or disinterest rather than outright homophobia. But it's undeniably a bigoted and regressive homophobic statement to say that you don't see why preserving the human rights of gay people is any better or worse than stripping them away and treating gay people as second-class citizens.", 9693, "YNcQs17Xaa", 1],

I personally believe in God and believe that gay marriages should not be sanctified by God, ie in church. But many people marry outside of church at City Halls or in Vegas wherever. There are other \"churches\" which are not of the same beliefs that the Catholic church is and other churches who follow the teaching of the bible. Nobody has the right to change our religion and it's teachings and doctrines.   So GAYS should not be married within the Catholic Church or other churches who follow these teachings. But if they have a civil union, that is another matter altogether.   It's a pity it is referred to as \"MARRIAGE\".  People who live common-law well it's called a \"common-law\" marriage.

A Japanese teen wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the logo of a big American company is not the same as Madonna sporting a bindi as part of her latest reinvention. The difference is history and power. Colonization has made Western Anglo culture supreme–powerful and coveted. It is understood in its diversity and nuance as other cultures can only hope to be. Ignorance of culture that is a burden to Asians, African and indigenous peoples, is unknown to most European descendants or at least lacks the same negative impact. It matters who is doing the appropriating. If a dominant culture fancies some random element (a mode of dress, a manner of speaking, a style of music) of my culture interesting or exotic, but otherwise disdains my being and seeks to marginalize me, it is surely an insult.\" ------------------------- my own experience has shown me that the majority of people i have met in person who were \"pretindians\" that is appropriators of native identity and culture, have all been social misfits. they do not fit in with their peers, and saying they are native seems to be the reason (excuse) they use. but they do not fit in with us natives either...only other pretindians. its a group delusion apparently.  they form their own \"tribes\" and elect \"chiefs\" and \"clan mothers\" and hold ceremony all in english of course and not resembling anything remotely native except to hollywood. to us they are seen as foolish at best and totally insulting at worse. either way, they are harming us by mocking our ceremonies and spreading their delusions to other non natives who don't know any better.  i was born and raised as a native woman yet i have been told by non natives that i don't know my own culture because some wannabe or worse...an anthropologist, has said differently. so the native is dismissed as not knowing our own culture. and since there are only 2 million of us in the entire usa, we are easily dismissed. especially when there must be 10 million non natives pretending to BE native.  one of the most infamous culture vulture is a woman named Brooke Medicine Eagle (a name she gave herself). she has sold more books than all actual native authors combined. now you see the scope of the problem. i see this as an attempt to replace the indian with the white version. there is a poem by Sherman Alexie that says at the end: \"In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written,  all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.\" that is why i will continue to call out the frauds whenever i see them.

I am so sick of people who are \"ndn in their heart\" or \"ndn in a past life\" I am probably more racist now then I used to be when I was to young to be aware of the problem. I'd rather run into a middle of the road racist who will just dismiss me then a wannabe. At least we're not alone, we can start a support group with all the equally ticked off Jews.", 9692, "GrAUILdDaa", 2],
	99333 : ["I don't know of any.  However, I've been wondering if their are legal avenues available.  To what extent could we & other people protect our names in \"trademark\" style. That might put an end to Messanics falsely calling themselves Jewish.  And Native Cultures being co-opted. I understand the Christians see themselves as related to Judaism & receiving a new convenant from God that continues from ours.  However, that doesn't make their religion into ours.  There's a reason there are two religions (& various sub-communuities).  Respectful Christians know Judaism means the Jewish religion.  And it's NOT a free for all name to use for themselves...as though we don't exist & they have rights to anything of ours without concern for our existence. Saying you love someone while violating them, is classic to sexual abusers.  So saying you love someone doesn't identify rightness by itself.  That line that we are being intolerant is similar to lines abusers use to keep their victims still - you be a good girl & it will hurt less, you better not tell on me... Like you, I wonder sociolgically what the underlying process is that allows people to do this without self-awareness. It may be that classic power struggle that is the abuse pattern.  Tehilla's answer implies the same thing too.  It may be an inherent human trait that can be mass taught as acceptable.   I hope not.  I'll keep looking for answers. PS I've saved this ques in case it gets deleted. ==== When I think about children, it's not unusual for the younger sibling to try to \"be\" the older one.  And drive the older one nuts.  Could people get stuck & not grow out of that?  Add inherent power issues & desires humans have &/or adult bullying techniiques?  Humans & power & conquest is a hard to manage phenomenon. Mama  Nowhere was I implying that only one group is involved in hijacking.  Violations aren't accurate around here - this could be a reported question by those worried by it.  I wrote my comment so you'd know I have it for you, if it gets deleted.  (Hint, hint keep saving as you get good answers.  I've had valid good qs go away & been sorry I hadn't.)  Why are you assuming negative in my comments, when you know I'm likely to agree with you?  Am I saying it a certain way?  EDIT:  Here we go with misunderstanding each other :).  I'm sorry too - nothing meant by anything.  (I'm keeping this short since it's in a ques.) Chevah Fascinating.  I think you're onto something. === EDIT: Why is my answer the only one without a without a gratuitous  TD?  What's wrong with it? :)  Who didn't I tell the truth about?   (Well, that was something - when I updated for this edit, the whole ques came up in Chinese-style characters.)", 9692, "DTog0VZWaa", 3],
