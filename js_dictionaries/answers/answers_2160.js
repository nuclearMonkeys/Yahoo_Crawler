If that's all that's going on, you idiot, then the minorities would be weeded out during the face to face interview process and your entire so-called theory is invalid. Edit: Actually, moron, the majority of interviews are face to face affairs. You are talking about collecting race data as a way to continue \"institutional racism\", but then are dumb enough to think that the interview (where those hiring could see you and your race) would some how not matter?  I'm 40 now.  I've worked different places and interviewed many time. NEVER have I interviewed over the phone only.

To answer your question, yes, Bin Laden is real and if you do some research, you'll find that Bin Laden was secretly escorted to a Swedish hospital by the 3 American CIA agents and held for his protection DURING the 9./11 attacks because the Bin Laden family is a rich oil family that is 'in bed' with the President Bush family, there were pics of this all over the news when it happened and the government denied it - that is why you will NEVER see the government  \"CATCH\" bin laden because they are having dinner with the jerk right now! They know where he is at all times in order to protect him - remember we caught Saudam Hussan in a spider hole in the middle of nowhere in the middle east in less than 2-3 yrs but bin laden is somehow smarter? I don't think so! Bin Laden was Saddam's Protege remeber? and I doubt he surpassed his teacher ok?

They call to collect money, presents or when they dont get their way at their mom's. My husband feels so guilty over the now 11 year divorce those kids have been milking it for all they can- and guess what: It works.  But let me tell you how to send the \"Dont fu#$ with me\" signal: Separate your accounts and explain to your husband that from now on all of their expenses/child care will have to come directly from him! I was the idiot who used to buy all the favorite groceries when they were younger, and all the cute little things= but after my stepdaughter LITERALLY told me in a diva mode how she played her parents against each other so she could get what she wanted, and i found out they were bad mouthing me to the inlaws, honey- i set my foot down quietly: I dont buy my stepkids jack squat. I stay in our room whenever they come to the house, and I cook my favorite food=When I feel like eating. If my stepdaughter doesnt give at least 24 hr notice, we do not provide babysitting for her 2 kids and THE ONE time my husband tried to \"put me in my place because that was his daughter.....\" I smiled and sweetly said \"fine-THEN YOU take care of them!\" I went into the bedroom, shut the door, and turned off the circuit breakers to the rest of the house- He went nuts with 2 toddlers and no TV! and she's an overly appreciative little camper whenever we get our 24 hour notice!

What was shown to them might have been something else! How were they sure that it was moon that they landed on. All of them laughed at me, obviously for my ignorance. Now, if three astronauts of USA really landed on moon over 4 decades ago, why has not USA sent another team to land on moon for more information till now?

This essentially lowers the Bar for those people, to make it easier to acquire Jobs/promotions. The byproduct of this, is Discrimination against non-minority members, because this makes it harder for a non-minority member to get a Job, when his/her competition is a Minority member. This also makes it impossible to know if a Minority member got a Job due to his/her Skill or simply due to his/her Race and/or Gender This odd thing about this is, this is meant to make up for Past discrimination, however it is very Rare for someone was discriminated against in the past to benefit from this, due to most of the discrimination happened at least half a century ago.

Many of these school buses are decades old anyway. Not only are they a metal death trap if they are slammed into at high speed, but it smells of exhaust fumes. I know we need new school buses. The sad thing is money is an issue. We can spend billions on a barely supported war, but we can't buy kids safety belts for even the old buses. It wouldn't take a lot. Get a few school buses.

At 13 and 15 years of age, perhaps your expectations of their behaviour is too much under the circumstances. When they are older, they will be more independent of their mothers influence and will make decisions on their own which will undoubtedly involve future relationships with their dad. In the meantime, you are wasting energy becoming angry. Your energies could be better utilised by concentrating effort on making your husband feel more comfortable about his situation. Your anger and resentment will only make matters seem worse than they are. Your young daughter will want to see that you as her role model, can cope.

	113823 : ["Do you believe that the universe and all things in it function due to true and correct laws of nature?  Can you consider that their are also spiritual laws that direct and control the universe and everything in it?   If you can then you will understand that God works with these laws.  Both spiritual and physical.  When a law is broken their are always consequences.  When a law is kept their are also consequences.   God's purpose for our coming to earth and having the chance to have free agency is for us to learn that when we obey the eternal laws we are happy and have opportunities to progress and grow once we leave this earth.   Since Justice must be met, and all of us sin, how could we have the opportunity to become like our Father in Heaven and to qualify for all he wants to give us?   Only one way.  By having a surrogate pay for those laws that we would break.  One who did not deserve to suffer the consequences of those broken laws because he had not broken them himself.  Then justice would be met.  We then are in debt to him, our Savior Jesus Christ.  We pay the debt through repentance.   Lucifer had the choice to come to earth and to follow the plan that God had set up so that we would have the opportunity for eternal growth and progression but he wanted the power and glory for himself. Lucifer presented his own plan to the Father.  He wanted to force us to not break any laws and thus we would all return without ever sinning to God, but also we would not have had the ability to choose for ourselves. We would have been mere puppets.   God rejected this plan and Satan was cast out of Heaven because of it along with a third of the host of heaven.  You are here because you chose to not follow Satan but to come to earth and follow Gods plan for our happiness. Satan continues to fight against God's plan and against us who chose to follow it. I, as a Mormon believe that their are many kingdoms in heaven not just a Heaven or Hell which when you think about it makes sense.  Their are lots of different types of people.  Everyone is not all bad or all good, it makes sense that God would have places to live for those in between good and bad.   The place that offers the greatest amount of happiness and opportunity for eternal progression of course is the place where God and our Savior Jesus Christ dwell.  This is where we should all be striving to qualify for. God's motivation is love for us, his children.  He is the literal father of our spirits.  He created the earth and everything in it for the soul purpose of our welfare.  When you understand God's motivation then it helps you to not resent his commandments but to realize that those commandments when kept, lead to happiness and eternal opportunities.

After years of trying to figure out why seat belts have never been installed in school buses the only answer I can give you is that it is safer not to have the. I know it sounds like an oxymoron. Here is the scene-- if all the kids were buckled in and the bus rolled into ditch filled with water, knocking out most of the kids. would it be faster to pull them out not buckled in or laying in the water unrestrained?  of course unrestrained would make their rescue easier.  This logic applies in most cases. Given the number of school buses and the infrequency of accidents I would say this is a non issue.
