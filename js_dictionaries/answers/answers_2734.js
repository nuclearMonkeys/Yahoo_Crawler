	142573 : ["I am against capital punishment and not because I believe life is sacred or anything religious like that. When a person commits a heinous crime such as murder or rape or rape and murder or innocent butchering of children etc, etc, then it is understandable that people will want that murderer to suffer, want them to pay for what they have done and the hurt they have caused. Here is where pro-capital punishment people will say, a life for a life... and it's where Ghandi would say \"an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\". It seems a barbaric and dated choice of action for a government - to kill someone who has killed someone else. It's stooping to the level of the murderer, even.   However, I think that if a murderer is let loose and the family of the victim decide to kill the murderer, that's fair game. I'm all for vigilante justice! As far as legal law is concerned, I'm not saying that we should all be hippies about this and excuse the murderers and hug them until they get better. I know that there are sociopaths who it has been proven never get better.  Though some may be remorseful and some may learn in time through education (the greatest asset there is) and being locked away from the outside world to be better people. And also lets not forget the omg-he-was-actually-innocent clause, made popular by Shawshank Redemption. It's pretty grim to not be able to forgive or offer someone the chance to repent and nurture a conscience.  I also think that being locked away for the rest of your life would be worse than a simple death. However, Sadam Hussain, is a different story. I'm glad he was sentenced to death because he sentenced many people to death himself. He is a difficult one, I think because he was a corrupt political figurehead and of global importance he had to be killed to quell insurgents and stop rescue attempts. Edit:  I add this, because you added info to your details. You state that if someone kills through \"passion\" and just \"once\" then this does not warrant the death penalty? The law should never be clarified on subjective emotion, it needs to be clear cut. If your law was put into effect, where would you classify a man who went into a jealous rage and killed 20 people in a supermarket - it was a one time off moment of passion induced fury - yet he killed more than 1 person? Are you suggesting we have a legal system with a tally, once you murder 4 you get put on the green mile? Or a magical legal system that can successfully quantify \"reasonably passion induced murder?\" I hope that illustrates how bad I think your reasoning is.", 11549, "None", 2],
	142574 : ["I don't.... Reason being: States tell people they can't kill..... but yet the states turn around and kill through capital punishment.. That's being hypocritical.. Also, in a \"functioning, democratic society\" how can we put people on death row, when we KNOW at some point an Innocent person is going to be executed??? Now granted that doesn't happen often, but my informed guess is that its has happened. The Criminal Justice system isn't and never will be perfect...... I don't think it's right for people to murder other human beings but unfortuately it happens whatever the justification may be.  My best friend was murdered and I still don't believe in capital punishment- someone else dying won't bring my friend back. There is no justice when someone is murdered. Life in prison is cheaper anyway... Death sentence appeals take at least 7-8 years (or longer depending on the state) to get thru the courts. By the time tax payers pay for court fees, faxes, attorney fees, paralegals, etc, its much cheaper to let killers rot in a cell.....", 11549, "n4ITRmykaa", 3],
	142575 : ["Capital crimes deserve Capital punishment.  We all die.  No one wants to die.  We place special significance on the act of murder though.  We call what the state does to the criminal, capital punishment.  I see the ten or more years the appeals process takes as a waste of time and torture.   The age of DNA has proven to be a plus in proving guilt.  However, in the case where doubt could exist, I say remove the death penalty from the sentence.  For cases where all doubt has been removed, I say gas them in their sleep before they even know it will happen.  Sometimes the legal system exhorts cruel and unusual punishment. Extracting Death is a permanet punishment and can't be taken back.  However, some people can not be made public safe.  To them, I could pull the trigger.  I killed in Viet Nam when my country asked me to take that extreem measure.  It changes a person forever.  How, depends on the morals of the person.  It isn't easy or done lightly, then or now.
