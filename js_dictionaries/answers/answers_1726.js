	92008 : ["1)I tend to agree with you but it's just few miles ahead of Indo-Aus and Indo-SA.The other two are slowly catching up but the reception for fans(Including both countries) to Ind-Pak rivalry is still very much unbeatable.So AGREE 2)DISAGREED-I would have said Dwayne Bravo if it's not for J kallis.He is one of the most finest allrounder for the past decade or so.He is still the best allrounder currently with his performance and he is very 'intelligent' cricketer too.You can include bravo,Vettori and Watson together. 3)AGREED-By current form I would go with M Aamir.Parnell is very good in ODI(he didn't get opportunity in test yet).Aamir has done really well in both forms of the game.So Aamir is my pick. 4)Most definitely.You can never see a team like SouthAfrica which has all the talents in the world.Takes examples of batsmen:Graeme Smith,Kallis,AB Devilliers etc. Take eg: of bowlers:Steyn,Morne Morkel,Botha.Take Allrounders too:Kallis,Smith.So well balanced unarguably.The most dangerous side when get going as a unit which they do most of the times.AGREE(DieHard Fan of SA) 5)AB De Villiers-He is my favourite player most definitely.He hits them really hard and finds sweet spot of the bat with more consistency.Lot of flair in his batting.His onside and offside drives are magestic to watch at times.A great Fielder too.Also most cute cricketer I have ever seen.AGREE 6)Brett Lee-He could make a comeback but then he needs to find his speed.Aussies are very good in knowing their strength and I think Brett lee knows too.Speed is his one of the most dangerous weapon and if he loses it it will be hard for him to pick wickets once he come back.So with increase in age decrease in speed.So,Yes I AGREE. 7)Yes.He has a the most wonderful and funnier hairstyle I have ever seen.I AGREE 8)AGREED:I have said this many times and agreed with it to.Contacts like you have seen the Q of me would be knowing it very well.For others   9)Yes-The increasing amount of interesting Q's and Quality Cricket Questions I find here day by day make me thinks so.so I AGREE 10)Yes.It has all the ingredients(Masala in slang language) that's we see in a movie like thriller climax,emotions,sadness,happiness etc and also along with it more entertainment.So I completely AGREE.", 9417, "CfLAZKOjaa", 2],

If she likes a guy, she thinks about that A LOT. How she looks, what other people think about her. Maybe she worries a lot, even about little things. Or.. I don't know, it really depends on her interests. If she loves music, she'll probably think about that. If she likes art or writing, maybe she thinks about inspiration for new things. And then the things that go on around her. Drama with friends or boys, or events through out the day... Hope that helped a little:P", 9418, "RuTmlHZ4aa", 0],
