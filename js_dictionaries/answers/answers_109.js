	5452 : [" \"Marriage statistics indicate that the mean marriage age for the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras was higher than many people realize. Data taken from birthdates of women and marriage certificates reveals mean marriage ages to have been as follows: 1566-1619     27.0 years 1647-1719     29.6 years 1719-1779     26.8 years 1770-1837     25.1 years The marriage age of men was probably the same or a bit older than that of women. (In 1619, it was about 23 for women, 26 for men.) The age of consent was 12 for a girl, 14 for a boy, but for most children puberty came two or three years later than it does today.\" The comparatively late age was mostly due to the fact that people waited to get married until they could afford to do so, and it took a while to save up. Children might be married earlier if their families were noble or rich, or both because an heir or an heiress was a valuable property and had to be secured. but it wasn't the norm. A popular song like \"The Trees They do Grow High\" about the marriage of a 14 year old boy suggests that early marriages like these were not approved of by the general public \"At the age of fourteen he was a married man/At the age of fifteen she brought to him a son/At the age of sixteen the grass grew over him/Cruel death had put an end to his growing\" - the implication being that sexual intercourse might prove fatal if started too early even for a boy - the risks of childbirth for a very young girl didn't need emphasising. It's possible that Shakespeare's audience accepted the romance of Romeo and Juliet because, well, they were Italian and everyone knew foreigners were different. Not everyone, of course, married at the average age - Shakespeare was 18 when he married, and his wife Anne was 26 and pregnant (this was probably not that uncommon) - his daughter Susanna married at 24, Judith at 31 - Kit Marlowe, a contemporary of Shakespeare had a sister who was married at the age of 12 and died a year later in childbirth.", 925, "k5Bkkn6kaa", 4],
