I know you'll find the music excessively boring, but you gotta start somewhere. Just play through easy pieces and move up a level if you find them all sight-readable. Once you find a level that begins to challenge you, play through all of the pieces. Ten times. Then, bump it up a notch.  Eight years' experience can be meaningless if those years were spent without a teacher.

You study a bit, and you learn enough to functionally say you can read music.  But it still is a thinking process, where you're looking at lines and spaces and then figuring out what the note is.  Many people get really frustrated at this point and simply stop.  Don't do that!!  :-) The key here, as with anything, is to do it enough that it becomes second nature.  That's when music really starts to be fun!  Just like driving, once you pass your test and you have to drive every day to get to work -- it's not very long until driving is second nature and you don't have to think at all about all the little things you're doing. Our brains learn by repetition over time.  You said you've played for 8 years, but how have you played?  Here and there?  Having a few days of good practice and then not really playing for a month or two? If you play, every day, and make it part of your daily life, you will see almost magical results.  You are giving your brain the repetition it needs at regular intervals, and that's how you'll learn.  You'll see your own progress. You do need to start out with music that doesn't take a huge effort to read right now -- not too hard.

	81676 : ["Vanilla, I'm going to have to disagree about the first sentence. That sentence was one of the things I liked the most about this opening. I know about the whole telling/showing adage, but there are times when showing doesn't have the same flair as telling does. That first sentence sets the mood, and -- on a technical level -- it works because it raises a story question about Patrick's wife. Why is he afraid of her? What is she going to do when we see her? Telling is also perfectly acceptable if this turns out to be a children's story. The except sucked me in immediately and I was disappointed that there wasn't more of it. I want to know about Jasmine's arrangement, and I want to know whether or not Patrick caves in. My personal favourite line is where you mention that Jasmine doesn't know what she's looking for and that she'll be angry at Patrick for not knowing what it is/helping her find it. Makes me wish I'd come up with something like that xD There were some other good descriptions, like the idea of Jasmine's room being like going into someone's lawn. The characterization here is quite solid (as far as openings go), and both Patrick and his wife are interesting characters, due to their relationship. I also find myself wondering about their daughter, and what she may or may not be hiding that's making Jasmine (who is obviously quite controlling) want to look through her diary so badly. All in all -- if it's a critique you want -- I'd say that you've written a solid opening with a number of strong hooks. I would keep reading.", 9081, "eoEFzNEuaa", 1],

Make or buy some flash cards and on each card have one note (the music note on its proper place on the staff) and on the back put the correct answer. Start with a small set of cards and drill yourself every day until you know them automatically, without thinking about it. Then learn some more of them, the same way. It really will work. Once you can recgonize each note without thinking about it, start doing scales - just work on one until you can whiz through it and then add another.

	81686 : ["Let me first say that I really enjoyed this! Based on the opening sentence, I thought it was going to be sort of lame, but you blew me away with your style. It kept my attention all the way through and this is one of the only pieces I have ever seen on here that left me wanting more. I want to know what's going on with the Kennedy family, why Patrick is a bit timid around Beth, the whole deal. You have a good explanation of events, you aren't using any purple prose, and your amount of description, in my opinion, is perfect. Not too much, not too little. Your first sentence is the one thing I'm not crazy about. \"Patrick Kennedy had always been a little afraid of his wife, and this Tuesday evening was no exception.\" That whole entire sentence is telling. I'm sure you've heard of the famous \"show, don't tell\" saying when it comes to writing. To a certain extent, I think that telling is okay, but this is too much. I would much rather you show how Patrick has always been a little scared versus telling me straight up. It especially looks bad as the opening sentence (well, not bad really, just not something I would like to read). The \"this Tuesday evening...\" is a little unnecessary too. Maybe you should just jump into where the problem starts with Jasmine's diary instead of telling us this almost useless information. The rest of it, besides the first sentence, is very good. I really enjoyed reading it and both of your adult characters seem interesting. Great job so far!", 9081, "fKhexK0Gaa", 1],

	81691 : ["I don't like putting any rules to writing. The only rule I firmly stick to is grammar-liness. One's writing style depends on that certain individual and maybe something I would never do fits their story perfectly. But \"something I would never do\" is phrase with a very relative meaning.  Now that I think of it... I don't even think there are such things as rules for writing :-/  To every \"rule\" there is an exception, I'm sure of it. Even for the most technical things, like: a prologue should be at the beginning of the book.  \"Oh, yeah?\" said Sterne and put his prologue in the middle of Tristram Shandy.  Anyway, since I put no limits to writing, I don't know what should I classify as the rule-breaking book. So I can't answer that. And as for your question \"Why do you think the rule-breaking works?\" I think it's simply because it's breaking the rule. Ok, maybe not the rule, but... Um.  Hypothetical situation: in the past couple of years it has become a trend to start a book like this: \"I was walking down the street, when...\" And now imagine if you had a dozen of books which started with that particular sentence. And then you get a hold of a book which starts with \"I was just in the shower, when...\" So the guy who wrote it broke the rule. Or maybe it would be more appropriate to call it a convention?
