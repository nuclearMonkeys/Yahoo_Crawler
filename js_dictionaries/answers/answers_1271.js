And yes even age has little to do with judging a car.  CONDITION CONDITION CONDITION is the majority deciding factor in buying a used car these days.  I want to say this now every model and some times the year of the model have common problems.  Since that car is not old enough there really are no common problems on them yet. So with this question there is no way to be able to say \"well the cylinder heads typically go at this mileage or the trans at that mileage. But again condition is key NOT mileage. SOoo come cars parts die at certain mileages big whoop they can be repaired and be again in good condition.  So the car racked up 60K in almost or over 2 years depending on when it sold. All cars need care and repairs and not to go back to the miles thing and look like I was wrong about miles.  I did point out condition and a good condition car has all the maintenance and parts it needed replaced and not deferred.  Hence a good used car is in good condition.  When any car/truck racks up that kinda usage in 2 years it most definably a highway  used car, meaning its been going down the road at highway speeds for long periods of time in top gear the brakes no being used, hitting bumps in the road at higher speed causes in less wear to the suspension system, the oil pressure is up high ect.  basically less stop and go. The basic formula for a highway miles car is 1/3 of the odometer readout. YES YES I know miles are not the issue. just pointing out a car used on the highway a lot wears out parts much slower than a typically used car where lots of city driving is in the formula.  So the only real wear and tear to a mostly highway used car is tires wheel bearing and the drivers seat.  Highway cars don't follow the typical miles it does this thing.   Cars these day don't have the usual things going on where getting to 200K is near the end of its life mostly becasue the engine is worn out and the cost of replacing is not a smart financial decision, also in the past most makes of cars were very short lived compared to cars starting in the mid 90's and up.   Yes there are many makes and models and each manufacture has a different life expectancy as to when it becomes downright stupid to put any money into them to keep the in good condition., but in general these days miles and age can't be looked at as a basis on if the car is worth buying/keeping its all condition.", 8494, "None", 0],

	69102 : ["could be a combination of things but it sounds to me like the brakes have been given a hard time of it previously, you can soometimes get away with taking the pads out and scuffing them back with some sand paper {not too corse about 240 grit} also do this to the discs, a good indication of this being the problem would be if the discs look incredibly shinny because the smoother and shinnier a surface the less friction there is so the more violent you need to be with the brakes to get them to work, it could also be due to other issues like a partially siezed piston in one of the calipers causing the pads to wear un evenly {one or more pads wear tappered so there thicker on one edge than the other} this takes away the surface area of the pad on the disc face causing bad performance, it could also be a siezed slider too or even a vacum assist problem {could be the servo or just the vacum pipe or one way valve going from the engine to the servo. i doubt they need bleeding because if they did the problem would be that noticeable your sister would not drive the car as it would just feel far too unsafe. if you have a reasonably handy friend/family member then ask them to take each wheel off in turn and give the brakes a general inspection if nothing is noticeably wrong then i think your probably best off just replacing the discs and pads {if anything is siezed it will be picked up on when the discs and pads are changed and if something is siezed then you really want discs and pads anyway because the old ones will be unevenly worn so your not wasting your money by having them changed}", 8497, "TUnVYmavaa", 0],

Whats a true performance car you ask? Well for one when you stomp on the gas at 60 it shoots to much higher speeds quickly instead of being a car designed to sell with the false feeling of Awesome \"off the line power\" like the Lexus but without the capability to rocket from 40 50 60 to whatever. The BMW is capable of going 160 with a sustained speed of 140 as tested in the real world.

If it has a warranty that might help, but not for long.  Take the Toyota to a shop and fiind out what amount of money it would cost to fix it (including the frame damage) and how long it would take and what kind of warranty they would provide  Time might be the deciding factor because if your Toyota is in the shop for a month.  you may need another car  to get by.

	69111 : ["Our local 1/3 mile dirt track was recently in trouble too. It actually went through 4 different promoters in less than 10 years. It started out, like many others, as a horse track in the 1940's, but the county fair board started running cars on it in the 1950's. They now contract out the operation of the track to outside individuals. In recent years, the track was in bad shape from low attendance and bad management. The promoter that's been running it for the last few seasons seems to finally have it right though. He did it with hard work, sponsorship for special races and, perhaps the biggest thing he did, a partnership with another local track that combines the points chase from both tracks into one larger purse at the end of the season. They don't run late models every week here, though many of us wish they did, but, they run them 2 or 3 times each season (if I remember correctly, the D.I.R.T. cars are the ones that come here). All of the race nights are sponsored by someone whether it's a local car dealer or race engine builder, even our local fence company sponsors a couple nights each year. The big races usually have several major sponsors, including tech schools and race parts manufacturers. They combine the gate money and sponsor money and divide it up to pay the bills-you know what I mean by that-as well as putting some of it toward the end of season championship points fund which is awarded at a banquet at the end of the year. One other thing that was considered was grading off a smaller track, I believe it was going to be about 1/8 mile, but I could be mistaken there, using part of the front stretch and infield. It was intended for running go karts, quads and maybe Legend cars so that younger racers could develop and hopefully continue onto the \"big\" track as they got older. It never came about though since there is already a Kart track just a few miles away and another one near the other track that points are shared with.   I'm a drag racer myself, but, I came up pitting and working on my uncles late models on the 6 or 7 local dirt tracks that used to be around here. Most of them are closed now, but, the 2 that are still open are going strong again most weekends from the end of March or early April until late September or early October. I still build engines for a few dirt trackers and now for my daughters dirt truck as well and when there's nothing going on for me at the strip, I head for the dirt to watch and help out. Our local tracks website is www.fremontohspeedway.com, I think there's a link there to the track they partner with for the points fund.", 8484, "VBAYHGNzaa", 3],
	69112 : ["As a race fan first, driver second. I want to see races with lots of cars. 6 or 8 cars in a main event is not a good sign. The most popular division I've seen lately is the 4 cylinder, front wheel drive, bone stock class. Lots of cheap cars that most guys don't mind bending a little. Many race tracks are doing events during the week, so there's no competition from other tracks. Maybe run Thursday nights? I go to the track to see racing. Many tracks around here don't get that, and drag the night out with all kinds of  trivial events, interviews, and general time wasting stuff. Practice, heats, main events. One race ends, the next is already lined up, ready to go. You get fans back in the stands and keep them happy, the rest will follow. As a driver, I want to get in, do some racing, and still get home at a reasonable hour.
