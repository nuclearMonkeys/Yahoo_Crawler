Everybody loves saying \"MJ didn't get out of the 1st round until Pippen came\" Even though Scottie was a bench player. Everyone excuses his losses throughout his career. Seriously everyone has the same excuse \"He had no help\" He shot 35% in his first finals. He led his the best record in 2009 with 66 wins and 2010 with 61 wins and in both years he DID NOT WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP let alone made the finals. He averaged 17.8 Points in a finals and got outscored by a bench player. He ran from team to team in the past 10 years and he quit in the finals. He padded his stats in '14 and '17", 5419, "45BUtyf4aa", 0],

Ali's superior footwork, is the key to him beating Tyson, over the fight he would break Tyson down with exceptionally fast jabs, & then poof, he has danced away from Tyson's power punches, Tyson would be punching thin air, i'll say Ali, by 10th round k.o.", 5414, "eggiJkWZaa", 1],

In the paint he's like a guided tank missile. He's just dazzling.  Curry is nothing short of phenomenal. Unless you put 2-3 bodies on him he can make shots in any orientation, anywhere on the court. Hell, he can make shots from anywhere in the frigging building. At his best, no one has ever shot like him before or is likely to again. It's a hard call as to which is better, but I think if Durant can get back to 100% after his injury, he's going to be a contender too.", 5407, "2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa", 2],

	36046 : ["Depends on how you're measuring boxers because there are boxers that have had over 200 wins and significantly few losses like Willie pep. There are also fighters that have set the record for beating the most hall of famers in their prime. It's important to also consider the fact that not every boxer box against every opponent that was in their prime. To truly see who the greatest of all time is you have to compare that boxer to another boxer based on the criteria that if both boxers traded places who would be superior. Also keep in mind that some boxers have been dominant and suffer losses because they went up a weight class but if they would have stayed in the same weight class their win-loss record would be significantly better. I personally think guys like Pac-Man and Roy Jones should be on top of the list just because think about how they dominated and went up weights. also guys like sugar Ray Robinson and sugar Ray Leonard were legendary for being belt collectors", 5406, "5b2FcXnIaa", 0],
