I personally have not seen it, but I've heard it emulated it's style, even down to the soundtrack, to that of a 1980's classic horror flick.  They even released the video on VHS as well as DVD.  The critics have raved about it.   I even suggested it to a friend (who is VERY jaded when it comes to horror flicks) without even telling him the year it was made.  He came back and asked me if it was made in 1986.   In fact, it's on Netflix Instant, so I'm gonna go watch it now.  Thanks!", 9804, "oIhts4bgaa", 1],

Light headidness and hunger pangs could be side effects, but equally it could be due to you not having a sensible diet.  There seem to be 2 main solutions here:  1.  Go back to your Doctor (do not worry, they will understand and be supportive) and ask about the side effects and the time scales.  2.  Get an opinion direct from a qualified dietician on your general food consumption.  Remember that poor diet can exacerbate depression and there is always a risk of eating disorders.  Ensure that you follow a good dietary plan (based on expert opinion and not internet suggestions) as this will assist the medications to take effect.  Having been on medication for over 3 years, you should also be following a counselling/therapy programme so ask your doctor to refer you if this is not already happening.  good luck x", 9808, "f916c8d670b00602438b18034fec32c6aa", 1],

	102266 : ["I can tell that your not a Ron Paul supporter, but can you think of a Congressman that you DO support? And then ask yourself why you support him. Ron Paul obviously doesn't have many like-minded friends in congress who vote for legislation that he has created, but if you look at the bills he has tried to get through you see a trend of issues that most of congress doesn't want to vote on or doesn't want to bring into the public light. The fact that none have been signed into law (I don't know if there is one or not... just trying to make a point) only means that he doesn't have the support of the congress. Your question was asked with the intention of proving that Ron Paul is doing nothing. This just isn't the case, right now with HR 1207, one of the most historic bills our country has seen has more than 2/3 support of the house. This bill is trying to do something that hasn't been done in around 93 years. Audit the federal reserve. Now could I say that this one piece of legislation, being as important and rare as it is, could be proof that Ron Paul is not only doing things, but doing things that nobody else has the political nerve to push forward?
