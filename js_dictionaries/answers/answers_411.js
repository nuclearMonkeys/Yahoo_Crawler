	22553 : ["The availability of those vehicles will obviously be less than overall availability.  How many drivers actually own one of those vehicles? And how cost effective would it be for those drivers that do own one?   If you want to only ride in one of those you may have a very long wait, or even need to make schedule ahead.  I suggest you buy one and try it.  ", 3639, "mbwfle8vaa", 2],
	22554 : ["Because the typical driver doesn't own one of these higher-priced vehicles. Because they need to drive when there are customers and can't take the time for an hours-long charge to complete. Because the cost to operate an electric vehicle is slightly higher in some markets. Because Uber and Lyft do not own the fleet of vehicles. This isn't a bad idea, by any means, but a ride sharing business can't make it work. An eco-taxi system where a corporate entity owns all the vehicles in the fleet could, in a taxi-heavy environment like NYC, Boston, or SF, but it would never work in St. Louis, Minneapolis, or Denver. And you'd have to have riders willing to pay a little more per ride to save the planet.", 3639, "None", 2],

Australia also exports LNG to other nations and Australian mine owners earn good profit from the exports. Australian mining industry claim to give job in mining and income to the family of mine-workers but in reality spoil the health  and shorten the life of the mine worker who spends that money on medicines for cancer treatment and other life destroying diseases, doctor and insurance premiums.

	22566 : ["No, like all complex living organisms they have a finite lifespan.  Eventually cell replication breaks down and becomes increasingly flawed, i.e. the tree enters old age and frailty.  Different species have different average lifespan, much like the animal kingdom.  Some trees reproduce via cloning and some people claim the clones ARE the tree and so live for millennia but anyone with common sense notices that in fact this is a series of trees. If you're interested in trees \"The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate\" by Peter Wohlleben is pretty mindblowing.  It's not some hippy dippy book either.  Trees are far more situationally aware than we commonly think.  ", 3627, "None", 3],
