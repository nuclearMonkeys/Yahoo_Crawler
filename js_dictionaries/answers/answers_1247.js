It doesn't matter if it is an individual or a system, they are never at fault and there is always someone else to blame.  Obama has not been able to correctly identify any solution to a major problem that has risen to during this election year. He has often had to go back and change previous comments. Bush is an easy target. Most Americans do not care for him and they will easily jump on whatever bandwagon is going against him.  Obama has proven again and again he is in over his head. Let some people with experience and the ability to take blame handle this situation.  People unfortunately do not realize this is the product of a free market. You will at times have drops, especially when you have large gains for years and prices become too inflated and begin to settle back to normal. The greedy ones are being hit the hardest. The smart ones can ride this out. Government intervention is the WRONG answer.  To blame the President of the U.S. for something that the Congress of the U.S. controls is also very ignorant.

	67901 : ["They can't. All of scripture is true and independent of atheist beliefs. For example, the Bible tells us that EVERYONE is born with two lights, Creation and Conscience. Proverbs 20:27 states that the \"Spirit of man is the candle of the Lord\" and Romans 1 tells us that Creation is obvious and points to God. Furthermore, Genesis 1:26 tells us we were created in God's image and Revelation 4:11 tells us that WE were created FOR God's pleasure. Mankind never experiences true happiness and fulfillment apart from a relationship with Him. Indeed, mankind has a \"created within\" desire to WORSHIP, and this can be factually and archaeologically demonstrated by the fact that the archaeologist's shovel has uncovered civilizations which worshipped the Sun, moon, stars or a river, volcano, or \"Great Spirit,\" but no ATHEISTIC civilization has ever been unearthed. Indeed, the world IS a watch, and a rather accurate one at that. No, this DIDN'T happen by blind chance; Romans 1 has an excellent description of atheists and the condition of our current world: Rom 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:  Rom 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  Rom 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,  Rom 1:23  And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.  Rom 1:24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:  Rom 1:25  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.  Rom 1:26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  Rom 1:27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  Rom 1:28  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  Rom 1:29  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  Rom 1:30  Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  Rom 1:31  Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  Rom 1:32  Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.  And our founding fathers were truly men of understanding of the times: When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with one another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitles them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. Not only is our Declaration of Independence derived from the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" but this is where all of Western Civilization originates, beginning with the Magna Carta. Atheists are not only anti-God, they are Unamerican by their very nature. And they have the audacity to speak of Nature in condescending terms!! The Voice", 8437, "cMoK4plEaa", 1],

And in so doing they made better paths than any human or divine intervention could make. Sheep ? Intelligent designers -  I don't think so.  God ?

How many people know that bush actually tried (20something times) to push regulation of the banking and mtg companies, but the Dems blocked it every time.  So this isn't just bush's fault, in fact he may not be to blame at all since he tried to fix the problem but was blocked by a group (dems) that thought it was a good idea to loan large sums of money to groups of people who cannot ever dream of paying that money, plus interest, back.  You can also add to the dems poor choice that of the mtg companies who took advantage of this and made poor decisions.   Bush can be blamed for a lot of poor choices during his term(s), but I'm not sure one can blame him for this screwing.
