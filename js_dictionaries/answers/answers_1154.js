In a female child (who has two X sex chromosomes), a defective gene on one X chromosome is almost always counteracted by a normal gene on the other X chromosome; as a result, the girl is born with normal color vision. In a male child (who has an X and a Y sex chromosome), there is no matching normal gene to block the defect on the only X chromosome the boy has; the boy is, therefore, born color-blind. Red-green color blindness cannot be passed from a father to his sons, nor will his daughters be color-blind, unless the mother carries the defective gene as well.

By far the most common type is inherited red-green color blindness, which affects 8 percent of men and boys but only 0.5 percent of women and girls.Total color blindness, which is very rare, and pastel-shade color blindness are believed to be inherited. Other types, including blue-yellow color blindness and red-green color blindness, can be either inherited or acquired. Disease or injury affecting the retina may also be the cause of color blindness.   Why is red-green color blindness inherited by boys more often than by girls?

Heterzygous Pair ( 2 different pairs) Xx or Xy tend to be carriers. Note that since the color blindness gene comes from the female, the reason males are more likely to get it is because males have only one X  chromosome and only one Y chromosome, so if the X which comes from the mom is recessive (x) then the boy is likely to have colorblindness because it doesn't have another  (Dominant X) X chromosome to repress it.", 8199, "1695a519f88bae7e582b2806a17bb82daa", 13],
