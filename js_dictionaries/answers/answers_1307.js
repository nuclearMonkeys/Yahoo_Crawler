	70932 : ["Well yeah its a puzzle isnt it, firstly I gotta say that just because cricket originated in England doesnt give the team or its players any special advantage. As you say they are yet to win a major ODI tournament, in the first 5 World Cups they always at least reached the semi-finals but after that I can only suggest that the limited overs format never reached the kind of popularity in England that it has in Australia and sub-continent countries?, England always seem to be among the top 4 or 5 teams but thats about the best they can do these days and I dont see it changing much in the future. Failed to make a mark in the sub-continent? I cant disagree with that but that applies to pretty much every team! Not one member in the 10K club, yet they have heaps in the 7-8k club, my explanation for this curious anomaly is that it seems like England has a much different culture of selecting their players, they have a higher turnover of players than other countries, its much harder for England players to get past 120 Test matches, usually they have to play at least 3-4 seasons of county cricket before moving up to internationals, and its very rare to see players older than 35 in the England team these days, look at all the players who got to about age 35 and caved in to pressure to retire, Botham, Greig, Gatting,Gower, Vaughan, Hussain, Atherton, Thorpe, Strauss...., if those guys played for Australia or India they would have hung around for a few more years or until the selectors booted them out. There is a guy on cricinfo who produces some amazing lists of stats like which batsmen and bowlers scored the highest percentage of their runs and wickets against the best opposition, these lists can be massive I have printed some of them up to 40 pages and take a week to read! but in summary they are completely dominated by English players, probably due to the scheduling of the matches playing better opposition more often and longer series. Is it going to change in future? No I dont think so, England will probably dominate occasionally for a short time but I doubt they will ever get on top and stay there for very long, only 168 more days until the Ashes - I'm tipping England to win 3-1", 8596, "HdS25o2saa", 2],

It's not being cheap, just recycling stuff that is cluttering up your house and will most likely end up in land fill anyway.  Or even make your own pressies which cuts out the packaging. Go to the remnant shop and get some pretty sale fabric.  Chop it up and use it to wrap presents in, tying it up with string or ribbon.  After  , fold it up and store it with the string/ribbons for use again next year.  This can also be done with wrapping paper, using string/ribbons instead of cellotape (but the paper will obviously not last as long as fabric). Switch off the telly.  We weren't allowed to watch the telly at   time when we were kids.  We could fight amongst ourselves to video one of the   movies on the VCR and that was it.    may be the only time of the year where the whole family is off work together so why waste it staring at the goggle box.  Talk to each other, read stories, play games, go for a walk, get to know your kids/parents a bit better (you'll have fun, honestly!) Don't make enough food to feed the five thousand.  Come on, you know how much food you need to feed your family, so why make five times as much?  You don't have to have turkey which takes hours and hours of cooking time you know.  Think off all those KWhours burning up.  Why not have a vegetarian   for a change with locally grown veggies.

I know we've been working hard all year and need to kick back, touch base with our nearest and dearest but we should keep things simple.

	70947 : ["There are a number of ways we can help make this a greener  , one of the steps being turning off your fairy lights which waste approximately 15% of electricity - costing us on average £37 per year. You could even try those solar powered rope lights for some winter sparkle without adding to your carbon footprint. Secondly, since billions of   cards are sent each year, try to recycle them or even make your own - this is importance since the paper and materials are equivalent to around 150,000 trees in the country! Even better, use the internet to send e-cards or electronic versions and, of course, when all is over don't forget to take your cards you received from friends and family t the nearest recycling trust. A little tip - go one step further and purchase yours from local charities which are always RECYCLED and help a good cause! Next on my list is using recycled wrapping paper and use beeswax or natural vegetable-based candles since they don't contain petroleum residues - so your health and the earth will have a better   this year with these biodegrade eco-friendly products! Also, replace your   tree with a real one which is more eco-friendly.

There might be more fans with the later start, but what if there isn't? Then would it just be a waste of time? or are there other reasons why Tests are going to be played in the night? Besides money! The floodlights will be on, which means a lot more money wasted on lights, i presume because of that, the ticket prices will be higher and that could prevent a high number of fans. Cricket wise, the ball has always swing more under lights, so bowling in the late evening will be an advantage, white or pink balls would have to be used meaning, the Cricketers would either have to play in coloured clothing, or pink balls (which haven't been proven to be perfectly seeable yet) will have to be used.

	70978 : ["There are many simple ways, some more likely to be accepted than others: 1) Make a point of buying LED   lights rather than traditional filament lamp sets. 2) Get a small but live   tree and plant it in the garden after the festivities - look after it well while it's in the house, of course. 3) Buy coloured recycled paper packs to make your own hanging and tree decorations, rather than buying glittery tinsel, or at least cut down on the use of tinsel and 'metallic' decorations. 4) Use that same coloured recycled paper to wrap presents - yes, 'proper' wrapping paper looks nice but let's be honest, people are much more interested in the actual present! 5) Make a point of shunning the purchase of gifts that use excessive quantities of plastic packaging - those landfill sites won't last for ever! 6) After the unwrapping, sort the packaging and wrapping paper properly to suit whatever your local recycling scheme is. 7) We all spend a lot of time at home over   - but don't put the central heating on full blast - instead, either put some extra clothing on or use a small electric heater in the family room. 8) A large turkey may be traditional, but think of all the gas or electric used to cook it. Instead, maybe try a turkey joint, or thick slices, to reduce cooking time needed. 9) Turn lights off in unoccupied rooms, and turn   lights off when you go to bed, putting them on when it gets dark again the next day. 10) Don't put the warm leftovers straight in the fridge - this causes the fridge to have to work hard and uses a lot of electricity. Leave them out on the side but covered, until they are properly cool. 11) While you're unwrapping presents, keep the time special and turn the television off, saving more electricity. 12) Inevitably some presents will need batteries: consider buying rechargeable batteries rather than disposable. 13) If you're popping round to see friends a few houses or streets away, don't drive, walk, you'll probably be glad of the exercise! 14) If you use a dishwasher, make sure it's nice and full before turning it on, saving water. 15) Consider playing board games or organising a treasure hunt for Boxing Day, rather than watching television and films. 16) If you haven't already done so, replace bulbs in the main family room or lounge with low energy types - at this time of year the lights are on for a long time. 17) After cooking your dinner and finishing with the oven, leave the oven door open to let the heat escape into the room and save the heating bills. It all helps. 18) If you have a coal fire, only put more coal on once the flames disappear. Any sooner and the coal burns unnecessarily fast. 19) Turn any electrical appliances off completely in between uses, as standby mode still uses some power. 20) Make a New Year's Resolution to be a 'greener' person for 2008!", 8599, "ZVX6agFtaa", 1],
	70979 : ["I understand what you mean far as a modern movie. However, dont underestimate the classic Cecil B Demille \"The Ten Commandments\".  I truly feel that this film captured so much, that fancy cgi and modern effects wouldnt add much of anything to it.  The Ten Commandments has everything you just asked for. Special effects that to this day are STILL astounding and technical genius. Epic story, sweeping score, AND had big name actors/actresses in it. \"A cast of thousands\"... seems like a masterpiece to me. Most of the time, modern actors are cast by box office penny power, and not what acting skills they could bring to the table for the context.
