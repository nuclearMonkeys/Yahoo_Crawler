	114288 : ["Relax Jaret. Don't over clean under your foreskin. It will produce more oils if you clean it more often. Once a day is plenty to keep smegma away. Most of us won't get it even if we skip days, but once a day is good to be safe. If you are seeing smegma then you may need to clean a little better but not more often. NEVER use soap under your foreskin or on your head, that can also create more of a problem. You can also use a mild vinegar/water solution and soak your penis with the foreskin pulled back for 5 minutes, then rinse with plain warm water. Only do that once, and that can help remove any odor that you may be smelling.  You are cleaning it properly from the way you describe it. Pull the skin back and rinse with plain warm water then close your foreskin again. No need to dry the head, it is better if you don't.  Hope this helped answer your question Jaret. Feel free to ask any follow-up questions you may have. Good Luck!!", 10380, "uSYwTjJKaa", 3],

You can also ask any people that visit your site if they could try to get people they know to come to the site.

This would be the easiest, and most affordable (as it is free, and takes little time to start and work on). You could also use a free web hosting service, but for people to easily find you, you will need to buy a domain name. They cost $10 a year, $15 to keep your identity safe.  To get publicity you can pass out flyers at school, put some on a bulletin board, ask libraries to give out fliers, etc. You can also advertise in the newspaper classifieds.", 10381, "L5G31Funaa", 0],

As for your problem, Smegma is a build up of the natural oils that help keeps your glans clean, as long as dead skin, seamen and sperm.

Most likely not, so will have to find something comparable and provide proof of value.   But;;;;;that is no guarantee you will get that value.  Say for instance that coat cost $200 2 years ago, and can find that same coat on E-bay for $25, then they would only owe you $25, the cost to replace. Or, you can say that you had a fur coat worth $1,000, but would have to prove you were actually wearing that fur coat on the night of question.  For friends who were with you to state would not be valid since they are your friends.  Many times people will overvalue their possessions since in this case, since missing, how can you or the club prove it?   My guess is that you will get some kind of \"nuisance\" check which will be nowhere close to the value of your belongings.   Or they might even deny the claim saying \"you took the risk\" by leaving it there, or should have kept with you if very expensive or they may have a disclaimer they are not liable.    In the future, suggest either keeping your belongings with you or wearing something you can afford to lose especially in a nightclub.  good luck", 10384, "IXtiKaOYaa", 0],
