So if there is a deference in reliability it is not in engineering or design, it is a maintenance issue. For a lot of truck owners, the truck is part of what puts the bread on the table. While  most car owners treat the car as being of secondary importance. The car owner skips oil changes, doesn't check the fluids and in general just ignores the workings of the family car. But there are exceptions. Some pick up trucks use heavy grade suspension components. Some times even out dated technology that is more durable then state of the art weight saving parts and technology. But I will stick with the point of view that trucks are no more reliable then cars.

On the return trip, the first driver picked us up at our three hotels in downtown Boston, and, as that driver was not licensed to drive in New Hampshire, they drove our bus due west to Albany, NY.  There, a second driver took over and drove the bus to Montreal, Quebec.  There, a third driver took over and drove us to Ottawa. As this was now in the AM hours, and as there would be no local transit to carry members of our travel group home from several pickup/drop off spots, I arranged with the driver to take us on a route across Ottawa that I worked out, that got everyone within a block or two of their homes.  That took two hours to cross Ottawa, from east to west, and when we got to my neighborhood, we were down to three passengers, myself included. We policed the bus, making such no stuff of our group's was still aboard and released the bus for the return empty trip back to Montreal. One of the other two was staying at my home, and the third was the only one of the group who lived west or me, so I drove her back to her place, and came back home.
