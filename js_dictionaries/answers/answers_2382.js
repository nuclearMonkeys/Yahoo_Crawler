	124915 : ["JWs' version of truth is transient like shifting sands or a rudderless boat tossed hither and thither by the wind and waves. They love to misapply Proverbs 4:18 to justify their constantly changing false teachings but ignore other texts like 2 Timothy 3:7, Ecclesiastes 12:12 and Ephesians 4:14 which accurately describe and condemn what's happening with them. What they called truth decades ago is now a cause for shame for them! This has been a consistent feature of their history. Thus, in all likelihood, their unique teachings that they're now calling truth, will expire into falsehood in the future.  Members typically don't do any independent verification of what the organization tells them. In fact, their minds are unable to process independent verification because their minds are poisoned with the prideful notion that their leaders alone have spiritual insight and the whole world is deceived by satan. With that kind of mindset, no amount of hard, verifiable facts can reach their minds and hearts if it contradicts what their idolized organization and its leadership tells them. Their minds are poisoned with fallacious, faulty reasonings and emotionalism. \"Or does the Watchtower already take care of all that?\" Funny you should say that. The organization has actually published a statement in one their magazines to the effect that JWs don't need to do much in depth research because the brothers in the writing dept. have already done all the heavy research for them. They're basically encouraged to keep in the Watchtower bubble - researching religious matters using only information published by the organization. Why should anyone in their right mind have any confidence in any of their current unique teachings? And yet they have the gall to shun members who reject current dubious teachings not firmly rooted in scripture. It's a prideful, controlling religion that does not genuinely value truth. They value blind conformity and blind loyalty over truth. They make a mockery of the word truth and they bring great reproach on the name \"Jehovah\".", 10818, "mNw4ldB3aa", 2],
	124916 : ["JWs are not allowed to independently test anything their Governing Body tells them is the truth.The GB has declared,  \"Your attitude toward the wheatlike anointed 'brothers' of Christ [the anointed class] and the treatment you accord them will be the determining factor as to whether you go into 'everlasting cutting off' or receive 'everlasting life'. Prove yourself to be a loyal companion of the anointed 'wheat' class, the 'faithful and discreet slave,' whom Christ has appointed to provide spiritual 'food at the proper time'.\" (page 26 para. 20 1 Aug. 1981 Watchtower) So this group says that loyalty to them will determine whether JWs survive Armageddon or not. Further, JWs can only obtain 'spiritual food' from this class of leaders. If they dare go anywhere else, they will risk being put out. This class has even warned members against reading the Bible alone, without their explanatory literature! \"Furthermore, not only do we find that people cannot see the divine plan in studying the Bible by itself, but we see, also, that if anyone lays the Scripture Studies aside, even after he has used them, after he has become familiar with them, after he has read them for ten years, if he then lays them aside and ignores them and goes to the Bible alone, though he has understood his Bible for ten years, our experience shows that within two years he goes into darkness. On the other hand, if he had merely read the Scripture Studies with their references, and had not read a page of the Bible, as such, he would be in the light at the end of two years, because he would have the light of the Scriptures.\" (15 Sept 1910 Watchtower p 298/9) Notice that those Scripture Studies have now been abandoned by the JWs of today and are a total embarrassment to them. Also: \"Thus the Bible is an organizational book and belongs to the Christian congregation as an organization, not to individuals, regardless of how sincerely they may believe that they can interpret the Bible. For this reason the Bible cannot be properly understood without Jehovah's visible organization in mind.\" (1 October 1967 Watchtower, p 587 para 9) More recently they continue this claim: “But Jehovah God has also provided his visible organization, his “faithful and discreet slave,” made up of spirit-anointed ones, to help Christians in all nations to understand and apply properly the Bible in their lives. Unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that God is using, we will not progress along the road to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do.”  (Watchtower 1 December 1981, p 27) Any JW who does not agree with that will be 'marked' and watched. If they persist in saying anything that does not harmonise with what the F&DS class is currently stating, they will be put out and identified as an apostate, and shunned. Anyone who decides to become a JW will have knowingly submitted 100% to what this tiny group of men in America declare to be God's truth. That is why the second baptismal vow requires candidates to say they are publicly identifying themselves as being \"in association with Jehovah's spirit-filled organization\". (1 April 2006 Watchtower pp 21-25) As only a tiny percentage of JWs claim to be 'spirit-filled', and most of the FD&S class make that claim, you will be saying you submit to their authority, because you will be told that you are not 'spirit-filled'. That is why most JWs just accept whatever they are told is 'the truth'.", 10818, "0aN1xIxfaa", 4],

	124921 : ["JWs are a misguided cult that believes: That Jesus the Christ of Nazareth, the Messiah is inferior to God, which is contrary to John 1:1-18 and 1 Timothy 3:16 that proves Jesus is God. Man does not have a spirit which is contrary to Gal 3:14. That Jesus is the Archangel Michael, which is contrary to The Word of God (The Tree of Life, Light, Love, Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge) as John 1:1-14, 14-9 reveals. That Jesus second coming happened in 1914. That we are to worship Jehovah only, which is contrary to John 1:1-14. JWs believe that satan is the invisible ruler of the world; not true, God rules over satan. JWs believe that only 144,000 thousand go to heaven; again not true: John 3:16 tells us otherwise. JWs believe that hell is mankind's common grave; not even close: The place of eternal punishment for the unrighteous. The NKJV and KJV use this word to translate Sheol and Hades, the Old and New Testament words, respectively, for the abode of the dead. Hell as a place of punishment translates Gehenna , the Greek form of the Hebrew word that means \"the vale of Hinnom\"-a valley just south of Jerusalem. In this valley the Canaanites worshiped Baal and the fire-god Molech by sacrificing their children in a fire that burned continuously. Even Ahaz and Manasseh, kings of Judah, were guilty of this terrible, idolatrous practice (2 Chron 28:3; 33:6). The prophet Jeremiah predicted that God would visit such destruction upon Jerusalem that this valley would be known as the \"Valley of Slaughter\" (Jer 7:31-34; 19:2,6). In his religious reforms, King Josiah put an end to this worship. He defiled the valley in order to make it unfit even for pagan worship (2 Kings 23:10). In the time of Jesus the Valley of Hinnom was used as the garbage dump of Jerusalem. Into it were thrown all the filth and garbage of the city, including the dead bodies of animals and executed criminals. To consume all this, fires burned constantly. Maggots worked in the filth. When the wind blew from that direction over the city, its awfulness was quite evident. At night wild dogs howled and gnashed their teeth as JWs fought over the garbage. Jesus used this awful scene as a symbol of hell. In effect he said, \"Do you want to know what hell is like? Look at the valley of Gehenna.\" So hell may be described as God's \"cosmic garbage dump.\" All that is unfit for heaven will be thrown into hell. The word Gehenna occurs 12 times in the New Testament. Each time it is translated as \"hell.\" With the exception of James 3:6, it is used only by Jesus (Matt 5:22,29-30; 10:28; 23:15,33; Mark 9:43,45,47; Luke 12:5). In Matt 5:22; 18:9; and Mark 9:47, it is used with \"fire\" as \"hell fire.\" So the word hell (Gehenna) as a place of punishment is used in the New Testament by Him who is the essence of infinite love. In Mark 9:46 and 48, hell is described as a place where \"their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.\" Repeatedly Jesus spoke of outer darkness and a furnace of fire, where there will be wailing, weeping, and gnashing of teeth (Matt 8:12; 13:42,50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luke 13:28). Obviously this picture is drawn from the valley of Gehenna The Book of Revelation describes hell as \"a lake of fire burning with brimstone\" (Rev 19:20; 20:10,14-15; 21:8). Into hell will be thrown the beast and the false prophet (Rev 19:20). At the end of the age the devil himself will be thrown into it, along with death and hades and all whose names are not in the Book of Life. \"And JWs will be tormented day and night forever and ever\" (Rev 20:10 b). Because of the symbolic nature of the language, some people question whether hell consists of actual fire. Such reasoning should bring no comfort to the lost. The reality is greater than the symbol. The Bible exhausts human language in describing heaven and hell. The former is more glorious, and the latter more terrible, than language can express. JWs believe that the soul dies at death of the body; no, the soul is more than just the living essence of the body: The word soul also refers to the inner life of man, the seat of his emotions, and the center of human personality. The first use of the word soul in the Old Testament expresses this meaning: \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being (soul)\" (Gen 2:7). This means more than being given physical life; the biblical writer declares that man became a \"living soul,\" or a person, a human being, one distinct from all other animals. The soul is described as the seat of many emotions and desires: the desire for food (Deut 12:20-21), love (Song 1:7), longing for God (Ps 63:1), rejoicing (Ps 86:4), knowing (Ps 139:14), and memory (Lam 3:20). In the New Testament, Jesus spoke of his soul as being \"exceedingly sorrowful\" (Matt 26:38). Mary, the mother of Jesus, proclaimed that her soul \"magnifies the Lord\" (Luke 1:46). John prayed that Gaius would \"prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers\" (3 John 2). JWs believe that the Earth will never be destroyed or depopulated. Wrong, Rev 21:1-2 1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. 2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. KJV JWs believe that Jesus died for only the obedient. Not true for we have all sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God.  JWs also believe that Jesus is inferior to God and do not believe in the Trinity. Yet Jesus said: “Matt 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:” JWs believe the Earth will never be destroyed or depopulated but in fact God will create New Heavens and a new Earth along with new physical laws. God's people will be removed from the old Earth and placed on the New Earth as Matthew 24:31, Mark 13:27 and Thessalonians 4:16-17 reveals.  JWs believe that the wicked with be destroyed but the wicked will be eternally punished as Daniel 12:1-2, Matthew 25:46 and Mark 3:29 reveal. JWs believe the human soul ceases to exist at death but the Truth is the Spirit of those who have accepted Jesus the Christ of Nazareth, the Messiah as their personal savior goes directly to Heaven/God as Ecclesiastes 3:21 and 12:7 reveal.", 10816, "None", -3],

John 15:16 In this instance, though, Stephen had a vision of the Son of man standing at God's right hand.  Acts 7:56  Fully aware that Jesus had been given the power to resurrect the dead, Stephen spoke, but did not pray, directly to Jesus, asking Him to safeguard his spirit.  John 5:27-29 Stephen and the apostle John spoke to Jesus in heaven?' That is true. These events, however, did not involve prayers, as Stephen and John each saw Jesus in vision and spoke to him directly.   Bear in mind that simply speaking even to God does not in itself constitute a prayer. Adam and Eve spoke to God, offering excuses for their great sin, when He judged them following their sin in Eden. Their talking to him in that way was not a prayer.

	124928 : ["The last inspection carried out by Jesus apparently took place in 1918.  The 15 January 2008 Watchtower said (on page 24): \"When Christ inspected the (society) in 1918... He was pleased thereafter to appoint them \"over all of his belongings.\"  But then the FDS received increased light, no doubt from Jehovah via the Governing Body: The 15 July 2013 Watchtower article \"Tell us, when will these things be?\" said: \"Finally, we examined why Jesus' arrival to appoint the faithful slave over all of his belongings did not occur in 1919 but will take place during the great tribulation\".   Ah, so the FDS (via the GB) got it wrong back in 2008.  Jehovah had not seen fit to put them in charge over ALL his belongings.  That glorious event is now sometime future, during the great tribulation, they say.  Here is a summary of all the changes in the 15 July 2013 Watchtower:  The “Faithful and Discrete Slave” (FDS) were thought to be all the anointed followers of Christ on earth at any given point in history. Now they say the FDS is only a small group of anointed brothers at headquarters who are directly involved in preparing and dispensing spiritual food during Christ's presence. The “composite slave” is made up of this handful of men plus the Governing body.  Christ appointed the FDS over “the domestics” in 33 C.E. That has been changed to 1919.  Also, they used to believe that Christ had appointed “the slave” over ALL his belongings in 1918, but now they admit that was wrong and this will not happen till the Great Tribulation.  Christ's belongings were thought to be all the spiritual assets on earth that have become Christ's property in connection with his heavenly authority as King. Now they're saying Christ's belongings are all things heavenly and earthly, including the Messianic Kingdom.    The belief that Christ arrived in 1918 as “the bridegroom” has been dropped. He will not arrive as “the bridegroom” till the Great Tribulation – sometime future. Christ will appoint the Governing Body, along with other anointed Christians, “over all his belongings” when he comes in judgment during the Great Tribulation.  This is what happens when fallible men set themselves up as Jehovah's earthly representatives and falsely claim to have the Holy Spirit guiding and directing them. One hundred years after Christ Jesus is supposed to have been ruling from heaven the penny has finally dropped. All that stuff they predicted was wrong, so they have to give themselves more time to play with and keep the gullible rank and file Witnesses hanging onto their every word. They still cling to 1914, but have had to make \"adjustments\" because the Great Tribulation is still some time future. If you ask me, the FDS are long overdue another inspection.  Given the way the GB are manipulating the members and demanding total obedience, I think they would be identified as the wicked slave who abused the members of his master's household. P.S. If it's any comfort, the men of the GB, who claim to be the FDS, are now finally being inspected - by a number of criminal courts throughout the world who are looking into their gross negligence when it comes to child protection.", 10821, "None", 0],
	124929 : ["Ah, the \"Mandela Effect\" based on events in the 1980's when the Apartheid government in South Africa put about a propaganda story that Nelson Mandela had died in prison.  The fact is that Nelson Mandela lived for many years after his release from prison but even today, a large group of people believe he died in prison. No amount of verifiable facts will disuade them from clinging to a false belief. Of course the Governing Body don't want the Witnesses to learn about such things, especially when they themselves are guilty of spreading propaganda that distorts the truth and changes reality to suit their own purposes.   Take, for example, their expectations about 1975 and their belief that Armageddon would happen before the end of the 20th century.  When nothing happened, the Governing Body denied saying what they had said and blamed the Witnesses for reading too much into what had been published.  No way does the Governing Body want anybody to ever question their interpretation of events, even when the facts can be verified to expose the lies they have told.  If the Governing Body says Jehovah God has given them \"increased light\" that necessitates them changing virtually everything they ever said about 1914, 1918 and 1975, then the collective memory of those wrong views must be erased and replace with the new version of events. That's why they deny what they used to say about 1914, 1918 and 1975.  Even though it's in print.  That's why Jehovah's Witnesses remain in ignorance of the propaganda tactics used by their leaders, and why they probably will never hear about the \"Mandela Effect.\"", 10822, "None", 3],

The NWT then replaces \"Lord\" with \"Jehovah\" in verse 60: \"Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong voice, \"Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.\"  The NIV correctly translates the Greek in verse 60 as \"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.\" Clearly, the original manuscripts did NOT use the Tetragrammaton in either verses 59 or 60 so there is no justification for anybody trying to make out that having spoken to the Lord Jesus in verse 59, Stephen then speaks to Jehovah God in verse 60. Another example of how the NWT denies the divinity of Jesus by inserting \"Jehovah\" when the context clearly means the Lord Jesus. P.S. I have a note in my Bible that the word \"prayed\" as used in verse 59 can also mean \"to appeal to\" so the issue here is not whether Stephen was praying to Jesus but that Stephen was calling out to, appealing to or speaking to Jesus.  The issue here is that the Lord in verse 59 is Jesus, but the NWT then says the Lord in verse 60 is Jehovah!", 10819, "None", 4],

	124959 : ["All three! We desire to worship Jehovah and obey Jesus in the best understood way and the society constantly works to keep things as accurate as any human can. Granted we all make errors but that's what Christianity is about fixing our errors and doing what's right. If we mess up we need to fix things. We recognize that while Jehovah's witnesses are God's visable organization that doesn't make us unable to make errors!", 10820, "None", -2],
	124960 : ["We change because holy spirit from Jehovah motivates us to study and in the course of study, we, as imperfect humans, may see something that we originally did not see. Have you ever watched a movie a second or third time, and find yourself saying \"I didn't see that the first time.\" Reading and studying the Bible on a regular basis, and asking for insight in prayer can help bring to light things that were not seen in the past. The fault is not with the Bible, or Jehovah, or Jesus, or the holy spirit, or even the \"organization.\" It is a matter of being imperfect humans. History, archaeology, and scholarly research comes to light. And we do not ignore what has been found. At least we are willing to correct what we state, unlike many religions which know that   is pagan and still go ahead and celebrate. Or that Halloween is God-dishonoring, and yet trick or treat sometimes right in the church activity rooms. Or go to war with their fellow man over land and oil when the Bible says at Isaiah 2:4 that war should not be participated in by those who want to live by God's standards. Or racial or ethnic hatreds - Acts 10:34, 35 show this not from God. I repeat, at least we will change.", 10820, "JZxZ8mKRaa", -1],
	124961 : ["Your question assumes things that are not true, so none of your multiple choice answers will be the whole truth. You ask \" What is the dominant force behind the witnesses willingness to change what they believe whenever the society changes what it teaches ? \" By \"the society\"  I am assuming that you mean the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society,  If that is a correct assumption, the Witnesses are not willing to change WHATEVER THEY BELIEVE whenever \"the society changes what it teaches.\"  because that is NOT the way the society works.  We often get clarifications on details, but the Bible is the word of God and Jesus is our leader, not anyone in \"the society.\"  In fact, all who have responsibility among  Jehovah's witnesses are obligated themselves to \"handle the word of the truth aright\"  and they all have to DO WHAT JESUS SAID. “Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.”—2 TIMOTHY 2:15 So our willingness is to change OURSELVES from the imperfections that all humans, even Christians have due to our inherited imperfection.  Again, this is something that all Jehovah's witnesses are obligated to do, EVEN THOSE IN RESPONSIBLE POSITIONS.  The apostle Peter, who was a member of the first century governing body of the Christian congregation, had to change his position when he stopped associating with Christians who were not Jews, and Paul had to reprove him.  Galatians 2:11-14 Certain things are not going to change, because we have believed them from the time that we began to be a modern day international body of Bible Students.  We will always believe them because they are what Jesus Christ, our Leader, believed and taught, and also because they are clearly established in the God's word, which is given to us to \"set things straight\"  2 Timothy 3:16  1  God. We worship the one true and Almighty God, the Creator, whose name is Jehovah. (Psalm 83:18; Revelation 4:11) He is the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.—Exodus 3:6; 32:11; John 20:17. 2  Bible. We recognize the Bible as God's inspired message to humans. (John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16) We base our beliefs on all 66 of its books, which include both the “Old Testament” and the “New Testament.” Professor Jason D. BeDuhn aptly described it when he wrote that Jehovah's Witnesses built “their system of belief and practice from the raw material of the Bible without predetermining what was to be found there.” * While we accept the entire Bible, we are not fundamentalists. We recognize that parts of the Bible are written in figurative or symbolic language and are not to be understood literally.—Revelation 1:1. 3  Jesus. We follow the teachings and example of Jesus Christ and honor him as our Savior and as the Son of God. (Matthew 20:28; Acts 5:31) Thus, we are Christians. (Acts 11:26) However, we have learned from the Bible that Jesus is not Almighty God and that there is no Scriptural basis for the Trinity doctrine.—John 14:28. 4  The Kingdom of God. This is a real government in heaven, not a condition in the hearts of Christians. It will replace human governments and accomplish God's purpose for the earth. (Daniel 2:44; Matthew 6:9, 10) It will take these actions soon, for Bible prophecy indicates that we are living in “the last days.”—2 Timothy 3:1-5; Matthew 24:3-14. Jesus is the King of God's Kingdom in heaven. He began ruling in 1914.—Revelation 11:15. 5  Salvation. Deliverance from sin and death is possible through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus. (Matthew 20:28; Acts 4:12) To benefit from that sacrifice, people must not only exercise faith in Jesus but also change their course of life and get baptized. (Matthew 28:19, 20; John 3:16; Acts 3:19, 20) A person's works prove that his faith is alive. (James 2:24, 26) However, salvation cannot be earned—it comes through “the undeserved kindness of God.”—Galatians 2:16, 21. 6  Heaven. Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and the faithful angels reside in the spirit realm. * (Psalm 103:19-21; Acts 7:55) A relatively small number of people—144,000—will be resurrected to life in heaven to rule with Jesus in the Kingdom.—Daniel 7:27; 2 Timothy 2:12; Revelation 5:9, 10; 14:1, 3. 7  Earth. God created the earth to be mankind's eternal home. (Psalm 104:5; 115:16; Ecclesiastes 1:4) God will bless obedient people with perfect health and everlasting life in an earthly paradise.—Psalm 37:11, 34. 8  Evil and suffering. These began when one of God's angels rebelled. (John 8:44) This angel, who after his rebellion was called “Satan” and “Devil,” persuaded the first human couple to join him, and the consequences have been disastrous for their descendants. (Genesis 3:1-6; Romans 5:12) In order to settle the moral issues raised by Satan, God has allowed evil and suffering, but He will not permit them to continue forever. 9  Death. People who die pass out of existence. (Psalm 146:4; Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10) They do not suffer in a fiery hell of torment. God will bring billions back from death by means of a resurrection. (Acts 24:15) However, those who refuse to learn God's ways after being raised to life will be destroyed forever with no hope of a resurrection.—Revelation 20:14, 15. 10 Family. We adhere to God's original standard of marriage as the union of one man and one woman, with sexual immorality being the only valid basis for divorce. (Matthew 19:4-9) We are convinced that the wisdom found in the Bible helps families to succeed.—Ephesians 5:22–6:1. 11 Our worship. We do not venerate the cross or any other images. (Deuteronomy 4:15-19; 1 John 5:21) Key aspects of our worship include the following: Praying to God.—Philippians 4:6. Reading and studying the Bible.—Psalm 1:1-3. Meditating on what we learn from the Bible.—Psalm 77:12. Meeting together to pray, study the Bible, sing, express our faith, and encourage fellow Witnesses and others.—Colossians 3:16; Hebrews 10:23-25. Preaching the “good news of the Kingdom.”—Matthew 24:14. Helping those in need.—James 2:14-17. Constructing and maintaining Kingdom Halls and other facilities used to further our worldwide Bible educational work.—Psalm 127:1. Sharing in disaster relief.—Acts 11:27-30. A congregation meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses 12 Our organization. We are organized into congregations, each of which is overseen by a body of elders. However, the elders do not form a clergy class, and they are unsalaried. (Matthew 10:8; 23:8) We do not practice tithing, and no collections are ever taken at our meetings. (2 Corinthians 9:7) All our activities are supported by anonymous donations. The Governing Body, a small group of mature Christians who serve at our world headquarters, provides direction for Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.—Matthew 24:45. 13  Our unity. We are globally united in our beliefs. (1 Corinthians 1:10) We also work hard to have no social, ethnic, racial, or class divisions. (Acts 10:34, 35; James 2:4) Our unity allows for personal choice, though. Each Witness makes decisions in harmony with his or her own Bible-trained conscience.—Romans 14:1-4; Hebrews 5:14. 14  Our conduct. We strive to show unselfish love in all our actions. (John 13:34, 35) We avoid practices that displease God, including the misuse of blood by taking blood transfusions. (Acts 15:28, 29; Galatians 5:19-21) We are peaceful and do not participate in warfare. (Matthew 5:9; Isaiah 2:4) We respect the government where we live and obey its laws as long as these do not call on us to disobey God's laws.—Matthew 22:21; Acts 5:29. 15   Our relationships with others. Jesus commanded: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” He also said that Christians “are no part of the world.” (Matthew 22:39; John 17:16) So we try to “work what is good toward all,” yet we remain strictly neutral in political affairs and avoid affiliation with other religions. (Galatians 6:10; 2 Corinthians 6:14) However, we respect the choices that others make in such matters.—Romans 14:12.", 10820, "2a8c395f0e25741b188b78eece388316aa", -2],
