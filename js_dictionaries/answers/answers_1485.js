	79935 : ["In no particular order: 1) People that are so religious they      a) try to convert anyone else to their belief system      b) don't make intelligent, rational choices, they only make stupid choices based on their \"faith\" 2) People that think they know how everybody should live their life - if it's not hurting anyone else (marijuana, homosexuality, etc) it's none of your business and it should be legal and perfectly acceptable 3) People that write badly - there vs. their vs. they're and such things.  Spelling and use of correct grammar are valuable skills. 4) People that laugh at their own jokes, or especially after non-humorous sentences.  \"Hey will you hand me the salt?  Hahahaha!\" ....  WTF people? 5) People that are rude - loud people in apartment complexes, people that stand at seated concerts despite blocking the view of people behind them, obnoxious people in movie theaters, etc. 6) Bad drivers.  If you can't drive the speed limit, get off the road.  If you can't stay in one lane, swerve without signaling, don't pay attention, tailgate, sit at green lights cause you're retarded, park angled or offset so spots next to you are unusable, stop anywhere (not for emergencies) that's not a parking spot and kick on your hazards like that makes it ok, get off the road. 7) People on bicycles that don't use sidewalks.  Bikes can go in the road if and only if they can follow all traffic laws, which includes going 35 MPH so they're not holding up all traffic behind them.  Cars are more important than bicycles.  Also, bonus annoyance points if you wear the full spandex outfit to bike around town.  It's not a race, you don't need to showcase your dong. 8) If you live in a country, speak the language well enough so people can understand you.  If you don't, never go out without bringing a translator with you.  I don't speak french, and believe me, I am never going to go to France.  See how easy that is?  I don't speak spanish, and I'm sure as hell never going to go to Mexico. 9) People that work in customer service that are really bad at customer service.  If you deal with people, especially in sales, and especially when you get commission, you should be friendly, knowledgable, polite, and willing to help the customer at all costs.  If you're not, get a new job. 10) People that make excuses about why their life sucks - I am discriminated against because I'm black/female/muslim/short/pretty etc.  You make your own future.  If you don't get a job, apply somewhere else.  Didn't get into college?  Maybe you should have studied harder.  You need to work to succeed at life, it shouldn't just be handed to you.  Nobody is really out to get you.  You can just get over yourself, stop making excuses, and realize that you are a loser and people don't like you because you're a loser, not because of some minor attribute like skin color or gender.", 9010, "K1HGtB3maa", 0],

	79937 : ["I watch both, I started watching grey's because it got you hooked into the patients stories. You wanted to see how that resolved as well as what was personally going on in the doctor's lives. I stopped watching grey's because Meredith became too needy, Izzy too whiney, and the whole McDreamy and Meredith thing too much. I am in the minority that I do not like Meredith and McDreamy. Grey's is slowly starting to get back to where it was at the beginning so I continue to watch in hopes that it will be the show I fell in love with. Private Practice I watch because of the characters of the doctors and the fact that you get involved with the patients as well. It has the humor that Grey's started out with, although there is some predictability with the romances on the show most plotlines have already been done and they work.  Both shows on a good night are just pure entertainment, sometimes tearjerking, and gripping.", 9011, "R9rJSwshaa", 0],
