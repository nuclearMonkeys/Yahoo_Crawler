	129472 : ["All our ancestors, except the Native Americans, came across the big ocean as refugees from religious persecution, were tossed out as the dredge of the society or to escape from utter poverty. Today, it's pretty much the same reason, poverty, persecution or economic opportunities. The mode of transportation has changed. Besides boats, there are airplanes and many, as you well know, are walking across a brutal desert. After the American Revolutionary War, revolutions erupted throughout the New World and even in the Old World most notably, the French Revolution. Back in the new United States of America many loyalists to the British Crown, fearing retribution or death, left their homes by the thousands by fleeing to British-controlled Canada.These early immigrants to present-day Canada are still known as the United Empire Loyalists.  In a twist of irony, the UEL were instrumental in securing British control over Canada during the War of 1812, to them the tyrants and aggressors were the Americans. Of course the world changes and the USA, UK and Canada are best of friends. Throughout the centuries since the American Revolution, many countries have erupted in revolution in the name of freedom, some succeed, others failed. In failure, many escape their homelands to other lands of freedom. So, to assume the Americans are alone in trying to toss out tyranny is shortsighted. In time, another revolution is pursued sometimes it's a peaceful revolution, sometimes it's not. Franco's fascist Spain, most of the former Soviet satellites and the USSR itself were blessed in seeing an end to dictatorships by a relatively peaceful overthrow.  So to answer your very last questions,\" why don't people from other countries around the USA do the same\". They have. \"Why do they run?\" Most likely to survive, some to fight another day. \"Don't they want their own country to be better?  For the vast majority, of course they do, sometimes it just doesn't work out right the first time, but there's always another day.", 11032, "SmYQynrCaa", 0],

US corporations must compete with foreign corporations, and if a large company like Exxon, who has 80% of its revenue and profit outside the US has to pay a greater % of its profits to the government than Shell, a British / Dutch company, it is at an economic disadvantage to Shell.  So what happens is that Exxon does not repatriate its foreign profit, (the money made in foreign subsidiaries) to the US, in order to pay less taxes. It causes the US economy to suffer, because those profits stay overseas, and are used for capital investment in the foreign country instead of the US. Furthermore, US corporations are under no law that prevents then from leaving the US, and incorporating in a foreign country with lower taxes (Tyco for example is incorporated in Bermuda). This further deprives the US government of taxes, and spurns domestic growth by Tyco.  Economics is a very easy science to understand. Companies, and citizens will maximize their efforts to legally avoid taxes, and corporations are doing that. Lowering corporate taxes would actually increase the treasury more than raising taxes, as funds would be repatriated to the US.", 11033, "OA3Mgsuaaa", 2],

I have always said that the WORD has been altered by man to control his fellow Man.  Then again, I also believe that all life is connected at a fundemental level we have yet to discover. I believe that at this interconnected level, the sub-consious of the more intelligent forms of life can share information with this \"Super-Consious\" as it were. I believe that in so doing, this sharing is what is more commonly known as the power of miracles to many of the religions of Man, and the Plaseabo Effect to those who worship science. I know that a strong mind can influence the reality around it, even to the point where the laws of physics can be bent, but not changed.

As a result the minimum price the company must charge in order to make production worthwhile goes up also.

Make it tougher and more expensive for businesses to operate in your city/state/country and those businesses will be much less likely to expand in your area and are more likely to move to other areas.  And you can forget about attracting any new business development. Taxes are the inverse of economic activity. Increases in taxes lower economic activity and decreases in taxes increase economic activity.  It has been proven over and over in history to work like that.

As recent as the early 1990s, the Republic of Ireland was one of the poorer nations in Europe, plagued by poverty and emigration. The Irish government implemented several policies, including reducing government spending and reducing taxes. What happened after, sometimes referred to “Celtic Tiger,” is that businesses came flocking to Ireland, and the economy boomed. Currently, Ireland has the second highest per capita income of any country in the European Union, and fourth highest in the world based on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Look at California, who continues to tax like crazy and the businesses are flocking to Nevada. Look at my home state of Michigan, where my Democrat governor would agree with you in word, but guess what she did when she wanted jobs here?  Offer tax breaks to Hollywood so they'd film here.
