No E sound there. The word \"there\".  What the heck is up with that word.  the TH sounds like a D, and the last E isn't even pronunced. Who ever thought of the idea of writting two O's in order to make it sound like a U. Or why would you need two L's in \"really\"?  Or two D's in \"add\"?  Or the H in \"why\" or \"what\"? And many many other words. By the way, I just want to make a comment on El Sancho.

Though they have no paid ministry, they still have employees, such as custodians and record-keepers, that need to be payed. They also use i to build more church buildings and other LDS-related stuff. The big sink, though, is emergency relief. The lDS church gave millions of dollars to help in Thailand and New Orleans after their respective disasters, as well as almost every emergency in the last few decades.  In terms of other religions and money, they do need to pay their ministry, and I know the Catholic Church also made huge contributions to the above disasters On that whole \"changing the Book of Mormon\" thing whenever its useful, prove it.

	68088 : ["Sanding it , gently will get it where the wall becomes smooth- so when you paint over it, you will not be able to tell if you painted over another coat.

	68089 : ["To get one coat of paint to stick on top of another the two layers have to be able to bond together.  If the original layer is shiny then it's difficult to form this bond so you need to 'key' the surface by sanding it.  You don't need to go mad, just enough to make the surface feel a bit rough, just rub it over a few times with a medium grade sandpaper and then brush it over with a soft brush to remove the dust. Primer is mainly used to seal bare wood or metal, if you applied normal paint to bare wood it would soak in like a sponge but the primer provides a base layer to prevent this happening. On a wall or large area you can use either a watered down mix of PVA (about 10 parts water to 1 part PVA) or just use cheap emulsion paint.  This will bond the surface and prevent it absorbing the finishing layers of paint. If the existing paint is sound then you don't need to prime it or undercoat it, just apply as many coats as necessary to give a nice even coverage. What I'd suggest is to give the paintwork a quick sand down all over and smooth down any rough bits.  Fill any gaps or cracks with caulk or filler and leave to dry, sand the repaired areas to a nice smooth finish, brush off the dust, wash with warm soapy water, quick wipe with clean water to get rid of any soap.  Primer on any exposed wood or PVA/emsulsion on bare walls, leave to dry, and then 2 or 3 coats of paint as needs be. If your kitchen tends to get steamed up then check the paint you're buying, some are designed for use in kitchens and bathrooms whereas others such as matt paints aren't particularly suitable.", 8442, "AA10993476", 0],

Now Jewish dominated media indoctrinate the masses and encourage them to make constant use of the word. They want the people to use this word as a weapon to defend their own race.  Only the Jews escape being labeled racist because the power they have over the media can 'educate' the masses into believing Jews are 'the chosen ones', and anyone that labels a Jew racist is 'anti-semetic'. However, no-one can be anti-white. The Jews also know racial diversity causes many problems. This continues to fuel the use of the word 'racist'. They know racism is human nature and can never be removed, but their media keep alive a false hope in the public that racism can be overcome. The Jews also constantly pump out anti-white films which portray the Jews as victims and whites as opressors ex. Schindlers list. This conjures up feelings of sympathy and guilt in whites and non-whites. You never see films about Jewish atrocities, because Jews control Hollywood. And if these films were made, then the Jews would manipulate the media and present the Jewish atrocities as fiction and lies to undermine Jewish agendas. As the media promote this diversity with the aim to create racial and social conflict, the Jews emerge as the victors, and white man the scapegoat. Thus, it is now impossible to be a proud white.
