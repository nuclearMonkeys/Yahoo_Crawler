	114888 : ["There are 3 things that lead to fear in climbing: Exposure, Difficulty and Type of Climbing Exposure is how far above the ground you are and how far you would fall. This is very mental - everyone has fear the first time they are 1000 ft off the ground and the people at the bottom look like ants. You get used to this one, but it will always get your attention. The first time I lead Mt. Whitney and stepped out on to the 1st traverse I was scared - now each time I do it I feel the fear but know how to control it. Difficulty is how far past your climbing ability you are. If the climbing is like a ladder, your fear is lower. If you are holding on to dime size holds (even 15ft off the ground) you are going to have fear. This one is limited by your ability and you will always be able to find something hard enough to scare you. The last one is subjective because if you are on top rope and KNOW that you can only fall 6\" before the rope catches you, most people won't have fear regardless of the exposure or the difficulty. If you are leading a route that would normally be easy, then exposure and difficulty start to bother you. Good Luck", 10402, "ICsOPpszaa", 3],

Find an indoor climbing gym and either join or find out which days have daily discounts and start going. There is usually an introductory class that teaches belaying (when you feed the safety rope for another climber) and sometimes basic climbing technique - start there.

In the beginning, it is always dark (The Neverending Story).  God and whatnot is only ONE possibility, possible doesn't mean true. I think life forms and matter came from science, not from a man in the sky. It just seems illogical to me. In orbit, tiny rocks and bigger rocks join together when they meet and they form a planet. I know very little about eletrons, atoms etc but I very much believe that that is the reason behind matter and life. I don't believe in the man in the sky. I think humans created god, long ago, because back then mankind didn't have the technology that we do now, they had no other explaination so they came up with the concept of god.  I find it very hard to believe that such a being can have that much power all to himself. If there was a god wouldn't god share his power with his creations like Davros and the daleks? At least the Daleks know who their creator is! Lol. Edit: I don't mind what other people think either as long as they don't care what I think :P Life after death, again, there are many different things that may await.

	114900 : ["I am a theist and I tend to follow the concept of big bang and all sciences. Nevertheless, I believe that all this perfectness within the nature and the correlation between every single link in sciences has to have some great power that can orchestrate this design to be so beautiful, thrilling and magnificent. I do not think that we were created out of the blue with just \"let it be\", but with some specific process. Although I believe in what can one call \"god\", I disregard him (god) to any particular religion because I think that NONE religion is true and veritable, let alone applicable. When I say \"god\" I mean some hidden and unknown power that you cannot explain but you see the effect of. In no matter, I refer a god to whom you pray or beg for forgiveness. About atheism, I respect it and think that people who hold this idea based not on foolishness or negligence but rather following the pure reason and the scientific method, possess profound understanding on the matter. I am open-minded and can tolerate all kind of perceptions as long as they are not rubbed in the face. It may sounds contradictory and ridiculous but I do believe in the afterlife simply because I believe of the great justice. When I see every single day injustice around me, the only think the pops up in my mind is \"there has to be some retaliation for all this madness\". Devil for me is the common blindness of people who cannot see the truth and prefer to be deluded. I do not connect the negativism and bad things to Satan, rather to the incompetence and viciousness of the human soul. I find these matters interesting as well as you do, that's why I often read about the main three religions in order to know what they call for. So far, I disagree with all of them. Religion is simply a constraint which lets you breathless with chains. \"Allegory of the cave\" in Republic by Plato is the perfect example. Exactly the escape from religious thinking is the reason why we understand the world as it is. Thales, Aristotle, Galileo, Newton and many others.", 10405, "Kd4FZ0Txaa", 0],

It moved and was concentrated to her limbs. The dr told me she had a virus and was displaying an allergic reaction to the virus. He could not treat the virus itself, but he could control the rash. he gave me 'Benadryl' for kids - not sure if you all have that over the pond, but an anti-histamine - which controlled the rash and she was fine in 2 days. Calebs rash looks a lot like Sophie's did - almost identical, and the fact its coming and going makes me think its the same also. definately get a drs opinion though, and in the meantime, try an anti-histamine and see if it does anything. **** I'm lying, it was 'Piriton' for kids, but same thing, just caught a glimpse of it in the cupboard lol", 10403, "None", 5],

Or maybe it is something with the washer machine not rinsing the clothes properly. Try having him sleep somewhere else for a nap and see if he still awakens with it. This would at least give you more input to tell the doctor such as when he sleeps somewhere else it doesn't happen or it happens no matter where he sleeps. My son get rashes like that if I tough him after putting lotion on my hands. I didn't know why until I found out that he was allergic to aloe.

	114913 : ["Simple answer is yes.   As others have mentioned, that's part of the appeal for some people.   I'm afraid of heights, unless I've climbed to the point I'm at.  My first climbing experience I led the climb because I was taller than the guy teaching me and thought I could reach something he couldn't.  I was wrong.  So we hiked up to the \"top\" of our climb (actually top of the first pitch) and walked out to the anchor on a little ledge.  I was scared.  After climbing the pitch though, I was completely comfortable sitting there. Fear is an important part of climbing.  It keeps you alive.  It makes you double check that all your safety precautions have been properly addressed.  Sometimes it can cause problems, when you're half-way up a lead and get scared about the next few pieces (or lack thereof) of protection you have to place.  I've seen people bail off of climbs they could have easily finished, but it's always better to come back and do it again than to make a mistake that could be fatal. Fear is part of climbing.  All climbers feel some sense of fear at some point.  Dealing with it is what makes us better climbers, and in many ways better people.

I did give you a thumbs up vote  OIl 101; First and foremost the major difference in oil is viscosity the bigger the single digit oil the slower it will run this holds true at any temperature.  Then there are multi viscosity oils. In an effort to simplify the issue, they take really thin oil that is easy to pump and will flow in every nook and cranny that needs oil (when it is cold) and add some “gunk” that makes it stiff and sticky when it is hot. This is a very very good thing.  The major reason why just about every manufacturer changed to a standard 5w-*.* oil was to improve cold start up lubrication. The minor reason is because the oil is easy to pump there is less wear and tear on the pump and its drive system. And on the + not the thinner oil does not take as much gas to pump around and around.  Manufacturers choose an average operating oil that should match the engine under average conditions, so they usually use a *.*w- 20 to 30 oil. This is an all around good oil. Forced induction engines usually go with a 30 to 50-weight oil because they run hotter because of the extra load and heat generated by the supercharging system (turbo or belt). They need the thicker oil to stick to the parts because at the higher temp it is not as “runny”  If you would like to see the + affects rebuild an engine and try to break it in using a true synthetic or an oil such as GTX 20w-50. IT TAKES FOREVER FOR THE RINGS TO SET this demonstrates the superior lubricating properties.  On the Negative side.  Run a 20w-50 or straight 50 in a car and see how long it takes for the oil pressure to come up to normal………….. FOREVER. This happens because the cold oil is cavitating in the pump and it is not lubricating the engine at that time. This gets worse and worse, as the temp gets lower. Another problem is this. Take an older engine that has a trimming belt that should have been changed more than a few miles ago, (most say 60,000 miles) and start that car up at 0 F…… see how many times you can do that without breaking the belt and I will say that you have more guts than I do. In conclusion: If you are the person that lets a car heat up in the winter till the windows are nice and clean, then drive a 50+-mile commute, use thicker oil. And change it every 4,000 miles If you just love to turn that key and give it Hell for 3 miles on the way to work go a smidge thinner. And change it every 2,000 miles  In any event the in both cases the engines will run as far or longer than normal. 20w-50 is race oil that you can use on the street and is mostly hype. Synthetics are very good but mostly just cost the same in the long run as replacing the engine after about 200000 miles.  So do what you want.
