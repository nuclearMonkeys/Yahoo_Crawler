	57089 : ["The dark matter must be in the observable universe if it exists at all. Otherwise we wouldn't know about it. The \"ubobservable universe\" if it exists, is by definition unobservable.

	57108 : ["Because you do not know what is a UFO. Those three letters are an abbreviation of 'unidentified flying object'. That abbreviation is not a word and is not a synonym of alien spacecraft. Unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are objects that appear to the observer to be above them, vaguely in the sky (flying), but which at the time they are observed the observer could not identify the object (unidentified). They are objects from, linked with or seen from Earth. They may be natural phenomena such as an astronomical object, e.g., a planet or star, cloud formation, flock of birds flying at high altitude. Alternatively, they may be man made objects such as artificial satellites, aircraft, weather balloons, etc. Whilst unidentifiable at the time to that particular observer, they are all subject to rational explanation. What they are not is spacecraft carrying a species from another planet. There is not one iota of evidence that such has visited Earth. Plus when taking into account the manifold practical difficulties and the many dangers involved in travelling through space over huge distances, the probability of such visitations is very close to zero.", 7938, "kz04oBhsaa", 1],
