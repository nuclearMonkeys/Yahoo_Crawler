I definitely understand money being tight, but they are the only ones that can really diagnose your dog.

I highly doubt that is our case especially since she's so young, our dog turned 8 years old a week after we found out and she was completely healthy before, just letting you know worst case scenario.  Definitely call the vet though and ask their opinion on what you can do.  Explain your situation and I'm sure they'll give you some tips over the phone, at least if it's a good vet.

I knew immediately he had pulled a muscle based of the way he was holding his leg when he limped, and his lack of response when I applied pressure all over his leg, trying to pinpoint the area of pain. We applied ice packs regularly that night, to eliminate swelling. I also carefully massaged his whole leg throughout the night, in order to keep the muscles loosened and relaxed. The next 2 days, we applied heat packs to his leg, and I continued the massages. These pack applications were done for about 10-20 minute increments throughout the day. Within 3 days, he was healed. Try that and see how it goes (though now the ice wouldn't do anything as ice is supposed to be applied when the injury is first inflicted).

	140207 : ["Asking a WWE-centric forum full of WWE fans (and fanboys) who don't watch TNA which company produces better PPVs, then you bash TNA in your comments? Okay, I'll jump on the bandwagon to fit in. WWE rulz, TNA droolz.  I love watching everybody do the same match all the time, punching and kicking like they don't even need wrestling moves, they're so awesome.  This way I don't even need to try to remember what wrestling moves are called because the WWE doesn't even use them.  And I LOVE how the WWE spends ten minutes before every match reminding me why whoever is in the next match is having their match coz I NEVER watch RAW or Smackdown to know why they would be having a match in the first place.  Those ten-minute video packages before EVERY match are a lifesaver, I tell you what.  I LOVE how Michael Cole tries to steal the spotlight every minute of every show...god, I can't do this anymore... WWE PPVs are paint-by-the-numbers predictable and just as boring.  Just longer episodes of RAW or Smackdown and nowhere near worth the $50 or so they charge for them.  Ten-minute video \"package\" of stuff we've already seen before to pad out the show, punch and kick, do a finisher.  Ten-minute video \"package\" of stuff we've already seen before to pad out the show, punch and kick, do a finisher.  Ten-minute video \"package\" of stuff we've already seen before...rinse and repeat ad nauseum.  And all over the show and throughout the whole damn thing, just like on RAW and Smackdown, that babbling idiot Michael Cole's grandstanding is insulting and offensive and kills any mood the WWE is trying to set.  The matches are slow, repetitive, and filled with far too many rest periods for athletes supposedly in top shape.  At least on RAW and Smackdown the matches are generally short enough to not be irritating. TNA, on the other hand, gives us more value for our money (meaning more time in the ring and less on useless filler like those ten-minute video \"packages\" and entrances that take several minutes).  TNA gives us a wide variety of matches and wrestling styles (and yes, most of the wrestlers in TNA actually do wrestle, rather than just punch and kick).  TNA doesn't do anything paint-by-the-numbers; they're always trying new things (such as the ending to the Main Event you bash; Roode is the heel, the bad guy; his job is to irritate the fans so they boo him, not think he's \"cool\"; that's what he did at Genesis).  TNA gives us real \"hardcore\" matches, X Division matches (cruiserweight matches that actually mean something), and every championship gets defended just about every TNA PPV. The WWE has state-of-the-art production, TNA isn't quite at their level.  But for high-quality wrestling matches, and more of them, the WWE can't hold a candle to TNA.  Not to say that WWE PPVs \"suck\", just that TNA does PPV better.  I'll buy The Rumble just because I love that match, and probably Wrestlemania (though they're going to need a whole lot more than just Cena vs The Rock if they expect me to pay $65 for it).  Otherwise TNA gets my PPV money every month (and I do buy them; I don't steal them via \"streams\"; WWE PPVs, too) simply because TNA does PPV better and gives me more value for my money.", 11449, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 0],
	140208 : ["You have EVERY RIGHT to be hanging onto this still. Let me first say it sounds like you deserve someone way better than this chick.  Although she got defensive and denied it before, she did in fact have a great amount of feelings for this guy. Of course she wouldn't admit it, not only that but she tried to make YOU the bad guy by accusing you of suffocating her. You did nothing wrong, sweetheart. It's a lack of respect on her end. You don't text another guy and give him all the attention all the time when you're with someone. You just don't.  The fact that she kissed this man while you guys were on a \"break\" (which is no excuse at all to go around kissing other men,) is a HUGE red flag. Because she hid how she really feels about this guy before, you have all the reason in the world to believe she still has feelings for him, especially since she's always on her phone again. That's the reason why you can't look past this- your trust in her has been battered & bruised, and she's trying to play it off like it's no big deal. She wants the best of both worlds- a steady boyfriend who will always be there no matter what she does, as well as an exciting new love interest in a guy who worships the ground she walks on. This is wrong on so many levels. So, my dear, you have three options- Number one, you can try and forget about what happened. You can pretend like it wasn't a big deal, tell her you forgive her, and give her confirmation that she can and WILL walk all over you. That will eventually lead to her dumping you, either for this hot new fling of hers, or perhaps for a different man than this recent one. Number two, you can sit her down and talk. Not just about what's recently happened between her and this man, but about why your relationship seems to be spiraling downwards. Take a night off together, buy some flowers, pour some wine, be a complete romantic- I'm sure that'd get her full attention. Talk about what made you fall in love with one another to begin with. Laugh about good memories, and remember what made them good. Then figure out what the problem is between you two- it sounds like lack of communication. There's something wrong in the relationship, but neither of you want to admit it. Find the root of the problem, and then agree to work on your downfalls. Promise to put the other person first. Promise to have at least one night a week and spend some genuine time together. Treat her the way you did when you first started dating. Show her how much you really care about her. If you both want it enough, she will put down the phone and you guys will have a much better relationship. Number three, end it. As sad as it is to admit it, there's a great deal of poison within you two that is not easily forgotten. She went behind your back, betrayed your trust, and shared an intimate moment with another man. This shows that she doesn't respect you, and she doesn't care about you near as much as she should. Don't go on another \"break,\" that just gives her another get-out-of-jail free card to do what she wants. What if she one day admits that she's had sex with another man? Which would hurt worse, hearing her say that to you, or ending the relationship as red flags pop up everywhere? Sometimes it's better to beat the punch and bow out before you get completely obliterated. Who knows, maybe you'll find a nice gal who is completely head over heels for you, and would never disrespect or go behind your back the way she did? I know this is a difficult situation to be in, and I'm sorry she put you there. Keep in mind that you don't need a girl to make you happy- YOU can make you happy, and you need a girl who will stand beside you, ready to catch you if you fall.
