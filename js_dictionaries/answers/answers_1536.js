We are contributing CO2 to the atmosphere:   and  CO2 increases the average temperature of the biosphere:  The biosphere is, in consequence, warming:   , and will warm further:   (I may have been a bit wrong about the rate, I think that's warming of 2-5 degrees total, not *necessarily* 2-5 degrees over the next century) And, if we don't stop it, it   will   do   bad   things   . edit: The post this hypothesis was originally in got deleted for violating the question and answer format, somehow, so I'm glad I posted all this here, not there. and re: \"You omit to point out that the line is preceded by this caveat. “…place high or very high confidence in the following findings:” They don't say it IS so, they say it is very likely.\" Scientists talk like that.  Virtually nothing is *absolutely* certain.  Particularly when you're talking about something as chaotic and with as many factors and inputs as the average global climate.  It could be that a massive chain of volcanic eruptions or a well-placed asteroid strike will negate all the warming we have generated to date (volcanic eruptions tend to cool, not warm the biosphere; ejecta from an asteroid could do the same).  It could be that some unforeseen negative feedback will halt warming in its tracks.  It could be that some rogue planet will come through the solar system and pull us out of our orbit, or smack into us and kill us all.

You then wrap a monumental lie around that simple fact, and just point to it when anyone wants to argue. 2-5 degrees per century... I think we are falling behind.

We want to see the US out of the UN and the UN out of the US.   We want a return to the gold-backed dollar and an end to inflation.  We want an end to government interference in our daily lives.  We want our Civil (Constitutional) Rights, particularly the Second Amendment.  We understand the First Amendment as giving us the right to pray whenever or wherever we wish.  And we understand that we cannot be compelled to pray.  All restriction is on the state. We do not believe in destroying the Right from unreasonable search (for National Security, or any other reason).  We do not believe that any legitimate government can resort to torture. We don't think that a woman has the right to kill her unborn child any more than we think that a husband has the right to beat his wife.  Either we all have rights, or none of us do.

Just because a person is Christian and it is a part of them, shapes their ethics and morals, does not mean they are forcing their religion on you.

The subprime lending loans was a Clinton plocy, not a Bush policy. After it was policy banks were approving the loans, not the congress.  ( I do blame the republican congress for allowing the loan to exist, they were in controll of congress, and somehow that law got passed. However it is still a Clinton Plicy. If all of those jobs are up, how we lost over 4 million jobs since he took office. YOur obviously missing some data. Bush warned us that energy prices would go up 4 years before they did. And, the energy prices went up because of Katrina, it knocked two oil wells in the Gulf.  Oil has gone back up to about 2.75. That is not a low price for Gas, better than $4.00 but that is not a good price, it is more than double from just 3 or 4 years ago. Another fact you are missing is inflation went up 1.4% last month, in 1 month. If that trend keeps up, we will be back to 12% intrest rates in no time. Now Obama had nothing to do with the recession we are in. But he has not done anything to fix it. I dont blame him for causing it, but I dont see any reason to give him credit, he was more concerned about getting his liberal agendas passed. He was trying to take advantage of a 60 vote majority, and it didnt work, no one saw Scott Brown coming.
