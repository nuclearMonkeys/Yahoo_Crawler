Well, far and away, my favorite Western was \"Wild Wild West,\" so that goes at the top of the list.  James West was the epitome of cool. Second on the list is a short lived show from the early 70's, \"Alias Smith and Jones.\" And the rest of the list, in no particular order (some of these I watched in syndication...I'm not THAT old.) 3--Have Gun, Will Travel 4--Maverick 5--Bonanza 6--The Virginian 7--Death Valley Days 8--The Big Valley  I guess that's about it.  I was never a big fan of Gunsmoke, or Rawhide.

	21943 : ["Certainly they have commercials...but the BBC does not. I quote: In the UK, the BBC is funded by a licence fee and does not screen adverts. On the commercial channels, the amount of airtime allowed by the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom for advertising is an overall average of 7 minutes per hour, with limits of 12 minutes for any particular clock hour To say that in terms we Americans understand everyone in the UK who has a television has to pay for the BBC (really: for the privilege of being able to receive BBC broadcasts, whether or not they watch it). According to one web site the current cost is about £154 per year that is: about US$211 per year. Non-BBC channels such as ITV (been around since 1955) are \"free\" but include advertisements to pay the cost of running the network and so you can see commercials (and commercial break spots) in TV series produced by ITV. - Recommend: The Thunderbirds, from the 60s, but many others you are likely to know, such as various Agatha Christie series.", 3556, "g9g3fOYyaa", 1],

Example: Downtown Abbey was Not made by the BBC but ITV and would have had commercials when aired in the UK.", 3556, "2kpr2arRaa", 1],

Oh, what else?  Well, the last couple of seasons of Night Court was in the 90's so we'll include that.  Friends was really good.  And I guess the first couple years of \"That 70's Show ran in the late 90's,\" so we'll throw that one in, too.
