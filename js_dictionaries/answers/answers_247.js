	12355 : ["Basically, the answer is that you don't - at least, not as a professional. No-one is interested in someone with no training or experience and only a 'fascination' with acting.  Millions of teens and 20s have that! It takes, in normal times and on average, seven years of top-level training and stage and film experience for any aspiring actor to even get signed by an agent, which is how actors get auditions and, if they're very talented and very lucky, a job. In these times, hundreds of thousands of professional actors worldwide are unemployed and will be fighting for auditions as soon as things get back to normal. When it's allowed, join a community theatre which offers classes to adults.  Find out if you really love acting and have any talent.  If you do, acting as a hobby is rewarding, great fun and a wonderful way to make friends.", 2071, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 2],
	12356 : ["Local community theater.  With no experience, you are not going to get any professional work - especially in these times where little is being filmed and theaters closed, once things are back to normal, thousands of well trained and experienced actors will be vying for the few available roles.  Take acting as a hobby.", 2071, "3arJsZ91aa", 2],
	12357 : ["A monologue is just a tool to show a director that you have acting talent and the ability to memorize and repeat a  performance. I disagree acting is about making the situation real for everyone involved, your fellow actors and the audience. Any actor who makes every performance just about themselves is not a great actor.", 2072, "f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa", 3],
	12358 : ["I know this was published a month ago, but I wanted to answer lol I agree. Just because you can deliver a good monologue does not mean you're good at acting. Your monologue is just a snippet and most generally is something you're good at. It doesn't show how you act when a scene doesn't go your way. And when you choose your monologue and you're good at portraying one emotion, some people aren't good at anything but that one emotion. So if you have a character that's really sweet and friendly but has a bad blow out at the end of the movie, if their monologue is an angry one, it will not show your sweet side.", 2072, "YFxGVdleaa", 0],
	12359 : ["Yes, I agree.  An actor may well be able to rehearse a single monologue until it's pretty much perfect - but be very weak at all other aspects of acting.   Yes, delivering a great soliloquy takes excellent acting talent and skills, but the actor has to be able to perform the rest of the play equally well! This is why, at many auditions, an actor is asked to perform part of a script rather than a monologue, and take direction to perform it in several other ways.Many times, my daughter, who is a professional actor, has been asked to repeat a chunk of dialogue in different ways, with different emotions, different attitudes, etc.  For example, one director told her to act a scene flat on her back, facing into a corner,  sounding sarcastic, sounding regretful, sounding insane and sounding totally emotionless.  ", 2072, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 2],

Not everyone can handle acting.  There are people who are emotionally affected by roles that they play.  This is more common when they are doing theater or the like than filming a movie, because they have to stay in the role for extended periods of time.  That is why many children who do not continue on in acting.  They do not like it or can not handle it.
