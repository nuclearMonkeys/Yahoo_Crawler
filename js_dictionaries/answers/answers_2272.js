	119394 : ["I think Christ put it pretty clear in Jn 14:15 as you quoted. But, what I have come to understand in it's full meaning is to keep the Word of God in your heart and on your mind, by seeking first the kingdom [Matt 6:33]. If we center our lives upon Christ, and the Word which is Christ, then we obey and keep His commandments, which are to love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and to love our neighbor. By thinking first of Christ (What Would Jesus Do) [WWJD], then each thought and action is directed by the Spirit, and therefore living in obedience to the will of God. This is how the body of Christ shares it's light with the world. This is the love of Christ in us working through us. This is how we become His hands, His feet, His eyes. This is the power of the cross through His people.", 10580, "None", 1],
	119395 : ["Ok i know you're confused and probably kinda scared, but don't worry you will get used to it :) Periods usually last like 3-4 days. They should last 6, or let's say 7 days at the most but that's rare !!!! Everything longer is not normal, so in that case go see a doctor. They go away and come same time next month. But the first few years, your period probably won't be regular. If you get it for example 10 days earlier or later then last month, or if you don't get it for a few months, it's totally normal so don't worry, your body is just adjusting. After two years- in some cases longer, it should be regular. People say that you shouldn't wear a pad longer then 4 hours, so i guess you need to take 1 or 2 to school and change it.And before you get your period you will probably have stomach ache so always wear a pad to school in case you get your period, and you will be prepared. You know the pad is full when almost the whole pad is covered with blood. Oh and some girls don't have stomach ache during period and some do. So if your stomach hurts it's normal, you can have some pills or something for that. Just ask a doctor or your mom which one you should take, never take anything by yourself !!! Hope i helped :) Oh and...i know i'm changing the subject, but you got your period now...so i don't even know how old are you, sorry...but SAFE SEX !!!! :)", 10584, "None", 0],

	119430 : ["Hey hun, It's possible you have what is called Hyperhidrosis, which essentially is excessive sweating of the underarms, forehead, palms or feet. Over 8 million people around the world have it and many have found ways of dealing with it. As for how guys would react to it?  Personally, I think it's cute and I wouldn't mind it at all :) (and I'm sure there are plenty of other guys out there like me).  But if you want to minimize it this is what I'd suggest: 1. Coffee And Sugar Out of all the ways to stop excessive sweating this one is probably one of the biggest. Everyone in today's society drinks coffee and plenty of it. Thing is it is packed with caffeine and sugar, both of which increase your anxiety and thus your sweating. Cut back on the coffee drinking! 2. Alcohol Alcohol tends to dilate your blood vessels and in so doing, increases your overall body temperature. An increase in body temperature means an increase in sweating, so watch your alcohol intake. 3. Yoga Take up a relaxing past time like yoga.  It will help to keep you calm and reduce your overall anxiety levels. 4. Charcoal It's not only good for the barbecue, but if you try eating this on an empty stomach you can see results in as little as two days. 5. Wheat Grass This is very high in many forms of vitamin B which has been shown to aid those who sweat excessively. Try drinking a glass of this a day. 6. Water cold water can help you to reduce your body temperature and thus reduce your sweating. The whole purpose of sweating is to regulate our body's temperature, but if we help it out by drinking lots of cold water, we will be able to reduce our body's need to sweat. 7. Spicy Foods Cut out the spicy foods in your diet and you won't be stimulating your sympathetic nervous system as much. Ever notice how your body reacts when you eat something extremely spicy? Notice how you tend to heat up a bit? Your sympathetic nerves react to this stimulus by signaling your sweat glands to excrete more sweat. You can find more treatment methods at the link below...best thing is to try several of them at once, you'll see the best results that way. Good luck! -Renard", 10582, "None", 0],

I recommend wearing a tampon with a pad for extra protection, tampons are way easier and less messy. You should always carry tampons and pads with you, trust me it is better to be safe than sorry and you'll know when a pad is full b/c u can feel it ans see it! good luck", 10584, "bvu77Kqsaa", 0],
