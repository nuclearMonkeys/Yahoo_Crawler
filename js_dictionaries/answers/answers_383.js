It also explains the difference between AC & DC power(cord vs battery) . it may also explain the difference gearing has  For Ryobi is a geared SCREW GUN on 12volt battery The DeWalt is a 1/2\" I am guessing corded drill120volt with a half inch drill bit meant for some serious drilling.  It can screw but those screw are in in an instant. Ryobi max turning speed(RotationsPerMinute) is about 900 with a fresh battery.  DeWalt's RPM is probably closer to 6000 so it does not go slow at all.  It does go slower with the variable speed trigger but going slow means it heats up and it has a fan inside it that rotates with the motor to keep it cool so you do not say screw in 1000  1 1/4\" screws with this drill because you will overheat the motor. and burn it out.   You can't screw at high speed because you chance to come out of the screw itself ruining the screw. The 12 volt screw drill is too slow to drill into concrete because that is a hard material so it takes a long time.  So does drilling in steel.  Battery will be dead 6 times before you get through 1/4 in plate steel. They are both necessary.  Dewalt also makes a battery powered drill  16Volt so only a 16 volt charger charges it and only 16 Volt batteries from Dewalt fit Dewalt.

They can weigh about the same.  I have several of each type. The Dewalt corded is useful in the shop or garage. The Dewalt battery is useful for short jobs away from the house or on the roof, where there aren't any power receptacles handy.  You still need to charge the batteries, and they eventually stop holding much of a charge.
