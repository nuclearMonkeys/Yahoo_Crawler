Personally, I maintain quite a few and I don't say that out of arrogance. Almost 7 years ago, I began experimenting with astral projection and my chakras and had an incredible awakening that changed the direction of my life. Prior to that time, I'd never kept any kind of written record of my journey through life. Suddenly, I found all these doors opening - anything metaphysical caught and held my interest - and all these new insights and knowledge was being absorbed and found that I had write them down, just to make sense of what was going on, most of the time. As an example...one of the doors that presented itself was an interest in remote viewing. It honestly floored me when I realized that I could actually do it...not with great accuracy but enough for me to know. As a result, a new phase of learning  and a new journal was begun...and parts of that aren't for prying eyes...lol.", 10436, "None", 0],

It's called \"let's imitate each others accents.\" Which should be freaking hilarious, because I've heard Americans try to do Australian accents, and I'm in stitches after it.

	115720 : ["There's no beak color identification with Cockatiels. There are numerous ways to identify a sex of the bird. But your birds are very young and probably didn't have their first molt (feathers and coloration slightly changes), so it would't be much helpful. Your first one sounds like a normal grey. The males and females look the same as babies. After the first molt the males start having the 'freckles' and after few months their whole head turns yellow with bright orange cheeks. The same with pearls and pieds. Your second bird sounds like a whiteface lutino (known as albino). Does it have red (maroon) eyes? There's no visual way to identify the sex of the whitefaces except of a DNA test.  The males whistle a lot. Log onto www.avianbiotech.com and ask for a free kit. I would go for the blood cart. Take it to your vet or a pet store. They will clip the bird's nail and put few drops onto the card. You will mail it with a check on $19.99 and they will send you an email in 48 hours with the result. Also in few weeks you will receive the Certificate for the tested bird. Also, please, try to spend some time with them each and every day. That's the only way to tame them. If you'll keep avoiding them, they won't trust you and they'll stay that way. For beginning try to aproach the cage and open the door each day. Do not put your hand inside yet. Just sit around and talk with a soft voice. You'll see how they'll try to come to you after some time. There's this great web site for Tiel's owners - www.cockatielcottage.net. Try to read all the info and you will be suprised what great friends the cockatiels can become. ", 10439, "8IM8gXjwaa", 0],
	115721 : ["Some correct answers here and some not. There are three sure ways to determine the sex of a lovebird. First and most common would be the DNA test. You can purchase the kits needed by going online and ordering (usually about $20-$30). If you do it yourself, you will need to cut the toenail or pull a blood feather, both of which are dangerous if you are not experienced; or you can have an avian veterinarian perform the test for a bit more money. A second way is to do the pelvic bone test mentioned by someone else here BUT, unless you have done this on many birds it may be difficult for you to really be able to feel the difference between the two AND, if you have two of the same sex, you won't feel a difference and be really confused. Generally, only experienced breeders can tell for sure. I'm an experienced lovebird breeder and have NEVER been willing to say for 100% certain which sex was which to any of the people purchasing my lovebrats, because I find it difficult myself! The third and more expensive way is by having an avian vet perform a surgical sexing which involves putting the bird under anesthesia (which is dangerous in itself unless seriously necessary), making a tiny incision near the bird's abdomen, putting a small scope inside and being able to see whether the bird has testies or ovaries. This can cost anywhere from $85-$125. If you are simply a pet owner and not a breeder, I feel this is rather inappropriate and cost prohibitive. As others have stated, I would keep the two in separate cages but allow them outside playtime together, in order to keep them tame and having a desire to bond with you rather than each other. And, in the event they are male and female, they will not be inclined to breed if they are in separate cages either.", 10439, "8HyjSwH8aa", 0],
