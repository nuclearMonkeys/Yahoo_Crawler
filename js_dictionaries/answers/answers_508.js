Keep in mind there is no way whatsoever that an MMA fight would resemble 100% of what a street fight would look like because in a street fight it is the prerogative of the person that's winning to accept a knockout as the end of the fight or to accept the tap out at the end of the fight. In a street fight there's a reason why the police will stop you because these are unsanctionables that can lead to someone being killed maimed or permanently disfigured", 4409, "5b2FcXnIaa", 0],

	28425 : ["No. They are saying you care more for your mom than you do for your dad.  I am a momma's boy. momma's boy Type 1) A male who is overly dependent on their mom into adult hood. This can lead to things such as a grown man letting his mom make decisions for him despite the fact he's old enough to make decisions for himself. He also lets his mom order him around with no disapproval. This can have a bad effect on relationships and can be the driving force to breaking up as his girlfriend can grow tired of him letting his mother control his life. This type of momma's boy tends to be looked down upon by society. Type 2) A man who simply loves his mother and isn't afraid to show it. How this differs from Type 1 is that the son is perfectly capable and willing to take care of himself while still holding a close bond with his mother without all the negative effects of Type 1. This type of momma's boy is sometimes misunderstood because he's willing to repay his mom for all she's done for him. This type also isn't afraid to proudly proclaim themselves a momma's boy, after all, she carried him in her stomach for nine months, gave birth to him, fed him when he was a baby, took care of him when he was sick, raised him into a respectable adult, and is pretty much the main reason he came into existence in the first place. Maybe he would get a tattoo that reads \"Mom\" on his arm to pay tribute, or maybe he's willing to defend his mom from any miserable ********** that would dare threaten her good health. If he is tough, insulting his mom can be a death note, because even bad men love their moms. Type 1) Girl: \"I'm thinking of breaking up with my boyfriend; he's such a momma's boy that he let's his mother control his life and he does nothing about it.\" Type 2) Mr. T: \"\"I'm a mama's boy.

And I am assuming he would know having first hand knowledge. Legendary knockout artist Igor Vovchanchyn says the same thing, you achieve your results much quicker without gloves.
