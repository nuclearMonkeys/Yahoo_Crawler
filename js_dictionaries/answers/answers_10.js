It should go down to the bike shop and let the real mechanics work on it when you don't know what the \"eff\" you are doing. 1300km is squat for the bike.  Sorry, but sometimes it is harder than you think.  You seem not knowledgeable about this thing.", 84, "None", -1],

Quite a few people rely on public transport and live in Philadelphia.  The worst place to live (in my opinion) would be out in the country 100+ miles from town without a car or personal vehicle. Now don't get me wrong, I would love to be able to live out in the country if I could work entirely remote... but I sure would not want to do that without any form of personal transportation. ", 100, "DNK79Hydaa", 2],

The cab fare from my house to my nearest town is $90 one way. We don't have Uber or Lyft around here, and if we did it wouldn't be cheap either.

By the time you get them hitched up and on the road, you might be able to walk to the store and back. Then there is the time needed to un-hitch the teams, brush them down, make sure they have food and water. Don't forget the pooper scooper and to muck out the stalls.

I always think I'd like to read more/faster, not to prove a point or hit a high mark but just simply because there is so much stuff I'd love to read out there that I won't be able to read in my lifetime (unless I somehow stumble across the Elixir of Life). But this is entirely about me. I don't expect anybody else to care about my reading, just as I don't care about yours. That said, Stephen King is one of my favorite authors so I think you're in for a good ride. And it goes without saying that if you challenge yourself to read two books, reading a 1,000 page tome by King plus another one is more of an achievement than reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Green Eggs and Ham. I can't believe that I'm even typing this; I guess you are allowed to call me Captain Obvious for the rest of the month.
