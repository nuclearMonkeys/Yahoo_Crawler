If you find out that she has used your horse again for another rider, demand payment. 2) I have seen other instructors do this: bully a person into thinking they aren't good for their horse, only to have a \"new\" horse lined up to sell you and make money off of you. I bet she even has a buyer for your pony in the back of her mind with a sweet commission she will happily charge to \"help you out\". 3) You deserve to be happy with your pony, no matter how tall, short, heavy, skinny you are, you can still love your pony and move someplace where both of you will be happy. 4) If you really can't leave the barn, attempt to go out to see your horse, but have as little contact with this owner as possible. I would even stop volunteering your time there (unless the barn work you do is part of the arrangement). Try to find another instructor that can maybe come teach you there. If it is getting abusive, you need to report the situation. BTW, I am 5'7\" and ride a 13.2hh horse all the time. He has no problems and is my favorite :)", 10327, "8AyLoyS2aa", 2],
	112786 : ["My sister has a problem being able to ride at her yard even though she owns a pony because of the riding instructor being so awkward. This woman sounds horrible, does she own the yard like? If she doesn't you should have a word with the owners. Another idea is to take a mate up with you (or just chat with one of the fellow livery people) as well as one of your parents (just say as like a one off) the two advantages here are that the instructor will shut up and stop calling you and you have two witnesses if she does call you something.

	112787 : ["Is the instructor the owner as well.  I hope not.  Your instructor sounds like a bully. If you can't talk to the barn owner by saying what you said here and adding \"it makes me not want to be here but other than the bullying I love it here.\"-the time to rise above the adult! (The instructor). Kill her with kindness or if you don't want to have any contact ignore her and walk away.  That way she doesn't get to see any reaction and you have taken her fun away.  I work with behavioural youth.  For two of them that is what we do for them.  By getting up and walking away when they start they no longer have an audience for that behaviour. You are paying for a service here.  One which does not include the instructor using your horse at her will.  That does need to be brought up to the manager/owner. Start keeping track of the work you do around there, especially any above and beyond what is expected of you.  Keep track of what she is saying to you as well as who is on your horse without your permission and lastly when the instructor has your horse out with out your permission. By doing this you will have solid evidence to present to the owner/manager and your parents.  As your parents will probably have to get involved sooner than later if ignoring her doesn't work.  She may be nuts enough to up the ante. I feel for you and really wish you had a adult who could stand in your court and put this person in her place. Selling your pony is not an option!!  That is your pony!  This bullying has to stop.  Given me the address of the owner and I will write a nice, professional letter about the issue she has working at her barn.  I detest bullies with a passion. Sorry you can't seem to find the support you need.  Try looking for another barn.  Staying there if you are not going to go is not helping you any.  Selling your pony though would be a last resort.  I understand that sometimes moving is not an option when you are underage.  Is there someone else at the barn you can befriend?  Step back and start writing down ideas of how you can solve this with out selling your pony.  It may take a while but something may come up. Still write everything down.  I can't believe your parents put up with this.  Take that paper and show them.  Tell them it is hurting you and hurting you worse when it is done in front of them and they let it go.  I obviously don't know your parents but hopefully when they see it in writing and that you are hurt to the point of selling your pony-maybe they will help out.", 10327, "ejhMavhhaa", 0],

The first person on each time takes a pair of chopsticks and on go runs to their rice bowl and tries to find the first item on the list throught the rice.

	112798 : ["The deciduous crape myrtle is among the longest blooming trees in existence with flowering periods lasting from 60-120 days. Crapes come in heights as short as 18 in (46 cm) and as tall as 40 ft (12 m). Leaves are alternate and smooth, but leaf size depends on variety. Flowers are borne in summer in big showy clusters and come in white and many shades of pink, purple, lavender and red. The fruits that follow are brown or black. When mature they dry and split releasing disk shaped seeds. Depending on variety, crapes grow as large shrubs or as trees that may be either upright or spreading. Large varieties are very fast growing and can put on several feet in a single growing season. Many types have interesting bark that exfoliates in thin flakes exposing lovely cinnamon or gray inner bark. Crapes tend to produce many suckers that should be removed as they appear if you want to maintain them as trees with distinct trunks. They are enthusiastic reseeders so you may find yourself pulling up baby crapes throughout the summer..", 10325, "jCDcPWNuaa", 0],

	112800 : ["The experience of New York is something that will reflect on your resume.  Working a year in New York is equivalent to putting 5 years of job experience else where on your file.  Besides the positives to your career, there are the benefits to you personally. Sure, you will enjoy the night life, the shopping, the restaurants, but you will also find out who you truely are.  New York is a place where people discover themselves, grow up, and find out what they can and cannot do.  New York forces you to do thing you may never of imagined and if you can survive NYC, you can survive any where.  I've been in NYC for 6 years now, and I love it.  The work is crazy, my hours are ridiculous, but I have had such a great time in NYC.  I've met great people, made amazing career connections, and gained so much living here. They say, we are to live in the real world.  Well you have to experience the Real World, and New York is about a real as it gets.  Hudson Street is a great area, but you don't have to live there.  You will always have access to subway to get to work.  At first it may overwhelm you, but you'll use the subway religiously while you are here.  The West Village is close to Hudson Street, and so is the East Village.  Those are great areas to live in, and so is anywhere along the west side of the city.  Just avoid midtown around the theatres because of all the tourist traffic.  I'm sure you'll have a great time here.  How can you not? All my friends here love it, and my family visits NYC yearly because they enjoy everything about it.   If your work pays well and allows you financial security, then come to New York.

That being said NYC can be overwhelming at times, and this is from someone who's lived here all his life. It's tough to meet people, the sights and sensations can at times seem like more of an assault than an experience and it seems like the \"NY minute\" gets shorter every year. Like any place you need common sense. If you hold you wallet in the air and shout \"somebody take this please,\" somebody will. Still I don't know of too many places where they wouldn't. A little caution and a little foresight will go a long way in preventing any problems, but again, that's true for just about anywhere. On the whole though, there is nothing quite like living in the Big Apple. Anything you can imagine, anything you are interested in is practically at your fingertips.

Next i would have your parents get in contact with a equine attornery that can write up a contract that pretty much states that  while she does not have permision to use your horse that in the case she does handles your horse or puts any one on the horse and the horse or rider injures themselves she is liable to pay all expenences concerning vet or hospital bills, and that you have the right to sue her for extra costs due to your horse being out of commision due to her negligence. I would then present her with this, but have a parent do it. I wouldnt expect her to sign it but i think it should atleast keep her from doing things to your horse and putting other riders on him.

But I think it all started because my mother used to tell my siblings and me stories at bedtime, and they were really great when she fell asleep in the middle of one and continued with the story, anything could happen.  She and my father also saved old family pictures and told stories which had been passed down in the family about their ancestors.  We heard about greats who swam to safety after a riverboat fire and one 14 year old who nearly died at Bull Run and had to have his leg amputated.  Dad repeated the words that were spoken over 100 years before by the corpsmen who saved his grandfather and told me about a rebel soldier who gave him his canteen.  I was hooked.  My history classes couldn't compete with this and memorizing dates and jingles to remember dates became a tedious exercise in futility.  History books seem designed to make kids hate history when it is actually quite interesting.  But I degress. Not many people were researching when I started, but one line of my family had been traced way, way back in England.  I found a mistake in that line and feel a little guilty because I have left a brick wall in my wake.  Anyway, I went through the old pictures with my parents and wrote names for the ones they knew, looked through old bibles and letters and found some cousins who were delighted to hear from me.  This was back in the days when Dinosaurs roamed the Earth, so there were no computers.  The dinosaurs would have smashed them, no wait, I got carried away.  Actually in the absence of computers the research was all done by snail mail or on site.  I helped my mother decorate graves on Memorial Day, so I knew where my grandparents and some greats were buried.  I searched through newspapers, wrote to various states requesting records, and sent for records from the National Archives.  I had no idea what I was doing and learned as I went.  I found relatives who were also researching and collaborated with them.  Since I can't travel everywhere I want to, the computer has turned out to be an enormous help.  I really like the free sites where we can post what we have found, which saves reinventing the wheel by each researcher.  The whole thing turned out not to be a thing where you work on it for awhile and then know all your ancestors back to mitochondrial Eve, but a mystery you'll never solve completely, and it can turn out to be a lifetime hobby.  The husband of another family researcher I met would always say to my daughter, Oh no, they are going to start talking about dead people.
