	101360 : ["I am a taxpayer, and an Obama supporter. My wife and I both have jobs (that supply good healthcare plans), make a decent living and receive no help from any government agency.  I will gladly pay more taxes to help others who need the assistance be it for healthcare, college plans, or for forms of welfare because it makes for a better society. A more functional society. I'd much rather have my tax dollars go to public assistance than to go into the pockets of Haliburton, KBR or Blackwater. I'd rather have my tax dollars go to education than to an illegal war in Iraq that despite the tax dollars is bankrupting us rapidly. How about actually supporting the troops who have fought in that illegal war, put their lives on the line for us when they return (which given their stance on the new GI bill Bush and McCain seem to not care as much as their propaganda would have you believe). They just want to keep handing out sweetheart contracts to their buddies while starving public programs that need money and pissing all over the constitution. Plus, my main point would be that not everyone who gets stuck in a bad place that needs some assistance is a product of a bad decision. What about the now single mother who left her job to raise the kids and is abandoned and stuck? The hard working person who is left permanently disabled due to an injury or sickness? People who CAN'T get health inurance, despite an ability to pay for it, because of a pre-existing condition? Why are there so many homeless disabled veterans? What happens if you work hard everyday for a job, only to be laid off in an industry that doesn't afford you much opportunity to just go out and get a new job by the end of the month? What if you're working for it but it takes you a couple months? What should happen to that family in transition? Should they end up on the street?Those are just some things off the top of my head. You can do everything right and still end up in a bad spot. You would just have all of them fall through the cracks? ***************** I'm not trying to spit any venom. I know that we just have different ideas about how these sorts of problems need to be solved, but that is what I think about when that question is asked. For the record, I also do not appreciate being called a leech (especially since it is by no means accurate).
