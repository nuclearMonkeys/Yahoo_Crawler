	135178 : ["Yes, China is now an economic hub. I think it's because most people just regurgitate what the media and the government have told them. In actuality, communism has never existed. It is an idea, a concept. It is so pure that mankind has never been able to create a true \"communist\" state. China has tried to create one, but it obviously didn't work out. So they adapted. Now I would classify China as a capitalistic autocratic republic. Most people just like to focus on Tibet, censorship, and the massacre at Tiananmen. They were/are bad yes. The government should (have) definitely tried other methods. Yes China is not a democracy at all. But the majority of the 1.6+ billion people tolerate it because right now, China's doing well. There's a hope that in the future, the country's infrastructure will be fully completed and advanced, that the corruption going on will be controlled and eradicated, that the economy becomes stable and sustainable (yes, it's growing, but is it stable? not really), and the population will be under control. Think about it this way: If China weren't doing a good job, would so many Chinese people have as much pride as they do now? (And don't talk about censorship, you can't possibly censor something as big as Tiananmen or Tibet) Also, most Americans don't put their own history in perspective.", 11267, "3cfdbfd29eb7588f6064a307a03673b7aa", 5],
	135179 : ["I'm a little confused with your line of thinking. I assume your are using the term \"bad things\" in reference to armed aggression. Sure, both the USA and China have done things that serve the own best interest. Both countries have done things that the rest of the world see as wrong. As someone else pointed out, what matters is what happens from this day forward. I really don't think most Americans care as to what form of government the Chinese people choose to have. What matters to us is that people are treated well and served well by their government. Americans have a big problem with many Muslim countries because they treat women as second class citizens and give them fewer rights than men. Americans had a problem with communist China because it served mostly an elite, communist party members. It is good that the average Chinese citizen has more opportunity under the present regime. The problem is, however, you only have that oportunity because it serves the purpose of the present regime. What happens if a few years from now there's a regime change and those opportunites are removed? There isn't anything you can do about that because you exist at the will of your government. In the USA, it is the opposite situation. The government in the USA exist at the will of the people. All the systems here exist at the will of the people. All system are subject to change only at the will of the people. I have my serious doubts about the long term success of capitalism in a society in which the power of the government does not rest in the hands of ordinary people. The USA is not a democracy. It's a democratic republic. It's likely that China may one day move towards a democratic republic as well.", 11267, "38216f724bae29026c8cbdd051373157aa", 2],

	135181 : ["Ok, well, this one's gonna be tough, because you're obviously a smart individual and you have a really tricky problem. Without actually interacting with you (70% of communication is non-verbal), I cannot say what it is about your behaviour that puts people off. However, I can recommend some strategies to help you integrate a little better. Start by creating a public persona. Keep it simple: pick a couple personality traits that you would like to be known for, and use these as the basis for your persona. This is easiest if you pick certain facets of YOUR personality and expand them to make it define you. Essentially what you'll be doing boiling your personality down to something more easily understandable, not creating a whole new one. The farther this persona is from your actual personality, the more difficult it will be to make it convincing, so go with what you know. To actually project these traits, find people who already do so and also receive the kind of feedback that you want, and emulate their behaviour. Understand that it will take a little time to be convincing, and also that you will need to modify your behaviour to fit different scenarios. Nonetheless, keep your fundamental traits and desired behaviours/responses in mind, and stick to them; with a little practice, you'll get it. Next, remember that above all, people like predictability. They like to know roughly how someone is going to react to a given stimulus, and a complex personality can be unnerving because all of its traits cannot be quickly identified. Provide this predictability by sticking to your persona faithfully, and in time you'll slip into it unconsciously. Also, remember that confidence is appealing, so believe at all times that you ARE an interesting person who is worth getting to know. In your case, I think this is actually true, because you are obviously both intelligent and extremely perceptive, so talking to you would likely be quite interesting and stimulating. Finally, remember that this facade is merely there to serve a useful purpose, and that everyone has one, more or less. Just because yours will be more carefully designed than most is in no way a bad or negative thing; it is just a means to an end, the end being a better social life and closer friends. You are in no way inferior simply because you are naturally more introverted and less socially skilled than your peers; these are just quirks of your personality, and what you lack in social skills, you make up for in intelligence anyway. Good luck! PS: If this problem persists, I would recommend seeing a therapist. The kind of loneliness I think you're describing really isn't healthy, and therapy would help address the root causes. Everyone - and I really do mean everyone - could benefit from some counseling, so you really shouldn't feel stigmatized if you do seek support.", 11268, "None", 0],

	135183 : ["\"European American\" isn't really very descriptive and wouldn't work particularly well .  Especially if, as you suggest, it should be applied to caucasians.  This would be an inaccurate useage considering that it's perfectly reasonable to have a caucasian African-American.  For example, Dave Mathews was born in South Africa and moved to the states.  Ergo, he can be considered African American, though his skin is of a paler hue than one would normally associate with the term. Also, alot of the examples you use don't refer to continents.  They refer to specific nations, states, or islands.  There are plenty of individuals with european backgrounds that consider themselves Irish American, Italian American, Anglo American, etc.   But I guess you aren't referring to what people identify as, so much as what we should call one another, isn't it? Why can't we just say someone is black, white, asian, latino, etc?  I feel like these hyphenations are used in an attempt to  dance around feeling racist.  Many say \"African American\" because they are uncomfortable calling someone black. The irony being, as you point out, that it reinforces/creates a notion that Americans are, by default, white.  And that makes it unintentionally more racist than simply using another term. So why not just be sensible and use the least connotative term possible when we need to and let Americans be Americans without qualification?", 11270, "gzpM24CCaa", 1],

	135187 : ["Registries are something that grew out of the idea that a husband and wife had to set up house when they get married.  It goes even further back to the days when women used to make all the things they would need for their homes, like doilies and quilts and so on.  Fortunately we have places like Bed Bath and Beyond instead of having to do all that sewing by hand! Anyway, you don't have to have a registry for stuff for your house.  If anything, you may want to take inventory of what you already have and see if there's anything you might like to replace - are your towels getting sorta shabby and your bedding faded?  How's the condition of your bakeware and your pots and pans?  Store registries don't have to be restricted to kitchen and housewares, lots of people are putting other items on there.  Does your fiance really really really wish to have a 42 inch plasma TV or a radial arm saw?  You could also see about registering at someplace less mainstream for some really cool art pieces or accent items (Pier 1 has a ton of really cool stand alone pieces that could jazz up your house).  Consider getting even a small gift registry, because there may be people out there who really would rather give a gift than something else. Wishing wells are intended for cards, so even if you have other types of registries you're still likely going to get cards from your guests and you'll need someplace to collect them.  You may get cash or gift cards, depends on the guest.  And it doesn't have to be a wishing well per say.  I've seen baskets, boxes decorated with a slot cut in the top, and my mother is planning to use a decorative birdcage for the cards at my wedding, if she can find one she likes. I really like the idea of a honeymoon registry.  A friend of mine who just got married did this and my fiance and I are going to inquire about it when we start getting more specific information about our honeymoon.

	135196 : ["There is a basic fundamental difference between the USA and China that both cultures have trouble dealing with toward one another. In the USA, change in government and in business comes from the bottom up. In China, change in government and business comes from the top down. Both systems are completely correct for the population of each country. And, both systems in each country are evolving in the same direction, toward the same point from opposite ends. In the USA, people are realizing that there must be some limited regulations and controls on the free market in order to prevent wealth from becoming too concentrated. This notion is coming from the people, and the government acts to place regulations when the people allow it to do so. Change occurs quickly in a system like this, which is why the USA always appears to have a changing face. The Chinese government has realized that they must allow some free market activity and individual ownership in order to build national wealth. Under a purely socialistic system, poverty just becomes equally distributed. People and systems are only allowed to change when the government allows it. Change in China comes more slowly. In a country with a population the size of China's, this system of top down government may very well be the best system. Your assumption that China could have the biggest economy in the world within three decades may not be correct. China has to invest tens if not hundreds of tillions of dollars into its infrastructure. You have a lot of building to do. You will be reinvesting the gain in your economy for decades. It's estimated here in the USA that China has the potential to match the size of the USA's economy in 80 years, at China's current growth and with maximum reinvestment. The stumbling block will be energy. China has a population of almost 4 times that of the USA. The US economy is almost 6 times greater than that of China. China has great potential. And, if it is successful in building an economy equal to the per capita economy of the USA, I am convinced that poverty will disappear on the entire planet. I look forward to the day that the USA and China work together to cure all the ills of mankind. But, China has a very long road and a lot of hard work ahead of it before that day comes.

Some might argue that Chinas swift and unrelenting policy for implementing the death penalty for capital offenses is harsh and inhumane, others might argue that it is more efficient than the USA system, less of a tax burden on its citizens and provides a greater deterrant.   Some might also say that unlike the United States unequal application of Justice which is race biased, Chinas system in some respects is better. I would argue that China has a number of questionable policies which from a Utalitarian perspective work quite well and most certainly would not work in the USA.   But as someone who has lived in China,   Family values are very important, the government is non-invasive and unlike the US television, Chinas television ccentuates on the positive accomplishments of the society rather than hanging on the negative..", 11267, "9d8db7cf9f6c11246583829f3005173aaa", 1],

Perhaps this has come about so that the race-baiters (Charlie Rangel etc) can have a 'group' they can name and appeal to?  I do not think the distinction of being African-American would be so freely used if the African-Americans did not want to be recognized with that term. Most Americans regardless of their ethnic background want to be known as Americans.  WE ARE all Americans.  Choose what you want to be 'called' and correct people if they don't call you that.", 11270, "qaiYanF2aa", 1],
	135220 : ["For the exact same reasons Haitian Americans do not call themselves American Carribeans, there are differences within racial ethnic groups. I am an Irish American, not a Swede, Dutch, German, Italian, Greek, French, Norweigen, or a 'white' person.  I am not white.  My Irish heritage here in Boston includes: No Irish Need Apply; Slums; and vile discrimination - the Irish Americans are the only American minority to have a political party formed against them (The Know Nothing Party). Today, the Irish American is still racially discriminated against by being color coded as 'white'.  Yet Jamaicans and Haitians are not labled 'black'.  Why is that?", 11270, "None", -1],
	135221 : ["It's fine to have a box for wedding cards - make sure someone is watching it at all times, though. However, no honeymoon registry. If you two can't afford your own honeymoon, you shouldn't be expecting your guests to pay for it. You should be hosting your guests to a wonderful day to celebrate with you, not being so focused on gifts. Leave it to people to decide what, if anything, they will give to you.", 11269, "5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa", 2],
	135222 : ["you do no longer ought to register for funds, i think of the belief will insult some people. in case you bypass with the aid of a honeymoon registry provider they are going to pocket 5-10% off your visitor's funds, it somewhat is a entire scam. merely use notice of mouth to enable people understand which you have an activity in funds presents. then you certainly can apply it to your honeymoon.", 11269, "tNEl7Fgjaa", 0],
