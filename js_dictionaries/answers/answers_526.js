Is it physical labor? Could explain why he's tired all the time. Maybe he's depressed. Sounds like the life you two lead is stressful as hell.

And do not break up in the first place.  What he doesn't want to lose is an easy connection for sex when he cannot find another woman to sleep with. Of course you miss him.  The human brain resists change and \"missing someone\" is the equivalent of withdrawal symptoms for a drug addict. Merely the brain trying to make you go back to your addiction by making you hurt. The more you think about him, the more you strengthen your habit OF thinking about him. And the more you refuse to go with the thoughts of him when they enter your mind - instead turning your mind away to something else instead - the more you gradually create a NEW habit that within 4 to 8 month should replace your current habit OF thinking about him. If you are not completely over him within 8 months talk to a therapist to figure out how to do this. if you endjoy being dumped, get back with him.  History repeats itself, and it is no truer than in relationships. Btw, feelings are not love. They are merely a form of attachment to \"me\", and love doesn't work when the focus is on \"me\".  Chemistry is only 11% of what makes a relationship work. Love is always a duet, not a solo.  And it doesn't start until we have been living together for at least 3 years, and it takes about 20 years together to make it work and realistically be able to think it will last. You cannot know it if would work out between you two .. not yet.  But you DO know that both of you are more focused on yourselves than on the sacrifices required to make a relationship work with anyone ... let alone with each other.", 4549, "sMtpQ4f2aa", 1],

You must come from a culture where parents choose and arrange a marriage. Do you?  No doubt, its always a good idea to have one's affairs in order, such as insurance and wills, regardless. So, good for them. They are forcing you to choose, which is unfortunate. Perhaps you might arrange for your girlfriend to meet them, although , if I were her, I surely wouldn't want to do so.

	29324 : ["#MeToo and American feminism. The ‘60s, hippies and “free love” are over. Unfortunately. Those were the good all days. Also if you don't live in a big cosmopolitan city like New York it's harder. In an environment like that there are generally more women who are willing to have casual sex with no strings attached and won't go blabbing about it to all their friends and waiting for a wedding ring, and  you don't necessarily have to play as many relationship games if you just want the “casual sex” you refer to. Also you don't have to be particularly “macho”....you can even go around carrying a gay-looking shoulder bag and be “metrosexual” and you will still be able to get laid by a lot of very attractive and classy New York women. Or at least that's the way it used to be. Again, things may have changed since I was there. But when I lived there you didn't have to have a lot of money even, New York women would usually be more than happy to pick up the tab if they liked you and you were decently sensual and okay in bed. a it was a totally different scene than rural redneck America. Yeah, New York women were not into the musclebound jock thing anyway. That didn't turn most of them on.They would go for brains and depth. Although I haven't lived in New York for a while and I don't know if it's the way it used to be..there definitely WAS a good reason that the series called “Sex and the City” was shot in New York City as opposed to Oshkosh, let's say.

If you want him to do more around the house, you need to understand this will give you even LESS quality time together, because he will be spending some time doing those things and even more time even more tired and unwilling to do other things with you. Please note that I am NOT saying he shouldn't do more around the house, I have no idea what the actual distribution of chores in your household is. I'm simply pointing out that you say you want quality time but that you're pissed off because you do “everything” at home. Now, about your mom. Not sure why you are caring for her, especially if she has dementia, but that is not going to be sustainable once the baby comes. Look into senior services in your area to see what resources might be available to you. This may mean you have to make the difficult decision to put her into a care facility, but that may be the best choice. And after all, she is your mom, not his, so he has no obligation to help with her or provide for her care. Your quality time for anything is going to drop hugely once the baby is born. You have a few months to get things resolved before that happens, and you need to, because if you feel this overwhelmed now, it will magnify by 1000 once the baby comes.", 4542, "KESlvKqQaa", 1],
