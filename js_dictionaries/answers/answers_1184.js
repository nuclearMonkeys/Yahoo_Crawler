However, with the entire Obama campaign being focused on change, those supporters easily swayed by what he said are starting to (or should be starting to) figure out that he just gave them lip service.  I know it is only 2 weeks into his term, but he has already gone back on his promises regarding no pork in legislative bills, no lobbyists at all in his cabinet, and a strict vetting process that would ensure the highest moral character regarding his selections. I never trust a politician's words.  In order to see where a politician stands, look at his or her record.  Lip service can get you so far, but examining the voting record and choice of venues for speeches and special events are far more telling that a well-written speech.  Politicians have a nasty habit of saying one thing and doing something else, and clearly Obama has already shown himself to follow that same pattern of DC behavior. Also take into account the current state of Congress.  If McCain had won, I doubt he would be able to move much through with a heavily democrat majority in both houses. Naivety was a huge factor in Obama's victory in November.  That was a key factor in his winning the presidency.", 8272, "6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa", 0],

	64715 : ["There are really two different areas you can work on to improve your \"speed\" on the ice. One is simply the ability to skate fast up and down the ice, and the other is quickness which is more about having quick mobility, quick, explosive starts, quick turns etc. For pure speed, strength training and good skating mechanics are the two most important keys. Leg workouts (squats, lunges, presses, etc) and even running or biking will help develop the strength needed for a powerful stride. A strong, efficient stride is even more important than pure leg strength alone though. Having the correct push and extension is super important. There's a really good book by Laura Stamm called Power skating that really helps develop a strong skating stride, as well as a bunch of other areas. For quickness, working on agility and explosive drills really helps. Practicing starts and stops and quick turns on the ice will help develop quickness, as will lateral movements like side starts and running crossovers which you can also practice on dry land. Plyometrics are also good for developing quickness and agility. I like to also do some stability ball exercises to help with balance, which I think has helped out quite a bit. There really are a lot of different ways you can improve your speed. The Power Skating book is really helpful, and there is also a bunch of different exercises on the Nike Bauer website that are good for training.", 8273, "None", 0],

There are beliefs that vary from saying that people have invented the theory of god and the ability to make rational ethical decisions is a potential we all have, to (Buddhism for example) which thinks that if there is a god or if he/she exists they are irrelevant as this does nothing to alleviate the suffering of those living now. (See the parable of the poison arrow). I've even heard some point out that the power to create doesn't necessarily correlate with ultimate love, wisdom, or anything like having your best interest in mind. It's really up to how you view god. Next, the \"best advice\" is very subjective. Best for your goals? Best for your parents goals? Best to achieve your goals? Most effective for what end? If there is a personal god, and he knows best, then yes his advice would be best. But what if he wants you to learn some lesson by being a homeless person...then, you may disagree and not want to follow the advice.  However, that would lead's me to question personal revelation or how you are getting this advice and how you know you are getting it correctly, psychologists will likely tell you that you hear what you think god would say based on previous beliefs, purely cognitive creativity at work ... Some people think god literally talks, some suggest he nudges you the right direction, some think he set the world in motion and doesn't interact daily, thus not giving you advice at all and some say check the bible, koran etc and it will answer any question you need to be asking.
