	92646 : ["WHO defines Traditional Medicine as \"the medicine that refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-being\". Countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America use traditional medicine (TM) to help meet some of their primary health care needs. In Africa, up to 80% of the population uses traditional medicine for primary health care. Utilizing the healing properties of plants is an ancient practice. People in all continents have long used hundreds, if not thousands, of indigenous plants for treatment of various ailments dating back to prehistory. These plants are still widely used in ethnomedicine around the world. The first generally accepted use of plants as healing agents were depicted in the cave paintings discovered in the Lascaux caves in France, which have been Radiocarbon dated to between 13,000 - 25,000 BCE. Anthropologists theorize that over time, and with trial and error, a small base of knowledge would have been acquired within early tribal communities. As this knowledge base expanded over the generations, the specialized role of the herbalist emerged. The process would likely have occurred in varying manners within a wide diversity of cultures. Plants have an almost limitless ability to synthesize aromatic substances, most of which are phenols or their oxygen-substituted derivatives such as tannins. Most are secondary metabolites, of which at least 12,000 have been isolated, a number estimated to be less than 10% of the total. In many cases, these substances (esp. alkaloids) serve as plant defense mechanisms against predation by microorganisms, insects, and herbivores. Many of the herbs and spices used by humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds. The use of and search for drugs and dietary supplements derived from plants have accelerated in recent years. Pharmacologists, microbiologists, botanists, and natural-products chemists are combing the Earth for phytochemicals and leads that could be developed for treatment of various diseases. In fact, many modern drugs have been derived from plants.", 9451, "1c73371581a5c285c64ed6d78aaade8faa", -1],

Emergency savings? .... First you need to reduce your rent by 700 or so. Find a tight place that has everything included. When you go to the supermarket have a budget. Do not endulge or overspend. Open an oline savings accounts and put 20 for now every month. Dont say you cant, you can. AH btw, the fact you have debts has nothing to do with savings.... You need more money, get a better job, or a second job.  If you have not paid late until now, in order to rescue that credit and get rid of that debt you need a very agressive plan. Minimum payments wont do, interest will eat them. Why on earth you pay so much on friggin rent??? Are you running a bussiness from which you make all of your money??? If so you need to get one or two regular jobs and lessen the rent payments to survive. Suppose you need monthly 850 a month for rent (utilities included) this could be even 700. 80 a month for food, asumming you know how to cook and strech the dollar. 130 for car insurance, = bad credit 60 = cell phone 200 miscelanous expenses = gas, etc a month = total 1260 a month to live. If your job gives you 2600, wich is about 20 an hour, and you get a part time for 10/h that gives you at leasts 1000 bucks extra, that would be 3600 a month - 1200 = 2400 to pay for your debts You owe =  30890,  Your debt to credit ratio sucks so you cant ask for more. Forget about 0 % offers. So, Pay those 1300 first all at once to improve your credit score a little. Then pay the other cards.  DO NOT INCURR ANY NEW DEBT.  In one year you should be debt free = 30890/2400 = 12.87 = one eyar aprox.... If you can make more money or borrow from your parents you are encouraged to do so.", 9446, "AA11436624", 0],

	92683 : ["Hello -  This is a great question. Until recently, seniors 62 years of age and older have not had the best choices when it came to getting cash from their homes. Traditional home loans only offered the option of either selling one's house or borrowing against its equity.  With reverse mortgages coming on the scene, seniors now have some additional cash-flow alternatives. This type of loan allows mature borrowers to convert their home equity into tax-free income without leaving their current home or making mortgage payments - and they do not need an existing income to qualify.   How a Reverse Mortgage Works Reverse mortgages are probably best understood when compared side-by-side with traditional home mortgages, otherwise known as \"forward\" mortgages. The following table shows the differences between the two: FORWARD MORTGAGE                   REVERSE MORTGAGE Uses income to pay debt   Uses home equity to get cash or credit Monthly mortgage payments               No payments                                             Falling debt, rising equity                       Rising debt, falling equity  Both loans incur debt against your home, and both affect equity, but they do so in different ways. Traditional home mortgages require making monthly payments to a lender. With a Reverse Mortgage, payments are made to you.  What a Reverse Mortgage Involves  Here are some important points to know when considering a reverse mortgage:  Eligibility: To qualify for a reverse mortgage, you must be at least 62 years of age. All owners who are on the title deed must meet this age requirement. You must also have paid off all, or most, of your home mortgage. Lastly, the home you reside in must remain your principal place of residence.  Mandatory Counsel: In order to ensure that homeowners are fully aware of the financial ramifications of obtaining a reverse mortgage, you must undergo counseling with an unbiased third party before completing a loan. HUD and AARP oversee a network of counselors who can provide this service, and it should be offered for either a nominal fee or at no charge. Tax-Free Income: One of the advantages of a reverse mortgage is that the money you receive will not be taxed. The amount you'll obtain depends on several factors including the plan you select, the type of cash advances you choose, your age, and the value of your home. Typically, the older you are the larger the loan, as you will have more equity in the house.  Cost: The cost of a reverse mortgage varies considerably from one type to the next. However, you can typically use the money you receive to offset the loan fees. The costs will be added to the loan balance and must be repaid with interest once the loan terminates.  Repayment: Reverse mortgages do not require any payment as long as the borrower(s) remain in the home. Should the borrower(s) pass away, sell the home, or permanently relocate, then the loan would be due in full, along with interest and additional costs. If two borrowers are on the loan and one dies, the loan would not be due since one of them still occupies the home.  Home Equity Conversion Mortgage - The Federally Insured Loan  The most common type of reverse mortgage is the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, otherwise known as a HECM mortgage. This is the only reverse mortgage program that's federally insured and backed by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This type of reverse mortgage is popular for a few reasons:  Ability to choose your own interest rate. You can select one that changes annually or one that changes every month. You have several payment options. You may receive monthly loan advances for a fixed term or for as long as you live in the home. You may also choose to receive a line of credit or combine monthly loan advances with a line of credit. The loan can be used for any purpose. With a HECM, you don't have to designate the loan to a specific use; you can apply the funds to anything you choose. Protection. This is one of the most attractive features of a HECM. This plan protects you by guaranteeing continued loan advances even if your lender defaults.    Sell or Stay?  The main reason people choose a reverse mortgage is to gain financial independence and maintain an adequate standard of living without leaving their current home. The best way to decide if a reverse mortgage is right for you is to compare it to the other option of selling your house. To do this, ask yourself these three questions:  How much cash can I get by selling my home?    How much will it cost to buy or rent a new place?    Is it worth my moving now, or do I prefer to do something else with the money?    Perhaps you'll confirm what you knew all along, where you now live is the best place to be.
