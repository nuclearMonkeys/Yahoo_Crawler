Please don't take this for being mean....but you have absolutely no chance of joining the military, they are not even going to go near you.  Your wife might have a chance, however if she is in her 30's I believe she is too old as well to join. Also most the branches wont even let you sign up and go to MEPS without you being in shape.

	66374 : ["First:  Don't limit your choices to just the Air Force.  Consider other branches including the U.S. Public Health Service (Naval commission - but work mostly for the Department of Health and Human Services... still can't place them?  Think the U.S. Surgeon General).     They JUST entered into a huge partnership to assist the DoD with exactly what you're talking about (link for it is on the website). No matter what branch you choose, you would be getting a direct commission with an advanced rank (Master degrees get O-2 and Doctorates get O-3), plus since you are prior enlisted, you would also have an \"E\" after your pay grade until you make O-4 for pay purposes.  That means a bit extra base pay (look at the bottom of the Officer's pay scale - footnote 3 - to see what I mean), and even a little more for the housing allowance.   As far as advancement potential - the Medical Service Corps folks are all promoted by separate boards (no matter the branch of service) than the \"regular\" line officers, so not being a Pilot or Academy grad won't inhibit your promotions.  Keep in mind, though, that some specialties will only have one slot in flag billets (like there is only one Surgeon General per branch - and that's a three star billet; top dentist is two stars; top pharmacist is one star; etc.) and that's PER BRANCH.  So while it's not impossible to be a flag officer as a Psychologist, it's not probable - BUT O-6 is certainly within reach - and your prior enlisted knowledge will only help you. A direct commission (which the medical services for ALL branches qualify for) means no OCS/OTS, but you will face \"indoctrination\" training.  Think a glorified charm school for two to four weeks (THAT depends on the branch).  You'll be there with a bunch of nurses/docs/lawyers/etc. learning how to salute, wear the uniform, a little about the U.C.M.J., do a little P.T., etc.  It's a breeze and since you're prior enlisted, you'll probably be made a class leader of some sort. As far as choices for a home-base - same applies as when you were in before.  Fill out your dream sheet and hope for the best.  The Service's needs come first - and while you may be a Phychologist, that's just your career field.  You're an officer first.  With the Air Force/Army/Navy, you could be stationed anywhere (As a P.S. here - the Marine Corps DOES NOT have MSC folks.  They are Navy folks.  When they are assigned with a Marine unit, they can wear the Marine uniform, but look closely, the symbols - buttons, devices, etc. - all have either the Navy or PHS insignia, not the Marines'). With the PHS, it depends on which agency hires you inside the DHHS, and it will be stateside (you have a lot of say with the PHS, but even here smart choices will impact your promotion potential - they want to see diversity in assignments, not someone who's in it just for themselves). Hope all this helps.  I'll keep checking back to see if you post any follow-up questions. Edited to add: In response to the poster(s) who said the Air Force doesn't accept prior service.  Yes, they do in fact accept folks with prior service, esp. medical officers (and this person would be an MSC officer as a Psychologist).  Like all branches, though, you can't have more than 8 - 10 years without getting a waiver (you have to be able to serve a minimum of 10 years commissioned to retire as an officer).", 8330, "1jUGukznaa", 0],

You sound like you might be a good candidate for scholarships and would likely be a good ROTC candidate. If that is the case, you can get through college and commission into the Army without an overwhelming debt. That is a good thing. It would mean you would enter the service as an officer which means no 68W. That is for enlisted only. That's OK. If your ultimate goal is to gain a commission and serve in SF, this is as good a route as any. Get a commission as a Combat Arms officer such as Infantry and then when you are eligible go through the procedure to transfer to SF. Another route is to enlist as a Combat medic with Option 40 and then if you want to stay enlisted simply apply to and graduate from SF training. You won't be guaranteed 18D, but as a 68W you have a better than average chance. Another route is to serve a term of enlistment, get out and use your GI Bill to attend college and re-enter as an officer. But the most important thing to remember is just what the other response said; you don't know crap about the Army and you might decide two days after you enter that you don't like it.

	66398 : ["I don't think belief is a choice. It's like love - you don't really have any choice over who you love - you either love someone or you don't, but you can't force yourself to love or not love anyone. Who other people tell you should love cannot alter your own personal feelings. Another example: think of a food you really dislike. You didn't choose not to like it did you? Other people may not understand why you don't like that particular food - for instance, if you hated chocolate - but it's still not a choice that you made. It's a part of your character, but it's not a part of your character that you chose yourself. If other people were to say \"Oh, I bet you love chocolate really - you're just rejecting it\" they would sound crazy. I don't see how belief is any different. If you don't believe in God, you don't believe in God. You are not rejecting him because you do not believe he exists in the first place. You can't just tell yourself to believe, or be told all the reasons why you should believe, and suddenly become a devout Christian - you have to actually truly believe yourself! Theists couldn't suddenly just say \"Right, I'm not going to believe in God anymore!\" and become Atheists. Christians don't believe in Hindu Gods - does that mean you are rejecting them? No, because you don't believe in them in the first place! If someone suddenly told you that the universe was created by a giant penguin called Sir Jeremy the Conqueror, I don't think anybody could believe in that even if they wanted to. Same with atheists.

	66399 : ["Have you ever thought that the God in the highest heaven didn't create this world.  That lesser Gods did?  That is why Satan has had such a strong hold on all flesh and this world since creation.  God in the highest heaven has blessed this earth with his spirit that is pure love and has nothing to do with wars, hate, judgment or revenge of any kind.  The only God, that loves and demands the praise of men is Satan himself.  Yet, as Jesus himself said to the woman at the well,  \"You know not who you pray to.\"  Think about it.  The worlds truth pertains only to the world.  But when it comes to the Fathers truth, that is spiritual, the worldly know nothing except from what they learn through men's interpretation of such scriptures that are not only in the Bible, but all books of religion.      One must have the spirit of God, to know the mysteries of God, which is free for the asking.  But those who love the world ask only men of the world, for as the Pharisees and Scribes in Jesus's times.  They teach only what they have been taught by other men throughout the generations of man.       Remember, Gods ways are not mans' ways.  The bible and all it's stories have a lot of truth, but that truth is only for those who ask God, the Father.  They are similitude's that the churches of man have interpreted to fit the world we live in and to keep them in material wealth and they love the praise of the ignorant who look to them for spiritual guidance, which feeds their power mongering amongst the ignorant.
