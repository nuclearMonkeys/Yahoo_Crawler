	106752 : ["You have taken a subject which is most required in today's world. Most of the people today are suffering from one or the other psychological fears/disorders/anxiety.  So what if you did not get thru the subject test? Try again! If you chose it in the first place, that means you were already set to become a psychologist. After seeing two failures, you are shaken up because probably you have lost self confidence! One of my friends is a doctor. She tried to give a local licenciate exam and failed 9 times. Finally, she was not allowed to take exam any more due to over-rated trials. She went on to study FRCS and passed it! That means, today she is holding a degree which is stronger than a local licenciate! And she is on the top of the world! She thanks God for failing her in licenciate because if she had passed it, she would have never required to do FRCS and would have never been able to achieve that degree! So, go ahead and try one more time. Try till you succeed. Think yourself as one of the important persons in today's world and economy. Because if you pass with flying colors, and if you go on to become a good psychologist, you can support many people to lead good and successful lives and they will lead a better life than ever! So that means, you become a important part of their life and thus of this world!! Good Luck dear! ", 9970, "U8Qfjffgaa", 1],

Anyway, don't quit school, try majoring in the business instead of minoring in it. Or try trade school, mechanic is good money, or paramedic. You need to ask yourself, what it is you are passionate about and do that.", 9970, "XHmz4R99aa", 2],

	106760 : ["Ok, from someone who majored in Psychology. Yes, classes do get harder after the introductory psych course. You will have to write more papers that will be longer and the deadlines will get shorter--not to mention some courses seem more for math and biology majors. However, you can always get help from your teachers and your teacher assistants. do not hesitate to ask for help--that's what they are there for. Once a professor in college told us, in class, \"I don't get paid to teach this class, I get paid to sit in my office and help students with the material, I get paid to have office hours\". I repeated some psych courses and yes, it feels like crap to have to repeat a course, but sometimes it takes more than once or twice. I did not choose psychology because it was short or 'easy', I chose it because I really, really, really like it. I was majoring in computer science before, but the moment I took psych100, I was hooked. So, go for what you are passionate about, not what will be shorter. Forget about your age, that should not be an issue for you, you are still very young. If you really want to do psychology, maybe you should concentrate on it and not have a minor. I don't have one and I think things are working out for me. I have a job counseling teenagers and plan to return to school soon for my masters. Keep in mind that you will not be paid a lot in psychology with only a bachelor's degree. At most, expect to get paid between $25K to $30K a year with no experience and only a bachelor's. You need to be clear on what your goal is after you graduate. What do you want to do eventually with that degree. My goal was, and still is, to have my own practice and maybe teach at college level, but before all that happens I have to do other jobs that may not be as glamorous and keep returning to school for further education. Get rid of distractions, be disciplined, eat well, sleep well and ask, ask, ask, always ask for help. If you \"quit the whole school thing\" what will you do? It doesn't sound like you have a backup plan, like a trust fund, do you? Again, find what you are passionate about and go for that. Remember, there are a whole lot of branches in psychology, it's not just someone talking to a shrink lying on a leather couch. I hear school psychologists are will continue to be in great demand--a little tip: learn spanish, you will get hired like that! Believe me, I know from experience.", 9970, "None", 2],

It is always much easier to transfer in than to try to apply with a dismal record.  It's a bit late to apply for admission to any college. Many schools have already started. Combining late admission with academic probation is not giving you any sort of a break. Again, your chances will improve if you apply on the community college level.

I learned stuff in that course when i had to study for my tests, but in the end it just wasn't my thing even though i did well in it. so you just need to find something that interests you, but that you can also do well in. maybe you should drop getting a minor and focus on at least getting one degree before you go for more.", 9970, "VR6DNJJpaa", 0],

	106777 : ["First, don't bother with contacting a police department. It's not a criminal matter, it's a civil matter involving a business relationship between you and the Medical Technology Institute. As such, the only thing the police can tell you is that you should talk to a lawyer. In that sense, yes, it's \"legal\" as no laws are violated. To answer what I think you're really asking, which is \"can they do this?\", it depends. When you signed up for the course, somewhere in the contracts and paperwork they had you sign, there should have been a clause covering repeating/making up coursework. That's where they should have defined what their policy and procedures are in the event you had to retake classes. If the contract you signed states that additional courses or repeated courses would incur an additional charge (which in this case would be the extra $3,200), then yes, they can do that. If there's nothing in the paperwork you were provided that states that you would have to pay extra if you were required to repeat classes then no, they couldn't require you pay more without possibly being in breach of their contract. Since it's not a criminal matter, you'd have to take them to court, which would mean you'd need to hire an attorney  specializing in business/contract law. EDIT:  Actually, you shouldn't look at it as a matter of charging $100 a week. I suspect that they're offering that as a payment option rather than asking for $3,200 upfront to retake the classes you need. What you need to focus on is whether the contract you signed gives them the right to ask for that extra $3,200.", 9974, "ykolAyJDaa", 0],

	106781 : ["I can't speak to NYU's or Northwestern's transfer requirements in particular, but yes, while I do think you should make sure to apply to a public university or two in the same state as the community college you are now attending and that your school's transfer coordinator thinks you are pretty much guaranteed to get into, you should definitely also be applying to schools in the same category as those two (that includes the top publics as well as private schools). If you were to end up at a \"safety\" as an undergraduate but wanted to go to graduate school, I think that once again, you should be applying to schools in that category if that's where you want to go. At some point in your application materials you are going have to address what happened. Be honest. What you've written here is very clear, and I think that, once you cleaned it up so that it was in standard English grammar, it would do just fine as an explanation. It's not an excuse, and you make it very clear that you don't expect it to be. The one additional thing I'd want to know, if I were reviewing your application, is whether you are still attending AA and/or still seeing the psychiatrist, because it sounds as if you are not, and if you are not, why you decided those things were no longer necessary and what sorts of things would make you think you should avail yourself of one or both of those things again. Do you know whether your original school would consider taking you back? If you went back, academic renewal might be appropriate simply because otherwise the numbers would keep you on academic probation. I don't have any specific advice and I hope you get much better answers from other people, but I think you're someone that many admissions departments would love to hear from. And I hope that things get less horrible soon, because you have clearly made huge changes in your life and you deserve at least as much credit for that as any embarrassment over the mistakes you made earlier.", 9972, "None", 0],
