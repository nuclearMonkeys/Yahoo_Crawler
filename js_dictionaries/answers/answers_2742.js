Some of them are 12 year old kids who have nothing better to do than to antagonize grown-ups, others may carry a Christian title but have never known what it is to be born-again and follow the faith that was only taught to them, through tradition or by inheritance. If these comments that you see, make your spirit cringe, consider this: This forum is just a small example of what  the spiritual realm is all about. We are not battling with the opinions of the flesh, but in actuality we are battling with the spiritual forces that would like to keep people in darkness. You know that that your Christian family is not perfect, and that they can as easily lash out in frustration or discouragment just like anyone else.  You're concern is the sincere love that you show in your in your answers, never minding the splinter that you see in your brother's eye. We will be judged by God for our own actions. I used to get upset also, but the Lord showed me that this is a good place to practice patience, kindness, love for both our enemies and our brothers.  Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.

	142971 : ["Brown recluse spiders typically don't wander freely during the day. The only true identifier, as one poster mentioned, is their 3 pairs of eyes arranged in a a crescent shape (if you were looking at their top, or cephalothorax) and the fact they are a very plain, dull brown/tan. Unfortunately they share this characteristic with some other spiders as well. They tend to find a spot in wood piles or or irregular areas that have \"cubby holes\" to hide in. They are not active hunters, like most spiders and wait for their prey to happen across their trap. They are typically non-aggressive and will go through great trouble to avoid even moderately traveled areas. How even, if you stick your finger in their web and corner them, then *maybe* they'll bite you - or if you roll over on them.  Additionally, Brown recluse bites only create severe reactions in 20% of the population. The sluffing of skin and necrosis that has become legendary on the internet is an extremely adverse reaction. Most people who are bitten by brown recluses don't even know it, or assume it's just another spider or a large reaction to anything but a  brown recluse. Since recluses are generally nocturnal when moving and their initial bite is painless, it's hard to say *when* anybody has been bitten. Be sure to keep your hose tidy in the mean time so they have no \"comfortable\" spots to set up shop.  As for the backyard, chances are those spiders have always been there and you're noticing them now because you're concerned. I believe there was a statistic (lies and damned lies right?) that said there were hundreds of spiders per square yard of a natural environment. I'd say it's more like 50-100. If you go in the wild, and stare at a single spot of ground and let your peripheral  vision kick in, you can literally see the ground move with bugs.", 11566, "3597c41543844cfe384374d393b5be23aa", 1],
