	72894 : ["You doubt Vince Young?  I know that Gator defense was extremely great, but I just don't see how any defense can stop him.  The NFL is having enough trouble with him as it is.", 8694, "2799ed20d932d174d6a64537af69dcc9aa", 1],

	72897 : ["I know your situation all too well. I was a 5-11 190lbs OG 4.8 40...225 bench 355 squat. Playing on a team where the average weight on the line was about 255lbs. I was very technically sound and knew the responsibilities of every position on the football field. But no matter what I did I just wasn't going to be able to dominate a guy who I was giving up 40 plus pounds to. I was a backup and desperatally wanted to change positions, but the coaches wanted me stay put.  Don't make the same mistake I did. I regret not demanding a position change or transferring to another school, because I could have made a signifigant impact elsewhere. And I love football, eat, breath, and sleep it... For you I would recomend Tight End; Full-back; maybe DE or linebacker. But get off the OL if you know that you aren't going to be able to make a impact there.", 8695, "Ji9d9ue2aa", 0],
	72898 : ["you might try out for a linebacker or TE. you have good size for a wide reciever but your 40 time are a bit too slow. i think you might make a good middle linebacker if you put on say 10 more pounds and learn to react to the ball fast. some lb's where not all that fast but had great reaction time to the ball. good luck with your season", 8695, "aiA9uJegaa", 0],

	72908 : ["Stafford is fragile and he lacks toughness. Moore came at him so fast and Stafford went ducking to the ground. That must be very embarrassing. I know a lot of players act tough because they know they have a helmet and they know they cannot get hurt. But Stafford cannot even defend himself from a small corner-back coming at him.

Still would love to see this game. Texas vs. Florida would be a way better game than either a Big 12 south team or and SEC team against Penn State. I think either way that game would be a blowout. ", 8694, "None", 0],
	72912 : ["Try RB or maybe a rover type DB. Benching 235 is real good for weighing 146. I would also suggest going out for track and work on your speed. Coaches always find a spot for fast strong guys.", 8695, "None", 0],

	72918 : ["Yeah, he got his *** handed to him by a fricken defensive back. Cutler woulda been the one to start that fight if he got pushed (he did shoved Fairley after that roughing the passer), but Stafford just cries to the refs.", 8696, "GEPjM2EXaa", 3],

	72920 : ["Florida Gators - Hottest team offensively in the country last 4 games (over 200+ points) - Has the best defense in the SEC - Thats pretty good - Texas has not went against a really good D - Texas Tech was their toughest opponent. - Again, with the offensive playmakers UF has, not one person contributes much more than anyone else.  So, no off day would matter as much.  Tebow could hand off all day as Colt could not. Overall Texas is not On The Rise - Florida has been proving its potential these past weeks.  Most anaylsis believe Florida will win vs Alabama the # 1 team in the nation. FLORIDA !", 8694, "39mCIZHiaa", 1],

	72925 : ["You will not be able to observe what happens, because light will not be able to travel and contact the retina in your eye. When you asked the question, you probably are already aware that light travels at a constant speed.  And if we are traveling at speed of light also, the light is NOT moving relative to us. So probably what will happen (if light-speed-travel is possible) is that everything behind you will fade out and eventually turn black, and you will only see things that's in front of you.", 8697, "None", -1],

	72932 : ["Florida by a long shot. Their offense is explosive and their defense is pretty good too. As you saw last week against Georgia. Tim Tebow lights up the field with this running ability and his ability to throw the ball deep.", 8694, "gOPj6oKoaa", 1],
	72933 : ["Gators.  If Tebow is on his game then no one can stop him.  Tebow is so good and his supporting cast is stellar.  The Gators would stop McCoy and once he's stopped, Texas sucks.", 8694, "C9r94iTmaa", 0],

	72936 : ["Here is what I have learned from both sides of the fence. The universe is about 14.5 billion years old. While God did create it, he also used science to seed life here and watch it develop. He provided some spiritual direction in as much as he inspired some holy men to write things down that we now call a Bible. Sadly many have corrupted the Bible which has led to Atheism. Also religion and its leaders have led many away from their spiritual side instead of seeing the bigger picture. The flood was only in the area of Mesopotamia where man resided. There is a God and he truly is a God of love. He has lovingly given us free will so we may learn, develop and grow as a species. Everyone wants to blame him when they suffer problems from their own bad decisions. They forget to thank him for all he has done when things go right. He is so very forgiving and really wants the best for all of us. But if he rescues us from our problems we will not learn to solve them on our own. He will help you if you ask him for help but because so many do not believe him they do not see it when he helps them. He wants all the souls to return to him, the source of our life. The only way to do that is by showing unconditional love to one another.", 8700, "None", 1],
	72937 : ["The answer I have come to is a scientific one. I don't know. I have decided that I am not meant to so divinity is life and death. There is beauty and wonder in both Together all powerful apart meaningless. Thus to experience the 'divine' you must live in wonder and full of passion and die in hope. If you feel you can overcome the sadness of knowing your death may be simply an end without sense or meaning then try it. If death is final then life gains a beauty beyond measure if it is not the you have experienced life so fully you will be praised.", 8700, "Z9nSYPclaa", 0],
