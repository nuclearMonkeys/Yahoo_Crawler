	98487 : ["What kind of pump are you using?  It's common for pumping to become more difficult, less efficient over time, especially if you don't have a great pump to start with.  For long-term pumping, most women are much better off with a professional-quality pump with a strong motor with a higher cyclage for the suction.  These are generally electric pumps like the Medela Pump-n-Style, or Ameda brand, or even the Avent electric double-pump is pretty decent.  Nothing by Gerber or Evenflo or battery/hand operated, though.  Those types of pumps are mainly good for pumping off excess milk in the early weeks when the breasts are more than cooperative about spouting off any overflow, and will let down to a cat's meow as well as any baby's cry. ;)  The let-down reflex seems to become much more \"picky\" (for lack of a better term) over time, especially when it comes to letting down for a mechanical pump rather than a soft, sweet-smelling baby that fills you will ooey-gooey mom hormones... LOL As your supply is established, though, and your breasts start to make milk for your baby based more upon your baby's feeding routines and habits (supply/demand), there will be less excess milk being stored between feedings.  Your breasts may even get softer between feedings instead of fuller at that point.  Many women think they're losing their milk supply because of this, especially if these changes happen in conjunction with a growth spurt (making baby nurse extra often for a day or two), but it really means your body is adjusting to your baby's needs more efficiently.   As far as ensuring that your supply *is* actually abundant enough to be meeting your baby's needs, the easiest and most reliable way to tell, is to watch your baby's output.  A baby who is not getting enough fluid will not put out the minimum # of wet diapers daily (5-6 if you are using disposables, 6-8 if baby is in cloth).  Now most babies of course are putting out 8-10+ wet ones, but if it goes below 5-6 then you should take a look at the possibility of low milk supply, or some other feeding problem.  Also, most babies will still be having at least 2 poopy diapers a day at this point (again, most are having *far* more!), BUT this is a little more difficult to predict because breastfed babies can go up to 10 days without a bowel movement, and still be just fine, not technically constipated.  So it's more reliable to just pay attention & know how many poopy dipes *your* baby usually has daily (or weekly, or whatever), and take notice if he suddenly isn't pooping nearly as much.  Then, when he does have a dirty diaper, if it is still normal breastfed consistency, he's probably fine, but if it is thicker, pasty, and more difficult to pass, or hard and solid and painful, that would be a sign to look more closely at milk supply issues.   (Sorry, I know this is getting long...) If by some chance, your supply *is* a little low, you can pretty easily counteract that by nursing more frequently for a few days, make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids & still taking that prenatal vitamin (& eating well, of course).  Some moms forget to keep up the fluid intake after the early postpartum period.  Once they are feeling recovered and \"real\" life with full care of the baby settles in, it's easy to forget to drink those 6-8 glasses of water every day.  And if baby is sleeping long stretches at night, for some women their bodies will not receive quite enough stimulation to keep up an adequate milk supply.  Those hormones that regulate breastfeeding are at their highest levels in the sleeping hours, so night feedings actually provide *more* milk-production stimulation than daytime feedings by taking advantage of those higher hormone levels.  If your little guy is sleeping through the night already by chance, you may want to consider continuing at least one night feeding, perhaps in the early morning hours between 4-6, to help increase your supply if that seems necessary.  (Most adults seem to handle an early morning interruption better than a middle-of-the-night one, but everyone is different.) I'm sure there is more I could add here, but a lot of it involves needing an answer to a question before continuing with an answer that may or may not apply (like sleeping through the night).  You could give your local La Leche League leader a call, which would be easier as a one-on-one conversation.  You can find a number for a leader near you at: It really doesn't sound like anything is amiss, from the info you gave, though.  Just normal changes that occur in the course of breastfeeding, and pumping doesn't always work well for all women past the early weeks.  Also, pumping is not really an accurate indicator of milk supply anyway, because the baby will always be far superior at milk extraction.  Even if you're only pumping 2 oz., the baby could very well be eating 6 oz. and getting quite enough milk.   If you aren't able to solve the issue of low output when pumping (even with a good pump), it's possible you'll need to consider supplementing with formula while you are away from baby.  Remember though that you can pump whatever you're able to get, and may only need a small amount of formula daily for quite a while.  And at about 6 months your baby will likely be ready for starting solids, at which point you might choose to replace formula supplements with solid foods and juice instead.   I personally was never able to get  a pump to work well for me, even the expensive ones.  Luckily I didn't have much long-term need for pumping, but I learned to hand-express my milk quite effectively so I was always able to put a little milk in the fridge if it was needed.  I did go back to work outside the home full-time when my youngest was almost a year old (nowhere close to weaning), and just hand-expressed milk for her to drink while she was home with her papa in the evenings.  A bit different at that age, though, since she was eating a lot of different foods.  She mainly needed just a few ounces of milk to drift off to sleep at night.   More info on hand expression, if you're curious: I hope you're able to use the info here!

	98496 : ["There are many ways to keep it moisturized. You can find a hair forum and get advice from other natural women, and everyone has their own advice for keeping their hair healthy and moisturized. It really comes down to what your own hair likes.  It's best to become familiar with the ingredients they put in hair products because some of these ingredients coat your hair and block moisture or the ingredients will dry out your hair. Don't be fooled by the label on the products; always check the ingredients list. You can be using a \"moisturizer\" that's actually drying out your hair. My aunt gave me an expensive line of products for  , and I knew just from reading the ingredients list that I couldn't use any of them in my hair, so I ended up giving them to my mother because they *might* work on her relaxed hair (everyone's relaxed/natural hair is different). My aunt re-gifts, so don't worry, lol, and this was one of her re-gifts. Before I gave them to my mom I just wanted to confirm my suspicion about the \"moisturizing cream.\" I tried it and it did exactly what I thought it would do. My hair was dry and brittle after using this so-called moisturizer. This is because the ingredients used in the product dries out the hair.  Keep it moisturized can be tricky. Make sure you have summer and winter moisturizers. My hair takes light moisturizers during the summer months, but needs something heavier during the winter. Also, as my hair grows and I get more of it, I also notice that I need heavier moisturizers for all that hair. Make sure you try different types of oils to see which ones are better at sealing your hair. I've tried jojoba, coconut, olive, grapeseed, and some other oils. The only ones that I've stuck with are olive and coconut. The rest don't work well in my hair. Coconut oil worked best during the winter, and now that it's hot out, I've had to switch to olive because the coconut wasn't as effective as it used to be. That's just how it is sometimes when there's a change in weather.  Buy some vegetable glycerin or products that are humectant; Nexxus has humectant conditioners. Glycerin is also a natural humectant. Humectants absorbs humidity from the air and brings it into your hair and this keeps your hair moisturized. It won't work unless there's humidity in the air.   To keep my hair manageable, it depends on the products I use. I use products that keep my hair soft, moisturized and very manageable. Wen does it for me, but really, anything that can keep my hair soft also makes it manageable. By manageable, I mean that it's easier to style.  When I'm not going anywhere, I use raw cocoa butter or shea butter to keep my hair moisturized and it stays moisturized for days. Some people consider these butters to be oils, but I don't. I can never seal with these butters, and they actually moisturize my hair, and oils don't moisturize. BUT, I guess it depends on how it reacts in your hair. I consider them moisturizers and not oils, and I use them as such, and they work very well at keeping my hair moisturized; I never use them to seal.  Check out biracialhair.org (it transfers to her new site) and she seems to know a lot about the ingredients they put in hair products. In fact, she has a book that's coming out soon about hair. There are some girls who self-publish their hair book (nothing wrong with it), but her book will be published by one of the top publishers in the industry, and her site is very useful to anyone with tight curls. You can find style videos on youtube; many girls have hair video journals there.  Also, visit some hair forums if you aren't already. I prefer   but there are many to choose from.  **** Disclaimer: Everyone's hair is different, so what works on one person's hair might not work on yours. You'll just have to experiment until you find the right regimen and products for your hair. And, of course, ignore anything you already know.", 9667, "f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa", 0],

	98503 : ["I agree with calling lactation consultant.  In the mean time, food for thought... Is your son gaining weight steadily?  Does he have 4-6 wet nappies (or wees) a day, clear/odourless urine? If so...dont stress about your supply, he is getting enough.  Babies go thru growth spurts at various times and they will be hungrier than usual and can be unsettled as well.  My 2 babies both did this around 5 weeks of age (I fed No. 1 till 17 mths and am still feeding No. 2 @ 8 mths, neither had any formula).  Also, your baby has probably adjusted your supply (it is a supply and demand process) to meet exactly what he needs and this is why you are not able to express as much milk after a feed.  He basically is taking it all for himself, for his dinner.  This is a good thing, and normal, although maybe not very handy if you are trying to build up a supply in the freezer for returning to work!  Try expressing at night when he may normally miss a feed, you will only need to do this a few times to build up a few feeds, then the expressing you will do at work covers any future feeds while your at work.  I used to always make sure I had the right No. of feeds needed while at work for one day, and plus an extra one just in case (milk can be spilt or vomited or you could just be held up in traffic!).  Good luck, I hope this helps. PS. Big tip:  distract yourself while you express...it works wonders (eg read magazine, watch telly, talk on ph etc) and allows let-down reflex to really flow!!
