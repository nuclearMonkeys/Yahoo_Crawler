They were also one of several successor groups of the Hasidim (the \"pious\"), an anti-Hellenistic Jewish movement that formed in the time of the Seleucid king, Antiochus Epiphanes (175–163 BCE). (This group is distinct from the Hasidism established in 18th century Europe.) The social standing and beliefs of the Pharisees changed over time, such that the role, significance, and meaning of the Pharisees evolved as political and social conditions in Judea changed.

	87421 : ["The Pharisees were a major Jewish sect from the 2d century BC to the 2d century AD. The origin of the Pharisaic movement is shrouded in mystery. According to Josephus, the Pharisees first became a significant force in Jewish affairs during the reign of Hyrcanus I (134-104 B.C.). In an earlier work, however, Josephus places the rise of the Pharisees much later, during the reign of Salome Alexandra (76-67 B.C.). Some scholars who view the Pharisees as the shapers of late second temple Judaism have sought to trace the beginnings of the group back to the time of Ezra and beyond. But such reconstructions are speculative at best. It is more likely that the Pharisees were one of several groups to grow out of the revival and resistance movement of the Maccabean period (ca. 166-160 B.C.).

	87422 : ["The Pharisees were a sect of Jews demonized in the New Testament because they strongly opposed any introduction of foreign or idolatrous elements into Judaism. Today, the Hebrew Christian evangelical who give all outward appearance of strict adherence to Torah law ( claiming to be \"Torah observant\" Messianic Jews ) while assigning foreign meaning to the rituals and laws, and violating core precepts, fit the New Testament definition of Pharisee precisely. It is utmost hypocrisy to claim Torah observance if your observance of ritual is honor a contradictory belief to that which it represents in reality. Jewish history does not present the Pharisees as the New Testament depiction. Jewish history presents them as those who held strongest to Torah law and promoted education for all. They were of more than one tribe and this group arose because of strong attempts to do away with the Jewish people and faith by forced assimilation through coercion and deceit.  Religion and politics were intermingled with conquest. A good place to get background on Pharisees and Sadducees.  < another EXCELLENT page to help you Judaism survived largely because of the Pharisees who refused to abandon Torah and dishonor the commands not to add to or take away from it in Deuteronomy.  \"The Pharisaic school of thought is the only one that survived the destruction of the Temple. The Zealots were killed off during the war with Rome. The Sadducees could not survive without the Temple, which was the center of their religion. The Essenes, who were never very numerous, were apparently killed off by the Romans (they were easily recognizable in their isolated communities).  For many centuries after the destruction of the Temple, there was no large-scale, organized difference of opinion within Judaism. Judaism was Judaism, and it was basically the same as what we now know as Orthodox Judaism. There were some differences in practices and customs between the Ashkenazic Jews of Eastern Europe and the Sephardic Jews of Spain and the Middle East, but these differences were not significant. See Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews\" This is from the jewfaq.org site above. Even though Christianity demonizes the Pharisees for its rejection of the replacement of the eternal covenant...Christianity is dependent on a concept that was taught by the Pharisees. Belief in the eventual resurrection of the dead is a fundamental belief of traditional Judaism. It was a belief that distinguished the Pharisees from the Sadducees.  I am proud to be a modern day Pharisee.  I believe as they taught, that education of Torah should be available to all people, that all humans are equal before God, that God is no respecter of persons based on any social status.  I believe that the righteous of all nations merit blessing.  The depiction of the Pharisee in the Christian religion is utterly insulting to the teachings, writings and examples of the lives of the Pharisees.  .  It is a blot on the Christian legacy that it has made the very name of the people who preserved the eternal covenant of God for us today as a synonym for hypocrite and to depict them as those whose outward observance of ritual and custom is more important than living their lives as an example of a walk in faith with God and fellow human being.. the lives of the Pharisees as Jews know them is far different than the New Testament version", 9263, "vEEeq7kYaa", 2],

The bible is not one piece, but a collection of writings written by different men, and assembled by different men much later on in history.   The Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant canons, no two of which are alike, were fixed by modern councils. The Council of Trent (1645-1563) determined the Roman Catholic canon. While a majority were in favor of the canon of Augustine they were not agreed in regard to the character and classification of the books. There were four parties. The first advocated two divisions of the books, one to comprise the acknowledged books, the other the disputed books. The second party proposed three divisions-- the acknowledged books, the disputed books of the New Testament, and the Apocryphal books of the Old Testament. The third party desired the list of books to be named without determining their authority. The fourth party demanded that all the books, acknowledged, disputed, and apocryphal, be declared canonical. This party triumphed. At a council of the Greek church held in Jerusalem in 1672, this church, which had always refused to accept Revelation, finally placed it in the canon. The Greek canon contains several apocryphal books not contained in the Roman Catholic canon.

	87441 : ["The Book of Enoch is any of several pseudepigraphal (falsely attributed works, texts whose claimed authorship is unfounded) works that attribute themselves to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah; that is, Enoch son of Jared (Genesis 5:18). Enoch is also one of the three people in the Bible taken up to heaven while still alive (the only others being Elijah and Jesus), as the Bible says \"And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him.\" (Genesis 5:24; see also Hebrews 11:5). Most commonly, the phrase \"Book of Enoch\" refers to 1 Enoch, which is wholly extant only in the Ethiopic language. The biblical book of Jude quotes from the Book of Enoch in verses 14-15, “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men: ‘See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.'” But this does not mean the Book of Enoch is inspired by God and should be in the Bible. Jude's quote is not the only quote in the Bible from a non-biblical source. The Apostle Paul quotes Epimenides in Titus 1:12 but that does not mean we should give any additional authority to Epimenides' writings. The same is true with Jude, verse 14. Jude quoting from the book of Enoch in Jude verse 9 does not indicate the entire book is inspired, or even true. All it means is that particular verse is true. It is interesting to note that no scholars believe the Book of Enoch to have truly been written by the Enoch in the Bible. Enoch was seven generations from Adam, prior to the Flood (Genesis 5:1-24). Evidently, though, this was genuinely something that Enoch prophesied – or the Bible would not attribute it to him, “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men…” (Jude 14). This saying of Enoch was evidently handed down by tradition, and eventually recorded in the Book of Enoch. We should treat the Book of Enoch (and the other books like it) in the same manner we do the other Apocryphal writings. Some of what the Apocrypha says is true and correct, but at the same time, much of it is false and historically inaccurate.

	87448 : ["First, evolution does NOT attack God, eliminate the possibility of a creator, or even contradict the Bible.  It is only a contradiction with the Bible if you insist on an absolutely *literal* interpretation of a small number of Biblical passages.  And it is only a narrow, fundamentalist branch of Christianity (unfortunately extremely vocal in the United States), Islam, and (to a lesser extent) Judaism who insists on such a literal interpretation ... most mainstream branches of Christianity (such as the Catholic church, home to 1.1 billion out of the world's 2 billion Christians) see NO conflict between evolution and faith.  Second, it is extremely important to separate *understanding* from *belief*.  Religion trains people to believe things without understanding them (\"the Lord works in mysterious ways\").  But unfortunately also trains them to *disbelieve* things without understanding them.   They will simultaneously say \"evolution doesn't make sense\" and \"I firmly reject it\" and see no contradiction that they have rejected something without understanding it.   That is precisely why there are so many \"challenges\" to evolution here (barely disguised as \"questions\"), that are based on *GLARING* misunderstandings of what evolution is, or how it works, or what the theory is.  For example, \"why are there still monkeys?\" has at least 5 fundamental misunderstandings about evolution ... and yet it is asked here several times a day. So there is no point in discussing *evidence* if the person admits that evolution \"makes no sense\" to them.   Throwing fossil evidence, genetic, DNA, blah blah. at them goes absolutely nowhere if they think evolution is about some monkey giving birth to a human baby ... or that evolution is a chain A-> B -> C-> instead of a constanly *branching* tree. Third, there's no point in even discussing evolution if their understanding of *BASIC* science is lacking.   Two key ways to tell if someone doesn't understand *science* (forget evolution): 1. If they insist on using the word \"proof\" instead of \"evidence\", they do not understand science.   2. If they ever use the phrase \"just a theory\", they do not understand science.    This has nothing to do with evolution ... it is basic *science* they do not understand.  So drop the emotionally charged topic of evolution completely, and walk them through their understanding of how we know what an atom is, or that the sun is made of hydrogen.  How do we \"know\" these things if we cannot touch them?  Are they \"proved\"?  Answer: NO.  There is no \"proof\" of atoms of hydrogen in the sun ... only \"evidence.\"  The existence of atoms, or hydrogen in the sun, are not \"facts\" they are based on theory.   I could go on and on ... but those are my top three things. However, it is the first of these that makes resistance to evolution so *powerful*.   To the person who who has been taught from early childhood that evolution is anti-God ... they will (understandably) fight evolution with every fiber of their being.  It is utterly pointless to argue logic or evidence with someone who believes that conceding a single point to evolution is threatening their faith.  And that is what leads them into the other two traps ... clinging to a bad understanding of evolution; and clinging to bad understanding of science itself. And that last point is why I fight Creationism (not religion) with every fiber of my being.  It leads good people into a tragic and *unnecessary* conflict with science.  It leads good people to utter *contempt* for science and scientists.

The books that were \"in\" are the gospels; the bible we have today.  There were books that were thrown out entirely (many of the Gnostic texts were thrown out - the Gnostics were an early cult).  Then, they had this kind of \"honorable mention\" type catagory called the \"Apochropha\".  These were books that were considered to be good books, written by good Jews/Christians, and had value in religious teaching, but were just not the inspired word of God.  If you go to a Christian bookstore, you'll find many a book written by many authors (George McDonnald, Billy Grahm, C.S. Lewis, etc.), which are considered to be good Christian books - informative, talking about God, etc. - but are not considered to be the Gospel inspired word of God.  The Apochrapha was the \"Christian Bookstore\" of the day. Unfortuntely, over the years, this misconception has grown up that these books were \"supressed\", and \"banned\", etc.  Nonsense.  This is compounded by the fact that the Apochropha for the new testiment has a name that is like 50 words long, so typically it is published under the misleading title \"Lost Books of the Bible\".  They were never lost.  In fact, there is one in there very much like Revlations, and some of the more confusing parts of Revelations are actually a little more clear in the other book, and so many a biblical scholar will flesh out his understanding for passages in Revelations by reading the other book. Oxford publishes a version of the Revised Standard Version of the bible which includes the Apochrapha to the old testiment.  And you can search for the \"Lost Books of the Bible\" to get the new testiment.  I'm sure both are available in Project Gutenberg: Update - reading other people's answers, I see there are a lot of misconeptions still.  Actually the old testiment being cannonized in 90AD was largely done in response to Jesus's followers.  They had a blanket rule that anything less than 200 years old was not to be considered (which upset some because there were some texts written by a prophet in Egypt that some considered to be Gospel). The Catholic bible includes 3 or 4 books that aren't in the rest of them.  Two of the books, Maccabes, are in the Apocrypha (though books 1 & 2 in the Catholic bible are 3 & 4 in the Apocrypha).  There is another book, cannonized out of other bibles, that speaks to the accention of Mary into heaven (and is the basis of the Catholic's beliefs about Mary interceeding on their behalves). Unfortunately, the Apocrypha has become to be considered \"bad\" and \"false\", to the point that the word \"Apocryphal\" has been coined to mean false or dubious. PS: Yes, I know I've misspelled Apocrypha many times here, but I just don't feel like looking up the correct spelling and fixing them all.  The \"spell check\" seems to barf on anything more than 15 lines long, so don't say \"spell check\".  Oh well.", 9264, "AA12034021", 1],

	87453 : ["OK - Pharisees and Sadducees were two of the main sects at the time of the second temple. The Sadducees were involved mainly with the temple and associated rituals. This group didn't survive the AD 70 destruction of that temple. The Pharisees were the 'blue collar' Jews - they argued that all people, rich or poor, deserved an education and that all Jews should be able to read and enjoy Torah. It is from the Pharisees that modern Judaism evolved. Karaites are a small group, and are AS Jewish as any other Jews, they simply don't recognise the Oral Torah, or Talmud. They go by the written Torah - the five books of Moses. But any Karaite with a Jewish mother, is Jewish, because this is the SOLE definition of 'jew'. Hasids are Orthodox Jews. They approach the Torah very literally, but unlike Karaites, they use the Talmud as well and they recognise that it expands on the written Torah. As for which group is 'true' - Judaism doesn't work that way. All Jews share the SAME CORE BELIEFS: One G-d Definition of 'jew' All humans equal All humans born pure Maschiach hasn't arrived yet plus other core beliefs Jews argue and debate and discuss passionately and frequently.

	87457 : ["The sphere of Christianity was vast and wide - and certain far off churches had their own favourite texts - and although these were not approved by their governing body - so far away, they still kept their favourite texts as part of their teachings - and so, certain gospels can still be found, in some far away places. A good question to ask - is how do you know that the current popular Bible contains the real teachings of Jesus? www.tjresearch.info/overview.htm Talks about an original text that is now available to anyone wishing to follow this up? That something totally impossible - resurrection, simply cannot happen. The same view is presented in the British documentary - 'Did Jesus Die?' A lot of people can accept Jesus being a normal man - prophet and healer - but not the resurrection part - because that defies belief.. And there is a text which presents this view.

	87458 : ["There were many criteria which were considered when deciding whether a particular writing made it into the Bible. Did any of the already accepted documents make reference to the writings in question?, was one criteria. Some Authors made references that did not agree with what was already known to be correct, or contained gross theological errors which automatically disqualified them from being considered \"God-breathed\", inspired by God, scripture. I wish I had access to more info right now, but I don't. These are a few things that I can remember off the top of my head. <edit> No writings were \"banned\", they were not accepted. There is a dramatic difference. It's like you apply for a loan and are not accepted. That is different from being banned from getting a loan anywhere else. Your application just wasn't accepted at this one place, maybe they have higher standards that another place does not have. Since you can still get a loan somewhere else, you are not \"banned\". The writings in question still exist and can be accessed and read, they just don't meet the higher standard for acceptance into the Bible. The History Channel often uses \"Shock\" titles to gain viewers. \"BANNED FROM THE BIBLE\" is a \"shock\" title, and it is also an intentionally inacurate one as well, the goal of which is to make someone believe something that is not true.

	87459 : ["Satan vists the church One bright, beautiful Sunday morning, everyone in tiny Jonestown wakes up early and goes to their local church. Before the service starts, the townspeople sit in their pews and talk about their lives and their families. Suddenly, at the altar, Satan appears!! Everyone starts screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in their determined efforts to get away from Evil Incarnate. Soon, everyone is evacuated from the church except for one man, who sit calmly in his pew, seemingly oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy is in his presence. This confuses Satan a bit. Satan walks up to the man and says, \"Hey, don't you know who I am?\" The man says, \"Yep, sure do.\" Satan says, \"Well, aren't you afraid of me?\" The man says, \"Nope, sure ain't.\" Satan, perturbed, says, \"And why aren't you afraid of me?\" The man says, \"Well, I've been married to your sister for 25 years.\"", 9261, "None", 7],
