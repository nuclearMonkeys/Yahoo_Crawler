	76751 : ["Absolutely NOT!!!  Hip Hop began as a PARTY DANCE MUSIC, so when people whine about \"Hip Hop losing its roots\" they forget that while Hip Hop was created as a relief from a struggle...its main purpose was to provide a venue for people to have fun!!! I'm all for advance lyricism, as it has definitely become a huge proponent of the genre, but when angry Immortal Technique and Cannibus fans claim that Hip Hop is merely one dimensional, they ignore the countless other aspects of the genre... (NOTE: Cannibus is dope...Immortal Technique not so much...)  The great thing about Hip Hop is that it means so much to so many people, so by realizing this, you not only learn to respect other aspects of this genre but also music in general. The problem with the artists themselves, of course, is when they start acting like some of these fans who claim that whatever they do is the only form of Hip Hop, or \"You Can't Be Hip Hop Without This or This...\" I have a problem with that. Ironically you bring up Nelly who was in a beef regarding such subject with KRS-ONE. While Nelly is really in no place to battle, I respected alot of what he said both about the many aspects of \"Real Hip Hop\" and how hypocritical KRS-One is when he himself used to do the same exact thing (This is pretty clear as KRS-One supports Souljah Boy these days, which is dope, but only goes to show that he probably shouldn't have released like five songs dissing Nelly!). While I am not the biggest fan of Nelly and did disagree with alot of what he said, especially with his idea that \"Record Sales\" alone determines the quality of your music, but I was with him on that one.

	76752 : ["Of course there isn't anything wrong with listening, or liking, \"catchy\" hip hop... it's all down to people's preferences and tastes, and people are able to listen to whatever they like. I gotta say I did like Nelly when I was younger, he did make some catchy songs... and I even like some of the Black Eyed Peas new stuff because of the bass they have in it (although, I can't see how they can't even feel slightly embarrassed performing lyrics a 2 year old could've written lol)... I do actually quite like a lot of \"catchy\" hip hop, it's pretty good for parties. I mean you don't want to be hanging on every word, listening out for every deep meaning while your dancing/getting drunk :P Also, I do dancing to a lot of the \"catchy\" type hip hop songs, right now I'm doing that Move If You Wanna song by Mims.", 8845, "XOJZIjBWaa", -1],

	76768 : ["Both female and male circumcision should be outlawed. NO ONE has the right to remove a healthy, functioning part of someone else's body for NO MEDICAL REASON. This is a direct violation of human rights. My son's penis is HIS and HIS ALONE. It is not my place to cut off parts of it. Contrary to popular belief, male circumcision HAS NO HEALTH BENEFITS. Female circumcision is done by women to women. It's usually the removal of the clitoral hood -- a part of the genitals that is directly analygous to the foreskin on a man. In fact, both parts are called the \"prepuce\". Just because female circumcision is (slightly) worse, doesn't justify male circumcision. That's like saying rape is okay because murder is worse. Female circumcision is done for cultural reasons. Male circumcision is done for cultural reasons. Female circumcision is done for religious reasons. Male circumcision is done for religious reasons. Female circumcision is done to \"look like mommy\". Male circumcision is done to \"look like daddy\". Female circumcision is done based on the belief that it's cleaner and healthier. Male circumcision is done based on the belief that it's cleaner and healthier. Female circumcision is sometimes done to reduce sexual pleasure. Male circumcision was originally done to reduce sexual pleasure (it was used as a punishment for masturbation). Both female circumcision and male circumcision reduces sexual pleasure. Both female circumcision and male circumcision violate the rights of the child. Both female circumcision and male circumcision are unnecessary and harmful. Personally, I don't see the difference. Read this somewhere, forget where: \"When a girl is strapped to a board, and her genitals are sliced apart -- without anesthetic -- it's a horrible hate crime against her gender. But when a boy is strapped to a board, and his genitals are sliced apart -- without anesthetic -- it's not only acceptable, but preferable to millions of Americans. No one's been able to explain this profoundly sexist double-standard to me in a way that makes sense. It's another indication that biases against males are often ignored, minimized or mocked.\"", 8847, "MWPwkn14aa", 11],
	76769 : ["I don't know. It's very weird. Females get more urinary tract infections than males anyway.
