The doctor gave the man a jar and said, 'Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow.' The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor's office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day. The doctor asked what happened, and the man explained, 'Well, doc, it's like this--first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. 'Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing. 'We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried squeezin' it between her knees, but still nothing.'  The doctor was shocked! 'You asked your neighbor?' The old man replied, 'Yep, none of us could get the jar open.' ----------- SENIOR CITIZENS ARE THE NATION'S LEADING CARRIERS OF AIDS!

	94444 : ["A game similar in set up and made by the same company is called Cause of Death. It's on the Apple App Store. I got it after having played the Surviving High School app and having a lot of fun with it. Cause of Death is like the Law and Order/CSI of SHS. There aren't \"mini-games\" per se, as there are in SHS, but it's set up so that the decisions you make add up, and if you do well enough in the end, you get an extra cut scene. If you make the wrong decision, you could potentially die (if it's during one of the action parts).  It's certainly darker than SHS, so do be warned. It's not gory or anything (nothing graphic shown), but the plot lines are dark (you are following cases involving serial killers, after all).  The base game is free, which includes the first chapter, but the following chapters cost money. They are fairly cheap, considering how long they take to solve. Each chapter has about 6-8 component parts. You're looking at a spending a couple hours per chapter, so it's a great way to pass time.  Once you catch up, new component parts of chapters are released every Monday, or you can pay a dollar to get them earlier (it's not worth it to pay, though, since you'd still have to wait a week, you'd just be a part of a chapter ahead).  It's one of my favorite apps to date, so I definitely recommend checking it out.", 9509, "HOhzczcRaa", 0],
	94445 : ["Considering it is a public school function, it is unconstitutional.  Given that you live in North Carolina, you've got a rough road ahead of you. I lived in North Carolina before and I know how difficult it can be to be an atheist in that state. I've been to quite a few high school sporting events with a friend who's parents were teachers, and I noticed the same thing about prayers being said before games. Seeing as it wasn't my school or even my county, I didn't feel as though it was my place to say anything. But considering it IS your school and your events, it IS your place and you SHOULD say something. Because of how religious NC is in general and, as it seems, your school in particular you should probably expect pushback. My recommendations are as follows: 1.) Write a pleasant, informational email to the NC ACLU (   ) letting them know your name, your school district and the issue. Inform them that as a secular american, you are upset about a prayer being recited pre-football games and are planning to ask your school to stop. You don't need them to take any action at this stage, but tell them you are informing them because you are concerned about backlash and you'd like to have your bases covered just in case. 2.) Write an email to your principal, superintendent and athletic director and CC it to the ACLU. The ACLU might even help you draft the letter. (If they won't, I will.)  Be NICE about it. If you go all out and make unpleasant demands, they will feel as though you are attacking their beliefs and them personally and get defensive. It'll also make you look like an a$$. Politely express that you mean no disrespect to their belief system, however, being that you go to a public school, it upsets you that the school endorses prayer at their athletic events. If a moment of silence isn't objectionable to you, provided they don't make you pray or end it with amen, recommend that as an alternative. Thank them for their time. 3.) SAVE THE EMAIL and any response you get: a.) Hopefully, the response will be along the lines of: \"We understand your concern. We'll stop.\" Get it in writing. Reply back with a cheery thanks. Forward the results your ACLU contact and thank them as well. Follow up. If it stops, send another email in a few weeks expressing your appreciation. If it doesn't, reiterate your stance. Don't get angry if it doesn't happen instantly. The powers that be might have asked the announcer to refrain and the announcer is disobeying them. In this case, let them take care of it. b.) They might ignore you entirely. Not likely if they see an ACLU email address in the CC, but it might happen. Some people think the best way to solve a problem is to ignore it. In this case, wait a few days (at least four days, but not more than seven) and email them all again. (stay polite) If there is still no response, let your ACLU know they're ignoring you. They may decide to step in, or may recommend additional steps for you to take. c.) They get belligerent, angry and defensive. THIS is why you were polite and calm in your emails and contacted your ACLU. You made a polite, well worded point about prayer at a public school event being unconstitutional and now they're being jerks about it. At this point, you'll HAVE to keep the ACLU in the loop because if the school fights you on this, you WILL need help. Especially if it gets as bad as it did for Jessica Ahlquist in Rhode Island when she asked her school to remove a banner depicting the \"school prayer\". Even if this DOES happen, don't get belligerent and start throwing insults (yes, even if they started it.) You have to be the bigger person. Let them act like petulant children and be the rational adult. It'll only make them look worse. Save any written correspondence and ask for a wittiness in any verbal response. No matter WHAT steps you take, stay calm, polite and mature. If you don't, you'll come across like a whiny brat and NO ONE will take you seriously. If you act with composure anlevelheadednessss, you'll be taken more seriously, and in the case of them refusing to acquiescess, they won't have your behavior to hold against you, not to mention it will only make THEM look bad. Remember; it is your Constitutional rights being infringed upon. You have the law on your side. Good luck.", 9509, "bKN5WWaaaa", -1],
