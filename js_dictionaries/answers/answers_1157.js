	63353 : ["Yovel S, Colour blind is a term much used to indicate two conditions, colour deficient/confused and colour blind. The human eye can simultaneously detect three primary colours, red, green and blue. All other colours are obtained through the mixing of the three primary colours. In the case of colour deficiency, (which used to be termed as colour confused), one or more primary colours are not detected in the normal way, while people who are colour blind see shades of gray only (total colour blindness). Under the most recent theory of colour vision, colour blindness is recognized as an extreme case of colour deficiency. Men are approximately 16 times more likely to be colour deficient than women. Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women have some degree of inherited colour deficiency. Red-green colour deficiency is a hereditary disease, carried by the X chromosome of females. For this reason the daughter of a colour deficient father can pass it to her sons. Women have two X-chromosomes and one defective X chromosome will be compensated for by the other non-defective one.

Certainly the question is allowed to be asked but the reason people will probably stare at you in disbelief if you ask it is because it's an established fact that evolution happens and explains biodiversity diversity.

As for calling people Darwinists, we've moved on a lot since Darwin's time.  For one we've discovered genetics and the implications it has on evolutionary biology.

	63370 : ["Criticism: @Wire & String, I really enjoy your style of music being simple and very rootsy sounding. I don't think the harmonica was harsh at all and the lyrics are incredible. The other piece made me smile and think of a circus parade. I imagined seeing elephants blasting their trunks and just swaying down the street with funny clowns. @hep, My favorite was the rag song that you wrote. The song is just awesome and you and your dad did a great job. I wish I could have did things like that while my dad was still around because he was an awesome musician also. Consider yourself very fortunate to be able to do that. My only criticism in your other songs would be on the ones with the fuzz guitar being used a little too much. Just my opinion but I really enjoyed the two you submitted without the fuzz more than the two with the fuzz. Maybe if you just used it to add more color to the song and not dominate the sound the way it seems to sometimes. And like I said before on the new song possibly being expanded a little with drums or percussion a little. You should put your music onto cd format for future posterity to pass on to your family. Or just something to listen to when you get older to remember these days. @likegibberish, I really love your music and I'm really greatful that you share your music with us. I honestly get the feeling that I'm in the presence of the gods when I listen to you and others music on here and can't thank you and Wire & String enough for having this format. I disagree with your comments about your one song sounding sloppy in the aspect that it is a bad thing. It really enhances the raw element of the music and I think would actually make it suck if it was all polished in a studio. I really liked the 7 minute song too. One of my favorite things back in the 70s was to put on headphones and just lay back and groove to long jams like that while stoned. Really took me back to those times. @scraggly Young man, all I can say is that I had to light a stick of cherry incense and be reminded of Pink Floyd while listening to your music. Really awesome! @Zack, I almost completely overlooked your lyrics and think they are a great start for a song. I hope you keep working on it and put some more poetry to it. Reminds me a little of Jim Morrison's writing. @RJ, I'm pretty sure I commented on the first link you have posted and mentioned how I love it. It just sounds like I'm rushing around a spiral with a bunch of \"spirits\" or demons. The second link is pretty wild too. You have excellent taste on how you put it together with a mixture of white noise and music. I don't know what the hell you are tapping into but it really shakes me to another level while listening to your stuff. @(Brian) Superstring Dualities, I knew you was going to post some kickass music as a farewell song and probably make at least a few people pissed off because you are leaving. I'm one of those people. I've been a fan of your posts and music for a little while now and really don;t want to see you go. You don't post that often but when you do I can see how you have a lot of love for your friends here. I'm sad that we couldn't make that kind of connection. I love your music and your spirit. I seriously hope you would reconsider or just take a haiatus from this site but really don't want to see anyone leave here.  It gets shallow and empty when people leave and there's an empty place that can't be filled. I'm seeing too many people that I think of as friends that leave for bad reasons. I really loved reading Killer Peaches, Speak English Or Die, Indian Dotter, and a few others that really made this place what it is. All I can say if you are set on leaving is go with my respect and love for your time here but really wish you would reconsider. You are a true artist and I've known a few in my life. You get to undrstand they are quirky people and can overlook their human flaws and see the true artist inside of them. @hep, I appreciate your prodding and have considered posting a tune but have that stupid kink in my head that holds me back. Maybe one day but I'm dealing with my wife being ill right now and just enjoy the release I get from spending a little time with my friends on here. Thanks all for sharing your music.

	63386 : ["The fossil record does not support evolution. Despite the fact that over a hundred million fossils are in museums and other institutions around the earth there is not a single  line of fossils which demonstrates evolution. The fossil record supports creation and the genetic variety within a \"kind\", such as a dog kind, or family, but what came before the dog? That is from the fossil record. When you try to pin an evolutionist down here they will say that fossils are very rare, but there are enough to demonstrate it in at least one case if it really happened. There are no links at all between any of the \"families\". When we look at the fossil record we don't see one, or a few, life forms which branched out in an evolutionary \"tree of life\" but what we see is just the opposite. It is like the tree turned upside down. There were many fossils of life forms which went extinct. So that in our modern age we have a far less diverse range of life forms than in ages past. Many of your posters here try to sound educated, but apparently they are mere gullible dupes. One person mentioned a fossil bunny radioactively dated a million years old, that is if you could find it that would be evidence against evolution. That is wrong on twp accounts' first consider that God did not create bunnies, but what he did create is the ancestor of bunnies. This does not mean that  he uses evolution. He did not create lions or tigers, but two creatures of the \"cat kind\" and these were designed with the capacity for genetic diversity, but not outside of that family \"kind\": any descendant would still be some kind of cat, and the fossil record bears this out. One paleontologist on a web site show fossils of snails which had changed over a period of time to demonstrate \"speciation\" . However the Bible view of a \"Genesis kind\" is the forerunner of the word \"genus\" but it had a wider definition than this modern word and corresponded to something closer tot he modern definition of \"family\". So in the snail example it started as snail, and ended up as a snail, and it just demonstrates genetic diversity built into living things. The only way that this would have supported evolution is if it actually evolved into something that is not a snail. The second reason that the \"bunny\" reference was ignorant is that there is no way to date fossils to a million years old. The reliable dating methods that we have, and by which rocks are dated work only on igneous rocks , but almost all fossils are found in sedimentary rock. The Carbon-14  has a half life of a little over 57 thousand years, but theoretically it is used to date back to forty thousand years. However the whole Carbon-14 premise is based on the view that the level of it in the atmosphere has remained constant. However scientists know that the ancient earth was a far different place in the past with shallow oceans and very little mountainous barriers and so we know that the earth has undergone many catastrophic events, and  Carbon-14 is produced by an interaction between cosmic radiation and nitrogen, but the sun is not a constant source of this as it goes through various regular and irregular cycles. And the atmosphere also has been affected by things like volcanic eruptions. So Carbon-14 is not reliable past 5, 000 years where it can be confirmed by tree rings and known historical dates. Anything past that is just conjecture. If you or anyone else would like to talk to me about evolution my e-mail is \"Bambootiger@msn.com\"", 8202, "QvY5sROoaa", -1],
