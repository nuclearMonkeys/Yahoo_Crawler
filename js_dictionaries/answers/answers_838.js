	46504 : ["In the strictest sense, if you play any game in any format (tabletop, console, mobile, PC, ect.), you are a gamer.  In order to keep such a label, you do need to keep playing games on a somewhat regular basis that can be as infrequently as a few times per year.  However, the key takeaway is regularity.  If you stop gaming, you lose that label & become an \"ex-gamer\" (in the same vein as other ex-'s). Please be aware that the \"Gamer\" label is extremely broad & has no major context with it.  This is where additional labels are mixed in based on what you're playing & how often to provide that context that other gamers can utilize. ASSUMING that you keep gaming, being exclusively a Roblox player isn't going to garner a lot of respect since the game is it's geared towards younger children, being more creative & open-framed than other traditional games.  With only 3 sessions under you belt, you would be on the shallowest end of the gamer spectrum being the most casual of casual gamers.  Unless you played another game to supplement your gaming resumé, you would be at risk of losing that \"precious\" label you're obsessing over. With that said, most gamers generally don't fuss if they're consider a gamer or not because they already know & are comfortable with themselves regarding the gamer label.  Thus, by asking or fussing about this (by virtue of posting this question), you're virtually negating yourself in the process.", 6612, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 0],

I'll note if a game supports online gameplay (meaning everybody can have a copy to run on their own system) OR \"Play Together\" (meaning you're streaming the game to others from your system). * Battleblock Theater (Online / Play Together) * BroForce / ExpendaBros (Online / Play Together) * Castle Crashers (Online / Play Together) * Crawl (Play Together) * Duck Game (Online / Play Together) * Gauntlet (Online / Play Together) * Gang Beasts (Online / Play Together) * Goat Simulator (Play Together) * Golf with Your Friends (Online) * Heave Ho (Play Together) * Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime (Play Together) * Mercenary Kings (Play Together) * Overcooked series (Online / Play Together) * River City Ransom Underground (Online / Play Together) * Screencheat (Online / Play Together) * Tabletop Simulator (Online) * Ultimate Chicken Horse (Online / Play Together) Please be aware that this is NOT an exhaustive list as I've passed over some games in favor of more co-op / competitive games.  When looking at games in Steam, check your library for multiplayer games that have \"Play Together\" support.  This is relatively new for Steam (released in the past year) where you can invite your friends to play the game that's streamed from your computer to theirs.  This does require a stronger computer on your end (as it'll be crunching video frames to send out to them & handling their inputs) & everybody having a reasonably good connection (if you can do a video call with minimal quality dips, you should be OK), but it does allow you to play games that don't normally have online support. This does means that games like the Disney Afternoon Collection (which is a collection of 6 NES Disney Games) & Sega Genesis Classics (which contains around 50 games, all sold separately) can be played online, even though the games don't natively support it. I must note that you generally need to have your account in good standing to utilize Play Together services.  Any bans on your account will potentially restrict your access to this service, as VAC bans will block on those VAC-enabled games & abuse reports from others (in the case friends or family more than stranger with Play Together, but reports from strangers while using Family Library services can happen) can you to be banned from this service completely.

Those vegans who get vaccinated, truly falls into the do the least possible harm group.   The first are those who fall into the anti-vaxxer group, who are against all forms of vaccinations, as not only some type of governmental control, conspiracy, or will try to claim, that vaccinations are dangerous and is a cause all manner of illnesses or birth defects. Neither of which claim has been found to have any proven scientific validity. Then the second group who are against vaccinations, are those who believes that no type of vaccines, and/or any other medications for that matter, should be developed using animals. Yet and sadly all to often, the latter group fails to realize that not only vaccines but also with many medications, that they also benefit other types animals as well.   I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian myself, but I've looked over some of their arguments over the years.
