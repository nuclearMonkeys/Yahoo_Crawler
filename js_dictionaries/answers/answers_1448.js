The benefit of traffic school is that you do not get a point with DMV and the conviction is confidential so it CANNOT be seen or used by an insurance company in setting rates.  (Contrary to Steven's suggestion, this is not optional with the insurance company--the conviction is confidential which IS one of the purposes of traffic school.) So, that means you will have a point on your record.  Your license is NOT suspended unless and until the DMV says so.  Your license will NOT be suspended by the DMV for one point; the DMV is not authorized to take action against a provisional license unless you get at least two points in one year (and if you have a full license, that is four points in one year).  What is likely, however, is an increase in insurance rates.", 8935, "None", 1],
