The way of having valid insurance in NC is easy, but not cheap.  You can either be listed on someone else's policy as a driver (they don't care who), or you can buy a thing called non-owner's auto insurance.  All the insurance providers in the state will sell it to you. Non-owner's insurance doesn't cost much, but it's still a lot of money when you consider what it won't cover.  It doesn't cover any vehicle owned by a member of your household or workplace, it doesn't cover any vehicle you own / lease / rent, it doesn't cover any vehicle you operate regularly, and it doesn't cover any vehicle that does not have regular insurance on it.  In other words, it only covers you if you're driving a total stranger's insured vehicle for the very first time.  Does that sound like something any sane person would ever pay for? When no customers around, insurance companies call non-owner's policies by a whole other name.  They call it pure profit.  But if you live in NC, you're kind of screwed.", 25, "M0akEw8Vaa", 0],

You still owe the rent. What ever late fee was stated in your lease still applies in most states.  Some states are still allowing no cause evictions on a month to month but some are not.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good.

Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 28, "None", 0],
