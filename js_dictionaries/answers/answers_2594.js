	135564 : ["No, because it has been shown that a person from a primitive culture can be taken away as a child to a more advanced culture and after becoming acclimated fit right in. Religion explains why \"some\" civilizations became more advanced than others. Beginnings of modern science Christian pioneers  It is significant that the early pioneers in modern science were men of deep Christian faith. For Copernicus, the first astronomer of the scientific revolution, God was personally responsible for all the activity in the heavens. His radical ideas were contained in his book On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, which was published in 1543, the year of his death. The regularity he was discovering in the movements of the planets was, for him, a manifestation of the faithfulness of a loving Creator.  Galileo (d. 1642) invented the hydrostatic balance and discovered the laws of dynamics from observation of falling bodies. However, he is chiefly known for his achievements in astronomy. His discovery of the four satellites of Jupiter on January 7, 1610, with the aid of the newly invented telescope, revolutionised the study of astronomy. He has been called the first modern scientist and his work confirmed the observations of Copernicus. He regarded his science as illuminating the work of the Creator. For all his quarrelling with the church he remained a devout Christian until he died. Kepler, the German astronomer, a contemporary of Galileo, was also a devout Christian. His discovery of the three laws of planetary motion laid the foundation for Newton's theory of gravity. He regarded his study of the physical universe as \"thinking God's thoughts after him\". In The Secret of the Universe he wrote:  Here we are concerned with the book of nature, so greatly celebrated in sacred writings. It is in this that Paul proposes to the Gentiles that they should contemplate God like the Sun in water or in a mirror. Why then as Christians should we take any less delight in its contemplation, since it is for us with true worship to honor God, to venerate him, to wonder at him? The more rightly we understand the nature and scope of what our God has founded, the more devoted the spirit in which that is done.  The baton of scientific leadership passed in the next generation to Newton, born in the year of Galileo's death. Though he had problems with the Christian view of the Trinity, he was a strong believer. As a member of the Anglican Church he was involved in distribution of Bibles to the poor and the construction of new churches. He actually wrote more than a million words on the Bible and theological topics, more than he wrote on science. His well-worn Bible, with marginal notes in his own handwriting, is in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He became the foremost mathematician in Europe. He published Principia mathematica in 1667, \"a book that transformed the course of western science\". His work gave new direction to optics, mechanics and celestial dynamics. His work on gravity established the Cambridge reputation for mathematics. His studies of light produced the first reflecting telescope. His invention of calculus gave science the mathematical tool it needed for further exploration of the trails he blazed.", 11291, "AA11232725", 1],
	135565 : ["You'd have to demonstrate that anyone actually learned anything. Lots of people who reject evolution are in world-class denial. Most theists are not committed to reject evolution and many accept it as a valid description of how different species arise, but while some are simply misinformed and amenable to argument, there's a hardcore group who are committed to denying evolution, some out of misguided theology and others for political reasons.", 11291, "lTo4jdGGaa", 0],
	135566 : ["I am rather surprised that most Evolutionists here are ignorant about the fact that even Civilizations in relation to human intelligence and also behaviour have been tried to be explained by Evolutionists scientists, although through imaginary way without any scientific foundation. Although human beings have certain biological similarities to other living things, only man has constructed civilisation. Mankind has established universities, hospitals, factories and states, composed music, held Olympic games and ventured into space, and has achieved all of these thanks to his intelligence.  Contrary to what evolutionists hope, it is clear that there is no property in the brain which can give rise to reason. That is because brain cells consist of such unconscious atoms as oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. These atoms cannot, of course, “think,” “know,” “remember” and “love.” Moreover, these atoms are the same in all the billions of people living on Earth. Yet despite having exactly the same atoms in their brains, billions of different people have entirely different characters. It is clear just how nonsensical Evolution, which regards all these people, who are able to demonstrate quite different emotions and ideas in exactly the same circumstances, as collections of atoms, really is. Evolutionists, however, suggest that this order within the brain came about by chance mutations. They claim that atoms bereft of all capacity for thought established the magnificent design in the human brain solely as the result of a long “evolutionary process” based on nothing more than chance. This claim has no scientific foundation and is a violation of reason. Genetic research has shown that there is no question of mutations adding any information to the genes, and that if they do have any effect these are always damaging to the organism. Not one artificial mutation carried out in laboratories has brought any benefit to a single living thing. Embryos subjected to mutation have been seen to be born dead or crippled. It is clear that mutation could never bring about the “order” within the brain. Such a thing is as impossible as turning an electronic calculator in the most complex computer in the world by smashing it with a hammer. Human beings are very superior to other living things. The civilisation established by man reveals an extraordinary accumulation of knowledge. Philosophy, medicine, universities, science, technology, politics, art… the origin of all of these stems from consciousness. Consciousness, language and speech are concepts that cannot be explained in terms of Evolution. The truth which evolutionists refuse to accept is evident: it is impossible to account for human reason and consciousness in terms of Evolution. The atoms in the brain cannot feel, know or speak. There is no doubt that the source of the human brain is not atoms, but the inspiration of our Lord. Darwinism Refuted: Don't Judge Before You Read!
