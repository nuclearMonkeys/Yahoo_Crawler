Genetics will determine the actual start of greying, once you're 35 years old, your aging hair follicles are likely to produce white or grey hair to replace the last hair that died. Look at your parents and older relatives to get an idea of how quickly you may turn completely grey (more than just a few strands). My mother started turning grey at the age of 22 but my paternal grandfather is in his 90's with only a few strands of grey. Seems like the maternal side has pretty much all turned prematurely grey so I guess I have that to look forward to - I think silver/grey hair is beautiful!

Other than the above, sending a lock of hair is charming.

	48604 : ["Collecting, in and of itself, is fine.  It is some of the issues pertaining to collecting that can cause problems in a relationship, and before you proceed, you need to establish a firm understanding with him about hos collecting. Collecting this sort of thing takes up room.  It also takes discretionary spending, and what I mean by that is it is extra money. money left after the necessities of life are met.  This doesn't mean that you can't keep and add to a collection while you are saving for/buying a house, or saving for kids' education, your retirement, or other things important to you.  It just means the disposable income spent on collecting needs to be limited. This can get very tricky; fighting over money has ended many, many marriages. Taking up space is a big issue.  Time spent on a hobby is a big issue. These issues need to be discussed. If he shows an unwillingness to compromise, I see trouble ahead. If you proceed, then you need to take what you get without complaint, because you entered the marriage knowing what you might expect. Again, it's not the items themselves, it's the issues related to collecting in general.  Certain Hot Wheels cars are extremely valuable.  I don't collect them but I do collect. I've been collecting 30 years. Some of what I collected is not worth much more than what I spent, and some is worth less, and when you factor in that a few thousand dollars spent 25-30 years ago would be worth maybe $10k today, those things have been a terrible investment.  But you can't put a price on pleasure of enjoyment.  On the other hand, as I gained more knowledge as I bought, developed 'an eye', my collecting has turned out to be a great investment. I have things I paid hundreds for that are worth multiple thousands.  I've spent a lot of money but it has never interfered with our outside investing. Space is another matter entirely. My wife has not been overjoyed at times, but when she sees the check after I've sold something (we are now in the downsizing years), she is much more forgiving of my hobby.", 6842, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 2],
