When you ask Him into your heart, and repent of your sins, he will forgive your sins.  But as a believer, one  should be getting better all the time. We are incapable of being perfect, but we should be striving, growing spiritually  in that direction. ( toward Christ). It is Christ/God/spirit in us who helps , guides, you when you pray for strength, focus, help, etc.  The one unforgivable sin is to deny God and his Holy spirit.

We had mice problems when my son was 2 and I told my husband to get have a harts traps he could not find any and they where eating our wiring, so he did not want to waite and bought the d-con, He hid it really well I thought behing a board behing a dresser.. While my 5 year old saw the bright yellow box and some how got it mind you they where upstairs less than 15 min. I was in the shower and I saw my 2 year old eating something I knew I had given him no snacks so I asked him wheer he got them he said J his brother gave him some lucky charms but that is not what they where they where d-con pelletts. I called posion control thinking I would have to give him epicat something used to induce vomiting,, They said OH NO give him nothing to drinl thy sent an ambulance and my 2 year old had to have his stomach pumpped. Dcon has an ingrediant that will may them become hemophiliacs, meaning they will start to bleed from any orphos eyes or nose vagina, it thins the blood until they bleed to death.. That is why they needed to pump his stomach so they caould meassure the amount they got out with the amount missing, . If i had not coaugh he was eating that he could have fallen down that day and scrapedhis knww and bled to death scary experience.. But depending on how much blood as to what animal but I think he was probably looking for a place to die.. I hope you find it as it can stink really bad, I never used that thing agai and felt guilty forever..Good lucj maybe you can follow the blood to where he went to die.. You can call the exterminator and ask him what he used and the side effects on the animal it will give you more of a sure answer , see if he set any traps that he could have been trappped in and then got free and the wound may not be big enough to kill him just bleed until he heels.. Often being the tail someties it has gotten theneck and the wiggle out if that is the case it probably will not live either or still can be walking or lying somwhere attached to a trap.. I hope I answered that ok.. If you set out water in the event it wa dcon they will die faster pecause he will urine out more blood faster, which is ehy they did not want me to give him any liquids until his stomach was pumped..", 9345, "None", 0],

	89946 : ["I consider it a veggie because when I cook, I combine it with other veggies. I know that I am wrong. I agree with others that posted regarding the issues of the seeds causing it to belong to the fruit family. I think that I once read (or heard) that tomatoes are part of the berry family, not because of the taste or looks, but because they come from a vine or shrub, as opposed to how the majority of other fruits come from trees. It was something along those lines that made it part of the fruit/ berry family. Anyway,  I think many people refer to tomatoes as veggies and consider them to be so. It does have to do with the fact that they aren't sweet like most other fruits are.  I'd also like you to know that there is also a veggie that is sometimes thought of as a fruit, called rhubarb. It grows like and resembles celery, but the stalks are pink to deep red instead of green. Since many people may buy it already chopped and frozen, and aren't aware how it looks whole, and they take it to be fruit. When rhubarb is cooked or baked and prepared properly, it's taste becomes sweet. Rhubarb is used in many dessert recipes, like for making pies, etc. and yet it is a vegetable!

My New International Version Study Bible makes it clear that \"The earliest manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have John 8:1-11\".  Some manuscripts place it at the end of John's Gospel and others insert it after Luke 21:38. With regard to Mark 16:9-20, it is preceded by a statement saying \"The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9-20.\"  No attempt at fraud is being made. Likewise with 1 John 5:7-8 - it is not \"a bald face attempt to validate the false doctrine of the Trinity\" because. If it was, then there would not be a note to explain that verses 7-8 do not appear in manuscripts prior to the sixteenth century. Are you aware that Greek manuscripts fall into two pedigrees?  The most widely used MSS (Alexandrian) as translated by Catholics Westcott and Hort, was also used by anti-trinitarian Jehovah's Witnesses in their New World Translation.

They come about because of a person at one time reasoning on the Bible. And I personally think if we could track these down - sort of like their etymology - that they came about when people did not have the advantage of a personal copy of the Bible. (I'm talking 1500's kind of thing) And they heard bits and pieces of scripture read or discussed. What they remembered is what we get in these quotes. When Bibles did become available, for many it was just assumed that these were in it, but never found because there was always more to read. Today, people read so little of the Bible, they truly don't know what is in the Bible, and what is not.

	89955 : ["One way to determine the accuracy of certain verses is to research each manuscript. for example the earlier manuscripts are not necessarily more accurate. They are just older. If you look into the  Alexandrian manuscripts  you will find that these are altered or different that the majority of the texts because it was in the hands of Gnostics. These religious leaders taught a great many things that are not Christian. Their old temples and libraries are extremely pagan. Gnostics taught the concept of secret or hidden knowledge. see: John 18:20 (link) There were parables that Jesus later explained. These were written down for all to understand. If you look into the Sianatic manuscript you will find that it was pulled from a trash heap and showed erasures and rewrites up to seven times in one verse.  If you look into the Vaticanus you will find liberal alterations and deliberate changes from other manuscripts. Here is a link to a video that is done by a man that has researched a lot of it.
