Why should I worry about cleaning my LCD screen? One of the most expensive components of a computer system or laptop is the LCD monitor or screen. LCD screens are easily susceptible to damage and scratches, so it's a good idea to make sure you clean it correctly.  Can I use any type of cleaning solution on my LCD screen? No, using alcohol or ammonia - based cleaners repeatedly may cause permanent damage to the LCD. Over time using these types of cleaners could cause the surface of the screen to yellow. It can also make the screen brittle and eventually cause cracking on the screen surface. NOTICE: The following cleaners are unacceptable:  Acetone  Ethyl alcohol  Ethyl acid  Ammonia  Methyl chloride  What types of cleaners are acceptable? • Water • Vinegar (mixed with water) • Isopropyl Alcohol • Petroleum Benzene What are some of the basic supplies needed to clean an LCD screen? A soft cotton cloth. When cleaning the LCD screen it is important to use a soft cotton cloth, rather than an old rag. Some materials, such as paper towels, could cause scratches and damage the LCD screen.  Solution of water and isopropyl alcohol. This solution can be used along with the soft cotton cloth.  Computer wipes. Only use these if they specifically state on the package they are designed for LCD laptop screens. Computer wipes can come in handy for fast clean-ups or when you want to avoid mixing up a cleaning solution yourself.  How do I clean the LCD surface properly? Do not spray any liquids on the LCD screen directly, and do not use paper towels, this can cause the LCD screen to become scratched.  Always apply the solution to your cloth first, not directly to the parts you are cleaning. You want to avoid dripping the solution directly into your computer or laptop.  Stroke the cloth across the display in one direction, moving from the top of the display to the bottom.", 9461, "AA10589847", 3],

The effects will depend on your age, I think. If you are young you will prolly grow. If you are older you will have less body fat and it will be easier to increase muscle mass... and you might get hairier. Your libido will obviously increase.  As for joint pain, it depends on what has caused that. If you have osteoarthritis for example, increased levels of testosterone won't help. Muscle repair, fatigue, injury repair, and tissue repair should all improve. I think some people stay on hormone replacement therapy permanently and lead \"normal\" lives. I read that the tallest men often have an overactive pituitary glands and I can think of one basketball player who had an operation to remove a tumour that was causing his excess height.
