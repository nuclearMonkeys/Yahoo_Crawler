If you have both done everything, then of course she's going to believe she has no responsibilities.  Sit down with her as a family and divy up the chores among the three of you.  That way, she'll have a hand in it and will be more likely to comply.  If she doesn't comply, then give her a consequence related to the offense.  For example, if she doesn't wash her clothes, she will be stuck with nothing clean to wear.", 10378, "im9HVuWfaa", 2],

Don't listen to the person who said you raised her that way bc she is a TEENAGER! Kids and teenagers can't see beyond their own needs, and it is our job to teach them how to not be selfish, at twelve it's normal for her to act like that. Normal...not OK!! lol so just keep taking her rights away...just like in real life, you don't work, you don't pay rent, guess what, you start loosing things. This needs to be the lesson.

	114089 : ["In most cases \"headphones\" are not allowed by OSHA or most insurance companies. Temp agencies pay low wages and charge compaies high hourly rates, but pay no insurance.

	114090 : ["Well, they are called temporary agencies for a reason.  Employment is temporary.  A company may hire you for a short time then let you go.  Nothing may be available right away after you're done the first job.  If you really need a stable income that you can depend on and would be affected too deeply if you missed paychecks here and there, then I would not recommend it, as there is no guarantee of employment.

	114109 : ["I'm sorry your family treats you this way. It's wrong in any situation, but particularly when it comes to matters of mental health. Has your family had any communication with a health professional who can explain to them what is happening to you? Maybe they have refused to learn about your illness.  I hope you are receiving treatment for your disorder. There are a number of different medications for those with bipolar disorder. It is a treatable condition I know some answerers have suggested that it's time to move out and move on with your life. They aren't necessarily wrong, but I know how hard it can be to leave any home--healthy or not--and that you may not be capable of working in your present state of mind. Sometimes bad situations, as awful as they can be, are less scary than the facing the unknown world outside. I feel that moving out and moving on is an overly simplistic solution I don't have a solution, I just know that that was true for me at one time. However, ultimately I think moving away from your family will benefit you. We have to remove the people in our lives who are detrimental to our health, even when they're family members. We don't get to choose the families we are born into, and you got a raw deal when you entered the world. Someone once told me that friends are family that we choose for ourselves. Please find a support group. You need people who understand what your going through around you. I also think it would be very beneficial for you to participate in one-to-one therapy with some sort of counselor. It's sounds like you may have a lot of issues to talk about having grown up in the family you did. Find a therapist you feel you can work with and who understands you. This may take trying several different therapists. It's not a one-size-fits-all thing. Different therapists subscribe to different philosophies about how to treat mental illness. Find one who you feel is good, and don't give up looking. I know it's a lot of work when you aren't feeling very strong already, but I really, really hope you can do it.", 10379, "AA10502178", 0],
	114110 : ["I'm no expert but I do have chronic \"invisible\" illnesses that most people don't know about.  I don't have a band aid on my head so I am not sick.  Anyway, at 25 I had my first child, was a single mom.  At around 29 or 30 I met a wonderful guy and moved out, had 2 other children with him.  I worked for 3 years until I had my 3rd.   I am a stay at home mom now.  I am 36.  My parents have done nothing all my life but tell me I will never do anything with my life.  Well, I have helped my 3 kids get good grades, enjoy sports, music, dance or any activity they enjoy, I also play and talk to them.  I don't just shove them into activities.  I am (hopefully) going back to college this September.  Now this is my immediate family (parents & older sibling) whom I'm guessing just has some sort of sibling rivalry going on...I don't know.  I suggest THERAPY.  Talk to someone.  That was the only way I got through it.  You are not a bad person or a freak for having bipolar.  I really hate the way society perceives mentall illness.

	114111 : ["their are a few things i would recommend, i have to be honest as i am a 13 year old so i have been through this stage before, also i have a stepmum too. i would recommend firstly, to sit down and talk to her and ask her why she is acting this way, if she opens her heart and tells you theirs something wrong or even if she just can't  be botherd, make sure you listen to her reasonings first and give her a cuddle at the end of it, then you express why your feeling the way you are to her, if that doesnt work i recommend, confiscating special possessions, such as mobile phones, any game consells, even the tv in her room. if that doesnt work i would say ground her, not just ground like she cant go out, i mean like school trips, days out with her friends, anything in that nature, and i know im going from punishment to having fun but, maybe if you went on special days out with her, something you both like doing, for example, shopping bowling crazy golf cinema even if its just doing some special activity like baking or dancing in the house, having a laugh. also id just like to mention, urm because i dont what happened with her past mum i cant say alot but im not aloud to see my mother, well i am but my parents always make me feel guilty whenever i say i want to so i change my mind, maybe she misses her mother, or even if she doesnt, maybe if her mother did something bad or she just didnt like her, she might be thinking the same way towards you, however if she is seeing her mother, maybe her mother is putting things in her head, you have to be very careful with that, i hope it goes well for you xxx good luck amy xx", 10378, "1Hf5XJmoaa", -2],

I worked for an agency with the intention of getting a full time job.  I worked at an automotive plant for five months and 29 days.  The plant had actually measured me for my uniforms because they were going to hire me full time. The day before I went full time, the agency pulled me for another job. The agencies take a portion of your wages, normally $1.50 to $3.00 off the top to pay for their services. When I tried to put in my resume at the automotive plant, the agency called me and told me that I was an employee of theirs and that what I did was very unacceptable. Since the company only hired through the agency, I lost out on a great job.
