	61792 : ["1.  It is not in India's policy to attack another country. 2.  India will do anything and everything to defend itself - even if it means retaliation and war. 3.  Before reaching a conclusion on whether India should attack Pakistan, we whould first establish direct link of these events with Pakistani government, because Pakistan is not able to control its extremist and terrorist groups within Pakistan. All said and done, some action is to be taken for the incidences that took place SOON - whether that action is against a country or some group or some individuals is a matter of investigation. The action is necesary to set an example that these deplorable incidences will not be tolerated.", 8132, "O4YuD3L0aa", 0],
	61793 : ["I think its very irresponsible of Indian politicians and media to point fingers at Pakistan without any solid proof. The attackers themselves claimed to be from Hyderabad Deccan. It would be a big mistake to attack pakistan because this is a war no one will win. Both countries have nuclear weapons and we can well imagine the consequences. ", 8132, "K9GdVSZIaa", 1],
	61794 : ["Chill out and wait for the investigation.  It has only just begun. We have to stop falling for the media propaganda.  The globalist controlled media and globalist controlled government have an interest in keeping us afraid of muslims extremists.  It helps them justify the war agenda and the continued gradual dismantling of the Constitution. If you want some truth, read from independent media.  Independent media is not instant - it takes a few days for the stories to come up.  They don't have the same resources as the globalist stooges. Evidence has already surfaced suggesting this may be the work of Indian organized crime.  I doubt you will hear the media run with that.  C'mon .. you cannot expect them to miss the opportunity to promote the new world order by actually telling the truth for a change, can you?", 8132, "mVlRpc97aa", 0],

	61807 : ["I am sorry for your loss.  There are a million things that can happen to stop a pregnancy. Some are because there is a genetic defect that prevented continuing or incompatible blood types. Chances are you didn't do anything. Lots of pregnancies cease during the first tri-mester.  Please wait for a few months before trying again, to give your body a chance to heal.  You don't want a repeat of what happened, if you can help it. Why not marry the guy? Why give a guy an heir and not a wife? I hope you consider having a stable home for a new life to bigin in. Not just a bf who may or may not stay. If you aren't ready, then why are you ready to raise a child without a daddy? Daddies are so important.  Little girls need daddies so badly-even more than sons do, until sons are school age.   My condolences for your loss.  Good luck.", 8136, "2f64bcbff1164d7d3d76ac0fefcf633baa", 0],
	61808 : ["First, I've very sorry to hear about your miscarriage.  Remember you didn't do anything wrong, about 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage in the first trimester.  The high rate is generally due to genetic/developemental abnormalities in the fetus, not anything you specifically did or didn't do.  You may wish to look into a support group in your area so you can talk with other people who have had the same experience and asked the same questions.  Your doctor should be able to provide some information on this.", 8136, "AA11119076", 0],

	61812 : ["I had a miscarrage at 6 weeks too in January. You have to understand that you did not cause this. Did you know experts say miscarrage happenens 40-50% of all pregnancies? It's hard to cope with but it sounds like you have a very supportave boyfriend, which is good. Just talk to him and tell him how you feel and share your thoughts on what happened. I bought a necklace in memory of my lost baby, there are many things you can do to honor the life that was lost inside of you. Just make sure to not blame yourself. Sometimes, it just wasn't meant to be. I try to see the positives like if my body did not reject this fetus, what if it had a life threatning illness and would have died at a very young age? Our bodies sense something is wrong and abort it. I'm sorry for your loss.", 8136, "None", 0],
	61813 : ["You didn't do anything wrong.   There are many reasons why women sometimes miscarry- even more than once- before having a child.  (And why, traditionally, women wait until they are out of their first trimester \"danger zone\" to go public with their pregnancies) It could be that the blastocyst improperly implanted itself in the wall of your uterus.  Do you have any gynocological diseases that would impair conception?  (i.e. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease- PID, or Endometriosis)  Have you ever had any STD's/STI's that went untreated for a certain amount of time?  Any family history of ovarian/uterine cancers?  Also, some fetuses (in your case, embryos) abort themselves (as horrid as that sounds... I'm sorry babe...) because of genetic abnormalities.   My advice is to go to your OB/GYN, get a complete check-up, get tested for STD's and STI's (there's no shame there... I promise...) and PID/Endometriosis, Ovarian and Uterine cancers, and have a scan done on your entire reproductive system.  If anything, it'll make you feel better about the next time.  And I do encourage you to keep trying!   It'll all pay off in the end.", 8136, "hF6TMH5Yaa", 0],

	61819 : ["its not your fault so don't feel like u are the one to blame for ur miscarriage. miscarriage can happen because the fetus is not growing the way its supposed to so ur body rejects it. 1 out of 5 pregnancies for a woman end up in a miscarriage.

	61824 : ["Your going to end up loosing him for sure if you continue this way anyway so what's point of spot checking him?  You really have serious psychological issues and I don't say that to offend you.  Thats why you are on here, so that people could give you honest opinions, right?  You need to realize that if he is going to cheat, somehow someway he will be able to do it.  For example, while he is in the care \"alone\" he could just tell the girl to be quiet and not say anything while he screams \"Im alone!\".  Cheating is easy, people do it all the time and if he wants to do it, he will find a way, trust me.  Its nice to know that you really love him and wouldn't want him with no one else but you have to also realize that your insecurity could eventually make him loose interest in you.  An insecure girl is not attractive in my book.  It makes a girl look ugly and needy.  I have met some full figured women are so confident that they even look better then some thin women that I have met!  Confidence enhances character and it character is everything.", 8137, "ysHug5HTaa", 1],

	61829 : ["UPDATE:  I rethought my answer and deleted and replaced my original answer with the following (there was one thumbs up for the old answer): Pentax does in camera HDR, and I'll put those results up against any phone any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The images from phones look good because you're looking at them on a small LCD screen.  This is far too small for the human eye to see any defects due to poor lens design or the horrendous amount of noise that phones produce even at base ISO.  You don't know what you are giving up for the convenience of a phone.  I think if more people did, there would be a lot more people using actual dedicated cameras instead of phones. Your question is obviously based upon your personal experience of the major DSLR brands, namely Canon and Nikon, which is understandable.  However, Pentax DSLR bodies do a lot of things that Canon & Nikon bodies don't such as in-body image stabilization (IBIS), astrotracer, and pixel shift are all things in most Pentax bodies (even the entry level ones) but not in any Nikon or Canon DSLR.  Why?  Because Canon and Nikon know that don't have to.  They know consumers will buy their cameras because of the name.  Pentax, on the other hand, doesn't have that name recognition and therefore, they have to put more tech in their cameras to entice people to even consider them over Canon or Nikon.  Have you ever considered Pentax?  Probably not because of the fantastic marketing of Canon & Nikon that promotes the idea that if you want great pictures, then you have to be using a Canon or Nikon, which is simply BS; just ask any Holga owner.  I know, I bought into the marketing BS, too.  I used to be a Canon and Holga shooter and had you told me that one day I would be shooting Pentax and loving it, I'd think you're crazy. So, you see, DSLRs do, do the things that phones do and a lot better, too.", 8140, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],
