As far as the colors go...I've actually taken some interest in the temperament colors as of late.  ^_^  You know, the four that sort of go like this: Orange--energetic, intense. Golden/Yellow--Rules Person, orderly, neat. Green--Cerebral, technical. Blue--Emotional, passionate. It's got me to thinking that the colors aren't on a sliding scale, so much as they are on a three-point system.... Things closer to Green or Yellow--the two colors our eyes are most sensitive to--are about matters of the Brain, or what we think. Things closer to Orange or Red--These are what I'd call your \"gut\" feelings, the really primitive, primal stuff.  The \"er\" drives: anger, hunger, terror.  Things that make you *Move* or Go. Then things closer to Blue or Violet--These are what I'd call your \"heart\" feelings.  They're sort of the in-between, between your gut and brain, things like: joy, love, sorrow.  I'd say these are the things that make you *Reflect* or Stop. ^_^  But hey, what do I know?  I admit I don't have this stuff down 100%....if I did I'd be a Jedi or something, you know? Hope this helps.  ^_^  *lol*", 11305, "556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa", 0],
