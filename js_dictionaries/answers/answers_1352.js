I would think that if a genuine deity revealed itself via a written book, that book would have some quality to it that could not be found in other \"holy\" books. However no holy text of any religion holds anything special over all the other ones. So yes, I think a real religious revelation would be too profoundly beautiful to be dismissed. But that is not the case and therefore the conclusion is that all \"holy\" books are the work of human societies and not gods.", 8709, "uBpx2JDGaa", 1],
	73193 : ["Hmm.. do you think it is possible that you are confusing \"Inspired by God\" and \"written by God\"  two different but often times misrepresented things? Because TO ME,  and maybe I'm just crazy,  \"inspired by God\" doesn't mean it is written by him and is the BEST he can come up with.  I think you might be taking it a BIT too far there, buddy. Secondly,   Did God INTEND for people to believe SOLELY based on this book?  Did God intend for this to be the ONLY source of information about him?  -- This seems to be your base line assumption,  so it is only fair to ask.. is this a realistic assumption based on the evidence? IF SO,  why the HECK didn't he write it himself?  So the fact that you are RIGHT that not everyone who reads it converts and it doesn't seem like the BEST he could have hoped for... PROBABLY should tell you that he didn't INTEND people to be converted simply by reading a book. That he didn't INTEND for this book to be the ONLY source.  RIGHT? SO,  you need to re-evaluate your primary assumption.  It seems to ME that you are assuming that this IS his best work and he DID intend people to be converted solely by it.  If that is the case (your assumption) then YES, it is a very poor attempt.   But realizing it is a poor attempt.. should lead you to re-evaluate your primary assumption. However, your \"further details\" where you respond to what other have answered..seems to show that you are unwilling to re-evaluate your primary assumption that the bible IS God's best work and the only means of conversion. Maybe, you have miss judged the purpose and intentions.  I'll give you that a NUMBER of Christians seem to think the bible IS the ONLY source AND that it is the ONLY thing that converts. And typically THESE Christians that believe this.. call the bible \"the word of God\"  as-if he wrote it himself. BUT, maybe the reality is a bit more complex than that.  MAYBE people don't convert solely based on the book and this is OK.  MAYBE it makes sense that it would take more then a book to convert someone... and this is OK.  Maybe \"inspired word of God\" is more of an apt designation then merely \"word of God\" as many have shortened it to.  These are things you need to think about. PERSONALLY,  I can tell you that you have REALLY high standards for a book. Sounds like you are a fundamentalist who bases EVERYTHING on the bible.  You seem to expect that the bible be SOOO amazing that you are disappointed. BUT maybe your expectations were unreasonable because you misjudged the intent and purpose of the bible entirely.  I'll tell you THIS.. of the 2.0 billion Christians worldwide,  less then 2/3rds think like you and think the bible is the ONLY source and what converts people.  1.2 billion Catholics don't think that.  SO you are preaching to a small minority. Of the remaining 1/3rd, not ALL of them believe solely in the bible.  So WHO exactly are your arguing with?", 8709, "1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa", 3],

When it comes to the bigger things, like knowing how to read or write, it's not about death but still about being at the mercy of others. Knowing things not only defines who you are (I believe who we are is based on our memories and experiences) but allows you to defend that against the constantly influencing world. So, in a way, knowing the bigger things is still about life or death...but intellectually, because if you're not your own person you're as mentally disabled as anyone who is retarded or autistic (which is a kind of death.)", 8712, "zblAppOraa", 2],

	73214 : ["It is not a satisfactory explanation on any level.  I dislike such a definition because of the subtle implication that religion automatically equals the deepest foundation, the core values, of humanity in general.  Religion did not originate those moral values considered to be the foundation of society, and it really is not synonymous with them, either. Suffice it to say that religion usually is representative of the deepest *expression* of the person, so far as these things are concerned--but you cannot separate the person from it and claim it has any value on its own.  Religion is the tool whereby many people *express* those values that resonate with them on a personal level, and only as such a vehicle does religion have any meaning. Too often it is the case that the focus is on the apparel, rather than the person within.  It is safe to say that this is a good description of how religion is viewed in the world today.
