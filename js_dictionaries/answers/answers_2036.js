I am underweight. I am almost 16, almost 5ft (lol) and weight about 83 pounds. To me that sounds like an okay weight but everyone tells me that I need to gain more. Just try to eat an extra serving of something. Here is what you don't want to do. Don't go eating chips and junk all the time to try to gain weight. That is not healthy. It is absolutely okay to eat chips and stuff, but in moderation. We are lucky!! Most people would rather have a diet where they need to gain weight, rather then lose it.", 10010, "None", 0],

	107558 : ["Post breakup regrets are normal for any circumstances.  It sounds like you want her back because you need...somebody.  Your self esteem issues are about what you feel about yourself, not what you are when you're with someone. It's probably a good thing you didn't get back together.  Like you said...you were tired of the relationship, that  most likely wouldn't change.  You're the same 2 people, if it was stagnant then, it still would be.  Sometimes we really want to love the person we're with, but it  doesn't always happen.  I think that's what you might have experienced.  Maybe she and you could be good friends, but that's all.  In time your self esteem will improve and you'll be willing to take chances again.  Who's to say...Ms Right might be right around the corner.  Good luck.  Hope this helps....", 10008, "n8lXItGraa", 0],

Sometimes because I did not follow the \"party line\", other times because my experience spoke a different language or understanding. Perhaps it is the nature of men, or men just fear what is different,  I do not know. Perhaps it is why I always sought that communion within, that One Relationship where rejection is just not possible. I have never felt rejected when seeking communion within & in that communion the sting of disapproval from men ceased to have an impact.

	107573 : ["Have you recently been to the Dr to have things checked out?  I think you should get bloodwork done just to check for thyroid or hormone disorders that could be causing you to be so underweight. It is also possible that you have a fast metabolism, or you just aren't eating quite enough for your activity level.  I would recommend that you eat 5-6 meals/snacks a day (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, dessert/snack).  That way you will be able to fit in more calories, without feeling overly full, and you will have more energy too. Try adding some of these healthy foods to your diet to help you gain weight: -nuts/seeds -natural peanut butter/almond butter -avocado -olive oil -eggs -100% fruit juices or milk instead of water -cheese -2% or full fat milk/yogurt/cottage cheese instead of skim -dried fruits -starchy whole grains (whole grain cereals/breads/pastas, brown rice, potatos) -more protein (canned tuna, chicken breast, lean ground beef/turkey, etc) -protein/energy bars (Larabars are very calorie dense, and they are made with very few ingredients and are all natural) You could also try drinking Ensure or Boost Plus with meals and snacks.  They are basically nutrition drinks that are meant as meal replacements, but if you drink 2 of them a day in addition to what you already eat, you should gain weight.  Each 8oz bottle has 350 calories and nutrients, and they don't taste too bad either.  They can be a little pricey though, but if you have a wholesale warehouse store near you (like Costco or Sam's Club) you can often buy them in  bulk and get them cheaper there. As for exercise, I wouldn't do too much cardio while you're trying to gain, but you can add strength training a few times a week to help you gain a little muscle/fill out more.  But make sure you are eating plenty while doing this! Best wishes", 10010, "S7Q3fRvoaa", 0],
	107574 : ["Post-breakup regret is normal.  That's when we start to romanticize about how \"great\" things were, when they really weren't.  What helps is writing down all the things you didn't like about her, how she treated you, and the relationship in general.  Read over them, and remember how unhappy you were in the relationship.  In time you will start to feel better about it, and start to build your confidence back up, and you won't feel so regretful.  Remember, things happen for a reason.

When I was younger I had a grilfriend like that but the only reason she called every 30 secs was to find out where I was so that she could do the \"dirty things she accused me of\" do not call him every 30 secs or you may find yourself alone because it makes them feel insecure too. I suggest a hobby that will occupy your time until he returns and if you get quality time with him then that is good; but making a guy feel superior to you puts him in the driver seat, guys like challenges especially when they are attractive.", 10009, "AA10292084", 2],
	107585 : ["I feel for you. Without intending any disrespect to you, it is hard to know what kind of person you are from only words on a screen. I don't know if you are a sane woman, of sound mind, and only feeling a bit anxious over this relationship or if you are like this with everything in your life? It sounds like you love your boyfriend a lot. Did you have an unstable childhood? Were you betrayed by various friends in the past? Do you think that your boyfriend is not trustworthy for some reason? As I said, I feel for you and I *truly* mean that! I sometimes feel that way with my current boyfriend / fiancée / future husband. I think the reason that I feel that way is because I was engaged before - 9 years ago - and lost that person suddenly, in a violent car accident. That incident changed my world and now - (as much as I try not to be this way) - a part of me is always scared that my loved one will just up and leave or die abruptly. It is a hard path & while I don't let it cloud my path of happiness or my relationship with my partner, I feel that it is mine alone to endure / bear. I have spoken to my partner about it several times but he cannot relate. He has never had anyone he has loved die so he cannot imagine it. He always says: \"Life is long.....\" and I see it the completely opposite way. I think life is short...no matter how much time we are allotted on this planet. I think time is so precious. I cannot help but wonder if you were ever abused as a child or if, like me, you had a loved one die suddenly? I don't know what else to say to you to help you. Sometimes people sabotage themselves for no reason. Tell yourself that you deserve happiness and that you are \"allowed\" to have happiness in your life.

She would sleep with him in a heartbeat, but it's hard to say whether or not he would sleep with her at all. The only thing you can do to solve this is confront him directly.

	107592 : ["For skinny guys (ectomorphs) you definitely need to eat a lot of calories. The general rule of thumb is this. About 1 gram of protein per body weight. So at 120 lbs, 120 grams of protein spread between 5-6 meals throughout the day. About 1/2 gram of total fat intake, so 60 grams for you the entire day, spread out. About 3-4 times per body weight for carbs. This is where you will grow and put on weight. People always talk about protein which is essential for muscle but without carbs used for fuel, you won't gain any significant muscle or weight. Types of foods to eat include : chicken, turkey, fish, egg whites, whole eggs, tuna, cottage cheese, lean beef. Carbs include whole wheat pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, yams, sweet potatoes, russet potatoes. Get your veggies in and fruit. A weight gainer wouldn't hurt as well as protein powder. Workout wise, forget the cardio for now. Too much cardio will eat away at muscle. Aim for a 6-8 rep range, lifting at least 3 times a week for starters. Go with free weights as opposed to machine work. You'll get a better pump. Also google, \"compound\" exercises. These are great (squats, dips, pull ups, dead lifts) to add size.
