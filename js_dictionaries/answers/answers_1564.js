He admitted that it was going to be a slow process, but that it needs to be done. This is one of the reasons behind Operation Fast And Furious. It was an attempt to make uns look bad, by secretly providing them to Mexican Drug Cartels. Unfortunately, it backfired. Also, the background check is already in place. It was part of the crime bill in 99, and it was an NRA idea. When you buy a gun from a dealer, you have to do a phone-in FBI background check. This also happens at gun shows, contrary to popular belief. The background check can take from 5 minutes to 5 days. If they do not respond within 5 days, you get the gun. Don't blame the dealers, blame the FBI for taking more than 5 days to see if someone is good or bad. Private sales are the ones exempt from background checks. But private sales are a very small fraction of gun sales. And in different states, registration is required even for private sales.

The Republicans actually did this completely spot on, they unmasked what the Democrats were trying to get out of this and it was mainly to divert the populace's' attention away from their failed economic policies and a fiscal cliff bill that was literally a piece of garbage that the senate spit out in less than 5 hours, instead of passing the Republican plans that were revised multiple times and actually were written way before the deadline. However Republicans simply stated we have more important issues to deal with. And not only that to expose the problems with mental health care which is tied to mostly Blue states cutting tons of money from mental health facilities, an example would be Rahm Emmanuel with Chicago. They turned what would be a democrat plan to divert attention into a political exposure of their rash actions in cutting mental health care.

No, I'm not an evangelical, but some of my friends are, and we have some lively discussions.  I go by the biological definition of life, you know the science of biology, and I also know that a baby's DNA is different than its mother's, so why shouldn't we protect its right to due process?

No, I'm not too worried if she would become the president, but I guess some people are because they have what they want and are worried about change.  By the way, in Roe v.

	83891 : ["I understand special relativity as well as any layperson, and the reasons why it causes the idea of stellar travel to seem a mere pipe dream. However, I am firmly of the belief that just because we don't know a way around it doesn't mean that there is none. Newton was right as far as anyone had the ability to detect for over a hundred years. Einstein realized that Newton's laws only held true in cases where all observers are in the same inertial frame of reference, etc etc - and we've since proven this to be true. What about circumstances where special relativity doesn't apply? We haven't found any, but that doesn't equate to the inescapability of relativity. Or, perhaps even if it is inescapable, the alien visitors are of a culture where family and personal attachments mean little to them, and they simply accept time dilation as a consequence of stellar exploration. One could visit a very large portion of space indeed if they are willing to leave their origin's timeframe behind. And as far as energy sources go, once again, we only know what we know, and not everything that could be possible. A 50mph wind was able to blow down a suspension bridge, not through brute force, but by unlocking the potential energy stored in the structure itself, and causing that to tear the bridge apart. Certainly there might be analogous energy sources / ways to get around special relativistic effects when travelling to stars. I accept relativity for what it is - the best we currently know. I also accept the fact that today's scientific laws are tomorrow's outdated misconceptions / steps in the right direction that fell short of the full truth. So I completely believe that it is //possible// to travel to the stars (from the stars to Earth?). I simply do not buy into the UFO/Conspiracy Theory thought as it is too speculative and un-proven to be considered a liklihood.", 9141, "11a1cc1b17086e736a4ecf4c8f2de81faa", 1],

Throughout Man's history, our feeble understanding of Nature has undergone many revolutions and are we really that arrogant to believe we now understand all our limitations?

Would they say \"Impossible!!!\"? The Star Trek communicators of yester year are todays reality in cell phones. Look at the strides Man has accomplished in just the last hundred years. It doesn't take much of a duck brain to imagine a civilization a hundred thousand or even a million years more advanced than us.
