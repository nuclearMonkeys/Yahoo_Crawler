My IQ is genius level, so I'll match it with yours or anyone else's any time. The most intelligent people do not blindly believe in gods and devils. Do you believe in Ahuramazda and Ahriman of Persian Zoroastrianism? The Devil was copied from Ahriman. He was not in the Bible until the time of the Persian captivity. What does that say about your intelligence if you do not know that? Do you believe in Allah, Amon, Baal, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Zeus, Odin, Jove, Marduk, Yu Ti, Ma Lo Wong, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, etc, etc, etc? People of other religions may say you have little intelligence for believing in Yahweh the god invented by Moses, rather than their gods.

	63554 : ["Hi Sierra! Wow! Your vision and need to help is awesome. I admire your spirit. What you are planning is a big task, but definitely achievable! I would, however, recommend that you do it in small steps. So start with what you can do today: You can read books about counseling to start with: People don't always want to hear what others have to say, especially if its something they don't want to hear. Counseling books teach you how to engage people so that they are more open to guidance, and tons of other stuff that will help you help others. If you are Christian, you should join a local church with a good youth ministry. Volunteer to help there on the camera team, the music team or whatever catches your fancy. You will need Spiritual strength to carry your great attitude through the rest of your teen years and into adulthood. Church is also a great place to find other like minded guys who can help you work on your dream, and the Church is the NUMBER ONE way to help your community. Many of them have outreach programs, counseling teams etc. You can also kick off one or 2 small projects in your area, or join some that already exist. Are there soup kitchens? You can volunteer there. Collect old clothes from your neighborhood and give to homeless people. My wife and I collected TWENTY bags of clothes just from our complex! Look for ways to do small things every day. Many people see the big stuff, like the world's unemployment and all that and then it depresses them so much that they lose hope and don't do anything. Making a difference starts with doing what you can in your street, then your community, then your town, etc. I'm sure you get the picture! Mail me if you want to talk about these things more ok? Bounce around any ideas you have for helping locally. I've done most of them so will be able to give you some tips. At the risk of repeating myself: Don't lose heart.Start locally and just keep doing SOMETHING every week, no matter how small you might think it is..", 8211, "None", 0],

I researched for months before I moved here and found the Alliance area in North Ft Worth to be my best place. I don't know if you have kids, but the school districts up here (Northwest and Keller) are very good. The commute to downtown is about 15 miles, not too bad.

	63585 : ["Cami, we worship a miracle working God. The following story is true. It happened in Ft. Payne, Ala., in Feb. of 1999. It's one of those things that you hear about, But when you hear about it happening to someone near by, it makes it even more real and can bring you to your knees praising God.  There is a couple whose little boy, 6, has a tumor in his brain that is very rare and without  treatment will kill him. They have been told that there is only one doctor in the world  that has experienced success with this particular type tumor. The problem is, this doctor is  in Asia. The family, their friends, and their church all prayed for God's compassion as this  little boy has grown sicker and sicker. The family cannot afford to take the boy to Asia  for the necessary surgery. As a matter of fact, they couldn't afford the surgery if they had  access to the doctor. Consequently, most of the prayers have simply asked God to prevent  the child from suffering as the tumor kills him. The boy's dad is a salesman at a local Ford  dealership. Last week, a very well dressed man stopped at this Ford Dealership. The dad  talked to him. The customer said that he didn't need a car. He obviously could afford it,  but he explained that he didn't need a vehicle. He added, that he wasn't sure why he had  even stopped. Upon hearing this, the dad suggested that they go into his office and talk and  look over some brochures. As they exchanged introductions, the dad discovered that the man  had the same last name of the Asian doctor who could operate on his son's tumor. Upon  hearing the name, the dad fell to his knees and wept. He began praying that the man might be  a relative, a brother, or at least know the doctor. He was thinking that if he were a family  member or knew the doctor, maybe he could intervene and make some arrangements to get  help for his son.  Noticing what was happening, the other staff members of the Ford dealership began gathering  around the dad and the stranger. The customer was more than a little surprised by this  reaction to his name. It was only when the dad related the story about his son's tumor that  it all began to fall into place.  For, you see, the customer was not a family member of the doctor, or even someone who knew the doctor. He was the doctor. He explained that he is moving from Asia to begin practicing medicine in the United States. In fact, he is going to practice medicine in the University of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham, Al., which is just two hours from Ft. Payne. He promised that as soon as he completes his move from Asia to the US, that he would perform the surgery on the little boy, free of charge. Now, you might ask, why would a very successful and wealthy doctor from Asia, who is in the process of moving his practice to Birmingham, Ala. stop at a Ford dealership in Ft. Payne, Al.?  Who knows?  God works in mysterious ways. gatita Baptized in Jesus Name according to Acts 2:38 My faith in the One who died for me", 8211, "OfeCeEvqaa", 5],
