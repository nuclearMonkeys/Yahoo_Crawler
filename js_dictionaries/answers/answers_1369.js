	74062 : ["I'm going to 100% agree with you on the \"hero\" aspect.  That's just human nature.  I'm a Larry Holmes, Ray Leonard and Muhammad Ali fan, and as such, someone can make the case that I'm not thinking clearly when comparing those 3 to other greats.  I certainly see it in the Mike Tyson apologists that can't come to grips with their man never beating a top fighter, in shape and unafraid. I'm only going to partially agree and partially disagree with you on the incompatibility factors in rating fighters from different eras.  I consider both Dempsey and Tunney to be the first fighters of the modern era we know today.  You mention footwork and combination punching, what I've noticed is that both Dempsey and Tunney do both better than a lot of today's fighter.  Watch those 2, and watch films of fights just 10 years earlier and you'll see a quantum leap in fighting skill.  You see a guy like Jack Johnson on film, there's no way that method would work today, but you can also divine from JJ's apparent natural athletic ability that he'd have no trouble adapting, and most likely would torment contemporary fighters as much as he did during his hey-day.  You can break down a hypothetical fight between Holmes and Dempsey, Marciano and Lewis.  I don't think you can break down a fight between Sullivan and Klitzhko.  Holmes beats Dempsey the same way Tunney did.  Lewis Marciano?  I find it hard to believe RM could even reach LL's chin with a powershot, but if he could, it would only take one shot for RM to cold-cock LL. But Dempsey's combinations were terrific, and from time to time we can see him doing what's known as \"6 inch punch\" and \"3 inch punch\", gaining great power with very little range. That skill has been lost on today's heavyweight. Watch Dempsey use his feet to gain leverage for hitting power.", 8756, "None", 6],
	74063 : ["Boxing is an unpredictable sport. The big guys do have an advantage over the small guys but there are many times where the small guy won. Chris Byrd defeated Jameel McKline, Roy Jones Jr. over John Ruiz, Evander Holyfield one win over Riddick Bowe, Mike Spinks over Larry Holmes, Sultan Ibragimov over Shannon Briggs...the list goes on...Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano were cruiser weight by today standard but Evander Holyfield was also a cruiser weight moving up to heavyweight and did quite well. Chris Byrd, Roy Jones Jr. James Toney were middle weights who all did well in the heavyweight division. Mike Spinks was light heavyweight when he moved up to heavyweight without a tuneup fight and beat Larry Holmes. Ruslan Chagaev defeated Nicolay Valuev, huge size difference. I am not saying that the smaller guys always win but the possibilities are there.", 8756, "AA10270018", 4],

Their relationship to bees (and the many other organisms that pollinate them) is strictly symbiotic: they don't trap them, as would be necessary for the plant to be considered protocarnivorous, and they don't digest them, as would be necessary for them to be truly carnivorous.

	74076 : ["I agree. I absolutely agree with you on this. In fact, I'm not sure what I could even add to your statement other then the fact that all the hero worshiping on this forum, and especially when it comes to Jack Dempsey and Rocky Marciano, is not only bias and irrational, but also very disrespectful and nothing more then a real slap in the face to modern boxers. What makes it even worse, as you perceptively pointed out, is that this kind of thinking is mostly coming from people who are supposed to be historians and experts and set an example to others on this forum. I'm not sure exactly, who made the remark that Jack Dempsey would KO Larry Holmes, but I remember all too well the Lennox Lewis vs Rocky Marciano question, which was asked by gannoway just a few days ago. While I found it incredibly interesting, once I've read the opinions of other members and forum experts on this subject, I was, in all honesty, simply too disgusted to give any sort of response. Jack Dempsey and Rocky Marciano were great fighters for their time and they should be taken as such, but in comparison to Larry Holmes and Lennox Lewis, as far as pure boxing talent, skill level and ability is concerned, they were nothing. Compared to Holmes, Jack Dempsey looked like a thug who just stumbled of the street into a boxing ring. No technique, all most no defense, complete predictability in the ring and total miss match in physique to begin with. And this is a man that would knock out Larry Holmes, a true master of this sport and one of the most complete boxers ever. Same goes for Lewis vs Marciano, except for the fact that there is an even bigger difference in physique and most likely skill level and boxing talent between them. Lennox Lewis was completely superior to Rocky Marciano in every aspect of boxing and everyone who knows anything about this sport knows this very well, but yet, most of us are absolutely convinced that he would get knocked out in this match. I don't know, I really don't. As you said, we are all entitled to our own opinions, regardless of how delusional, disrespectful or inconsiderate they may be and most people on this forum, when it comes to their heroes, seem to exercise that right to the fullest, I guess. That's all I can say.", 8756, "AA11728597", -4],
	74077 : ["You ask a very profound question. Because you are correct. There is no reason for God to create anything nor does He need WORSHIP. Yet, creation exists. Hence we are FORCED to conclude God did it for Himself for His Own Honor and Glory (WORSHIP) despite the fact God does not need any further Honor and Glory. We are stuck with that answer. However, we now need scripture for a more complete answer because God is a pure self aware Spirit. It tells us mankind was made into the spiritual Image and likeness of God (self aware spiritual intellect [know] & will [acting/love]). In other words, we were created to eventually \"share\" (love) in the life of God. This now means that mankind was made to know (intellect), love (will) and serve (WORSHIP) God in this world and to be happy (SHARE) with God forever in heaven. Thus God is LOVE (sharing) which becomes the true motive for creation. God DID IT FOR US in order for us to SHARE in His Honor and Glory. Thus true worship is ultimately for our own good. We become what we admire and worship.", 8756, "DWQ4C97Baa", 0],
