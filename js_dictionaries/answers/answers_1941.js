If you play BF3 and Starcraft 2, I'd just get the GTX 660. If you don't, I would go with the 7870. As far as the reference model, 4 different people will probably give you 4 different answers. I got MSI for my first build because it was on sale, it worked well with no heat issues, so I have gotten it ever since with no issues. But is it better than the others? Probably not. I just know it works well and stays cool. But I would get whichever is on sale.", 9824, "zXk7FgEfaa", 0],

Have you thought of using a dictionary for the collection of lists? listdic = {'acc1': list1, 'acc2': list2} listdic[varname] = list3 Also note that there's an easier way of creating the variable name, using string substitution: \"acc%1\" % (len(accounts)+1) This even works as a dictionary key: listdic[\"acc%1\" % (len(accounts)+1)]", 9825, "715f8a57435bf66b324f94e65dec6359aa", 0],
	102793 : ["Python lists have no such thing (as far as I'm aware) as preallocation. When creating arrays in most other languages, the arrays are either explicitly or implicitly allocated to an initial size. When they have to expand, usually the data contained will be copied over to another array that is preallocated for the larger required size. In Python, lists are a little weird. The preallocation that goes on there is probably more similar to languages that use implicit preallocation (done in the background). But they seem to preallocate more memory than necessary in case you want to add elements. I believe there are other optimizations done as well to avoid slow-downs while appending items. Thus, I think that (b) would be the most correct answer. See the sources for an interesting discussion on the ways and advantages/disadvantages of preallocation in Python.", 9825, "B5pN8kUuaa", 0],

	102797 : ["The previous answers are correct in their statements, yes all jet engines have spinning components.  But, I don't think that is what the original poster is asking.   When you view a jet engine from the front, you will not necessarily see all the vanes spinning.   A number of engine designs feature what are called inlet vanes and stator vanes.  These are stationary blades on the exterior or inside of the engine that don't spin, but guide the airflow into the rotating compressor or fan blades. These vanes are very prominent if you are sitting at the back of a DC-9 or MD-88 aircraft, where the engines are mounted on the fuselage right next to you.   In certain seats, if you look back into the engine it will look like the engine is not spinning at all.  The actual fan disk becomes a blur because it spins so fast, and the stationary inlet vanes are the only things you can see.  (see the linked photo). Also, in certain conditions on other jet engines, the spinning fan blades will become a blur, and you will only see the stationary stator blades inside the engine. So, to answer your question: yes, the turbines in all jet engines do spin.  But the vanes and stators within the engine do not, and can often be confused for the compressor blades themselves.", 9827, "mFtNSX02aa", -2],
	102798 : ["Let me guess, you look out the window and saw the vanes not turning?  They don't, they are called Fixed Stator Guide Vanes and smooth out the airflow, they aren't supposed to move at all. There are some internal to the engine that also perform this function that will change their angle relative the spinning blades called Variable Stator Guide Vanes, but you can't see them from outside.", 9827, "4bGQpFB3aa", 0],

	102803 : ["The amount of VRAM (3GB vs 2GB) really isn't a factor unless you're running multiple monitors.  For a single 1920x1080 monitor, there's no difference.  If you're running at extreme resolutions like 2560x1600 or dual 1080p screens. that's when 3GB would matter. On raw performance, it does depend upon the specific game titles you play.  Some titles are more optimized for AMD cards, others are more optimized for Nvidia cards- so you'll want to check benchmarks in the games you plan to play most often.   But the general performance breakdown is that the Radeon HD 7950 is slightly better than the GeForce GTX 660 Ti, especially at higher screen resolutions.  For example, notice the GTX 660 Ti performs better in BF3 at 1680x1050, but at 1920x1200 the HD 7950 takes the lead.  That's partially because the GTX 660 Ti only has a 192-bit memory interface compared to 256-bit for the HD 7950. The GTX 670 is a level above both of those cards, and a better choice for high-end gaming.  However, keep in mind that the recently released GTX 770 smokes the GTX 670 and was supposed to sell for roughly the same price.  If your budget and power supply allow, that's the bang/buck pick. Note that it's not a question of \"advanced PhysX\".  Only Nvidia cards have any hardware-level PhysX support.

The new Radeon HD 7870 LE (i.e. the 7930) beats the GTX 660 Ti, but that's a completely different card.", 9822, "2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa", 1],
