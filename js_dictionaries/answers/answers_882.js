Which camera are you planning to use and which lenses (brand, focal length). The only problem I had ever had in that regards was with an adapted (from M39 SLR mount) Mir Ib  on a Zenit 12 XP. But in general you should be good to go with a M42 to whatever you are using adapter. M42 is a SLR mount so the mirror was taken into consideration when building them. But without knowing what camera you to plan to use them lenses on it's hard to say. With Nikon F-mount cameras you'll need an adapter with a correction lens so you can a) mount it b) reach infinity focus this will degrade image quality. With Sony A mount, Canon EOS or Pentax K cameras you can use glassless adapters that don't degrade IQ. You will need the respective adapters which are available cheaply to be able to mount the lens to your camera.", 6919, "OPnjPaDKaa", 3],
