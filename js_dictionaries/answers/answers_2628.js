	137232 : ["Please, 'never', 'never', 'never' flick your ferret on the nose!  Ferret have very small bones in their nose and can be broken very eaisly!!  It also teaches the ferret to associate your hand with pain!!  It SO saddens me when I see this type of  advice given!!  Ferrets that bite can bite for many reasons, being abused,  fear, pain, fright or being startled.  I have  reformed abused, blood drawing ferrets with LOTS of love, attention, positive reinforcement  and handling!   Also, I would advise to 'never' use soft, rubber dog toys, ferrets can tear them up and injest the pieces causing life threatening intestinal blockages.    Here is some of the best advice I can offer you:  \"10 Helpful Hints To Stop Fear Biting By Bob Church   One of the worst problems to solve with ferrets is fear biting. Here are my top ten hints for retraining a fear-biting ferret.   1. Decrease the amount of stimuli that impacts the ferret. Move him  to a quiet corner in a quiet room, away from your child, cat, and even loud conversation. Build his confidence.   2. Increase the ferret's feeling of security, which can be done in two ways. You can cover the top, back, and sides of the cage with dark towels (or, if the ferrets tear at the towels, by duct taping cardboard over the cage). Also, place inside the cage a small box, large enough to hold the ferrets and bedding. By increasing the amount of darkness, decreasing the impact of outside movement, and providing a nest box, you will increase the ferrets' feeling of security. Put away those hammocks for now.   3. Use the \"open hand\" approach. Allow the ferret to approach you, rather than grabbing for her. When you pick her up, do not hold her, scruff her, or even retard her movements. This allows her to think contact is \"her own decision.\" Some people may disagree with this, but it works well for me.   4. Never punish with force. You might place the tip of your finger on his nose and say \"no!\", but do not thump, flick, scruff, or in any way use force to make your point. You are trying to re-teach the ferret not to bite, so dump violence as part of your lesson plan.   5. Never reward the ferret for biting. Many people reward ferrets for biting, usually by offering a treat to make them stop. The ferrets learn they can get a treat by biting you, and they learn it fast! I offer treats as I take biters from the cage, and after I place them back in, but not while I am retraining them. Later, after the biting stops, you can offer treats. Rather, I offer bits of food on an open palm; the same type that is regularly fed them. They may not eat it, but they start associating you with dinner.   6. Become the ferret's mother. If you really want a ferret to respond to you, groom it, especially around the eyes, mouth, and ears. When I do this, I try to mimic the soft chuckling sound by rapidly clicking my tongue to the roof of my mouth. It may not sound like a ferret, but it has a calming effect. If, when you are grooming, the ferret tries to bite, lightly scruff him for a short moment (like a real mother ferret would do), but continue the grooming.   7. When you are bitten, place the ferret back in the cage immediately! Ferrets really hate being confined, especially when they can see other ferrets having fun. No physical punishment, no treats, just back in the cage for 3 minutes or so, then let them back out. If they try to bite again, put them back in the cage for another 3 minutes. It won't take long for them to associate biting with confinement during play time.   8. Play with your ferrets. This is perhaps the most important thing you can do. Pick several times during the day that you know are free, and schedule ferret play at those times. You will find the ferrets will start changing their schedule to be awake then. Follow your schedule to the letter! If they bite too hard, hold a toy they can bite instead. Initiate play, rub them on the head and belly, tug their tail, and don't worry too much about being too rough. Do not postpone play, nor skip it!   9. Let them explore their environment before you start handling them. A ferret's first instinct is to explore her surroundings, so give her 10 minutes or so before you start interacting with her.   10. Assume you will be the target of those sharp little fangs. Resist the best you can jerking away (stimulates the clamping instinct), or trying to pry the ferret's mouth open (stimulates the fear response). Just place the ferret on the floor, and let him let go. Believe me, I know exactly how hard this can be! I once had a female fear biter macerate my thumb for more than 10 minutes! Some people try flooding the ferret's nose with water or various oils, but many times the ferret likes them, they drain off, or the ferret sees them as a treat. I have discovered a very effective material that is not generally seen as a treat -- Vaseline! I just smear a thick dab on the ferret's nose, and he lets go within a minute to lick it off so he can breathe. I have had 100% success with Vaseline, and keep an open container at-hand when dealing with biters. Another trick is to sprinkle a small amount [a few grains] of ground black pepper on the ferret's nose to make her sneeze. I don't like this one because of the danger of getting pepper into the eyes, but I know people who swear by it.   The point to all these hints is that a fear biter needs to trust you, and that takes time, patience, and the willingness to accept a bite or two. It is not easy, it is not without pain, but it is perhaps the most rewarding thing you will ever accomplish. Using these hints, I have made several fear biters into the most loving ferrets you would ever know.   One last comment. Ferrets are perceptive, intelligent animals, so there is a great deal of variation in their behavior. You may read of or hear other hints for dealing with fear-biting ferrets, and for individual ferrets, those hints might result in a better or faster outcome. Be flexible, and if one thing doesn't work, try something else. Don't get locked into one specific plan.   Bob Church has done extensive research on the habits, history, and physical makeup of ferrets and other mustelids while studying zoo-archeology. Bob always has a house full of ferrets and an endless supply of ideas on how to keep them happy and healthy.   This article originally appeared on the Ferret Mailing List (FML) on March 29, 2003.

Her blankets do get a little stinky, but they just need to be washed every once and awhile. Mine can go maybe 2 weeks beforeit's noticable. Maybe I just got lucky but her litterbox doesn't stink like some other people's do. And ferrets will not use the bathroom on you if they can help it.

To say that bettas cannot be placed with colourful, long-finned fish is a general guideline... Most bettas cannot be housed with male guppies due to their long, colourful fins, but some have had success keeping them together as well. The key to keeping a tankmate with your betta is to have an extra empty tank available for the tankmate, and to keep a very close eye on the two - not for killing per se, but even just aggression - as you really never know. Many keep bettas and ghost shrimp together with no problem. Your friend might have had a problem because the ghost shrimp was put in after the betta. Once the betta has established his territory in that set area, he might not like intruders. For this reason, many people put in the tankmates before buying the betta.", 11348, "TSgXRO82aa", 0],

Neon tetras are shoaling fish that needs around 5+ to feel protected. Ghost Shrimp are scavengers, and likely not eat your fish or try and hunt them down. They will eat dead fish, leftover food, and algae. The reason why your neon died, because a bowl is not a good home for the neon tetra. A bowl does not have enough room for a heater or a filter, and I doubt you have one installed. Also I'm guessing you didn't cycle the bowl and just dumped the fish and shrimp in? The fish might have died due to shock, neon/cardinal tetras have a specific disease that lowered their immune system and aren't as hardy as other fish. If you have another fish in there with the neons and tetras, my guess is a goldfish. Goldfish get around 6 inches, and should not live in a bowl but a 20 gallon tank. Your fish will likely die, and get eaten by the ghost shrimp. Best to do research before buying any pet. Little Laughter is a bit right and a bit sadistic.
