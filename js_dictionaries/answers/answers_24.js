Because you did not give an age, we can not give you a better answer. 3. Again, this will depend on the age of the patient, comorbidities, etc. Also, one blood pressure measure is NEVER enough. You usually need three different measurement on three different occasion. Patients tend to be anxious, nervous when they visit their doctor (look up \"white coat syndrome\") and this will raise their blood pressure. In fact we even take blood pressure reading 2 times during a check-up for this reason. As I have stated, treatment will depend on several blood pressure measurements, blood work to rule out secondary causes, comorbidities (ie. you don't want to give a beta blocker to someone with asthma, etc.). The treatment can range from not doing anything and just monitoring the patient to lifestyle changes such as decrease salt intake and exercise to one or more drugs.", 212, "pHOQ8qANaa", 0],

After the 2nd shot my arm was swollen, I experienced nausea, a headache, and a 100 degree fever. The nausea, headache and fever were gone 24 hours after the shot. The arm swelling subsided 3-4 days afterward. It's a sign that my immune system is working. There has been a lot of misinformation and paranoia surrounding the mRNA vaccines. One of the conspiracy theories is that it alters your DNA. That couldn't be further from the truth. Actually, unlike other vaccines the mRNA vaccines never breach the nucleus of your cell. They are delivered to the cytoplasm. So that conspiracy theory just is not true. Could the government put something in the vaccines to sterilize the population or something else bizarre? Perhaps some malevolent actor could do that. Maybe. It would be hard to keep it a secret though with so many scientists working on the vaccine. But they could also do that with any shot you ever get including your yearly flu shots if you think about it. Why just choose this one? The truth I think is the government wants to get people vaccinated so the older folks with money feel safe enough to emerge from their homes and spend again. That will propel the economy better than any stimulus ever could. And major pharma companies like Pfizer that have been hit pretty hard in the press over drug pricing want to come out of this looking good.
