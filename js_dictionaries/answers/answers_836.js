Who remembers the plinko board, where there would be a constant line of Big Macs or Quarterpounders coming down a slide like a manned vending machine? Standard practice now is to only keep a few ready and a few resting, more or less, made-to-order. And aside from longer waits, it forces the store to hand out undercooked foods, causing illness frequently. Somewhere in the mid 2000s the \"have it your way\" prompt swept over the fast food market, mistaking what it really is, fast food. It was a slightly nicer gas station heat lamp burger you grab and go, the original ready-meal. But to reach the rest of the market, which we'll admit worked for them overall, compared to being a small, regional drive in to global economic superpower. But still, stoned on a road trip at 3am, nobody wants to wait 15 mins for a made to order frozen heat lamp burger. ", 6616, "u1thfT1aaa", 3],
