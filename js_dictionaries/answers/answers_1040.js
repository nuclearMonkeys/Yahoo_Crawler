	57486 : ["A strong argument for out-of-body experience can be made using scientific evidence.  A difference between pseudoscience and real science is that real science makes predictions, and van Lommel's 2001 article in The Lancet does that. The Lancet is one of the world's most influential medical journals. If you know nothing about a patient who has just survived cardiac arrest except whether or not the patient has had an NDE, you can make an educated guess about the patient's survival over a 30-day interval, and the chance of this being a lucky guess is less than 1 in 10,000. Physicians who have written about the research include Fenwick, Parnia, and van Lommel. Skeptics typically argue that NDE can be explained by pathology of the brain, e.g., lack of oxygen. However, the NDE can occur when a person is simply in a life-threatening condition and there is no brain pathology. The expression \"I saw my life flash before my eyes\" was a cliche long before the first NDE studies. Van Lommel has said that the question of whether or not it's possible for a person to have a dim consciousness while the brain is in a \"flat-line\" state - no electrical activity - is irrelevant, because survivors report NDE events indicating a high level of consciousness, with detailed memories. There are numerous stories of patients reporting that they saw things in the hospital room or outside the room when they logically should have been unconscious, with verification of these stories. Ring and Cooper studied NDE stories told by blind people, including a few who reportedly were blind from birth and saw for the first time during their NDEs (video, below).", 7962, "oc4ZyRBLaa", 2],

	57511 : ["Your view depends upon where in the UK you live.  In London in midwinter, sunset is no earlier than just before 4pm with sunrise at just after 8am.  Those times change to about 3:40pm and 8:40am if you're located in Edinburgh or Glasgow.  I've therefore got no idea where you got 2pm sunset from.  Even in Reyjkavik in Iceland those times are 3:30pm and 11:40am and that's *much* further North. They stick to GMT all year round. So in the worst case in the most populated northerly part of the UK, you just shift those winter hours to a 4:40pm sunset and a 9:40am sunrise on December 2nd. The population north of that point dwindles to insignificance compared to the rest of the UK: a few hundred thousand in an area with sod all traffic, compared to a total of about 67 million in the rest of the UK. It would be lighter for longer in the afternoons, but wouldn't be fully light until about 10am in midwinter. Fewer accidents in the afternoon, but more on cold icy mornings, especially so if you're in southern Scotland. When the UK last experimented with sticking to BST all year round from 27th October 1968 to 31st October 1971 it was very unpopular with farmers across the UK and there was insufficient support from the public and industry to continue with it so Parliament voted to resume the former GMT and BST system.  There's also been supporters arguing that the entire UK moves to a clumsily named Single/Double Summer Time (SDST). It's identical to CET (Central European Time) so I've never understood the clumsy nomenclature. In midsummer that would make dawn occur at a ridiculously early time all over the UK and would harm the evening economy by making sunset an hour earlier. Had the UK stayed in the EU then we may have come under pressure to change to CET. Now that we're independent again that's highly unlikely; the most that supporters of clock changes can hope for is another repeat of the experiment of ‘68 to ‘71 using modern data analysis methods as those used back then were demonstrated to be deeply flawed. Most of the benefits attributed to the original experiment were wiped out when the data was reviewed and revised in 1989. My personal preference is to maintain the status quo. Although I'd still support another experiment to remain on BST if only to settle the argument one way or the other. Note that during WW2 the UK shifted to move the clock forward by 2 hours all year around; that was done to maximise the agricultural and manufacturing benefits of “wasted” morning sunlight during Summer, but also to make blackout occur 2 hours earlier so that German bombers were less likely to make raids in the late evenings and overnight when navigation and accurate bombing was more difficult. It also meant the UK needed far less electricity for lighting; there was no meaningful after dark leisure industry at the time so the much earlier sunsets did not cause economic harm.", 7973, "None", 2],
