	89319 : ["it is racist and this is why: \"The effort is sponsored by Georgia Right to Life, which also is pushing legislation that aims to ban abortions based on race.\" now what the heck is that? lets take a step backward and start taking rights away from blacks again. i hope this gets the attention of everyone, i hope they see it as it is.  next it will be hispanics cannot work in pharmacies because they are the \"most likely to use drugs\"  or asian american's cannot adopt pets because they are \"more likely\" to eat cats and dogs. does anyone see the racism in that? i don't believe any of the above things, but racism is a slippery slope and we start taking rights away from one group and it will become the most absurd things for every group. abortion is a moral decision. the majority of people that don't believe in abortion are christians and it is their faith that makes them so against it. so with that logic should we ban pork because the Jewish folks (and a few other religions like Seventh Day Adventists) don't agree with it? should we ban all hunting because Peta members are against it? where does it stop? where do we draw the line when it comes to imposing one groups beliefs on everyone else? it is racism. and i am a christian, but i am also pro-choice. i have been raped and the prospect of possible pregnancy is like being victimized all over again. while i would have not then nor now for any reason get an abortion i sure as heck am not going to point any fingers at a woman who could not carry that child in her body. sorry.. had to say it all.. anyways, does planned parenthood target black neighborhoods... i think that planned parenthood is a resource for low income people and people who are in need of a little sex ed in terms of prevention and safety. if this community happens to be black then fine. that is not racism. planned parenthood is where you can also get proper birth control to avoid these abortions. that is the solution, the solution is not making black women feel guilty like they are dying out because they have had an abortion. there are many reasons why abortion is the answer for any one individual. we cannot judge that, but we can educate folks of every ethnicity about prevention and make that prevention available to everyone.", 9323, "IP59OP4Kaa", 1],

	89328 : ["Hi there. I am from Georgia, myself, actually. I haven't seen any of these billboards, but it wouldn't surprise me if they do indeed exist.  I am a cynical person, so it may very well be that these billboards are racist. Just last week, MARTA, our local transit authority, had elected to call one of their train routes to a city called Doraville the \"yellow line.\" A lot of people got angry in the Asian community. MARTA didn't mean to offend people, they were using primary colors, and it just so happened that Doraville was chosen to have the \"yellow\" name. There is a large Asian community in Doraville, which is a suburb of Atlanta. The reality is that there is still racism here in Georgia. It is always getting better, but some people are still ignorant. I don't like admitting these things, but it's just the ugly truth. I personally love African Americans and all other races, and I consider Martin Luther King Jr. to be a hero of mine. But not everyone shares my point of view.  It could be that those billboards are making a racist statement, or it may not have been intentional. It is difficult to say for certain.", 9323, "8Jxg5Aq0aa", 2],
