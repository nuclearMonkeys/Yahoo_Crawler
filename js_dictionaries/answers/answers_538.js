All you can do is try to be a friend and good listener if he allows it and pray he finds more reasons to live than die. Sounds like he lonely maybe even depressed.  Does his parents know his intentions? Maybe you could discreetly some how if interested or if possible speak with them on what you know and at least your conscience is clear no matter what happens. Unfortunately we can't read minds or hearts only God can hope he finds someone who loves and Cherish's him and gives him a reason to want to live and he can find a way to love himself more. ", 4631, "WxyNu3K8aa", 2],

	29913 : ["For a very shy person, making friends is hard in any situation.  However, once a young person leaves home they are then spending much time with different people, many of whom they never knew at all before. That is an advantage because those new people in your life don't know anything about you and whole new relationships can be formed from meeting these new people.  If you were still surrounded with the people you'd known before they'd probably treat you as they did before and you'd feel inhibited but, once amongst new faces, you can be a new you.  They have no knowledge of you, nothing to judge you by and if you can relax and try to be natural you'll meet new people and find some who share your idea, hobbies, choices etc.  Try to disguise your shyness and it will become less of a problem as time goes on. I know all this because I was once painfully shy.  Moving away from home helped me make those changes.", 4632, "None", 1],
	29914 : ["ALWAYS in this discussion should mean exactly what it usually means - which is ALWAYS, ANY TIME.  Don't ever use that word if you don't really mean it because someone will take you up on that offer one day.  Always is a word which many people use too frequently and too flippantly just to give the impressions they care - when, quite often, they don't.", 4633, "Tf7eaIpuaa", 0],

	29916 : ["If you don't know her well enough to know the answer to this, perhaps you're proposing too soon.     Prior to agreeing to marry, most couples have extensively discussed it including budget, priorities, preferences, etc.  That being said, if you were expected to wear something every day for the rest of your life, wouldn't you want a say?   Or at least be asked if you want a say or want to be surprised? It sounds like you're a bit hung up on all of this being a surprise.   It shouldn't be.   The proposal shouldn't be a surprise either if you've truly discussed marriage enough to determine that you're compatible.    Sure, the exact date, time, place of proposal may be a surprise, but the fact that you've decided you'd like to marry her shouldn't be.   In fact, many couples don't even have a formal proposal anymore.   They simply agree to get married and get on with it.", 4624, "None", 0],
	29927 : ["I'm not trying to pick a fight but I think you're going about your plans backwards. If you start with \"I have this vision of what I want it to be and now I have to create that vision\" then you're making life hard for yourself. Instead, start with \"This is what I have readily available to work with; how can I best use it?\" If foliage and greenery are looking costly and troublesome, then maybe ribbons and beads?

And honestly it's not that big of a deal you're making it out to be.  I was a virgin when I started dating my significant other. 5 years later and I'm still with them. Not a virgin anymore obviously. So are you willing to stay with someone for so long without any type of intimacy ever? Better yet, will he? Say, 5 years? Or just kissing? How will the relationship, intimacy, closeness, understanding ever progress?? also, just because you are in a long term relationship, doesn't guarantee marriage. so what, you'll be a virgin until you're 40? some people don't get married until their mid 30's. AND what if you divorce a few years later after marriage? what will you do then? will your sex after marriage still matter? people who wait for sex until marriage mentally stunt their brain growth. they don't ever think about these things either. they put so much on the line for a thin membrane covering the vagina....", 4622, "None", 0],

	29932 : ["You invite more conversation when you answer with a question. Next time just say, \"Cool. Getting ready to eat dinner, see you tomorrow\". Shutting this person down before they can get started will be key in dissuading them from messaging you so much. ", 4634, "J3axFJ2Saa", 1],
	29933 : ["To be loved and thought of is priceless especially by anyone who isn't a fleshy family member it's just a kind friendly gesture to acknowledge your existence and him knowing you workmates at least appreciate it and if you're to busy to respond at that time or don't want to talk just simply say hi etc and explain to him it's nothing personal with him if it's not and pray you haven't lost a good friend.

	29936 : ["Ask yourself WHY wearing white is important to you. WHAT does white symbolize to you -- or do you think it symbolizes to others?  Are those simply traditions or childish/childhood expectations or are they actually important to a 28-year-old, modern woman in 2021?  Either take time to grieve the loss of those dreams and or take a rational approach -- the color of the dress doesn't \"mean\" anything anymore.

	29937 : ["After you're married, you will soon realize how utterly unimportant the wedding ceremony, what anybody wore, the food at the reception, and all that are in the greater scheme of your lives together. If you feel pretty in that dress, wear it. Feeling pretty is nine tenths of *being* pretty, after all. Don't worry, you're going to be the bride in everyone's eyes, including your own. Congratulations to you both, and we wish you many happy years together. My mom got married during WWII, in a navy blue suit, with lines drawn in eyebrow pencil up the back of her legs by her sister because she couldn't get stockings. They were married until my dad died.

	29939 : ["If the engagement has been so brief or so frivolous that spending/saving decisions aren't naturally and easily made together then the engagement has been too brief and it's way too early for wedding planning. Do your MARRIAGE planning first.", 4623, "iz1cNz5Laa", -1],

You should have equal access to the account. Since you were unemployed, did you do things around the house? (Usually back in the day, wives stayed home and took care of things in the house while the husbands work...things changed obviously, but I just brought this up since you were in the same situation). If you didn't, then I can see why there's a huge issue. If you did, yet he still doesn't give you access to the bank then there's something wrong with him. Whatever it is, you guys really need to work it out. Go to marriage counseling. COMPROMISE. The more one of you argues, the other will pushes and it'll be a big petty mess.

	29952 : ["Hydrogen peroxide H2O2   kills nanoworms inside facemasks. The elite is faking that they took the real vaccine; the real vaccine will cause spiritual and physical damage. When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 4636, "None", 0],
