The JOB of the AP is to find the truth in reporting. James Frey, someone that no one cares about, was hammered in the media for passing off his mostly fiction \"A Million Little Pieces\" as a memoir. That kind of thing is much more dangerous when it comes from a woman who nearly became Vice President and continues to spout total nonsense (death panels, etc.) as a 'spokesperson' for one of the two major political parties in the United States. I don't get why so many people are SO SHOCKED that her 'facts' are being checked. \"Going Rogue\" is not a run-of-the-mill personal memoir by some random author. It's a political STANCE by a (*cringe*) actual politician that the majority of Americans realize is a fraud.

	83643 : ["I Love Physics. Great questions, but my answer is only a guess. Since we are beyond nature, some of our attributes may well be beyond nature as well. If you ever watched Star Trek TNG, there was an episiode where all of time was changed, but one of the people one board (played by Whoopi Goldberg) sensed that time had changed, and then everyone had to try and change things back again. Well, maybe we're that way.  Maybe our free will is beyond time and even time altering.  Therefore, whereas everything else is set, we can cause it to change, thus, changing the stone. It's all speculation, but since time is not absolute, and we have a nature beyond nature (you have to consider that part of us is beyond physical, ie made by God), there are some possibilities of some pretty strange things happening. For those of you that say time can't be changed, how do you know it already hasn't?  If  history is being changed right now, all of the history books would have been changes as well as all of our learning.   Maybe we would know if our memories were altered.  Maybe our dreams would tell us something different. Cool Weird stuff! .", 9141, "None", 0],
	83644 : ["Your statement suggests that time exists at one point and only one point: now. However, this is not a statement about the actions taken in time (present or future), only about the occurrence of time itself. This statement also cannot say whether or not the future, although set to occur, actually exists before it occurs. Thus, one could argue that future does not exist. In doing so they set a foundation to say that God does not have to know the future in order to maintain omniscience. God knows all of time without knowing the future because it does not exist for God to know it. Thus, God can maintain God's all knowing quality and humanity can maintain their free will without giving up either and without violating special relativity.

	83648 : ["Things might change this century but for most current people homosexuality is still very much an unknown quantity. People's ideas are fed by what they see in the media. And the media being what they are tend to focus on the more dramatic side of things. So, the main ideas that are communicated to the general public is are that: 1 - Homosexuality means making a spectacle of yourself 2 - Homosexuality means being camp 3 - Homosexuality can get you assaulted or murdered. It is a fact that people who are homophobic but know a gay person (but don't know that they are actually gay) tend to like them. When they are told that the person is gay the reaction is often \"I don't like gays but this one is different\". So the negative image of gays is linked to the concept rather than the person. You then have a second category of people who are those who feel threatened by gay-ness. Some may have had bad experiences (e.g. I knew someone whose brother had been gang-raped and there is nothing you could do to make him less homophobic) but I would like to think this is a minute minority. Some of these homophobic people also feel that the only way they can survive is by showing some aggressivity (a very primal thing) and gays are an easy target. It is interesting to see that homophobia is most rampant in people with a lower social status and that more educated people tend to be more tolerant. This concurs with the survival theme in that people with lower social status need to find some way to stand out. Being aggressive is usually a good way to get noticed. Others are homophobic because they are in fact repressed gays. They feel threatened to see other gays because subconsciously it reminds them of what they are fighting hard not to be. Based on this, it is difficult to see how things can change. Generally though, as more people come out and the public is more exposed to gays, people will know that we are just normal people and society will play a role in softening the perceptions. It is quite telling that in the 18th century,being gay or bi was quite common in the aristocracy and it was accepted. It is only victorian values which have clamped down on all this.
