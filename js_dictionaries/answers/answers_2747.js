	143202 : ["I don't agree with that diet. I keep thin with a \"lifestyle\", not a diet because Atkins is something you can't do forever. The main things I do are just a piece of fruit in the morning and a big glass of water before each meal so I feel full before I eat. I keep lean muscle by getting enough protein. (At least 30 grams per day for girls). Do at least 30 min per day of some kind of exercise even if it's walking.", 11573, "None", 1],
	143203 : ["I have done it a few times.    I use it to kick start a diet rather than a long term dieting solution. It does work but it gets very very difficult to stay on beyond a few weeks.   If recommend the South Beach induction phase rather than Atkins.  They are nearly identical but South Beach is more restrictive in regard to saturated fats.

	143204 : ["Please don't start the Atkins Diet!!! I'm a vegetarian, so I have never tried it, but a friedn of mine has and because you're not eating certain types of food, once you start eating normally again, the weight just comes back on.

	143205 : ["No. You are under NO obligation to feed or tip these people. It is nice to offer them a drink since they are working hard. However, most people manage to bring their own lunch to the job and do not expect their clients to feed them.  You are paying this company for a service. You do not need to tip them. If these people feel they are not making enough money, that is between them and their employer; it is not your problem.  More to the point, what is wrong in our society where everyone feels they deserve a tip? What happened to simply doing your job well?  Good move on you for NOT tipping!!", 11571, "AA11481165", 1],
	143206 : ["Sounds like Budget Movers or Starving Students. Real movers would not ask or expect a \"tip\" however they may ask for water or something to keep hydrated. Good movers usually keep to themselves and bank on you tipping them for their good service and making your transition a pleasant experience. A nice tip, if you can't afford it is a simple call to the main office and praise them for their good work and pleasant attitude. On the other hand you should call the office and report your disappointment on poor service and rude suggestions. I put myself through school by moving furniture with great crews and we were tipped, fed and asked to bar-b-ques afterward too! BUT!, we NEVER asked for anything.

	143207 : ["sounds like you need to connect with the moving company, and have that kid fired for asking for food. If they do a good, prompt job, tipping is acceptable, but not a prerequisite. However expecting you to feed them, is unquestionable, and offering anything more than water or coffee is above the call of decency. Next time pay for a reputable company, or get your family and friends to move you.", 11571, "None", 0],

	143209 : ["Your right about Buffett, but do you understand that he had nothing to do with the GM purchase other than hiring someone who decided to purchase it? Berkshire is a $200billion company. If Buffett buys a stock you will see the value in the billions.  Buffett recently hired 2 people to invest smaller portions, and GM was very likely purchased by one of those. Unlike the bank bailouts, the GM bailout was done at the expense of bondholders, stockholders, and most likely taxpayers.  Many billions in debt was wiped off their balance sheet.  That doesn't say anything good about the bailout.  It would be amazing for them NOT to survive, given the way the bankruptcy was structured.", 11575, "VoGGYSSQaa", 0],

Regarding her comments/ behavior. Biologically, she may be the victim of hormones. If she could graduate from med school, though, surely she's smart enough to control her biological urges with her intellect. Your husband and his colleague are behaving inappropriately.

	143213 : ["Obama came across looking presidential and McCain as angry and petulant. The polls reflect this. Agreeing with someone is fine. I have a lot of friends with whom I share common ground on certain issues, and other issues we know to not discuss.  McCain lost. You admit you are young. Keep this in mind: in politics, perception by the voters trumps clever or angry answers by the candidates. The voters' perceived Obama as the winner.  Perception is everything. That's how Bush was able to overcome his many flaws, by having people perceive him as a likeable guy who wouldn't mess things up more. Oops.", 11572, "None", 2],
	143214 : ["Alabama? Arkansas? Red states? Think about it. Several of the rest are ag states with many corporate farms the size of IBM sucking down hundreds of billions a year. That's welfare, too, which most people I know oppose. People, I said. Not politicians who live well on \"contributions\" for routing the big bucks in that direction. And do Repubs, only, get it?

The fact that they asked you for a tip, and tried to make you feel guilty for them doing the job they are paid to do warrants a call to the management or owner.

	143223 : ["I am struggling with this one. Yes, you are supposed to tip movers, so part the part of me raised to be painstakingly polite wants to say \"yes, you should have tipped them!\" HOWEVER, to remind you that they take tips and to ASK you for food is so far out of line that I understand why you didn't. I guess I was lucky when we moved into our house, because we absolutely loved our movers, because they went out of their way to make things easy on us. Since we were the last move of the day for them, and because someone had brought us a ton of food and beer to the new house, we offered our movers a sandwich and a cold beer.  If I were in your shoes, though - I probably would have tipped - the bare minimum, and then called the moving company to complain.", 11571, "AA12358335", -1],

And he is quick to use that \"what Barack doesn't understand\"crap which pisses me off. He's just like a broken record. The only experience I see McCain has is with that whole war business. When the war is done; hopefully what will he be doing then? Obama has way better plans for the economy. I definitely don't see McCain helping the little ppl of the US.

Probably when you started eating so much fatty foods (more than usual), that is what triggered you to realize you were having gallbladder trouble (the pains you felt for a year).  Fatty food will aggrivate a problem that is already there.  It is pretty common for someone to have to have their gallbladder removed, and a huge sign that it isn't working well is when you have pain after eating anything that is high in fat.
