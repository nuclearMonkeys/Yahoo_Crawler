	7256 : ["People tend to be tall if their ancestors evolved in a warm climate because surface area increases when an object is elongated. That is the reason East Africans (which live in a warmer region) tend to be taller than pygmy Africans who live in or near forests (a cooler region). More surface area makes losing excess body heat easier, and a taller person therefore can more easily avoid heat stroke. However, despite genes that make them taller, they can still be short if they don't have enough to eat during the growth years.¬† Polynesians are a mix of the northern Chinese (who invented agriculture and experienced population explosion and then migrated south to SE Asia) and the dark skinned curly haired original migrants out of Africa 60,000 years ago who settled in the warm climate of SE Asia. Therefore they should be intermediate in height since the northern Chinese evolved in the ice age climate and tended to be shorter.¬† The tallest humans are Scandinavians (also some Russians) and their close relatives from the Balkan region, known generally as the Germanic tribe.¬† Europeans evolved from Central Asians who came originally from Africa 60,000 years ago. Europeans therefore tend to be cold adapted and they tend to be short.¬† However, 20,000 years ago, the ice age reached its maximum and many Europeans migrated out of northern Europe and settled in places like the Balkans and the Caucasus region. These Europeans therefore evolved to be taller since they lived in a warmer climate than their European ancestors. When the ice age ended 13,000 years ago, Scandinavia became ice free and many Balkans migrated to Germany, Scandinavia and Russia. Another wave of migration happened when people from the Caucasus migrated to Britain, Ireland, France and Spain and became the Western Europeans.Germanic people tend to be taller than Western Europeans. Because Germanic people tend to live in wealthy countries, they can eat enough as children to reach their full potential in height. Hence they tend to be among the tallest people in the world, along with many Balkans. East Africans who grow up with enough to eat can also reach their maximum height potential. Manute Bol, an East African, for example, is over 7 ft. tall. South Koreans average a lot taller than North Koreans, and Chinese folks who live in Beijing are much taller than the nation wide average for China, because of better nutrition not because they have genes that make them taller.¬† BTW, regardless of country of origin, a tall person tends to have a shorter life span than a short person, probably because they lose body heat more easily and they have higher metabolic rates to replace the lost heat and their hearts have to work harder to pump warm blood to all parts of the body to keep them warm.¬†", 1156, "None", 0],

	7264 : ["Different populations are adapted to different local environments. Adaptation for one environment makes one less well adapted to another environment. For example, adaptations to a hot environment means that one can more easily die of hypothermia. Adaptation to cold climate makes one more susceptible to skin cancer and to heat strokes. Adaptation to some environments make one stronger, but a more muscular person is not as good a long distance runner. How many weight lifters run the marathon, for example. Most marathon runners are skinny. Most sprinters are muscular. Is a long distance runner or a sprinter \"superior?\"¬† Some populations of humans have larger brains but they may not be as strong physically or as skilled athletically. Is a bookworm superior or a star athlete superior? Is Albert Einstein better than Michael Jordan or is it vice versa?¬† Is Michael Jordan better or is Pele better? Jordan won 6 NBA titles but Pele won 3 World Cup soccer titles.¬† Therefore it is not possible to say which race is superior because there is no objective standard of what is good vs. what is bad.¬† One may think that being tall is superior, but scientific studies show that tall people live about 10 years less than short people, regardless of which country one is from. So, is it better to live longer or is it better to be taller? Who decides what is superior and what is inferior? In fact, because there is no objective standard, a man can say he is superior to another, stronger man because he is smarter, but then he can claim that he is superior to a woman who is smarter than he is by saying that he is stronger. Biologists point out that there is no single gene or trait that is universally superior or fittest Because of that we cannot point to any human population and say that it is the most superior.", 1160, "None", 0],
	7265 : ["there are at least 6 species of human", 1154, "None", 1],
	7266 : ["It is not really weird. As little as 40,000 years ago, there were at least 2 different species of humans, and before that the situation was similar. The reason many species can coexist in nature is because they all have different niches, or ways of making a living.¬† If two species with the same niche were to meet in nature, they will either evolve to be different (niche differentiation) so they no longer compete, or else one of the two species may become extinct (competitive exclusion). If they live in different areas and never meet then they do not compete and can coexist even if they occupy identical niches.¬† If you look at wild cats for example, we have many species living in, say, Africa, but they are very different in terms of niches. Lions and cheetahs for example have very different hunting strategies. Other cats are much smaller and they also eat different things and hunt differently than the big ones. OTOH, the same kind of cat can live in 2 different areas and they can coexist since they do not meet. If you look at great apes, there is only a single species in Asia, the orangutan. In Africa, we have 2 species of great apes, the gorilla and the chimp. The chimp occupies a different niche as the gorilla, as it will hunt monkeys for food. This is niche differentiation since the gorilla is not known to eat meat. They coexist because of niche differentiation and because they also do not live in the same area. The gorilla will physically muscle chimps out of their territory. The bonobo is very similar to the chimp but it lives alone in a small area where gorillas and chimps are not found. Therefore the bonobo can exist since it does not have to compete against the other apes in that small area they are found. There were Neanderthals in Europe and West Asia and there were H. erectus or archaic humans in SE Asia, coexisting with modern humans in Africa, even though they have the same niche as us modern humans, by occupying areas where modern humans did not yet exist. Unfortunately for them, when modern humans left Africa 60,000 years ago, we came into contact with them, and we drove these 2 other species to extinction by outcompeting them. Neither modern humans nor Neanderthals evolved to avoid competition with one another, and in fact, there is fossil evidence that modern humans threw spears at Neanderthals and killed them. So it is not weird that there is only 1 species of human, because we expanded our range from Africa to most places on earth and exterminated the other species through competition. There is only 1 species of humans left because of the well known ecological principle known as competitive exclusion.", 1154, "None", 0],
