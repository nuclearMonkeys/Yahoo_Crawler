To deny the real presence of Christ's body and blood it to deny and mock Scripture.  It also denies the greatest gift that our Lord has given us short of eternal life. The words of our Lord in Latin are \"Hoc est corpus Meum\" (this is my body).  The followers of Zwingli and Calvin bastardized this phrase as \"Hoccus Poccus\" to mock the Biblical doctrine of the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Lutheran Church.

Why do they believe that \"This is My Body\" is just a figurative fable but \"The Father and I are One\" and \"The Word was God\" are not?

	83366 : ["If you think that is possible then how can you call America racist?   He could have  become president, because America isn't racist.

	83367 : ["I will never understand the arguement that if you don't agree w/ an Obama presidency, then you must be a racist.  It has been written on Yahoo Answers many times. If Senator Obama wins, I am not \"scared\" because of the color of his skin, his ethinicity or lack of ethinicity.  What I am is saddened by the fact that a person can become president w/ little experience, a few pretty speeches and a big  star studded fan base. Additionally, I am saddened by the fact that are so many people who can't think for themselves. I have heard and read more garbage about all 3/of the leading candidates in both parties. It is all probably somewhere in the middle. None of them are perfect - they are people who are politicians. They want your vote.", 9129, "None", 5],
	83368 : ["These people are too much.  Some white people are going crazy because they say that Obama hates white people (which is stupid, since he's half white and was raised by white people).  They can't decide whether he's a Muslim, or a member of a cult, or an America-hater, or a foreigner.  The level of sheer ignorance and stupidity that go along with some of the questions and answers I've seen here just boggle the mind.  The notion that he should resign, when he's winning the nomination race, because of something his retired pastor said is ... have I used dumb already?  It's dumb. Some black people say that Obama isn't black enough, for some of the same silly reasons.  So we have the whites saying he's too black, and the blacks saying he's not black enough.   Why is this happening?  Because we're simpletons.  Obama is a brilliant man, an educated man, and he's able to see the world as it is: in shades of gray.  But the population as a whole can only understand things if they can fit them into pre-conceived categories.  Obama doesn't fit neatly into those categories, so people freak out and don't know how to handle it.  They're certainly not handling it by listening and educating themselves.  This is why we see the same questions based on bad information again and again, and why people still think Obama is a socialist (I wish) and a secret Muslim, whatever that means.  Obama came right out and gave us a principled explanation of why he won't leave his church, even though he disagreed with his pastor, but we still have someone in this Q telling us that Obama \"folds like a cheap suit\" when the going gets tough.  Are you not even paying attention? The conversations I hear and read about Obama make me really sad.  My European friends think that America is basically too stupid to survive, that Americans are too disinterested in actually learning about the world around them, and this nonsense proves the point.  I'm not scared of Obama - he's a neat guy, and we'd do well to have him as president.  I'm scared of us.", 9129, "None", -3],

	83398 : ["Debra, You're right... scripture tells us in many places that this IS the body and the blood.  Never does it say this symbolizes the body and blood.  Many of his disciples actually left because of this.  All of the other changes in Jewish law they were fine with, but this was the one that they could not get past. So, in answer to your questions, yes, I do believe in the true presence in, with, and through the bread and the wine.   The Eucharist is one of the places that I can find Christ fully present.", 9127, "3WYcPsm4aa", 9],
	83399 : ["Catholics see the Scriptures written about the Eucharist as literal teaching by Jesus and have interpreted Jesus' words as literal since before the NT Scriptures were written as recorded in Scripture. Catholics find no reason to interpret Jesus' teaching to be anything but literal from a hermeneutical, historical or theological perspective. Some Protestants, on the other hand, are very much like the proto-Protestants who were former disciples and left Jesus after His teaching in John 6, about the commandment to eat His Body and drink His Blood. They remain in the carnal sense and deny the miracle of the Eucharist. They believe that instead of being present at the one sacrifice of Christ, that what Jesus instituted is a symbolic ordinance instead. So, what we are speaking of is two totally different practices. The first identical to what the apostles taught and put into practice which is the real presence and the second a modernist interpretation of a man Ulrich Zwingli which is a symbolic ordinance. The first is actually Christ on the Cross where the worshippers are at the foot of the cross; the second is just a remembering of what Christ did as recorded in the Bible. When a Catholic Christian remembers Christ's sacrifice it is from being there, when a Protestant remembers Christ's sacrifice it is recalling what is written in Scriptures about the event. Certainly, one should be able to understand the level of passion one would have after being at the foot of the cross compared to the level of one just remembering what is written in a book. So even though some do not take it lightly, even though they do not believe, it cannot be the same passion for an exercise or ordinance in supposed obedience, as the Protestant act can be described; to the Catholic practice of being present with the living corporeal Christ at the cross and eating His real body and Blood as He commanded. It must be noted for understanding that for many of the Reformers that this approach by Zwingli was necessary to give some credibility to the new Protestant movement which denied the successive apostolic leadership of the Church established by Christ. These reformers knew full well that they had no true legitimacy and no authority from Christ. They also knew that without a legitimate episcopacy that they could not continue Holy Orders, the Sacraments nor do they have the authority to confect the Eucharist which authority can only be given by Christ through the Church. Therefore, they could not continue the Eucharist even if they desired without a valid priesthood. So, I am not saying that I do not believe that Protestant communion service is not special or a sign of unity but it is to me a sign of unity for a false, heretical belief outside of historical, Traditional and orthodox Christianity and is a doctrine of men warned about in the Gospels. (Mat 15:7 DRB) Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:(Mat 15:8 DRB) This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.(Mat 15:9 DRB) And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men. (Mar 7:5 DRB) And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands? (Mar 7:6 DRB) But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. (Mar 7:7 DRB) And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men. (Mar 7:8 DRB) For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.(Mar 7:9 DRB) And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition. (Luk 6:46 DRB) And why call you me, Lord, Lord; and do not the things which I say? In Christ Fr. Joseph", 9127, "FGcwxZz0aa", 13],
