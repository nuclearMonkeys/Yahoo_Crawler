The big difference between a goat and a potato is that the goat has a central nervous system and a brain that is not actually that different from ours.

	74114 : ["Hi :-) May I relate something about this please.. When you don't like it, i will delete it. With all due respect, as far as I know (from Mahabrata - Indonesia version), 1. Khrisna, Rama, Arjun, etc did eat meat. 2. The teaching about being vegetarian, come later after the teaching about reincarnation. It means, don't eat meat because it could be a reincarnation of someone. 3. Human have both enzym to digest plant and meat, and we have canine teeth (for cutting) 4. There is a way to kill an animal with minimal pain. This is also practiced by the nature (carnivore). 5. God has submitted the plant and animal kingdom, and the sea and the river to the good of humankind.

	74120 : ["In one sentence, the animals and plants are 'saturation for each other'.  Animals' excreta is the food of plants and vice verssa Animals' expiration is the inspiration of plants and vice versa. When animals eat the plants, the plants are satisfied and their goal is achieved. Unless there are plants, human community (animal community) would not exist for long.   Environmentalists also reminds it to the developed cities.   Once the Jain religion had such a feeling about the plants and grass.

	74121 : ["i'd like to add my points. a fruit becomes ripe and if not eaten it becomes rotten. nature has made mechanisms for plants to be eaten before they perish. a goat would not perish if left without being eaten.a goat never approaches a man to eat it, the way a fruit does. speaking scientifically, a non-veg diet takes very long to digest and it lets a lot of fat accumulate in the body. when you eat non-veg, your ecological footprint increases.  if you compare the landmass required to raise an animal rather than a plant, you will find that a plant requires less space to grow and its animal equivalent in terms of energy requires more space. if you know the 10 % rule whatever a person eats only 10 % of that energy is transferred to the organism who eats himm. means at every level in a food chain the energy is reduced. so  according to the above rule in orger to get 10 joules of energy we have to feed animals 100 joules of eneergy producing plants. this puts presure on earth's resources. according to a website, i browsed, if only 10 % of the meat eating population turns vegetarian, the crops that are grown to feed animals to be killed, th resouces to grow them can be used to feed millions of hungry people all over the world. do you agree? jai shri krishna", 8760, "IhaLh2rXaa", 3],

	74129 : ["J.C. Bose showed that plants too have feelings.They may not be able to express but when you approach a plant to pluck or to do harm,the plant shows shivering or shaking. There are plants that are with out seeds and fruits but grow vegetatively. Another point is ,man by nature has a herbivorous digestive tract of about 23 ft long which is charetereristic of all herbivorous animals. All carnivorus animals have shorter al tract and cannot digest plant food.So by nature we are herbivores and later tranformed as omnivores irrespective of their feelings.We chose our food out of our own necessity", 8760, "8UiEAGFjaa", 3],
	74130 : ["Yes I admit that both plants and animals have life.  But being alive is not a reason for not eating animals ! Take one example first - if we slap a rikshawala and if we slap a magistrate what will happen ?  rikshwala may only cry or abuse us but magistrate will put us in jail We have Rin-anubandhan in both cases either we eat meat or plants.  But the amount of Rin-anubandha increases with increase in consciousness.  The more conscious a living being is, the more sin it will be Plants live in a state of unconsiousness.  They feel pain and pleasure as we feel duing our deep sleep.  Plants also attract other animals (including humans) to take their fruits so that they can propagate farther and farther. On the other hand, animals have more consciousness.  They feel pain and they curse and abuse telepathically to the meat eaters.  Specially if we eat their children, they throw a curse on us. A tribe in Africa when kills deer, they first pray before the dying animal saying they need meat for their children and are very sorry to kill him.  They actually ask for forgiveness from the deer. In Durga-saptshati Mother says she will become vegetables (shaak) when there will be nothing to eat.

	74131 : ["PAIN, PAIN, PAIN. That is the answer. I surprise why everybody skipped the main point! Without a brain, plants escape from pain while for animals, pain will hurt them. A Religion can claim kindness only if it is based on 'Ahimsa' (Not to cause pain). Hinduism says \"Ahimsa Paramo Dharmah\".  Killing makes pain to animals. Therefore it is 'Himsa'.  Even otherwise, an Atheist like me will also agree that killing makes pain and wish to avoid it. We should avoid 'Himsa' at our maximum level.

However, they really don't seem to even get satire much, let alone like it.  Brits (and Canadians, as it happens), are much better at satire, and what I would call more \"cerebral\" humour.  Not exclusively; even Monty Python had sight gags, but, a lot of the humour was not so obvious in fact.

	74144 : ["........... Here is my full answer. Plz be kind enough to comment on every point.  Scientifically both plants and animals are having one basic unit common i.e. cell. It's contents are remarkably common except few like chlorophyll, centrosome, plastids, vacuoles etc.These cell constitute the whole body of an animal or a plant. Now basic difference being it's inability to create sound [ cry ] when broken /eaten /plucked, a plant or vegetable, can not make it eatable, ethically and logically. People eat vegetables just becoz they don't scream or cry or BLEED. The only purpose of production of fruits in the plants is to propagate it's kind and not to feed human beings. Then why do we eat fruits or vegetables ? There may be a reason that blood of the killed animal generates guilty feeling, which is red and like ours becoz of hemoglobin. But then the blood of plants, incidentally not red, is as important as red blood. We love to kill cockroaches just becoz they don't have red blood. The canines are the teeth which are not found in Herbivorous animals. The fact that canines are present in human beings make it clear that human are Omnivorous as the God meant us to be. Human are having long and very peculiar kind of intestine meant for digesting both meat & vegetables. The intestine of herbivorous animals can not digest meat. You can not feed meat to a sheep and grass to a lion. Can you ? Moreover Non-veg diet is very essentially for the complete growth of children. The following is a warning for the veggies..........   And how do you justify the animal sacrifice? A sin is simply religious observation and since God has himself made us omnivorous, it is not at all a sin to eat non-veg like it is not a sin to eat vegetables & fruits. ......", 8760, "2652ba9a7c4b6c7d461554ae484d484eaa", 2],
