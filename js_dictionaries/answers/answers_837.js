But here's the thing, why then would you post this question?, am I not right in believing it's because you question that notion?.. Let's put it this way most players who enjoy playing  deeper more complex games, are not interested in the simplicity of nintendo's games,  infact nintendo's game format profile hasn't changed since the late 80's early 90's when the  kid's market was by far the biggest % of the market, and that's who thier games were intended to appeal to, they had the biggest slice of the market then,  but they are a long way behind now, because quite simply thier syle of games does not appeal to the majority of the adult market,,,,such as me..", 6610, "UY8ny1vFaa", 0],

I mean, i have many friends who are above the age of 25 who sweat out games like monster hunter world as they grew up with it in their childhood. but, from what ive seen, adults tent to play games that require hours put into games, where as children like to play the minigames with joycons. so, yes, i think anyone can use the nintendo switch. hope this answered your question! :) ", 6610, "pp6StGgTaa", 1],

Can't food should last for decades so long as the inside coating doesn't degrade and the food reacts with the steel - this could happen with something very acidic. You should be okay with soup though. Obviously if the can is bulging you mustn't eat the contents. Would I eat that soup? If it was something I liked I'd try it. I'd open it, and check it.

It is “natural” for humans to consume food? Yes, meat, vegetables, grain, nuts and milk and dairy products. Is it “natural” for us to consume a fruit salad or loaf of bread? It could be argued thatit's not, but that would be silly! If we wish to consume dairy products (and most of us do) it's necessary to breed, rear and far, dairy cows which must then be milked.

But when you've got a golden duck, or more aptly, a milking cow; a free milk machine with the one stipulation is you have one no-call, no-show, i.e. don't milk it one day, your free food privileges are over, it's easier to see how we got to where we are with cow milk as a food staple. ", 6619, "u1thfT1aaa", 2],
