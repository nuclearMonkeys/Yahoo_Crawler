	8253 : ["Those both sound like mere coincidence's to me. If you actually saw visions of these things taking place or seen it visually in a dream.. then maybe you could consider it a “sixth sense”. The problem is I truly believe only God himself knows the future & I believe he does reveal it to certain people which is why the Bible predicted so many things that have come to past & are currently even coming to pass.   I would truly wonder, are you a spiritual person? Do you pray at all? If not I wouldn't be able to really understand how it would be possible for God himself to be revealing the future to you. If you are not a spiritual person the only time I could see God revealing something to you through a dream about the future would be if it was an immediate life or death situation.   Satan knows the past, Only God knows the future & familiar spirits know the current. Which is why psychics are able to accurately state things about your life.. they do this by calling in familiar spirits. {which is highly forbidden in the Bible & it is certainly dabbling in evil. I would even go as far as saying it's borderline witchcraft}. & I'm talking about the psychics are are actually real & accurate, not the frauds who are just trying to make a penny.    The spiritual realm certainly is real. Personally I would pray about it. But if you're note religious that's fine you don't have to.   If you do have the gift of being able to prophesize the future, do understand God gave you that gift to help others. But again what you described.. doesn't sound like such.   Side note but personally for me I've noticed the more I pray & the more I get closer to God the more in-tune with my intuition I am. I always get little random heavy hearted thoughts, like this one time at a grocery store {I'll never forget it}, I heard a little voice in my head or so to speak { a thought} say “give that woman in-front of you in line 20$. I was like what the heck haha no?.. but it was an instant heavy thought that wouldn't go away. So I did. I gave her 20$ randomly & she turned to me in shock, hugged me & started balling her eyes out, she said “you truly have no idea what this means to me”. I never asked her further. But I know it was God. I know it was him using me to help others. For all I know she could have prayed that morning pleading with God for some way to pay her bills, or whatever the situation was.   Some things you just know are from God yanno.   One of my church girlfriends had a similar story where she as well had a heavy thought to just tell this person that they are loved & that Jesus loves them.. just randomly. She ended up doing it  {even though she thought she was going to look like a complete loon} & that person later revealed to her that they had been suicidal that day.  I believe Many times when we get thoughts like these that seem crazy, it's truly to help someone who might be on the verge of life & death.   I've learned that when you are obedient to God without fear of what others may think, he can use you in miraculous ways to truly save lives.  ", 1331, "eW4ksnQEaa", 0],

Just a lile clear white thing. So I swat at it and get all freaked out. One other time i remember taking pictures and.. There was like this face thing in the corner. I kept seeing like this flasging light over there. So I took several pictures in the spot where i was seeing it and... Ohhh my gosh.. There was like this mini alien baby yoda looking thing.
