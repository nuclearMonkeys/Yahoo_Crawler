	130277 : ["What do you think of these solutions? - I agree that if you play with people's taxes and emotions (by making them understand the severity of the problem that they all have created) it would do a lot to stop BYBing and over run shelters.  But would mass euthanization solve the problem?  Absolutely not.  You would just be opening up more spaces for more badly bred dogs to fill. If they were put into place, would you support them? - Being in the legal field, I would have to see something in writing before I decided to lend my support lol.  I wouldn't support anything that would make the lives of breed specific rescues any harder than it already is. Are there any programs or laws in your area geared towards bringing down the population of unwanted dogs? If so, how successful has it been? - Recently the OSPCA has been opening clinics for low cost spay and neuter, I'm talking like $60 for the procedure.  I have seen people get their dogs and cats altered there, who would otherwise not do it because they didn't want to spend the money at a vet's office.  Because this program is relatively new, it's hard to say if it's making a difference yet.", 11060, "B0a1SVQoaa", -1],
	130278 : ["I am all for  taxes that could help eliminate the breeding of dogs beyond their cost in resources. If I understand this correctly that would not work since the BYB and Puppy Mills do not exceed the resources to produce the animal since they operate with no vet care, minimal food, no employees to ensure the upkeep and humane treatment of the dogs etc. I would estimate that they work on a 75 to 90% profit. So tax the hell out of them? There is slight problem with this, they do not claim them as a business and pay no income taxes. So how would the government know they exist and how would they catch them or the people that support them. That lies in the hands of local government. No federal funds mean no local resources to enforce any laws, also remember allot of these animals are sold on the internet, again how would you trace this money,there is no internet regulations We must face facts the government has a few more priorities then dogs and cats. There are many low cost even free spay/neuter clinics, many offer free spay/neuter for ferrel animals. Problem with that, only a real animal lover will take the time to trap these animals and take them to the clinics. Many counties only have a few animal control officers, they don't have the resources to troll the streets. So again no money. Dog owners are suppose to resister dogs with the city/county and that generates some revenue. This is about $15.00 or so bucks. So does you the average Joe Blow does it? Again who is going to enforce that. Then you have the APBT problem. I was watching a program last night on \"Gang Dogs\" dang near every one of them had a Pit, Rott, Presa, and they breed them like rabbits. We are taking 10 of thousands of dogs.Everyone is outraged but they do nothing. If they are busted then the dogs are put into a already over crowded shelter.  Allot of these have to be held until the court case, before they are euthanized or the .1% are adopted. The responsible owners take the heat for this problem. As a dog owner I would be happy to pay an additional tax to help with this problem. I do pay extra for owning a \"dangerous dog\". I volunteer, rescue and contribute. It doesn't bother me because I am a responsible owner. In the grand scheme we are few and far between. Kill shelters are a necessary evil, but what would we do without them? There is not choice but to euthanise the unwanted dogs I will not go into the human overpopulation since I am sure I would be hung up by my toes for my opinions on that. I have no idea if I answered your question and maybe this is just a rant. Add: I do agree that we are taxed way too much. But I would rather pay a tax to help with these issues instead of being taxed to study ant hills and the average life of roaches. We are already paying for these useful studies {roll eyes in disgust}", 11060, "QVP8zSuWaa", 2],

	130283 : ["Your best bet is to get a contractor in to give you an estimate. They're free. What you want and what's possible in your yard can be two different things. There are a lot of factors to consider, such as ease of access to the yard ( hiring a crane to hoist an excavator over a house is expensive, I know, as I worked for a company that once had to do this) if it's easy, then the price is lower naturally. Your own local bylaws may not even allow you to build a pool. For instance, a corner lot in many municipalities, with a side yard can be a no go, even if it's fenced. That tree in your backyard where you want the pool may be one that your local municipality has declared protected, even though it's your land, that tree may not be. ( True case in a town near me. No pool could be built).  Same goes with a diving board too. Many municipalities consider them to be structures ( just like a building or shed). As such they are required to have an easement ( distance between it and your property line).  It has to go at the deep end of the pool so if there's no room to be legal with the bylaws, no board can be installed.  What you want in a fountain or waterfall can vary the price considerably as well. Rock, for instance, isn't priced the same for different varieties.  You haven't even made up your mind about if you want vinyl liner or gunite (concrete) yet, which is double the cost.  What I can say, as a minimum price, given the limited information and assuming no by law issues to dance around and ease of access, is that for a vinyl liner pool ( 18X36) with 4 person attached spa, board and slide with average filtration and sanitizing equipment ( add 1500 bucks for a salt generator for example), you're starting at 42 K and working up.

All \"pet quality\" dogs spayed/neutered (or huge fines in place for a pet quality breeding), licensing, testing etc. etc. done prior to breeding. Not likely to ever happen, but it'd be nice... \"destroy all unclaimed animals \" As much as I hate to say it, there should be an \"expiry\" Not only to \"save tax dollars\" but also, what kind of life is it for a dog to be sitting in a cage waiting for *that* family to come, year in and year out?

I would fully support the idea of controlling breeding though.  However, that's one of those things people would still ignore and continue to add to the population problem.  Heavier fines, permenant loss of animal privilages, etc. would help slightly...but certainly not stop the problem.  There is a free spay/neuter program in my area that is geared to keep the average pet owner from producing more unwanted pets.  Before anyone gets all intact-rights crazy...I said AVERAGE pet owner.  I'm well aware many of you can keep intact pets from ever having a litter.  The majority of owners can't. As for your intial statement to think with your head instead of heart.
