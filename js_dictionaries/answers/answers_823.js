Consuming too much sugar leads to weight gain, and can lead to problems in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.  So - best to cut down on sugar consumption overall, but simply substituting cane or beet sugar for HFCS does nothing. ", 6556, "WvFJh2GAaa", 1],

I am trying to be more plant based, I probably will never be fully vegan, but at least I am cutting out a lot of crap from what I eat, but truthfully, as much as I love cauliflower and carrots, that is a far stretch of the imagination to say those resemble a steak or hotdog. I will say that I do grill up a portobello mushroom the same as a steak and it comes out really good, but still, it is a mushroom and not a steak. Who knows?

We breed the fowl specially for the occasion and at the appropriate time kill bit. we then remove all its feathers and disembowel it. We stuff it with some vague mixture , cook it, and then are expected to eat the dead body and enjoy it, and all in the name of a religious festival. Yes, I too am a meat eater ad enjoy it,  but I often pause during the process , and I wonder why my principles  say one thing, but allow mw to act in another way.

Leafy greens are great in the blender - ever have a green smoothie?  Yes, its true that when you juice you are throwing away your fiber. but if you eat a vegetarian or vegan diet you probably get plenty of fiber. and in some cases you might want to limit it.  There are some veggies that have a lot of good nutrients. Take for instance celery. you might eat a stalk a day. as a soup ingredient you might also get the equivalent of a stalk. but as an ingredient in a juice you can have 5 stalks.  My suggestion for a \"Best Answer\" is Both.

The people of this planet MUST mend our ways if we are to avoid further ”warnings”. Scientists are telling us now something that has long been known by some people, that the most destructive activity by far is the rearing of animals for meat. Eating meat is a luxury, NOT a necessity! We know this, and no amount of intellectual argument is going to change it. A friend of mine – an “ordinary” English woman - died recently never having eaten meat in her life, and she lived to 94. Millions of Hindus never eat meat. The ultra healthy and long lived gurus, for example, are strictly vegetarian. It is essential for the health of the Earth and her people to STOP the mass daily slaughter of her creatures!
