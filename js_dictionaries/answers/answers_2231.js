For example, in Texas, an underage person is permitted by law to consume alcholic beverages while in the direct observation of parent or legal guardian.  However, Florida seems to have very few exceptions, except for established religious or medical purposes.  Here is a link for a map of states' policies from the Alcohol Policy Information System: Since the legal drinking age in Canada is 19 (at least for beer), if you were in a northern state close enough to the border, you could cross the border for consumption.

Having tested many oils never mind the specs, the premium products do tend to perform better at extreme temperature. Car manufacturers do not recommend certain oils because they get a backhander, clean efficient oil and a good quality filter like Mann or Bosch are the most vital aid to long engine life. It is not all big names; Morris oils are formally approved by Mercedes and are available direct on the net.  Do not deliberately let the engine idle to warm up which is what many car makers tell you in the handbook anyway and leave the heater off until the car warms up, although this is an ideal and may not be   possible in practice. Even when cold at higher revs the fuel mixture is less rich and it is unburnt petrol washing the oil off cold bores which is the major reason why 70% of all wear takes place when cold, so yes a garaged car does not get such a hard time as one outside and vehicles manufactured in cold climates are designed to shrug off low temperatures more efficiently.

	117353 : ["You might want to go to the web site and show it to your teacher.  That is, if you dare!! THE NAME UKRAINE, which first appeared in the historical chronicles in 1187, has been common in the English language for almost 350 years. In the earliest years it appeared without the definite article \"the\" but in this century the definite article increasingly preceded the name Ukraine.  First of all we might note that the Ukrainian language has no articles so this is not a factor except indirectly. The reason for this is that many Ukrainian immigrant scholars, due to their imperfect knowledge of English, used the form \"the Ukraine\" in their books thus helping to perpetuate this usage.  Does English grammar require the definite article the before Ukraine? Ukraine is the name of an independent country. There are only two groups of countries which require the article in English: Those with plural names such as the United States or the Netherlands. The others have names with adjectival or compound forms which require the article, such as the United Kingdom, the Dominion of Canada, or the Ukrainian SSR.  English grammar does not require a definite article before the names of singular countries such as England, Canada or Ukraine.  Even the computer age has ruled that \"the\" Ukraine is wrong in English. Gram-mat-ik, the very popular grammar and style checker for computers by Reference Software International of San Francisco, uses Ukraine without the article and labels \"the Ukraine\" as a mistake of grammar.  There appears to be virtually no grammatical or logical reason to use the definite article before the name Ukraine. But it is still encountered occasionally because of habit or because the writer is careless or ignorant about Ukraine. Sir Bernard Pares the eminent English historian of Russia suggested that \"the Ukraine\" came from French usage. We say Ia France, le Canada and l'Ukraine in French but not 'the France; 'the Canada' or 'the Ukraine' in the English language. The definite article the does not add anything to the meaning or clarity when used before the proper noun Ukraine.  Now, the exception to the rule. Yes, it is possible for \"the Ukraine\" to be correct in English but it is a very rare usage in apposition to contrast the past with the present. For example, one could correctly say, \"The America of George Washington is not the America of Bill Clinton\" as well as \"The Ukraine of Shevchenko is not the Ukraine of Kravchuk.\"  We may conclude then, that the use of the definite article in English before the name Ukraine is awkward, incorrect and superfluous. Writers who care about good style in their English grammar and the correctness of their language will always avoid the use of \"the Ukraine\" and use only the simpler and correct \"Ukraine.\"  Read  more at", 10497, "e415dafdcd312c16ad931bebee78c2ddaa", 1],
	117354 : ["You are right, of course, but this is because the Ukraine is not Italy, Russia, or China. It isn't \"The Hague\" either, but we don't say \"The Rome,\" now, do we? These are names that are accepted English and derive from decades or more of usage. It turns out that most of these, but not all, are falling into desuetude, but Ukraine is still referred to as The Ukraine, while Congo is no longer called The Congo. It is a matter of accepted usage. In the case of The Ukraine, you might tell your teacher that although it is still accepted by others to call it The Ukraine, Ukraine itself asserted, when it achieved independent status, that the article should be dropped. We usually call people by the name that they prefer. On the other hand, this is not a matter of \"American language,\" as you put it. In French it is \"l'Ukraine,\" The Ukraine, and in Italian it is \"l'ucraina,\"  also \"The Ukraine,\" so, as I have already said, this is a matter of (INTERNATIONAL) accepted usage. Untel very recently, it was considered the sole usage. EDIT: I don't want to start a fight with a guy from the Bronx (the old saying goes, \"Never start a fight with a guy from the Bronx\") but if anyone ever said, \"I live near Bronx,\" everyone in the Bronx and anywhere else would know (1) the guy lives in Jersey, or probably Atlanta, or (2) the guy just got hit in the head with a falling crane. My family has lived in NYC for generations, and several still live in The Bronx. Except for that guy from Georgia, and the one with the (very large) bump on his head, nobody, but nobody, says simply \"Bronx.\" EDIT EDIT: As for the nonsense that this is something recent in this or the past century, it is just simply that, nonsense. Ukraine has been called The Ukraine for hundreds and hundreds of years. Byron called it that TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO (BYRON Mazeppa iii, \"The Ukraine's hetman, calm and bold.\"); Hanway said it in 1753 (\"1753 HANWAY Trav. (1762) I. VI. lxxxii. 374 \"His brother..is now Hetman of the Cossacks in the Ukraine..This is a kind of vice-royalty, and is..the most lucrative of any employment in the empire\"); it has been standard English and every other Western language for centuries. So, what purports to be some sort of authoritative article on Ukraine, in one of the last answers below, is nothing more than the ignorant musings of a non-English speaker who is nothing more than a Ukrainian apologist, taken literally and wholly from the site (ad  more at\") where the author knows no more about Ukrainian history than of the rules of English grammar about which he is totally mistaken. The claim that it is only in this century that The Ukraine was called that is demonstrably wrong (see my quotations above). Enough said for all those who are critical and reflective thinkers. It is shameful to cite that kind of nonsense.", 10497, "None", -1],
