Don't move the jewlery again until you have been able to soak and clean your septum since it may have formed crust and will tear up the piercing to move it without cleaning. Don't flip your jewlery back and forth throughout the day as this will be likely to irritate your piercing.  If you're going to be going for the up look, get pierced with a septum retainer. Like so:   This little thing will hang out inside your nose without rubbing, pressing, putting pressure on anything. Yes it looks a little silly if you choose to wear it down, but its easy on your nose.  Be aware that it can try to escape your nose while cleaning, so be careful not to knock it out of yourself.  If you're going to hide your septum choose jewlery designed for the job like a retainer or a keeper. Circular barbells will work for both hiding and daily wear once your piercing is healed, but stuffing the whole thing into your nose may be too much while its healing. If you must hide a piercing, hide it with good equipment and don't bother it other than cleaning.", 11062, "ZIq2IzOmaa", 4],

I hear people all the time say that if you treat your dog good he will be a good dog.  That is a lot of Bull Crap !  !  !    Due to the way that most are bred to be fighting dogs.  This training starts when the dame is pregnant.  And the babies she is carrying go through the same emotional disstress as she is agitated & kept in a constant state of daily torment.  These pups are born with the same state the mother was kept in while she was pregnant.  This can also be carried in the genetics of these pups.  If for some reason they aren't what they wanted for fighting,  the pups are sold as pets.  Sever emotional disorders develop as the pups grow.  At the age of 3 or so their temperament changes,  just as a teen ager matures their attude, temperament, views all are completely different while they were growing up. A Pitt Bull that is not tormented durning gestation is a calmer more dependable dog.  The traits that are bred into a fighting Pitt can be passed on generations later as a recessive gene.  & could pop it's ugly head in a pup generations later. So it is & can be both the dog &/or the owner. It is not just the Pitt that matures & hase a temperament change.  The Dalmation is one.  So it is not always how a dog is treated (good or bad)  the genetic's play a major roll too.  A very major roll.", 11060, "18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa", -1],

	130133 : ["Yes. In inertial coordinates, that is correct. The relativistic shortening of radial distances due to expansion limits the size of the universe. Also, the expansion is equivalent to a gravity hill centered on the origin of the coordinates, wherever the origin may be.  However, inertial coordinates are generally only used at short enough distances that the expansion of space is a small fraction of the speed of light. Cosmologists prefer the comoving coordinate system which redefines time and space. In comoving coordinates, relative motion due to expansion is considered to be only \"apparent\" relative motion, and relativity does not apply to it. Distances between galaxies are not shortened and their clocks are not slowed because they are moving away from us.  This does not mean that general relativity has limited range; it simply means that cosmologists prefer to measure space differently. This alters the apparent shape of the universe, making it more aesthetically pleasing. I am not satisfied with Wikipedia's explanation of comoving distance. I prefer to think of it as a measuring chain whose equally spaced links are a constant length in inertial coordinates but with gaps between them. At the instant when the expansion of space eliminates the gaps, the chain gives an accurate measure of comoving distance. Then the chain snaps and you must postulate the existence of a new chain with gaps in it. If each link is a million light years long, the gaps will close at a relative speed of 25 km/s. This is a small enough fraction of the speed of light so that the links are not seriously shortened by relativity. The shorter the links, the more accurate the measure.

I've only been bitten once by big dog and it was only because i was breaking up a dog fight and got in the middle of it. I used to work at the animal shelter and they are trying to make it no Kill and they have a rule that no dog should be euthanized if if shorter than your knee. They call it \"No E below the knee\". My boss thought that was the most ridiculous thing he's ever heard. They say that the smaller dog are less likely to cause as much damage when they bite or attack. They say they can't maul you like a big dog can and that's why they have that new rule. I had a 90 lb. American Bulldog/Pit mix that i rescued from the shelter and he was the best dog i ever had. I had him for 15 years. I believe that people that own Pitbulls, Rottweilers, etc. are the ones that give them a bad name because they train them to be mean and think its cool to have a dog like that, that fights.

These two dimensions (so strongly associated with each other in relativistic physics that they are combined in the idea of space-time) may not exist outside this universe. The word \"beyond\" is already related to space-time. We cannot define what is outside, beyond, before, or after our universe because these concepts are only known to apply in the space-time universe itself.  Time and space exist because this universe has these two dimensions. Other dimensions and concepts may be scattered across all that we do not know. It does not have to be time after this universe or by that matter before. For example, where does the mass that is pulled into black holes go to? It is clear that it is no longer in our space and time, because all that stellar matter would not fit in a single point. There is no simple answer to this question. Since we do not possess the capabilities to explore a space that is beyond our senses at the moment, we cannot know what is beyond. As it is unobservable, it is only a subject of our speculation.
