Holmes had the best jab i've seen, and his hands are just plain faster than Klitschko's are. Wlad towers over opponents but Larry is just as tall. Both are very technical fighters, but Holmes could also get in there and bang if he needed to. I don't see Wladimir being able to cut off the ring very effectively against Holmes either. He's never been very mobile and Holmes wont let him stand there squared up all night. Larry Holmes was known to eat a lot of right hands, and Wlad sure has a good one, but Holmes would give back just as good as he takes, and I know he can take a punch better. I think Wlad's mental make up would be his own worst enemy in a fight like this. Not to say that Wlad isn't tough, but Holmes reacted differently to getting caught than Wlad does. I'd say Holmes would win by UD or late stoppage. I just don't think Wlad has the will power or the wheels to keep up Holmes all night. Just as big, better jab, faster, better ring generalship. Not saying it would be a blowout, but in the end, I think it would all be too much for Wlad to handle.", 10197, "MRdcOE9maa", -1],

	111744 : ["I am Joshua Mbngo Dmbungo TONGUE-CLICK Jnr. Jnr. Both these guys have gained alot of respect and lots of people call them underrated. I call both of them overrated. I make no secret that I don't happen to be a fan of either. Larry is a nailed on top ten heavy, I've no trouble seeing him in the top five. The reason I think he's overrated is because, for year after year, every day, someone will say Larry Holmes is underrated. Once everyone's saying a guy's underrated he's no longer underrated. Infact, over time with the underrated tag growing and growing I think people have forgotten how imperfect he was, how he struggled with Witherspoon, got flattened by Shavers. I just don't subscribe to other people's image of Holmes' boxing ability, however he had great heart. Even when guys did get under his skin he almost always roared back to stop them. Don't get me wrong, I think Larry is a great fighter with good movement, chin, power. I wouldn't say any of attributes are great other than the jab and the 1-2. At his best he gives any heavy in history a tough night, I just think retrospect gives him a free ride sometimes. I've probably already ranted on Wlad elsewhere - ranted on how, for all his longevity, he's never beaten a fighter who even knows what \"great\" looks like. Ranted on how he's 0-1 with Corrie Sanders. How, in the weakest heavyweight era since before Joe Louis he failed to unify. Even ranted on how, when it comes time to dig his heals and show the eye of the tiger he...gets knocked out. So that's my opinions of those guys, I have no preference. Now onto the fight: Larry wins 9.9 outta 10 for me. He faced a big 6'6 heavyweight by the name of Cooney and hammered him around. Cooney certainly didn't have Wlad's skill but he was heavier handed and Larry dealt with it just fine. He can find a guy that size no problem. Larry had more variety, he could box, he could get rough, he could work the body, fire in bunches. Wlad's best weapon is his jab. Wlad's jab is almost his only weapon and Larry can do that better. Add to the equation Holmes' ability to fight for 15 rounds and you know he only gets stronger as the fight goes on. Holmes WKO11 by me. Just a different class.

	111747 : ["Girls: Gertrude – It's not pretty but it's unique, strong, charismatic and so very rich in history, which is more than I can say for a vast majority of the popular girl names in today's society. Millicent – Powerful and domineering. People are always looking for confident, kind of tomboyish names for girls with an adorable nickname (Millie) to match so, why not Millicent? Queenie – Cute, quirky and entirely innovative in and of itself. True, it is a tad on the babyish side but nowhere near as tacky as your average Paige, Chloe and Mackenzie, nor as overdone as Lucy, Lily or Ava. Mavis (May-viss) – Apparently a lot of people dislike it but I don't know if that's because they're pronouncing it wrong or what have you. It's adorable and a tad on the frumpy side, but reasonably so like the other, more popular classics such as Mabel and Dinah that are already starting to make a comeback. Alma – Prim, proper and short enough to be cute but formal enough to work for any given age. Plus, it has a religious background which might be appealing to some though, if anything, that connection merely boosts its prestige. Boys: Evelyn – Yes, Evelyn. Typically pronounced as either “Eve-lin” or “Ev-lin”, it's interesting, sophisticated, elegant and charming. Some people might be quite hesitant to use it on a boy given its immense popularity with girls but, if it'd really gone 100% to the girls by this point then it would no longer be listed as ‘unisex' on all of the creditable sites. Lucius – It has that fresh, vibrant appeal that a lot of boy names are lacking recently. It's quite chic, it's related to the sexy character from Harry Potter, it ages well, it's legitimately unique and it's unquestionably manly. Barnaby – Admittedly not for everyone but, it's very suave and aristocratic, without the pretentious appeal that usually comes along with those characteristics. Plus, it has the adorable nickname option “Barney” which I believe everyone secretly loves but would never use as a full name thanks to that accursed purple dinosaur.  Aloysius (Ah-lou-wish-uss)– It's a beautiful classic that is very formal and professional, but offers the playful nickname “lou” and has a stylish and almost modern feel to it due to its lack of frumpiness. Sylvester – Yes, like the cat and the boxer but those are outdated references so what we're left with is, essentially, a classy, unusual and vibrant Victorian-esque name with a great history, an adorable nickname (Sly) and an elegance that can match up to your typical Alexander and Elizabeth. Phineas (Finny-us) – Everybody seems to be head over heels for Finley, so why shun Phineas? It's much less popular than Finley and far more formal, mature and professional, not to mention handsome and majestic. Robin – People tend associate Robin with femininity because most automatically think of the dainty little red-breasted bird but, honestly, that's where the potential for it being a girl name ends, in my opinion.

	111753 : ["For thousands of years, people have said that their gods were behind what they didn't understand -- life, lightning, stars, earthquakes, the origin of life, the world or the universe, etc.  Positing a god to supposedly answer a question solves nothing.  It just adds an unwarranted level of complexity and stops you from asking more questions. It used to be that science couldn't answer the question about the origin of the universe or of the Big Bang, but that didn't mean we should make up an answer (such as a god) and say that it was the cause.  Within the last few decades scientists have discovered some good answers.  Of course, a scientific explanation is more complex than simply saying, \"God did it.\" Quantum mechanics shows that \"nothing,\" as a philosophical concept, does not exist.  There is always a quantum field with random fluctuations. There are many well-respected physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Sean M. Carroll, Victor Stenger, Michio Kaku, Alan Guth, Alex Vilenkin, Robert A.J. Matthews, and Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek, who have created scientific models where the Big Bang and thus the entire universe could arise from nothing but a random quantum vacuum fluctuation in the quantum field -- via natural processes. In relativity, gravity is negative energy, and matter and photons are positive energy.  Because negative and positive energy seem to be equal in absolute total value, our observable universe appears balanced to the sum of zero.  Our universe could thus have come into existence without violating conservation of mass and energy — with the matter of the universe condensing out of the positive energy as the universe cooled, and gravity created from the negative energy.  When energy condenses into matter, equal parts of matter and antimatter are created — which annihilate each other to form energy.  However there is a slight imbalance to the process, which results in matter dominating over antimatter. I know that this doesn't make sense in our Newtonian experience, but it does in the realm of quantum mechanics and relativity.  As Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman wrote, \"The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense.  And it agrees fully with experiment.  So I hope you can accept nature as she is — absurd.\" For more about the Big Bang and its implications, watch the video at the 1st link - \"A Universe From Nothing\" by theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, read an interview with him (at the 2nd link), get his new book (at the 3rd link), or read an excerpt from his book (at the 4th link).

When he was backed up and hit with a hard shot, it would be likely for him to get knocked down, if not out. In my opinion, it would be like a chess match in the beginning, both jabbing and right crossing. In the eighth round, however, Holmes will find his mark, and land a bunch of right crosses and knock him down a couple times, before the referee stops it. Holmes TKO8. Klitschko is one of the best fighters today, he is very good, and he is one of my favorites.
