Most people that have high dollar shotguns did not pay that price exclusively for a performance gun but for a \"come look at MY gun\" with all the fancy engraving etc. and exotic wood furniture. Russian shotguns are ugly. Example: KSK, Molot Vepr 12, and Saiga 12. On the other hand Tula (Russian) makes a really pretty SxS.

	28649 : ["Size is a factor, skill is a factor, strength is a factor. People like to think that as long as they have skill, they're good. This is an excuse to only work on the skills that more enjoyable to train. This way you get to go train in your martial art, tire yourself a bit, and leave knowing you did some work while convincing yourself it's all you need to do. The truth is that the untrained will always be better off trained. The trained will always be better off if they also train for strength and explosiveness. When skill is equal, the bigger person usually has an advantage. If you are small, every mistake you make is more dangerous than if you were bigger. Make yourself better. We all only have so much time we can train, but train to be skilled, to be stronger, and to be more explosive. As long as you're trying to be better that's all you can really do.", 4459, "UhM9r2Osaa", -1],
	28650 : ["This is a few questions. Do martial arts teach to fight as a last resort? Yes and no. It comes down to the instructor to teach as they will. Some may teach fighting sooner than a last resort - for example a military combatives program might teach to attack first. The tactic should fit the situation in question. How do you get rid of ego? You don't. Ego is a part of who you are, and there is healthy ego and unhealthy ego. If somebody asks you to name something you are proud to have accomplished, your ego answers the question. If your ego is not healthy and in check, it can manifest in negative ways. You can't get rid of it, but if you are trying to keep it healthy and actively observing your own thoughts and behaviors then you are on the right track. I'm sorry to hear you ran from a bat. They're usually harmless animals. Can't recommend a film for wisdom. Wisdom isn't built from a set path. You live life and learn from your own experiences. Movies can't really substitute life experience for you, but they can provoke thought. Just watch what appeals to you. Life is too short to watch movies you don't enjoy as homework.", 4460, "UhM9r2Osaa", 0],
	28651 : ["Cool question, I've done martial arts for a while, but when I first began or rather a couple of months I sparred against a MMA fighter who trained for about as long as I did. I won... But, do you really win in sparring?  I won 4 bouts against him 2 standing and 2 in grappling. He never did beat me even after we both trained for years. We were friends btw. He was 3-1 a few years later. When we sparred again, I guess he thought he could beat me. I beat him again only because I tricked him a lot while sparring. Side kicks do work btw.", 4461, "dwPrLpdJaa", 0],
	28652 : ["If you don't train full contact, a high level fighter that has competed full contact on numerous occasions will have a serious advantage. Even if you fight dirty, if the professional fighter (who is also likely a natural born elite athlete) can defend against your punches and kicks, they can also defend against your eye gouges and nut kicks because you still have to be able to land those shots like anything else. If you are a high level martial artist who also has trained full contact, you might have a chance.", 4461, "UhM9r2Osaa", 1],

They are a privately owned concern, and have every right to set the conditions of admission. I don't know if it will come to this as far as transportation like the airlines, the railways or Greyhound, but it's the same deal.  They are private corporations, and if they decide that it's best for their business to require the vaccine in order to travel with them, it is their right.", 4463, "f0NRJxl3aa", 1],

So training does play big part in any situation and knowing how to/not to apply that training is even a bigger part of survivability. Not many get out of a fight without getting hit a few times.
