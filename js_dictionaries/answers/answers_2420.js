They need to realize that the bible was written by man and early man didn't have all the answers so they basically made theories about creation that was based on the little knowledge that they knew at the time. The Native Americans (I forget what tribe) believed that the world was created on the back of a turtle. Is that true? Will any Christian ever believe that? Of course not because it's ridiculous. Why can't Christians not see this issue only in black and white? There is physical evidence of evolution, so why can't you keep your God and just think well maybe God created the big bang, and life just went on from there instead they devote their entire beliefs on an ancient story told by shepherds that thought the world was flat and the earth was the center of the universe?", 10910, "1a2c7977e5e8dd3ec77d37f8abf5a078aa", 0],

Although, if he doesn't have a heater, he's probably cold. So I would recommend adding one. If he's resting at the bottom of the tank, check your water parameters. Make sure that he was introduced to a fully established tank, and that the nitrites and ammonia are both at 0ppm, and the nitrates are around 20ppm. As far as facts and tips go, just make sure that you're housing him correctly. Betta's do not appreciate spiky objects in their tank, as they can scratch themselves easily, so stick to live or silk plants. Make sure you have at least one hiding spot, like a cave for your betta to seek refuge and protection when threatened. Betta's are carnivores, and enjoy eating blood worms and brine shrimp. Live is best, but frozen and freeze-dried are other options as well. You may also want to fast your betta once or twice a week in order to clear out his digestive system. Make sure you are performing weekly water changes and are replacing only 25% of the water with treated tap water.", 10915, "kkFccdn7aa", 0],

The wives of the Prophet used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.' Once Sauda, the daughter of Zam'a went out and she was a tall woman. 'Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her while she was (defecating) in a group, and said, \"I have recognized you, O Sauda!\" He ('Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling of women.) So Allah revealed the verse of veiling 33.59. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) * Bukhari Volume 1, Book 8, Number 395: Narrated 'Umar (bin Al-Khattab): Allah agreed with me on three things and revealed ayas, one of them was the verse of the veiling of the women (33.59) . .Hafsa: “Well I cant wait that long.

Hafsa was outraged (she had a temper of her Dad Umar) and started hollering at him. Hafsa: “Rasulullah you lied and and deceived me to screw my maid”?. Prophet:” Hafsa mind your language. Aya 33.32* says you should talk to Allah's Prophet in an a honorable manner”. * 33.32 “O wives of the Prophet! Speak to the prophet in an honorable manner”.. Hafsa: “I will speak honorably to the prophet when the Prophet stops acting dishonorably himself”. Prophet: “Having sex with slave girls is not dishonorable. Allah has made* them halal for me”. *33.50 “Mohammed , sex with slave girls and captured women is halal for you* Hafsa:” I don't give a rat's behind who is is halal for you and who is is not .. You can have sex with a she camel for all I care. But I don't want it in my bed and on my night”. Prophet: “Hafsa ,calm down. I will tell you something. If you keep this incident a secret between you and me and don't tell any one, I take an oath that I will never touch Maria again. And Please cool down first . Go have a drink of cold water.... Hafsa: “ O.K. I have to go pee also... AYA 66.1 AND 66.2 REVEALED Hafsa returned after a short while and found her husband again in bed with Maria. Hafsa: “Rasulullah, You have a short memory. You had just said you will not touch her again”. Prophet: “Yes I did, but Allah revealed aya 66.1 after you left, it says “Mohammed why do you forbid yourself what Allah has made lawful to you just to please your wife” Hafsa: “What about the oath you took.” Prophet:: “Allah dissolved my oath” by aya 66.2 which says Allah has ordained for you the dissolution of your oath.
