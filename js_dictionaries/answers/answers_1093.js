Things are not overcome by \"emotions\" or any of that BS like you see in Naruto. It feels more realistic, and the value of life is much more significant in FMA than in Naruto. Not to mention, the comedy is also very well done. In Naruto, fanservice plays a much bigger role which can sometimes get annoying. In FMA, it's put in there but it's so well done, it doesn't take away from the story at all. Naruto also has too many flashbacks. It causes friction with the story, and makes for slow episodes. FMA is fast paced, suspenseful, and as realistic as a fantasy show with magical powers can be. So hands down FMA.", 8066, "vMUBGdLnaa", -1],

If you want the real thing, read books by genuine teachers. Of books by teachers, the two classic works are: \"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\" by Shunryu Suzuki Roshi \"Dropping Ashes on the Buddha\" by Zen Master Seung Sahn Both are readily available new and used and both convey the beauty and wisdom of Zen. My first Zen book was \"Three Pillars\" and I'm indebted to it. But several decades later I think it somewhat mis-represents the real work of Zen practice.

Do you know what the story actually is?  Your line \"silenced by Darwinists\" sounds like it's about a science student (or graduate) who believed in \"Intelligent Design\" was expelled from a college or university.  Please note I did NOT call him a \"scientist.\"  While it's possible to postulate a deist, Spinoza's sort of creator, and still be scientifically sound, the people who use the expression \"Intelligent Design\" go a great deal further than that.  They propound arguments \"from design\" which were successfully discredited by Hume hundreds of years ago.  Of course Darwin did a better job of discrediting the concept, but that was later. The problem with the ID people is they do the \"complex creation requires a creator\" line without noticing that using the term \"creation\" prejudices the outcome, and that Darwin (and cosmologists since) have successfully provided a superior explanation which fits the facts much better.

	60174 : ["I think it's absolutely possible to support gay rights, or same-sex marriage, and be Christian. I think the people who promote a narrow-minded view of who the \"ideal Christian\" is are really missing the point of their religion. In essence, Christianity is following the teachings of Jesus, not the teachings of archaic parts of the Old Testament and biased points of view from various New Testament contributers who didn't even meet Jesus, let alone live in that time period. If someone says that supporting gay rights is anti-Christian, then I would assume someone supporting the total abolition of slavery is also anti-Christian because the Bible treats both minority groups in similiar ways. Homosexuality is seen as an abomination, and slaves are degraded and seen as mere property to sell and trade. But yet no one thinks twice when someone supports the abolition of slavery, yet they all grab their fire and pitchforks for someone supporting two consenting adults getting married? Some elitist Christians try to pretend that their religion is organized and strict, when really they individually pick-and-choose which parts of the Bible to accept as truth and which parts to ignore. Instead of addressing the Bible as a coherent whole, they focus on political-driven issues like same-sex marriage and abortion to make distinctions between who are \"true\" Christians and who are not.

By destroy is to divide and make his truth unknown my clouding it with different teachings. This authority comes from the mouth of Jesus Christ and that is pass thou his holy church.

	60178 : ["This is not correct.  True the anti-christ is already here in the earth but he is not manifested himself yet.  Or he has not come to full power.  You will have to read the Book of Daniel about the anti-christ.  The anti-christ will arise during the period of the 7 year tribulation.  However, Christ will return and rapture the Church before the 7 year tribulation.  In book of Daniel, it talks about there is a time coming when the anti-christ will have power to conquer the church.   But the time that we are living in right now, he does not have that power.  He will not be able to conquer the church, until Christ comes for all those who were faithful.  Those who are left behind will have to endure the 7 year tribulation and the persecution of the anti-christ.  The apostle John in revelations saw a huge multitude of people which could not be numbered.  The angel asked him do you know who these people are?
