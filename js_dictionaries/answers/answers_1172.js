And if you accept the Christian/biblical definition of God then: Christians claim that God is all powerful, all knowing, loving and the creator of the universe.  An all knowing deity would know of a universe where all his aims for the people of the universe would be achieved without any suffering.  An all powerful deity would be able to create such a universe.  A loving deity would want to create such a universe where there is no suffering of his creations.  But in our universe there is suffering, not only of adults, who you might argue have free will to \"choose\" to suffer, but also of children and babies that do not have the ability to make that choice.

However, if you don't have much of a background in various sciences, it does seem like Creationist have a good point (especially if you don't objectively investigate their claims).  On the other hand, when you objectively examine both sides from the best information available as well as a good understanding of how both the Bible and History has treated the Biblical accounts of Creation, the Flood, and other early events, it is very clear that the Bible does not match up with what the evidence shows. I grew up as a Creationist (fundamental, charismatic, evangelical) and spent my early life espousing creationism.   Eventually I came to a point where I wanted to have a more complete understanding of the facts, so I forced myself to objectively research both sides.  I found that creationist claims are ill-informed, do not support their other claims (i.e. the biblical day is  a long period like millions of years, then you have plants without the sun or pollinators), fallacious arguments (appeals to incredulity or authority) or contradictory.  Looking at evolution, cosmology, geology etc, I found that they where consistent, supported by evidence, well defined (as opposed to \"kinds\").   The thing that really annoyed me with Creationists, is that most had no problem with promoting their misinformation to trusting people using statements like \"what scientists don't want you to know\".

	64111 : ["In a word: Yes. Far more complex answer: Define 'evidence.' The issue as I see it is that the two sides have vastly different standards for what constitutes evidence. Evidence should make something clearly evident. Atheists ask for evidence that is empirical, independently verifiable, repeatable. On the other hand, I'm often pointed by Christians to bible verses such as Hebrews 11:1 (KJV): “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” But, someone having faith in something isn't evidence it is true. Muslims have faith that their religion is true. Christians have faith theirs is true. Hindus have faith theirs is true. There is no position that can be taken on faith. I have seen that argument more than once. They say the very fact he had faith that God existed served as evidence that God existed. I don't doubt these people had faith. I just don't see that a god existing is required to believe one exists. Theists point to trees or whatever other things as some sort of supposed creation. But, it doesn't serve as evidence as a sentient creator any more than a confluence of natural events. The things they point to may be observable, but the problem is they don't make their God unquestionably evident, and hence don't constitute evidence. Cosmological argument as I understand it: 1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause. 2. The Universe began to exist. 3.  Therefore, the Universe had a cause. Nowhere in that argument is a god outlined as a cause any more than another universe or pixies.  So, it isn't evidence for a god any more than it is evidence for other universes and pixies.   And, I'm not convinced Universe \"began to exist\" in the sense I think you mean.  I agree there was a big bang, but I don't think we currently know enough to rule out something like conformal cyclic cosmology where the universe iterates through infinite cycles, demarcated by big bangs.  I'll admit, this is not my field.  But, noted physicists like Roger Penrose don't seem ready to take it off the table yet.", 8227, "8l20dIRXaa", 0],

A lot of this view that Christianity was a flat earth religion is Washington Irving's fault for claiming the Christian courts of Europe kept telling Columbus that the Earth was flat and that he'd fall off the edge. That nonsense is still doing the rounds today. The reality was the scholars of Europe knew full well the Earth was a globe and the size that globe was.

My expectations however is another \"natural\" cause, since we have no reasons to suspect any other kind of cause. We know energy cannot be created, so we do have the ultimate for an uncaused cause that somehow began everything else but did not need a cause itself. You also have the problem of the natural order of complexity, where nothing begins as a complex or finished product without going through steps over time to get there. This means everything that exists has a simpler beginning until you reach the basic building block and theists will never be able to give an actual example of anything violating this natural order, yet they want to begin with a finished product (God) that \"magically\" violates this necessary natural order.", 8237, "0jmvVwqPaa", 1],

However, the bible has verses stating God made everything over a week, creating man whole cloth from dust, woman from rib, and the like.  And, that's a very different picture than billions of years of evolution.  It isn't that they'd say it impossible for God.  They'd just claim something like \"God said in the bible that it didn't happen that way.\" And for atheists, I think it is more of a matter of Occam's razor than a matter of impossibility.

A man had to be found who was authentically human but who was not a descendent of Adam, to become a legally recognized plaintiff. Hence the necessity of the Virgin Birth (Luke 1:35) The Necessity of Moral Perfection There is another reason why the Virgin Birth is essential. A successful challenger of Satan had to be not only an authentic member of the human race, but in addition one who, under testing would prove to be morally and spiritually perfect. In order to furnish Satan no claim upon him, he had to live an absolutely sinless life. If Jesus were not the Son of God by Mary by virtue of a supernatural conception, then He was merely a son of Adam. Jesus As A Man Confronting Satan In order to establish a legal basis for authority over Him, it remained for Satan to attempt to induce some moral flaw or imperfection in His character or conduct. There was only one way to do this. Satan must persuade or compel Him to break fellowship or unity with His Father, to pressure Jesus to rebel and act independently. This was Satan's strategy and master plan. This was the crux of the struggle between Jesus and the archfiend of darkness. All the destiny of the world and the human race hung upon the outcome of this struggle.  Although Jesus was “very God of very God,” He had to fight this battle and overcome as “very man of very man.” Although Jesus had all the resources of Divinity at His command, He engaged Satan in this decisive contest purely as unfallen Man The Wilderness Temptation In the wilderness, Satan offered Jesus a shortcut to world dominion if He would only fall down and worship him…just once. Satan alleged that authority over all the kingdoms of the world had been delivered unto him and that he gave it to whomsoever he chose.  Jesus did not challenge this claim, for He knew Satan's legal basis for it. He also knew that the only way that He could redeem and recover man's lost estate was by way of Calvary. He overcame this temptation by using the Word of God, the same Word that was and is available to Adam and all his progeny. Adam didn't have the written word but he heard God speak to him directly. Gethsemane The battle which continued through His ministry reached an incredible intensity in the Garden. The demonic and satanic pressure on His spirit was so unutterably devastating that it brought Jesus to the very brink of death. He cried, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death” (Matt. 26:38), while from His tortured  face blood drops oozed and spattered onto the ground.
