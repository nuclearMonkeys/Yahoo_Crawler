Let me go and I'll grant you 3 wishes.  Ok, she says. So she frees it, and it says,  Sorry, forgot to tell you. whatever you get, your husband gets ten times the amount of whatever it is you wish for.  Ok, fine.  So, the frog asks, what's your first wish?  I want to be the most beautiful women in the world.  Fine, it says. Suddenly, she's gorgeous.  You are the most beatiful woman. But now your husband is ten times more handsom than you.  Thats ok, she say. He only has eyes for me.  Whats your second wish? it asks her.  I want to be the richest woman in the world. The frog then says, ok, but now your husband is ten times richer.  Thats ok she says. Whats his is mine, whats mine is his.  OK, the frog says. that is your last wish. what is it gonna be?

	76795 : ["A woman's \"ability to be independent\" is not repulsive. In fact it is a prerequisite. What I personally cannot bear is the woman who feels a need to express this. \"Girl power!\" is just annoying. It's like people who feel the need to point out they're intelligent. Why isn't just BEING intelligent enough?  Anyway, people who claim to be intelligent normally aren't. Likewise, I suspect that the \"I'm a strong independent woman\" type actually lack genuine self-confidence and they're trying to compensate. I don't want to be around people like this. As for why some men want dependence, weakness and submission from women... Well, obviously there are non-sex specific reasons - like wanting to get your own way, and a submissive partner is easy to manipulate. But male dominance has its own unique features obviously. I think there is a desire to prove his masculinity, that he is big, powerful and in control (fantasy element). I also think the man will see the submissive woman as less demanding. Men's sexual performance is more up for judgement and I think there is a fear of being unable to satisfy. A woman that is dependent and inexperienced is more likely to adore her partner regardless, probably not knowing bad performance when she experiences it. Oh yes, I forgot: \"yet women do not seem to hold the same or as many expectations of what a man \"should be\"\" This is just totally incorrect. The very fact that it is women who do the choosing (generally) should tell us that women are pickier and have more expectations of a prospective partner.", 8854, "None", 6],
	76796 : ["Well, to start, I think its important that we not hold others responsible for our expectations - we are responsible for them, no one else... As for why some want a needy woman - I think it speaks to the character of that individual.  They, perhaps, need to feel strong and powerful and in control.  Having an independent woman may make them feel less of a man, if you will - so not a good fit.   I guess the bottom line is that there is a lid for every pot, thank God.  There are so very many different men and women out there - and instead of trying to change one into the 'type' you want, its so much better to be clear with yourself about what that is, and go out and find one that fits the mold you seek.  Sure, it may take time - but the payoff is limitless!!!", 8854, "56a2c12d6cc205a92eb64ece9ccda3b4aa", 5],
	76797 : ["People say you can't miss something you never knew you had. I say bullshit. Actually, knowing you once had it makes you miss it more, because you've never known what it is like to have one, and can only get a vague idea of it by restoring. Infant genital mutilation, regardless of the gender, is absolutely unforgivable in my book. It is child molestation. Not to mention, if parents aren't satisfied with their child's body as is, then there is something severely wrong with those parents. What i'm wondering is where does it stop? Chopping off your breasts reduces the risk of breast cancer, so we should all chop off our children's breasts? People make the blunder of thinking the foreskin is a useless piece of skin, but ignore the roles it plays: Keeping the head soft and sensitive Not to mention that most of the nerve endings in that part of the body are in the foreskin itself. An uncut penis is just as sensitive as an uncut clitoris. Then we get to the traumatising pain that a baby feels by having a piece of their penis cut off. And the deaths caused by genital mutilation.", 8847, "AA11563742", 9],

It continues to be offered because frankly if physicians don't do it, people will do it in their homes which would be undoubtedly be much more harmful.  Male circumcisions have fallen out of style in most other modernized countries, and I suspect the US will be next. The argument that it increases sexual pleasure is also bogus, hell Victorian physicians removed the foreskin to make masturbation less pleasurable in order to discourage it (They believed it was linked to mental illness.)  Open up a medical textbook and look at the massive collection of mechanoreceptors in the foreskin.

Being circumcised is also much cleaner, I could careless what the antis say, but uncut guys can wash 3x a day and still have an odor. It is also much healthier to be circumcised, uncircumcised males have a 60% higher chance of acquiring HIV and STDs through heterosexual intercourse. It also looks much better, an anteater is not pleasant to the eye! Being circumcised is so far superior that I had no hesitation to have my 3 boys (5,3,1) circumcised, as I know that there is no downside, only a lifetime of benefits.
