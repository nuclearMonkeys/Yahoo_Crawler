For 90% of all women, a missed period is the first and only sign of pregnancy.  The key to knowing when to test has to do with ovulation date and the date the woman's period is expected.  If you are tracking ovulation and she ovulated about seven days ago, it is too soon to test.  If she has not missed her period yet, it is too early too test.   I'd suggest you wait until her period is at least 5 days late before testing. ", 7561, "RVK1NrNJaa", 0],

	54221 : ["Probably same way we use Greek Delta and Pi symbols for Defendant and Plaintiff. The Greek Symbol for the letter \"D\" called \"Delta\" is a \"Δ,\" symbol, and the Greek Symbol for the letter \"P\" or Pi is the \"π\" symbol. Lawyers often use these symbols when little handwritten notations or amendments need to be made to a legal document where there's limited space in margins and need to initial and sign off on and changes cannot be retyped or would be inconvenient to do so, etc. E.g., perhaps changes to a settlement agreement made last minute between parties in court or something. Additionally these symbols are very different looking so unlikely to confuse, if somebody has bad handwriting, (unlike p's and d's that could look alike...) and these symbols are also a form of universally recognized legal shorthand, so everybody knows what they mean. Along the same vein of thinking, since Defendant starts with \"D\" and \"Doe\" starts with \"D\" and \"Doe\" sounds like \"I don't know\" or \"so and so,\" it probably just worked and made sense. In civil actions they use \"Roe\" which stands for \"Respondent,\" and they both start with \"R.\" To be honest though, there's no real answer to this, as this practice can actually be traced back to 1300's in King Edward III's reign, and there's just no clear explanation or express reason noted anywhere for why these codenames became adopted. However, the lack of any express definition of their usage, in and of itself, actually leads me to believe it was developed informally as more of a commonly understood convenient way to identify unknown parties. It's short, starts with the same letter, and it just sounds fictitious and probably figured nobody's named \"John Doe\" or \"John Doo\" for real, so not likely to mix up with a real person. Whereas if you used \"John Smith,\" that could be 500 guys in one town! That, and it rhymes with \"I don't know\" so it's just common sense. Whoever first began using it probably thought, this is easy enough to figure out, I'll just write this. And then others saw it and were like, hey that's a good way to do that, and everybody started using it, and then after a while, it's so commonplace, nobody even remembers who first used it, and now we all are asking this 700 years later, but nobody even knows how it started...", 7569, "HpJ4wwC7aa", 0],
