	59732 : ["Nothing 1. The Spirit awakens a person's heart. The word \"heart\" is generally meant to mean emotions. I have emotions, and I'm an atheist. 2. The Spirit teaches a person's mind. No spirit has taught anybody anything. The mind is taught by teachers or by direct experience. 3. The Spirit leads to the Word. The \"word\" is meant to mean \"The Bible\". I know it more than the average Christian and I'm an atheist. In fact, objectively reading the Bible is likely to make a person an atheist. 4. The Spirit convinces of sin. Sin is an outdated concept. No list of rules is ever complete and always quickly becomes outdated. The only real morality comes from valuing others. 5. The Spirit draws to Christ. The whole New Testament was written decades after Jesus was supposedly killed, if he existed at all. It was written by people who never even met him. 6. The Spirit sanctifies. There is nothing that is really \"holy\", since there are no real gods. This is a null statement. 7. The Spirit makes a person spiritually minded. This basically says nothing. 8. The Spirit produces inward conflict. Religion creates cognitive dissonance, which is a type of internal conflict when someone believes two contradictory things at the same time, such as \"The Bible is true\" and \"Science is true\". Actually, thinking the Bible is true is enough to give you cognitive dissonance because of all its self-contradictions. 9. The Spirit makes a person love the brethren. My love for other people is not dependent on any religious dogma. 10. The Spirit teaches a person to pray. Praying is a way for people to feel good about doing something, without actually having to do anything. It is no better than a placebo. Since the \"Holy Spirit\" doesn't really exist, it can't do anything. It can't even have a presence. Souls don't exist either. Religion is superstition.", 8053, "AA11755204", 0],

	59741 : ["The neediness is completely understandable, as is the hyper climbing-the-walls thing with a seven-year-old boy. Unfortunately, yes, the gameboy addiction is also normal. My older son, in particular, has a bit of addiction to video games (as in he could play it for days straight if we let him).  We've started physically taking it away most of the time now, and it's up on top of a bookshelf in my husband's office.  During the week, if he's VERY good at preschool, he gets about thirty minutes of computer/video game time, and then it goes back up to the bookshelf.  The only other time he gets to play it is if he's missing school from being sick.  On the weekends, he gets it for about an hour or so a day.  He knows that it will be the first privilege to go if he or his brother misbehaves, though. You've GOT to force your son out of the video game/computer game/tv addiction.  Having all three of his favorite activities be nonproductive and sedative is just not healthy for any kid, especially one at that age. I think that if you're there for him in every way that you can be, eventually the neediness will begin to wan. Do some of his favorite activities, but also continue to play outside with him, as well as read together and just talk or hang out together.  More than anything THAT will help him realize that you and your ex-wife are there for him, and eventually he'll feel more secure in your relationship than he seems to at the moment. But PLEASE, lock up the gameboy and turn off the tv the majority of the time.  They are addictive and they are not healthy for young kids, developmentally or physically. BTW, gaming is becoming more and more an acceptable pasttime for adults, so it's not like it's something he'll necessarily need to \"grow out of\", but it's never healthy to do it a LOT.  My husband and his best friends are all gamers.  They're also very very responsible, all with good jobs, all with families they take care of well.  The person who suggested that playing video games and being a \"gamer\" is a road to an irresponsible mooching lifestyle was out of line.  It's becoming more and more mainstream.  But, like I said, it needs to be limited, ESPECIALLY for a child. Lori K hit the mark, your son, like most kids of divided families, is needy.  It's completely understandable.  He may benefit from a counselor for the neediness and other issues he has trouble with as a result of your divorce, and joining the Scouts or a soccer team or a karate class or something like that may help him make friends (which you don't mention -- does he have many?) and get him off the couch.", 8054, "c3dcff4a3f7cc2934c0ee92bae3fa5eeaa", 0],
	59742 : ["Jihad is a \"holy war\", like the Crusades.

The latter is what appears to be what you ask so that is the way I'll answer first.  The ultimate goal of Islam is also \"Eternal Salvation\" although of course between Islam and Christianity, there are differences in belief and as to how exactly salvation is achieved. If you want more information about the specific details of that, I will add some.  As for the \"goal of Islam\" on earth, it is the same as Christianity, as both Muslims and Christian want to rule the world even if they don't admit it.

I felt like it was an answer and ever since the day, whenever I am in a desperate...ST JUDE helps me out with his intercession. The next thing is really AMAZING. I am not raised in a christian family. So I HARDLY KNEW about Saints. During the time when I was sick and I had already accepted Jesus as my saviour, I had this dream. In the dream, I was in a church. The church was known as the CHURCH OF ST BERNADETTE. Seriously, I have never seen or heard of the saint nor the church before.  The next morning, I just briefly wrote the name of the church. Then I realised it was actually the name of a saint. I also read that she had digestive problems(just like me at that time).

Individually, it's obviously not the best course of action, but the comfort provided by the idea that society as a whole will benefit (whether or not it actually will) could be enough. I guess I have a more utilitarian point of view. As long as I am alive, I would like to be as happy as I can. Part of that is making ohers around me happy.
