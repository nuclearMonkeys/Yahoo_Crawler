	45149 : ["Vegetarians eat animal products. They just don't eat MEAT of land animals or birds. They definite consume eggs, cheese, milk, honey, etc.  Many even eat seafood. You are confusing vegetarians with vegans.   Vegans eat no animals and nothing that COMES from animals.  And there is no guarantee of what you are eating unless you cook it from scratch yourself.   Going vegetarian or vegan is a choice, and eating animal products is not harmful.  In fact, as many vegans and vegetarians age, they have to start eating meat to retain their health. Even the Dalai Lama has been ordered by his medical doctors to eat meat. My own sister - a vegetarian nutritionist before she retired - was a vegetarian for over 35 years, but eventually had to start eating meat again so that she could retain her energy and strength.  But it is FINE to eat vegan/vegetarian as long as your health remains strong.", 6487, "sMtpQ4f2aa", 1],

The majority of vegetarians simply avoid eating meat or anything that comes from a dead animal. They're not obsessive, crazy people! Also, in many countries, if something is claimed to be “vegetarian” then that's what it has to be. Obviously some people break the law or or ignorant of regulations but most of us just accept that things are what they are claimed to be. I'd guess you wouldn't want to eat rat or cat, but how could you be SURE it wasn't included in something you ate? You can't be, you just accept that it isn't.

To make the math easy, let's say that you have ALL 5 at once and they are now newborns. You and your husband need to now earn an EXTRA $27,777 per MONTH in order to raise these children. No, family is NOT for babysitting your kids.  They are not your slaves and you are not a princess.  You are not acting or thinking like an adult. Don't have any more kids until you mature and can support them. NEVER do something that YOU cannot pay for ALL on your own .. because you never have a guarantee that someone else WILL help you out. Stop being a child and relying on your family, because if you keep this up, someday your family will turn you away and you can't exactly stuff your kids back into your womb. You might not be a troll.

	45162 : ["That she is putting out vibes that she thinks you're cute when she has a boyfriend is not a good sign that she's a strong woman. I'd run like the wind. A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money). My suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you're not already) and eventually look for this type of girl (otherwise you're setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately this type of woman is difficult to find - but save yourself the heartache and don't settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps! PS Strong men attract strong women like magnets (as well as weak women - so be careful).
