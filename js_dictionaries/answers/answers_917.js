	51094 : ["In high school, grades matter more than just for scholarships. You are competing with other students for a limited number of college freshman opening spots, so if your grades are not good ENOUGH, you will not be picked for admission to that college. Mostly grades AFTER college matter if you want to go further in your education .. applying for graduate school, for instance. Or medical school.  Or law school.  Or dentistry .. veterinary school ... etc. Some employers care though.  Depends on whether or not you are looking for a job that is in the field of your study .. .such as engingeering, accounting, etc.  If you and another person both have the same degree but one has a much better GPA, usually the one with the better grades will get the job.  Because these are jobs that require you to USE what you learned, so they prefer the person who learned BETTER. Nursing and education also prepare you for a specific type of work, and grades can matter when applying for those jobs. But if you get a general arts degree, often you are hired for the fact that you GOT an education at all.  My daughter in law got her degree in anthropology and was hired by an insurance company to be trained to become an insurance adjuster .. because she had a college degree. A college degree tells an employer that you can understand and follow instructions ..  even complicated ones.  That you can research information without needing to have it spoon-fed to you by someone else.  That you can evaluate information to arrive at reasonable conclusions .. that you know how to think and have a reasonable level of intelligence.  That you can clearly communicate what you conclusions you have made from your research.  And that you can do all these things within a required deadline.  And meet their expectations and needs. These are the skills that are required for any white-collar job that pays well. Nonetheless, SOME blue-collar tradespeople make more money than someone with a Bachelor's degree. I have a friend who got a degree in Education and taught for a while .. but started working seasonally on a paving crew as a labourer, and eventually worked his way up to become superintendent and made as much money as any engineer or accountant.", 7176, "sMtpQ4f2aa", 0],
