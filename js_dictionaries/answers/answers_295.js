You're lucky that you're starting during Biden's term- no thanks to Alabama! If you're going to be in Tuscaloosa, I have a few words of advice: 1. Keep your political opinions to yourself. Either way, it's going to get you in trouble. 2. Show reverence for Bear Bryant ( you'll be attending events in Bear Bryant stadium, on Bear Bryant Drive)- he's a former football coach ranked just slightly below Jesus in the eyes of Alabamans.  3.
