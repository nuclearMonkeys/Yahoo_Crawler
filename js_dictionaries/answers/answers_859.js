I felt so bad for her. Called a Black hair salon and asked them. The lady told me no way that was caused by those cornrow extensions. Talked to a very experienced White lady hair stylist and she told me it doesn't hurt Black peoples hair but yeah it absolutely does White peoples hair. She said her sister did the same thing with the same results and she had to brush her hair alot every day for about a year til it finally grew back. Said it wasn't the extensions but the tight pull of cornrows. ", 6744, "t4doY3Y5aa", 1],

	47593 : ["I suggest just using tacky glue and some paperclips, I have to wear a mask at work and it is AWFUL the ones they sew. I made mine with a wire frame and it doesn't steam up my glasses(adheres to nose area) and it doesn't make me suffocate (downwards ventilation), and it doesn't hurt my ears(ribbon tied around head rather than hair ties around ears). Though I'm more of a card maker than a sewer, I highly suggest making it my way. Just make sure you glue everything around the top 3/4ths of it so that you can take the fabric off the frame like a pocket, then hand wash in cold water if you use tacky glue(tacky glue doesn't survive a hot wash). Also make sure that the inside fabric is concave so that you have room to breath. Whether you follow my advice or not, I hope you stay safe and well!", 6735, "h09eGqIQaa", -2],

	47620 : ["First: if the machine won't start unless you turn the wheel then it's time for a pro to look at it. It might need a good cleaning and de-gunking. Fibers can get inside a machine and if the grease inside gets clogged up with fibers it will harden and make the machine slow and in some cases stop it. Next: is the machine in gear? Occasionally the bobbin winder clutch on the wheel seems disengaged but it isn't. Ensure that the clutch is fully engaged when switching between winding bobbins and sewing. Check around the bobbin area for loose threads, lint and tangled threads.  If loose threads get wrapped up in the bobbin area in my one industrial machine it will jam up completely. If your machine is old then it might be nearing the end of its life. Sewing machines from the 70's and 80's were made to last 10 years and then fail forcing people to buy a new one.  So start with a good cleaning inside and out. Check the bobbin area for lint and loose threads. Ensure the threading path to the needle is clear of lint and threads. Check the clutch on the handwheel to ensure its in the right gear. Try sewing without rotating the wheel.  If none of that helps then it's time for a servicing  by a pro.", 6748, "qQqC2cHIaa", 0],
