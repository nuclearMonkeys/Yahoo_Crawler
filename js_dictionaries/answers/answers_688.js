	38218 : ["This is a story about Jack. Jack wants a job. Any job. He needs money because allowance from his parents isn't paying the bills anymore. But Jack has never had to apply for a job before. So he did what most people do. Jack Googled “How do I get a job?” After getting lost reading several dozen how-tos and subreddits Jack got worried. None of the advice told him what he could do today. Jack was sad, confused, and still broke. Jack doesn't have any experience. He doesn't have a resume – let alone a “good” resume. He still needs a job and his online reading made him feel like an unqualified loser. But Jack wasn't going to give up that easy. He decided he'd go visit some local businesses in-person to see what he could do. The first place he visits is the grocery store, where he's greeted by a manager. Jack asks him about the now hiring sign he saw outside – “How could I work for you?” The manager tells him that he's looking for people who will work hard and show up on time. He asks Jack if he can do that. Jack tells him he's never had a job before. “I'm willing to give it my best try.” The manager tells him he's leery of anyone who has never worked before. “I've had a lot of people applying for this job, son,” he tells Jack, “Why should I hire you?” Jack doesn't know, so he tells the manager the only answer he can think of – the truth. **“Honestly, sir, I don't know why you should pick me over anyone else, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to learn.”** The manager tells Jack to come back Saturday for a test run. “You get one shot to prove yourself, don't be late.” On Saturday, Jack showed up early. He got a new haircut the night before, and picked out clean clothes. His shirt is tucked in and he's wearing a belt. The manager greets him again. He tells him he'd like Jack to sweep the floor to start and points him to the back room where the brooms are kept. Jack doesn't wait for instructions. Jack races to the back room. He grabs the dust mop and he sets off around the store. When he encounters guests, Jack politely waits for them to move. One guest stopped Jack. “Sir, do you know which aisle I can find the grape jelly?” Jack doesn't know, so he tells her the only answer he can think of – the truth. “No, ma'am, I do not. But give me one second to find out and I'll be right back.” Jack races to the front of the store, reading the signs as he moves. There, on aisle two, he spots it: “Condiments.” And he tears down the aisle, grabs a jar of Smucker's Grape, and hurries back to the customer. “Ma'am, I went ahead and grabbed you a jar, but the grape jelly is on aisle two, so you know next time.” The customer smiles and accepts the jelly. She tells Jack how nice it is to meet such a polite young lad, and that she'd have to put in a nice word with his boss. When the manager heard the customer's story, he found Jack and told him he'd like to give him a shot. Jack's heart did cartwheels. He found a job! But he wanted to be sure why. So he asked. “Sir, if you don't mind me asking, what made you decide to take a chance on me? After all, I don't have any skills.” The manager told Jack he passed the test with flying colors. “You told me the truth. You showed up on time. You jumped to get to work when you first got here. You wore a smile. You put the customer's needs over your task at hand. You're just the kind of person we want to teach.” Jack beamed all the way home that day. He knew he had learned a valuable lesson. Getting a job wasn't as difficult as he first feared. It was okay he didn't know how to get a job – because he was willing to ask what it took, and go out of his way to prove he could do it. It was okay that he didn't have skills – because he was honest about it. It was okay that he didn't have experience – because he was willing to prove he'd work hard to learn. … Jack's story can teach us all a lot. Regardless of what job we're trying to land. Jack's whatever-it-takes attitude, paired with his commitment to proving it paid off for him. And next time you're looking for a job, it could pay off for you, too.", 5639, "None", 2],

	38224 : ["Leicester Cathedral is at the physical heart of the Leicester, situated in Leicester's Old Town. The Cathedral famously houses King Richard III's tomb. The church was built on the site of Roman ruins and is dedicated to St Martin of Tours, a 4th century Roman officer who became a Bishop. It is almost certainly one of six churches referred to in the Domesday Book (1086) and portions of the current building can be traced to a 12th century Norman church which was rebuilt in the 13th and 15th centuries. In the Middle Ages, its site next to Leicester's Guild Hall, ensured that St Martin's became Leicester's Civic Church with strong ties to the merchants and guilds of the town. The building you see today is predominantly Victorian. The tower and 220 foot spire were designed by the architect Raphael Brandon and were rebuilt in the 1860s. In 1927 St Martin's was dedicated as Leicester's Cathedral when the diocese was re-created, over 1,000 years after the last Saxon Bishop of Leicester fled from the invading Danes. Today over one hundred thousand people visit Leicester Cathedral every year, primarily to see the tomb of King Richard III, the last English monarch to die in battle.", 5665, "2Blu0glVaa", 1],
