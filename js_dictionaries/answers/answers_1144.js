	62686 : ["You didn't put limitations on your question (specifically, whether or not what anybody answers with is possible, legally or otherwise).  So I will answer with what IS the biggest problem in pro wrestling today: Vince McMahon's monopoly on the business. I wouldn't even begin to know how it would be legally possible to put limitations on Vince and the WWE.  He is allowed to advertise, rent buildings to hold events, and to obtain as many hours on TV on as many networks as he can.  If there IS a legal way to put limits on that, I sure don't know what it is. But that is the biggest problem with the wrestling business.  Vince's monopoly prevents other promotions from having any sort of fair chance at growing and succeeding.  He uses underhanded means to control which promotions are \"allowed\" to use the same arenas he uses (i.e. \"if you rent this arena to promotion X I won't bring the WWE back here and you will lose the profits you would have made and I will take the WWE to your competitor and make money for HIM\"). If a promotion gets on the map and grows popular, Vince runs WWE shows in their big markets on the same nights.  Vince \"raids\" other promotions' rosters, taking their biggest draws by offering more money than the smaller promotion can pay, whether or not he can actually use those local draws. Vince controls the wrestling business in North America.  He has the money and the power to do so.  Because of that he has created a monopoly and has flooded the market with the WWE, effectively preventing any other promotion a fair chance at success.  We are inundated with the \"same old same old\" from the WWE month after month, year after year.  There is no alternative to this (except TNA, but Vince's propaganda has most WWE fans spitting on TNA). I guess the only way to keep Vince in check and to give other promotions a fair shot at success (thus creating infinitely more variety in our choices for wrestling) is to recreate a \"governing board\" (as the NWA was in the past).  In this case Vince would be just one member of a Board of many equal members and he would no longer control the entire business. Vince would be forced to constantly innovate his product to compete with other promotions rather than dictate to the fans what they want, like it or not. The one thing in the wrestling business I would change is to bring back a \"governing board\" of ALL North American promoters to limit Vince's power and to give everybody else a fair shot at success, succeeding or failing by their own talent, rather than Vince bullying and/or shutting them down.  This would create a variety of wrestling shows not seen since the heyday of the NWA \"territories\".  Vince would be forced to put his efforts into innovating the WWE and to keep it from stagnating.", 8175, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 8],
