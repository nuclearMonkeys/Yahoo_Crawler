It does indeed and, unfortunately, yes, you most certainly are...:) Anyway, there was a very personal and bitter U.S. Senate campaign in 1950 in which George Smathers trashed his opponent, Claude Pepper any way he could.  Since it was in the middle of the Cold War and the Red Scare, he called him The RED Pepper. Also, popular legend has it that he accused Pepper of being a known extrovert who practiced nepotism with a sister-in-law, his sister of being a thespian and his brother of being a practicing homo sapiens. He swore that Pepper practiced celibacy before he married and that in college he had publicly matriculated.  Smathers won.", 9810, "KbnUq585aa", 0],

	102476 : ["There are some things to think about here. One would be how close you were to your grandma. If she was someone that you saw on a regular basis and talked to on the phone in between visits then I would say that maybe her death has not hit you yet. However if she was someone whom you had limited contact with then maybe you are not going to go into deep grieving.  Also was she elderly (sometimes grandparents are still young) however if you felt that she was elderly then maybe you feel that she is better off. Even more so since she had a disease you may feel she is in a better place. Then since she had an illness that you knew would eventually cause death maybe you have already prepared yourself for the loss and that is why you are not grieving more.  None of it means that you did not care for your grandma it is all just a reaction based on your beliefs.", 9815, "None", 1],

In spite of this I didn't feel it for about a year. I was talking to my friends having a normal conversation and just burst into tears and hysterics. It's quite normal. Sometimes you feel like you don't have time to grieve and you just need to push on, like there's no need for distress when the loved one was already sick. It's like you've been faced with the inevitable; you knew it was coming. Do you feel bothered that you didn't love her enough? Because that's not true at all, just deal with it in your own way so long as you're not hurting yourself or anyone else. I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm glad to hear that she went peacefully and that you're open to acceptance.  <3", 9815, "8vpHXtCRaa", 0],
	102478 : ["It is sad when you lose your pets, they love you no matter what & are there for you thru the good and the bad.  It is also tough being a teenager.  Life is not fair & there are times when we all have felt as you do. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had a tumour.. I cried & was heartbroken and I am 46 years old & a mom.  I swore I'd never get another dog but as fate would have it someone had to find a good home for their dog & I love him soo much...He didn't replace my dog but he helped me heal.  Pets and people don't live forever so it is heart breaking when something happens and worse when you lose three so close together.  There's nothing you could have done different to help them no more than I could get rid of the tumour my babe had.  When I was 15 I was very depressed & thought I had no future either, no hope.. you may not think it but things do get better..I have a job, a family and even though my life someimes does not go according to plan I take the good days with the bad. You may need a little bit of help to pull yourself out of that black hole you are sinking into.  Talk to your parents, a doctor, someone to let them know how you feel.  We love our children but we can't read your mind and sometimes we are so busy we don't notice when things are wrong.", 9816, "326YGGqmaa", 0],
	102479 : ["Your future is a long way off your just 16 and I know things can seem awful nowbut you cannot base what you future life will hold on the death of three pets. Each one of the pets deaths is terrible and painful and you should mourn their losses, but you cannot give up. It sounds like each one of the pets would have suffered even more if they were to prolong their lives. It can be more expensive taking care of a sick pet than taking care of a human. I have lost many pets over the years and I was sad about each one of them but another one came along ad I fell in love with it and the pain for the other pet left. I am glad that I kept on going, believe it or not pain makes us stronger. If you can overcome the death of a pet you can over come the death of a family member and then you can understand how life works, there is a beginning a middle and an end and it is not for us to decide when that shall be. I have a feeling you will get over the pain eventually and that you will be glad that you experienced so early so that it can help prepare you for a full, exciting and wonderful life ahead.", 9816, "ncjgkAyHaa", 0],
