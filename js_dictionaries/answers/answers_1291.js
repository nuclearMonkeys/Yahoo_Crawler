I cannot say for certainty that companies will treat their livestock humanely as companies do push different agendas, one being to cut corners to save profit & depending on where you are geographically the laws may be lax on inspections. But there definitely are livestock that are treated humanely, based on my experience this is 100% the case of sole traders (ie family farms as others would recognise it). They cannot afford to treat their cattle inhumanely due to lower quality production which is the competeitive niche of sole traders.  I suggest checking sole trader options over big scale companies, the farmers in Ireland milk their cows after a day in the fields with their young & the hens are roaming the yards. I'm sure where you live there is most definitely the same type of farms, also if you are in the EU you'd do good to check the EU laws on free range & what is/isn't free range. We are much more strict than other countries with what the label means", 8539, "None", 1],
	70099 : ["My husband and I get our raw organic milk from a local farm. We visit the farm and we see how they treat the animals. The calves stay with their Moms until they are weaned. The cows and calves roam on green pastures for most of the year. In the winter, when it's too cold for them to go out, they get fed hay. Is it totally humane? No, because of course the male calves are slaughtered after they are weaned, for beef. However, I don't have a huge issue with that because in the wild animals kill each other. I do have a huge issue with tearing babies from their moms, which happens in the dairy industry, and with forcing animals to live in tiny pens or fetid barns, standing in their own manure. At least with this organic farm, the animals can do normal cow things - graze, hang out together, nuzzle and feed their babies, etc.", 8539, "5B6LNSujaa", 1],
