Did you also see this part oif it? \"There are a couple other problems for Clinton in claiming the lead in the popular vote. Even using her criteria of counting Michigan and Florida, her lead may not last more than two weeks. That's because Obama is heavily favored to win the largest state left to vote, North Carolina, on May 6. Obama also is likely to win South Dakota and Oregon. Even if Clinton won all the other contests left — Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Montana, Puerto Rico and Guam — they are smaller contests that will make it difficult for her to catch back up.\"", 9168, "None", -1],
	84816 : ["I think they know that, but don't understand the significance of it so they shrug it off as immaterial.  Any argument about Obama's possible shortcomings in the general and they put their fingers in their ears and sing \"La la la la la\" until it goes away.  HIllary is counting FL and MI when she says she has won the popular vote, but since the super delegates will not accept that as kosher, it isn't going to matter.  But last night she cut Obama's lead in the popular vote by a 1/3.  It's entirely possible she will surpass him in that even without FL and MI.  They'll be a few super delegates in the next couple of weeks who will give in to Dean's nagging and throw their votes Obama's way and be done with it.  But the balance of them are waiting to see what happens in Indiana.  NC is of no concern to them.  They know Obama will win there because of the huge black population, and it's a red state anyway, immaterial to the Democrats.  They are very aware that the trend is troubling when it comes to Obama regarding states like Ohio and PA and what that says about his electability.  They have a lot to consider, especially if Hillary wins in Indiana, and I believe she will.", 9168, "None", 0],

And that is not reflected in closed primaries.  It's even possible that some states with a large black population would go Democrat because there are enough blacks to carry the state for him. PS  Hillary's not ahead in the popular vote.  FL and MI are not counted because they broke party rules.  Obama is ahead in everything.", 9168, "99f1f4239ec0553f5758442ab8a3f1c8aa", -2],

Obama would get Republican votes, but no Republican on the planet will vote for Hillary.  Obama could easily win or split the undecided vote, but Hillary would lose the undecided vote because of her far-left leaning political beliefs and her negative campaign tactics.  And if you think all the Obama supporters will simply bow their heads and support Hillary, think again.  SHE is dividing the Democratic Party, and idiot-boy Howard Dean is too blind to see it.

Its this type of double speak that makes me once a clinton supporter shudder at the thought of her dishonesty. It just reminds me of the Bush years think about who committed terrorists acts and who we are at war with does it make since that our efforts are focused in the place where this terrorist is not? ps i support the troops and their honor and patriotism but the fact that they are going back 3 and 4 times sends shivers up my spine.", 9168, "pewQZ25zaa", -6],

I agree with PFLAG; I'm sure that there are a lot of people in that group who have dealt with the same situation, and could probably point you in the right direction for starting your new life if your husband decides to remain an animal. I would try and let your son know that you love him as much as you can, because he's probably very suicidal at the moment. Try and organise some therapy for the two of you, which could probably be organised through PFLAG as well (God, I love that group).
