	127531 : ["only if you believe that humans were made in the image of God do you see any difference. otherwise, most elite evolutionists actually believe that the human race is the pest of Earth & should be killed off. Most humans throughout history by reason held to a belief in the sovereignty of mankind because there was no other rational explanation other than that we were meant to have dominion over other animals. we posses a depth of cause-effect reason ability that separates us from animals by an infinite gulf; we can conceive of eternity, we have an innate longing for something to worship that's beyond the world we already know, we have the scientific method, which we can discern the function of the entire universe from one singular standpoint. but there has always been evolutionary chance-based ideology. It started with places like Assyria, Babylon, Egypt & many ancient worlds. Since the closing of the bible-cannon it was largely rejected. Then came Darwin & confiscated the subject of origin from the realm of theology & published it as science. From there, Marxist Luciferianism was fully resurrected & the pyramid scheme dominated.

	127538 : ["Plasma TV's are a bit cheaper than LCD, but if you can make it to a showroom with decent lighting, you'll notice that fast motion (football, soccer, running etc.) isn't as clear on a plasma screen. Plasma's tend to distort motion (at least to my eyes) and I also noticed 'digital artifacts' on the plasma screen more so than on an LCD.  Go with the LCD. I bought a 40\" Samsung LCD and absolutely love it! ...so does my girlfriend. edit: Oh yeah, also look for a TV with HDTV. More cable companies are starting to beef up their HDTV channel offering. The only problem is that if you DO get a channel not encoded in HDTV, the picture will be squished due to the decreased resolution.", 10948, "wGwPY5Bwaa", 0],

	127540 : ["Well, these days it really depends a lot on what you want. For example, do you want HUD?  if so, then you'll probably want plasma or LCD.  Then, with those choices, you'll have to decide if you want the low-light, fast action performance of a plasma or if you have a high ambient light environment and you can deal with the slight flicker (due to the LCD response time), then LCD is better. In general, LCD display consume less power than plasma or their CRT counterparts.  So if saving energy is part of your goal, pick LCD.

	127541 : ["I'm not gay, but I went to a very VERY large state college that had a pretty significant gay population. I played rugby (good place to find lesbians--about half the team was gay) and I had a lesbian roommate. I never noticed any strong anti-gay sentiment at my school, which was a pretty friendly, hippie-type place. Make sure your college is truly gay-friendly.  Even if you don't feel like being militant about it, you don't want to have to hide the fact you're gay because your school is too antagonistic about it. As Chef on South Park says, \"There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college.\" If you want to be more open about your sexuality, I think you'll find that most people are more open about sex, drugs, thinking, pretty much everything.   But don't assume that your sexuality is the cause of your shyness/introversion and that just by being out that you'll solve everything.  If you're shy, you'll be a shy gay guy.  If you're introverted, you'll never really change that because it's not a flaw, just a type of personality. If you have trouble being yourself, look into some therapy.  You can't just go to school with problems and expect to leave them all behind.  They'll follow you EVERYWHERE you go if you don't deal with them properly. But as a young adult going away to college, it's a good opportunity for you to discover who you are and what's important and what you like, so it can be tumultuous but fun.  Don't try everything at once--pace yourself!  You don't have to change all at once, and don't try to force changes in yourself or your relationships.", 10941, "a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa", 1],
	127542 : ["People at the university level are in general more enlightened then people who stopped at a lower educational bracket. Colleges tend to be very liberal, and college is a time when everyone explores new aspects of themselves they had to repress in high school (while they were still living with parents). Everyone tends to be a little confused, a little lonely, and people's perspectives just tweak to be a little more tolerant and open-minded once college begins and they start to get a taste of how broad the real world actually is. If there is any good time to work on your self-confidence as an openly gay man, college is it. Of course there will be those who despise you, marginalize you, but you are going to find out that ALOT of people come out in college.  I was just like you, in fact I was so scared I even waited until halfway through college to drop the act! Not that anyone couldn't tell. Especially if you're one of those people for whom \"acting straight\" is streinuous or transparent, now's the time to relieve yourself of that burden. Go in as openly gay, college is one of the most nurturing environments possible for someone just emerging as non-closeted.", 10941, "4W4eUVguaa", 1],
	127543 : ["During your third trimester, you should be just fine going to classes and studying. Since most of that is done off your feet, and you will want to be sitting and \"relaxing\" anyway, studying shouldn't be a problem. Just try to keep the rest of your life as stress-free as possible, and concentrate on school and keeping yourself and your baby healthy :). Doing school with a newborn will be a little more difficult. Perhaps you could talk to your teachers at the beginning of the semester, and see if you can do extra work before the baby comes so you don't have to do as much AFTER? Depending on the birth, your recovery time could be kind of long. My newborn will be 2 weeks on Monday, and because of the C-section, there are still days when I am in pain. I CAN get out and do a few hours of something, but then I am worn out. There might also be policies at your school that could get you an extension to finish the work after the semester ends so that you have   Break to finish up? One suggestion for doing ANYTHING with a newborn--buy one of those Baby Bjorn carriers, so that you can keep him close and comfortable and other people away from him so he stays healthy. :) They are much easier than strollers in crowded places, especially with tiny babies. Lots of women I know have taken classes right up to giving birth, and gone back to school shortly thereafter. It IS possible, but you will be very tired.", 10941, "t20AO576aa", 0],
