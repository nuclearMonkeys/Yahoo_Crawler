	62637 : ["Personally I would see if someone could take care of the dog temporarily because I would think that after being their for awhile they should be able to find a place that will allow the dog, it's not like it's that big of a dog. I understand that children need to come first but that being said it would be a hard call to make. Certainly not made any easier with these judgmental neighbors who if they really cared about the dog would step up and take it.  Further more with the current state of the economy and people out there just up and leaving their dogs without a home at least this guy is trying to find a home for the dog instead of abandoning it.", 8175, "bel7bYMGaa", 1],
	62638 : ["What I don't understand is why this was an either/or proposition.  Wouldn't it have been possible to take the new job AND find a spot that takes dogs?  Or, at worst, get temporary housing for the dog while he finds a spot that will take all the family and the pet in the new town?  It's harder, but not impossible.  There are very few jobs that I can think of that would require you to live in a specific apartment (apartment manager is about the only one, actually), so I would have negotiated that with my employer when offered the new position. Especially since, if the company is paying for the apartment, you get to pay taxes on the amount of rent that they are covering, since it is considered \"income\".  And if I can find an equally nice spot for less money, then that's less tax I get to pay!", 8175, "8PAv0RQ9aa", 0],

That being said, this is not my family and they have to make the decision that suit them, not me or you or any of their neighbors or friends.  Wife and kids come first always and in this economy, the job is needed so as long as they get a responsible owner for the dog and do NOT just leave him out, then it's ok.  They may have to relinquish him to the Humane Society if things get bad and time runs out.  You sound like a concerned, caring person.  Maybe you could assist them in finding a home for the dog or foster the dog til you and the owner can find a home for him.  Maybe your neighbors could help out too instead of being so judgemental of these people.", 8175, "t9Fxx75uaa", 1],

I found all but one of them homes and i cried and cried because My traveling expenses were high enough as they were without tacking on my 4 precious kitties. But i love my husband and i don't regret having to find new homes for them.  A year and a half later i got one of my cats back anyway. One is with a trustworthy friend and has helped her out (stress). Now if we move our animals are coming with us, if the military says no then i am not going to be moving! !  It's sad that they have to get rid of thier dog to better thier finacial situation and maybe if they are lucky they can find a friend to watch thier dog and when they move into thier apartment, start looking for a new apartment that will allow them?

It's a horrible example to set for my children.  I don't want them to think that it's ever okay to abandon them because they are members of our families.  I want them to see what a commitment means.  They need to be taught that in EVERYTHING they should see it through to the end.  I think that it makes them better adults, better people.  It carries over in how they treat people and in how they will treat their father and I when we age.  That's just my opinion. I would have taken the job and declined the apartment.  They wouldn't have forced me to take it.  I would have explained the situation and that I was unwilling to give up my pet, my children's beloved companion.  There are plenty of places that rent to families with pets.  I could have easily found other housing.", 8175, "kIRILxE6aa", 2],

	62657 : ["One cannot know what a Godless earth would be like, unless we know what we would put in place of the belief in God. Remember, many times when a belief in God is forcibly removed from society, it is replaced by the adoration of a dictator. Hence, what happens is that the religious sentiment is transferred from one object, such as a nonexistent God, to another object, such as a flawed and megalomaniac dictator.  Hence, the mere removal of God is not enough to make a society a better place. We must replace that belief with something wholesome, and uplifting. This replacement belief must also not only prevent the worship of God, but the worship of men. This new belief system must not mention God. It must not glorify any one man at the expense of others.  It must insist on the equality of men, and it must engender belief in science, reason, and evidence. Such a world would be one replete with hope and wonder. Certain societies, like that of Denmark and Sweden have come close to achieving this ideal. They are direct proof that overwhelmingly secular societies are not doomed to the hellish nightmare that was the “Godless” Soviet Union. Secularism can lead to a better way of life as long as that secularism isn't achieved by coercion, as was done in the former Soviet Union, but through slowing convincing society that it is the best path for humanity.", 8176, "2a83d387aec1bc6928d92060e8ac8eaeaa", 0],

	62659 : ["If you ask me, it'd be a lot harder. Whether anything about religion is true or not, it acts as a good short-cut to teaching children good morals. If you try to explain to a 3-year-old why it's important to treat others with respect and kindness, they simply wouldn't understand. I'm not saying they'd NEVER develop morals, but it would definitely take a lot longer for them to learn that they need to treat others they way they would like to be treated. When they grow older, they may choose to abandon religion, and that's fine. As long as they've learned what they needed to from it. On second thought, it'd be like this section on Yahoo Answers. Going through all these answers, every time I come across an answer that remotely implies the existence of God or Gods, it has at least 4 or 5 \"thumb-downs,\" and the opposite for more atheistic ones.

	62675 : ["Exactly as it is now. I see no divine revelations, no miracles, no answered prayers, no preferential good fortune for people of any particular faith, no divine retribution for evildoers, no protection for the virtuous, the innocent or the weak.  Life is exactly as we would expect it to be if there was no divine influence in the world - i.e. good and bad things come to good and bad people alike.  Our lives are subject to chance, and the actions of other people, but that seems to be all. \"Nature does all things spontaneously, by herself, without the meddling of the gods.\" - Titus Lucretius Carus (c.99-55 BCE).   We can see no sign of any divine involvement in the natural world.  Galaxies, stars and planets form because it is in the nature of matter to do so.  Living organisms evolve and diverge by the unthinking, undirected process of evolution.  There is no plan, no design, just the effects of probability and the properties of matter and forces.  Many people will claim to the contrary, but as far as I can tell this just reflects an ignorance about how the natural world really is, rather than the perception of any higher truth.", 8176, "None", 4],

Here is a simple procedure (home remedy) that many people have used to remove warts in one week: Each night before going to bed soak a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar, apply it to the wart and then hold it in place with a band-aid. Leave it on all night, or if you like, 24 hours a day but change the soaked cotton and band-aid each evening for a week. The wart will swell and throb a little as it reacts with the vinegar and then start to turn black (usually with a white ring around it) within the first two days and after a week or two will fall off by itself.
