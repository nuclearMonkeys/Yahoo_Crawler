	142146 : ["actually it refers to a time when women were not educated, and if they didn't understand something in the temple, as the rabbis taught, they called out to their husbands (who sat separated from the women) to explain it to them. the men would shout an answer back. but this got so bad that the rabbis asked that the women wait until after the service to ask their questions, because no one could hear them preaching. if you read the original text in Hebrew, it would make sense. but the translations don't mention that kind of thing. as well, the text is about the Jewish faith, not the Christian one. Jesus had female disciples, and he asked them to spread the news and minister to people, all the time. edit paul is a real problem. he contradicted Christ in many ways. he actually advocated setting people on fire for their sins, not one book after Christ stopped an execution, saying that we have no right to kill people for their sins.  paul did not like women, and told them to do a lot of things, but Christ never did. the women were the first to find out that he had risen, and they went to tell everyone after the angel told them to. they ministered to people all the time.  then paul comes along and tells them to essentially get back in the kitchen. very weird.", 11526, "QPvG3HUzaa", -4],

This heat that it absorbs is obtained from the \"latent heat\" of water making the solution effectively cooler. There is no bond forming between water and Potassium Nitrate. The molecules are interspersed withing the molecules of water. This intermingling of molecules is the one that absorbs energy from the latent heat of water.

	142151 : ["The arrangement of the bubbles is random. Incoming light will enter the material, and sometimes will reflect off the bubbles, sometimes will be refracted by them, but the effect in either case is a random change in the direction of the light. The light will eventually exit the object, either back off the surface where it came in, or out another side. If it exits off the same surface, the effect is that the light is reflected, but it's reflected in a random direction, not according to the rule that angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. When light reflects that way, it's called diffuse reflection, which is the way most objects other than mirror-like objects reflect. You can't make out an image of a reflected object, just the color of light incident on the object, modified by the properties of the object. The clear object filled with bubbles does not modify the color, it reflects the same color as the incident light. That's what white objects do. Note that they don't necessarily reflect white light; they reflect whatever color light is incident on them. It's just that ambient light is often white. If the light passes through, then the object is translucent white.", 11528, "x9Bs0jkTaa", 0],

	142166 : ["Na2NO3 dissolves in water like any other salt: by dividing into its component ions (Na+ and NO3-).  The amount you can dissolve in a given amount of water depends on the temperature.  Warmer = more can dissolve in the water. You can get it back in its solid form either by cooling the water down, reducing the 'carrying capacity' of the water and causing excess salt to precipitate out, or by evaporating all the water, which will leave the salts behind in sold form.

	142191 : ["Preaching is not simply sitting in a church, waiting for people to come to you. As Jesus' example showed preaching required going forth to the people and teaching them. Matthew 9: 35 And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.  4: 23 Then he went around throughout the whole of Gal′i‧lee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people.  The situation in Acts shows us that women were present and received holy spirit. This enabled them to speak in tongues. The purpose? To preach to those speaking different languages. 2 Now while the day of the [festival of] Pentecost was in progress they were all together at the same place, 2 and suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. 3 And tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed about, and one sat upon each one of them, 4 and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance. 14 But Peter stood up with the eleven and raised his voice and made this utterance to them: “Men of Ju‧de′a and all YOU inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to YOU and give ear to my sayings. 15 These [people] are, in fact, not drunk, as YOU suppose, for it is the third hour of the day. 16 On the contrary, this is what was said through the prophet Joel, 17 ‘“And in the last days,” God says, “I shall pour out some of my spirit upon every sort of flesh, and YOUR sons and YOUR daughters will prophesy and YOUR young men will see visions and YOUR old men will dream dreams; 18 and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. 19 And I will give portents in heaven above and signs on earth below, blood and fire and smoke mist; 20 the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and illustrious day of Jehovah arrives. 21 And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”'  Peter himself spoke to this as prophesy being fulfilled that both males and females would have a share in this. However, this is not the same as a woman standing up before the congregation to teach. 1 Timothy 2: 11 Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence.  1 Corinthians 11: 3 But I want YOU to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.  A woman's head is man. If a woman were to preside a over a man in teaching this would disregard the headship arrangement. However Christ commanded all of his disciple to preach the good news to all. Matthew 28:19 Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded YOU. And, look! I am with YOU all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”   Philippians 4: 2 Eu‧o′di‧a I exhort and Syn′ty‧che I exhort to be of the same mind in [the] Lord. 3 Yes, I request you too, genuine yokefellow, keep assisting these [women] who have striven side by side with me in the good news along with Clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. Romans 16: 3 Give my greetings to Pris′ca and Aq′ui‧la my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 4 who have risked their own necks for my soul, to whom not only I but also all the congregations of the nations render thanks;  These three women were fine example of those who were sharing the Good News. Psalm 68:11 Jehovah himself gives the saying; The women telling the good news are a large army. So whereas all of Christ followers have the obligation to preach, women should not assume a teaching role in the congregation.", 11526, "None", 0],
