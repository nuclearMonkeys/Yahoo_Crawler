	43501 : ["Hello Alexander, Regarding the question which suggests Jew(s) blame Christianity for the Holocaust, the Asker provides the reader with:No detail, no objective-sources; zero evidence.I also refer to the answer from contributor \"Beautiful Sunset\" who wrote:\"Palestinian Holocaust [...] Millions of videos on the net of Jews torturing little Palestinian children and their pregnant mommies!\".My response:Zero evidence of any \"Palestinian Holocaust\".Zero evidence of: “Millions of videos on the net of Jews torturing [...]”.Contributor \"Beautiful Sunset\" also uploaded an image of an Israeli soldier restraining a child during an attempted arrest:- - - - Start of extract: - - - - [Heading:] “WATCH: In Nabi Saleh, an all too predictable black eye for Israel” “The ubiquity of the media in the West Bank means that almost every confrontation between IDF soldiers and Palestinians is a viral video waiting to happen By ERIC CORTELLESSA [reporter on scene] 31 August 2015, 7:19 pm” “ABI SALEH, West Bank - Their faces covered in bandanas, a group of adolescent Palestinian [“Palestinian” Arab] boys led the march from the West Bank Palestinian village [settlement*] of Nabi Saleh toward the neighboring Jewish settlement [village*] of Halamish. Behind them was a large crowd of villagers [“Palestinian” Arab settlers] - some older and some younger - activists and members of the media. Some were waving Palestinian flags; some were holding gas masks; many had cameras. Down the road, Israeli Defense Forces soldiers awaited them, as they do every Friday, in an effort to prevent the demonstration from reaching Halamish and the main road. This routine protest against settlement construction in Nabi Saleh set the stage for an incident that was caught on video and made news headlines worldwide: Palestinian [“Palestinian” Arab] women and children preventing an IDF soldier from arresting 12-year-old Muhammad Tamimi, who was suspected of stone-throwing. The altercation left the soldier with light wounds, and Israel with a black eye on the world stage. “[...] Meanwhile kids started running up a brown hill to throw more rocks at the soldiers, some with slingshots, some with their hands. The exchange continued for a while, shifting locations several times. At one point the demonstrators blocked the road. Little kids, under the leadership of the adolescents, began to take large rocks and line them up in the middle of the street. “They are blocking the army's jeeps from driving up the road to come from behind later,” someone told me. The protest then shifted to an adjacent hill, where adolescents and younger children threw more rocks [sling-shots pictured] at soldiers as adult villagers [“Palestinian” Arab settlers] and activists watched and cheered. And then, suddenly, people started screaming. A team of soldiers had rushed the demonstrators from behind to start making arrests. At the same time, other soldiers ran up from the bottom of the hill and grabbed one of the adolescents. A partially masked soldier with a rifle in his hand was chasing a younger boy [Muhammad Tamimi, as above] whose arm was in a cast. I ran toward the fracas just as the soldier picked up the boy, grabbed him by the neck and pressed him against a rock, putting him in a chokehold while he lay on top of him. A young girl, Ahed Tamimi, the boy's 15-year-old sister, then ran to the scene and began yelling and crying, pleading with the soldier to let him go. Everyone who had a camera ran to the scene, too, with photographers and videographers forming a half-circle around the melee. At that point, the soldier must have realized that whatever he chose to do would live beyond that moment. An older female villager - Nariman Tamimi, the boy's mother - came from behind the soldier and began pulling him off the boy. The soldier screamed for help as more people joined the effort. He then tried simultaneously to pin the boy down and fight off everyone else. The young girl bit his hand when he tried to grab her by the neck. Everyone around him then started to hit the soldier on the head. Finally, his commander came and extricated him from the imbroglio. [...] The soldier and his commander had left without making the arrest.”  * Note:My added words placed within squared brackets: “settlement” / “settlers” / “village”: The Jews (Jew=citizen of Judah) have unbroken-presence in their ancestral homeland of Israel from Biblical times; the Arabs arrived much later.
