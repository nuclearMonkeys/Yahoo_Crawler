I wanted to look professional and older since I have one of those perpetual baby faces that makes people assume I'm incapable and incompetent. Long story short, I got hit on a lot. It didn't matter if the men were single, married, old, young, wealthy, poor, I was always being pestered. All I wanted was to make money and then go home. Particularly the older men irked me b/ca well, they were revolting and disgusting. I even had an old dude in a mobilized cart zoom by and pinch my azz. I'm like, \"WTF!\". So I started wearing my hair frizzed out, baggy pants, I wore tight bras, sometimes even wrapping my breasts to hide them, no more make up, and I tried my best to keep a blank, disdainful face.  It worked, mostly. I still got hit on but less often. I didn't realize how your looks play such a big role in how people view you. It's a shame.", 9512, "None", 4],

Kept myself to myself during high school. Completed my GCSE's and got average grades. Hated high school and refused to study or participate. Went to college. Did 4 A-Levels and got average-above average grades. Really enjoyed college but could have worked harder. Left college at age 18. Completed NVQ Level 3 for Nursing in one year. Worked as a support worker for adults with learning disabilities. Great job. It paid my way through university. I got a Bachelor's in Geography, and eventually completed my Master's online last year. I really enjoyed university, so I actually applied myself and put the effort in. Then at age 23 I moved to San Diego, CA from that lonely little town in England. Been living the life in California. Used my geography degree to land a job at an archaeological firm in San Diego. I'm now soon to turn 27. I have a great job, a house and a life.

	94574 : ["It's very sad that your father died. You have my condolences. However, you need to understand that everything that you have seen is perfectly natural. There is nothing spooky or supernatural going on here. People have evolved to have highly developed pattern-recognition and pattern-remembering skills. No doubt this would have helped our distant ancestors when they were following the changing of day to night and back again, the cycling of the seasons, the movements of animals, and so on. People find it easy to spot patterns and to remember them. But this can easily go too far, and make people imagine patterns that aren't there. And when they think they've seen a pattern, it will stick in their minds, even if the supposed pattern was just a random chance occurrence. Our society is highly literate and numerate, compared to societies of centuries past, and we are now surrounded by numbers at all times. People live in houses, and the houses are numbered. People have mobile phones, and those phones have numbers. People have clocks on the walls and watches on their wrists, and a lot of those have digital displays. Numbers are all around us, all the time. Most of the time, we take no notice, because we are so used to it. If you were to note down every number that you encountered, you would soon end up with pages and pages full of numbers, and they would make a ridiculous random mess. Of course, nobody does note down every number that they come across. They wouldn't have time, for one thing. But sometimes, if a number has a particular pattern, their instinct for pattern recognition will kick in, and they will take notice, and be more likely to remember it. They will have seen hundreds of random numbers all through the day, but they won't remember seeing those ones. They'll mentally filter them out, and just remember the tiny apparent patterns in the sea of randomness. And if they are of a superstitious frame of mind, they may imagine that something special is going on. It isn't. They've just got a very selective memory, and an over-active imagination! Look at that time and date again: \"3am on the dot on Jan 3, 2012\" Year: 2012 Month: 1 Day: 3 Hour: 3 Minute: 0 What numbers appear there? There are two zeros, two ones, two twos, and two threes. There are not three threes, and indeed there are no more threes than there are zeros, ones, or twos. There is no real pattern. But because you have a thing about the number three, you have fixated on the threes in that date and time, and mentally filtered out the other numbers. This is your pattern-recognition instinct going into overdrive. There are no patterns there. You are just seeing what your brain is primed to want to see. When you see what seems to be a pattern, you need to remind yourself that your brain is a pattern-recognising machine, and that it can go into overdrive and see patterns that are not real. Step back and look at the context, and see how much randomness you had to get through to see this pattern. You'll find that there are more numbers that are unpatterned, and that you have just mentally filtered them out. Your brain is just seeing what it wants to see. Wikipedia says that Michael Shermer coined the word \"patternicity\", defining it as \"the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise\". Have a read of the Wikipedia article on \"apophenia\" (see source below), which is a related concept.", 9515, "9ec7BBgpaa", 1],

Third, you probably will have to include your father's financial information in your FAFSA.  If your father is paying your mother $4000/month in alimony, he must have a lot of income himself.

I too lost my dad to leukemia 9/11/10. Since then, my husband took ill and had to be on short term disability at his work. I had to have emergency surgery for a ruptured gallbladder and both my daughter and husband were sick and hospitalized the summer of 2013. Continuing our year of bad luck my husband was let go by his employer of 13 years. He is physically unable to work so we have to live on what I make for a family of 4 $2,000 take home a month. To put that into perspective our rent is $1,450 a month and the cheapest place to rent here in Denver is still like $895.00 for a 2 bedroom. This month (March 2014) we are being evicted. Adding insult to injury, last November, we lost our beloved dog to a rare neuropathy issue in which she tried to chew her arms off. After 2 weeks of trying to get her to heal our vet said she would never get better and we needed to stop her pain by putting her down. We have pretty much had non-stop losses. I am an not a religious person. I'm not an atheist but I don't believe that any of the religions out there have the answer. I have been looking into the option of suicide which would net a sizeable sum of life insurance that my husbands and daughter could use to purchase a home but I keep waking up at precisely 3:33. I told my husband who is a scientist and atheist. He believes it's just coincidental. To that end last night he said let's try an experiment. He gave me 2 strong sleeping pills. I slept very soundly but 1 time turned over and grabbed my phone and guess what time my phone said? 3:33 AM. I started laughing and took a screen shot and went soundly back to sleep.
