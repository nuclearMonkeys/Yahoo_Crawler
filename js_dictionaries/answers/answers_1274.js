	69240 : ["Use your favorite search engine to search for drive wipe or hard drive wipe.  Be sure to note difference between programs that will wipe a drive and programs that will wipe a file.  You will find links to a number of commercial, shareware and freeware programs.  Personally, when I wipe a drive, I use a DOS-based program called WipeDrive.  It was the only tool I could find for a while.  It is still available, but now there are free alternatives, too. I'm going to try this one pretty soon, though.  When you search for a drive wiping program, pay close attention to the description.  If you want to wipe a drive, that is not the same thing as wiping individual files.  It takes a program that will obliterate not only the data on the drive, by overwriting it with various values, but also it should obliterate the drive's formatting and partitioning in the same way.  File wipers might just ignore the empty space of deleted files -- the same deleted file that had your credit card number or your checkbook data, for example.  I like the free, open source software from SourceForge.net.  SourceForge.net is a \"software incubator\" for open source software and provides storage space, bug reporting & tracking facilities, and a version control system for maintaining control over changes to the source code -- all for free to open source projects.  One such project is a disk wiper called Darik's Boot and Nuke (   On its web page, the description reads: \"Darik's Boot and Nuke (\"DBAN\") is a self-contained boot floppy that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.\"  DBAN is available both as an ISO image for burning a CDROM and for a floppy diskette.  The reviews I have read indicate that it is a good tool to have.  I have downloaded and will have both the CDROM and the floppy versions available for my use.  According to their FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) web page, as of version 1 (current is 1.0.6), DBAN can selectively wipe partitions and drives.  Be sure to read the FAQ and the instructions.  Early versions of DBAN were an \"all or nothing solution\" -- you could not choose which drive to nuke (wipe) in a multi-drive system -- it would \"nuke\" every drive it finds in the system.  I have not tried DBAN yet, since I don't want to destroy all the data on any of my hard drives right now.  My suggestion:  unless you need to destroy the data on all the hard drives in the computer (which you would do just prior to giving it to some person or some organization), you should disconnect any hard drive that has data you want to save -- and then boot DBAN.  Of course, most people only have one hard drive in their computer, so that is not an issue for them..  Depending on the hard drive size and the number of overwrites you select, I've seen WipeDrive (the one I bought and use) take 12-16 hours at a medium setting.  That was probably on a 40GB drive, so you need to plan accordingly.  If you need DOD (Department of Defense) level data destruction, plan on leting it run for a long, long, time.  If you want a drive wiped, you should wipe the drive yourself.  It's your data;  make sure it is safe. ", 8502, "HInbRuAAaa", 0],

	69247 : ["Hi, I do not feed ferreal cats, but I have volunteered as a \"socializer\" for a lovely women, who has fed and trapped ferreals for many years.  The trapped ferral cats are taken to a vetereinarian to be spayed /or neutered.  After that, those that cannot be \"socialized\" for adoption purposes are released at feeding stations that have been set up for them.  The ones that can be \"socialized\" we find homes for. My friend sometimes has up to a dozen or more cats living in a garage she has converted for this pupose.  She has them in very comfy cages until they are either released again or homes have been found. There is a whole network of people who are volunteering in this project.  By spaying and neutering the kitties that cannot be 'socialized\" and setting up feeding stations for them, the ferral population has naturally been reduced without having to kill them. It is great fun to play with and pet these beautiful animals. This is the socializing part of the program.  Some are kittens born in the wild, that have not yet gone ferral.  And others are simply ones that have had home but have been abandoned for some reason. The ones that take to human attention are the ones we can find homes for.

	69262 : ["Yes, I feed ferals. I consider them my cats. One of them has been coming for a few months, and went from running away if she heard the sound of a door opening, to loving attention being pet. His/her (still haven't been able to figure it out) is named Smokey. He/she goes by his/her name, and comes when we call. All together, I feed 4 ferals. One of them just showed up a few days ago, and I'm not even kidding, this cat looks like it was bred or something. it's a beautiful white persian with a brown spot on the nose. Soo cute. 3 out of the 4 come every single day..the other comes every few days. Smokey is the only one that isn't scared of people though. We are trying to lure Smokey into the house so we can get him/her to the vet because I noticed his/her eyes are running, and I think he/she has an upper respiritory infection. We are planning on trapping all 4 when I can get a trap. I volunteer at an animal shelter and I put my name down for the trap that they lend out (someone else was using it) and so I should have it in a few days. I do think I noticed that Smokey's ear was a little chipped. I wasn't sure if this means he was already trapped, neutered, and released, or if he just hurt his ear because it isn't that noticeable so it's hard to tell if it was on purpose or not. Just to be safe, I'll have the vet check of course.  I have two cats that live in the house. They are both spayed. Fifi and Princess. They get territorial around the ferals, but the ferals get along perfectly with each other. They share food even when we put it on separate plates. Princess, who is actually my younger cat, is THE boss and she always watches the ferals to make sure they aren't doing anything bad. You know what else she did a few days ago? A raccoon, yes, a raccoon came up to my back door and started eating cupcakes out of the garbage. It was actually pretty funny, as it seemed like it was saying to itself \"JACKPOT!\" It was not scared of us at all..which was odd. Well Princess sees the raccoon and the raccoon sees Princess. Now, what happened next was reverse of what you would think. The raccoon just looks at Princess (who looks like a mini raccoon) and looks very confused. Princess tries to jump through the door and attack the raccoon. Now, if she's not a crazy cat, I don't know what is. The racoon even came back the next day  by the way and tried to open the door and get more food!! Don't worry, we aren't feeding it. It just found the garbage that one time and must have been very smart and knew where the food was coming from. Anywho, sorry for going off topic here. I am hoping that after I trap the strays and get them fixed and treated for whatever they may have, I will be able to keep Smokey in our house since that seems possible, and give the other ones to the no-kill shelter I volunteer at. If they are unable to be socialized with people, we have a special \"cat habitat\" for cats strays and other cats that need rehabilitation or that are unable to socialize with people. Its a house-like building where the cats can live out of cages and just roam in the house. We have play items and such so they never get bored. it's great. And they are always watched by one of the associates or volunteers to be safe. Oh, and for shelter- my garage is always slightly open so that they can sleep in or just stay in the garage if they wish. We were thinking of getting a heater for them in the garage, but I think we're just gonna trap them ASAP. I have attempted to tip the plastic containers sideways but they are scared to go in!
