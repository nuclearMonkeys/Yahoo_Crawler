	106802 : ["I can't speak to NYU's or Northwestern's transfer requirements in particular, but yes, while I do think you should make sure to apply to a public university or two in the same state as the community college you are now attending and that your school's transfer coordinator thinks you are pretty much guaranteed to get into, you should definitely also be applying to schools in the same category as those two (that includes the top publics as well as private schools). If you were to end up at a \"safety\" as an undergraduate but wanted to go to graduate school, I think that once again, you should be applying to schools in that category if that's where you want to go. At some point in your application materials you are going have to address what happened. Be honest. What you've written here is very clear, and I think that, once you cleaned it up so that it was in standard English grammar, it would do just fine as an explanation. It's not an excuse, and you make it very clear that you don't expect it to be. The one additional thing I'd want to know, if I were reviewing your application, is whether you are still attending AA and/or still seeing the psychiatrist, because it sounds as if you are not, and if you are not, why you decided those things were no longer necessary and what sorts of things would make you think you should avail yourself of one or both of those things again. Do you know whether your original school would consider taking you back? If you went back, academic renewal might be appropriate simply because otherwise the numbers would keep you on academic probation. I don't have any specific advice and I hope you get much better answers from other people, but I think you're someone that many admissions departments would love to hear from. And I hope that things get less horrible soon, because you have clearly made huge changes in your life and you deserve at least as much credit for that as any embarrassment over the mistakes you made earlier.", 9972, "SKOKAoIiaa", 0],

	106804 : ["Gold itself doesn't cause allergy. If it does, then it's not Gold.  Probably not, that is not gold itself. What people occasionally have is an allergy to the nickel content in gold alloys, usually in the alloy rich 9ct golds. 9ct alloys go dull or even black from the exposure to chemicals in the atmosphere and also may discolour from contact with perspiration, bleach, household chemicals and some fabrics. Detergents and other chemicals lodge between rings and the skin causing problems, particularly hairspray, beauty and cleaning products. Antiperspirants exacerbate metal allergy problems. It has been suggested that the sweat of a healthy person after exercise contains 18 times the nickel content of blood. The antiperspirant reduces the bodies natural way of eliminating heavy metals and can lead to a build up in intensity, which causes a higher concentration in the sweat than is normal. The most common type of allergy we encounter is a phantom allergy, caused by a noticeable desire to upgrade to 18ct or platinum!. As nickel and zinc are not used in 18ct alloy, just silver and copper, it is less likely to produce any kind of allergy related problems. What a good excuse!  Tarnishing of Gold Possible causes include:  Perspiration (everyone's body chemistry is different, hence this is why some are more susceptible than others); for women, the time of the month can influence their body chemistry.  Perfume, hair or deodorant sprays,  Tarnishing during storage (storage boxes may contain organic sulphur compounds),  Leaching of acid/ cleaning solutions from surface microporosity from cast jewellery; this causes corrosion locally (such porosity may even trap perspiration during wear, causing local corrosion)  Preparation of vegetables such as onions and spices (many foodstuffs contain sulphur compounds and others are also acidic).  Another possible mechanism may be surface micro-porosity on the surface of investment (lost wax) cast items. This porosity may trap acids and other cleaning solutions, sprays, or perspiration and cause a local corrosion which 'creeps' over the surface of the item.  The tarnish films formed are generally harmless although unsightly and may lead to a black smudging of the skin. Such films can be easily polished off by a jeweller to restore the bright gold colour.  Possible solutions to the problem include:  Store jewellery in a pouch or bag in a dry atmosphere (unpolluted, e.g. by exhaust fumes, solvent vapours, where possible).  If stored in a box or pouch or plastic bag, ensure it is free of sulphur-containing compounds (from solvents, fabric treatments, adhesives, etc.).  Polish jewellery regularly with a soft cloth to remove any early tarnish films, perspiration and other contaminants (sprays, etc). Clean after wear and do not put on perfume, deodorants, sprays, etc whilst wearing the jewellery", 9973, "haagPtQUaa", 0],
	106805 : ["When I first had my ears pierced at the age of 13, I found out quickly I was allergic to 14K gold.  My ears would turn red and drain.  Later, I developed keloids.  During my teen years my watches and rings would turn my finger and wrist red/green/black.  I was told it had something to do with mercury in the jewelry.  I fortunately love silver and white gold and have outgrown the yellow gold problem.
