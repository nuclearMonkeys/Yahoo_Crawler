First of all, just tell yourself that you will not Argue with them on any thing, and any thing means, any thing, until unless you have developed rational grounds about your faith. Next get into the habit of reading Koran (Quran), even a few verses, on daily basis; in the language best understand. This will infrom you more what God is saying in His Book. I take it for granted that you have read the Bible already, so it will develop a firm understanding about Islam as Koran is no different than Jewish or Christian Books of God. If you are observing daily Prayers at home then you must take care not to disturb them by choosing a place, like your room, where you mighty not be a hindrence in their domstic chores. Moreover, as a Muslim you have to have Kosher / Hallal food, and it they have an objection to that then you can tell them softly to look back to the Jewish traditions & ask them politely to not to have objections on that please. After all, Judaism, Christianity & Islam are all Abrahamic Faiths! Now, when you will be exposed to Koran, you will come to know that God consideres Jews & Christians among the believers, however, Koran clearly states & criticise People of the Book for certain adopted practices which were adopted in Religious Practices with the course of time & that which are considered ungodly by God All-sufficient. If you would be a little informed what is written in Koran then you will be in a position to inform them that there are good things written about them in Koarn. No doubt, God will not spare people who make compeers & assocates to God All-mighty, All-sufficient.  At the same time, People of the Book are the People of the Book. PATIANCE is the name of the game here & a test and trial for you to have Sure Faith in One unseen God.", 8921, "QkpNt5mvaa", 0],

Anyway I don't always get along with Leo's (even though my moon is in Leo) but I feel like they get so pissed off if anything you say sounds critical.  My mother is an Aries so I can't really say I hate them. But she's really bi-polar it confuses me a lot, I'm not sure if every Aries is like this cause they're probably not. I'm just describing an Aries that I know very well. I usually make friends with Cancers and Sags the most. Sometimes I'm scared of gemini's cause they're can get really physical, but its strange cause my best friend is a Gemini. I really like virgo suns and virgo moons.
