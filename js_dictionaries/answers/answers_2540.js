	132833 : ["I see some individuals have already decided that there is no point to your question.  Others are fine with it.  Regardless of a perfectly accurate definition of homophobia, there are a few things that help me to understand what the world of homosexuality is like. If a gay couple is involved in a lasting relationship, not unlike heterosexual marriages, the gay couple cannot hold hands in public.  They cannot show any affection toward each other, even though society says it's \"OK\" for a man and a woman to be kissing in public.  And yet the gay couple feels no less in love with each other than that man and woman. They cannot show any outward signs of their sexuality for fear of losing their jobs, ridicule by co-workers (behind their backs, of course), and if one partner is seriously hurt in a car accident, the other is shunned by the family and maybe even the staff. Of couse, inheritance is impossible.  The family jumps up to claim any thing that might be left. Naturally there are situations where both families of a gay couple are well adjusted, open minded, and accepting of their son/daughter's way of life.  Sadly it is in the minority. I am amazed at how many people think gays can just \"think\" their way into a heterosexual life style.  From what I understand, that sort of an idea is ridiculous. I attend a Unitarian Universalist church.  We have a very open community which accepts people of all life styles.  I have received great insights from our gay members.  I find it troubling that many of the \"good\" religious people in the world find it SO difficult to accept a gay person. I wonder often as to how someone listen to sermons, scriptures, and ministers talk about how everyone should love one another and disregard differences in race, social status, handicaps, and other things, yet still exclude homosexual life styles from that list.  Worst yet, they fear gay individuals. I suppose they fear any thing they don't understand.  The fact that intimate relations would be included as part of the fear factor repulse them. That is homophobia.  Fear of homosexuals.  After all, you never knows when it might rub off on you or your children!  (Or, so they think.) Regardless of what goes on in the bedroom, any devoted couple, same or opposited sex should have the same rights under the law.  As it stands now, clearly a large segment of our society is missing out and being discriminated against. I won't add a long list of all the creative, inspirational, and political people who are or were gay when they lived.  The list is far too long. I hava a bumper sticker on my car that reads, \"Tolerance, believe in it.\"  I think that says it all.", 11148, "a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa", 0],

Is there really any reason that a murderer is going to think \"You know what, I was going to watch TV but instead, I think I am going to go and kill someone. Hmm, what about that random person I have never met in the big house that probably has an alarm\". Even if it doesn't have an alarm, they don't know that. That always makes me feel a bit better. Another thing to do is to stay near the bathroom, or any room with a lock on it. If you get scared you could always run in there and lock the door (not that you will need to because nothing will happen). Put all of the lights on, lock all the doors, shut the windows (and lock if you can) and keep your mobile or your house phone (if you can) with you at all times. Whenever I am scared I always have my phone out with my finger sitting on the number 9. Other than that all you can do is to sit tight, listen to loud music or a loud movie to take your mind off of it, any little creaking that the house makes on it's own could make you think there is someone there when there isn't so if you drown out those noises you won't be as scared. Also get anything you need when it is still light (eg. food, a drink, movies, books, music, phone etc.) so that you don't have to go wandering about the house at night to get things.

	132870 : ["I don't think  the term 'Homophobia' adequately describes many people's attitudes towards homosexuality. Maybe some people do actually have an irrational fear of LGBT people - though how they perceive it as a personal threat is beyond me. Your exercise demonstrates that having sex with a same sex partner is abhorant to many people - but no more, perhaps, that a gay or lesbian would feel about having sex with an opposite sex partner - which should help YOU appreciate their feelings. If it is not fear - then what? Some quote the scriptures of various religions - I'm Agnostic so that doesn't work for me. Some quote morality - thats a bit weak amongst all the other things we get up to. Some might say it is unnatural because the purpose of human relationships is to continue the species - an anthropological arguement - but lets face it, a few gays and lesbians arn't going to compete with the world population increase that is evident. What about: \"its because they flaunt it\" - well isn't that just a simple defense against feeling under threat and wanting the safety of belonging to a wider community where they can be themselves? The arguements fall down like a stack of cards. My attitude? - well, I don't choose it as a personal lifestyle and I don't need to test myself with an excercise in imagination. I cannot identify any personal threat to me or mine - or to the future of mankind. The gays I have known are usually colourful and friendly personalities, and I've never met one who has tried to 'convert' me (unlike many religious people).
