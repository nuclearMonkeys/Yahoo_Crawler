	75325 : ["I read a few of these answers and I think many of you have missed the point. YOUR sense of morals may not match those of others. This is one of the reasons why the framers of the Constitution and Bill of Rights made sure that no one religion would be able to take over the government.

	75328 : ["Acts 24:15 Contemporary English Version 15I am just as sure as these people are that God will raise from death everyone who is good or evil.  Acts 24:15 New American Standard 15having a hope in God, which (A)these men cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.  Revelation 20:13, 14 NAS 13And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and (AT)death and Hades (AU)gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them (AV)according to their deeds.   14Then (AW)death and Hades were thrown into (AX)the lake of fire This is the (AY)second death, the lake of fire.  (Hades is translated hell in KJV and some other Bibles). Rev. 20:5  NAS 5The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. (Q)This is the first resurrection.  Yes, King Tut (and many others) are in the grave, the Bible's hell and will get out of it to learn....then hell is destroyed in the lake of fire when it is emptied and no one will ever be put in hell again as it will no longer exist. The wicked are shown favor by bringing them back to earth to learn, but many will refuse. Isaiah 26:  NAS 9(R)At night my soul longs for You,          Indeed, my spirit within me (S)seeks You diligently;          For when the earth experiences Your judgments          The inhabitants of the world (T)learn righteousness.      10Though the wicked is shown favor,          He does not (U)learn righteousness;          He (V)deals unjustly in the land of uprightness,          And does not perceive the majesty of the LORD.  There is ONLY one unpardonable sin, sin against the holy spirit.  It cannot be forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come (righteous new earth). Matthew 12:   KJV 31Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.   32And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  All other sins, can be forgiven.  So only willful deliberate going against the holy spirit or telling untruth when you have the holy spirit, is unpardonable.  Everyone else comes back to earth during the thousand years. Hebrews 6:4-6, 10:26, 29, Rev. 20:5. Debbie debbiepittman@yahoo.com", 8803, "P6atY3xXaa", -1],

	75331 : ["If you have to ask this question, Viagra is not your problem Stop feeling disabled or damaged. In this day and age, stress is too much.  And as men age, our desire stays high but the physical ability naturally declines. Any woman that you have to \"hide\" this from is the wrong woman for you.  Should you hide that you take a cholesterol drug? Choose better quality partners. UPDATE:  After posting, I read the other answers.

I had a boyfriend who was 30 and needed an injection at the base of his penis prior to sex every time, it was a nuisance of course, just as it was and is a nuisance in getting used to putting condoms on before sex once AIDS became the prevalent issue, but the sex was still great!
