	76517 : ["There have been a couple that have come out over the past few years that have repeatedly made me say, \"this genre has hit a new low.\" My Humps, Laffy Taffy, and It's Goin' Down are examples of this. However, one song that came out recently is clearly the lowest common denominator of rap, and that is Chicken Noodle Soup.", 8844, "28b7ce28cd693720dd246ed22bad5e77aa", 4],
	76518 : ["\"Rockers\" just find the hip-hop'in kids immautre, in my skool they ask \"you like Rock music?\" and we just look at them like thery're the stupidest kids ever. There's different genre's in rock therefore with that question we just find them ignorant. It's not that hip hop is hated  by these \"rockers\" it's that the mainstream hip hop is vial and unapropriate. \"Pimps and hoes\" aren't good subjects to look up on. Neither is depression, but if you look into lyrics of rock music they aren't trying to get depressed there is so much more to the song. Mainstream is the problem not genres of music. Rock is now a form of skill level. Take bands like Linkin Park. They suck so much, but their lyrics are meaningful. In Hip-Hop SPM is annoying. Bands have their talent drums, singing, guitar, and bass. In Hip-Hop they just spit out words that are so unorthodoxed. In bands where they have a soulful singer they achieve more talent. Take Anthony Green for example his voice is angelic, and there have been bands that \"rap\" like The Red Hot Chili Peppers their skill level is way better than Linkin  Park. Also in many places hip hop is taken as an example, a bad one. I don't get the pants falling off your *** trend. Serisouly it's inappropriate and stupid.", 8845, "XdyFqYUDaa", 3],
	76519 : ["i'd think that it's because rap music nowadays signify things different from rock and roll. if you looked at all the songs you mentioned. those are old groups (for all except Afrika, i dont know them, but i do know the Sex pistols). Old school hip-hop is different from modern-day rap, now theres some good songs, but for the most part, all they do is glorify sex, cars, money--pretty much the materialistic lifestyle.  I really dont even know what rock music is about now, but i sure as hell know they dont rock out and sing about their escalades and the 5 fine \"hos\" they managed to bag while throwing money out the windows. Before, rap and rock sang about similar things, they did have a similar attitude, but now, things are different, and this is seen by the fans, which is why they dont really get along. besides, when they do get along, you get **** like korn and disturbed, and god knows what, \"nu metal\", please.", 8845, "9t6Ez0Chaa", 1],
