	136983 : ["Hi James. I guess that you are now 16, bang in the middle of puberty and the bag of worms it feels like to be a growing teenager. This hang up you have about whether you might be gay or not is likely just part of the confusion your head makes with your body as you grow into manhood. Some guys even think they are gay, experimenting sexually with other like minded guys, only to realise around their late teens that they are indeed attracted to girls, forgetting that natural gay stage they went through earlier. I'm no doctor and I don't know how psychologically stressful this has been for you, but I think maybe your doctor is making more of this than need be. The only help maybe you need is to find out why you have such an obsession or fear about being gay. If your parents are homophobic or a past experience has left you questioning yourself, perhaps some professional help would be useful. But in the bigger scheme of things and how you define the person that you are, it really does not matter what your sexual orientation is, because we are born the way nature intended us to be. So in the unlikely event you are gay (and I doubt that you are) your instincts will steer you towards guys not girls. Looking at gay porn and fantasising are both a natural progression whilst you assess and interpret your sexual urges. I'm a gay guy. I would encourage you to listen to what you inner instincts are telling you, follow what feels right for you and not look for something that might not be there.", 11336, "None", 0],
	136984 : ["No, I don't think think they're Smackdown icons. My reasoning is simple. When I think of Smackdown, I don't think of Laycool. If they were truly icons, my first thought would be them.", 11337, "aYnduRsxaa", 0],

	136988 : ["You just got me thinking. Since the Bella Twins are heel, and they won't fued with a heel, then Layla will probably beat Brie for the title, and then Awesome Kong comes in, and since Layla will be face with the whole thing that happened with Michelle, Awesome Kong would want the title, and start to bully Layla for it. Then, Michelle feels really bad, and during a match where Layla is getting destroyed by Kong, Michelle could run out, and fight off Awesome Kong, and then Lay-Cool reunite again. I know my mind is crazy, but that could just happen, but thank you for getting my creative juices flowing.", 11338, "cx0OSvtgaa", 3],
	136989 : ["I think you ate stressing too much about it. You are young and male, your hormones are all over the place. Take a step back and... breathe. You may have worked yourself up to a point where you put up psychological barriers to being with your girlfriend. You sound pretty convinced you are straight or maybe you ate bi. Really, does it matter? You can still be straight and like some gay porn while having no desire to act on anything with men. It is normal. So take a breath, stop worrying about sex with your girlfriend but just let yourself be in the moment. And if you ever meet a guy in the future that you want to experiment with, then make the decision whether to act on it or not. Until then just enjoy life, and don't stress about it. Eventually you'll figure it out.", 11336, "None", 0],
	136990 : ["For one factor sexuality is rushes of blood and erections whilst gender is behaviours, customs and the way men and women transfer their body. Gender is more social and less bodily. Few feminists suppose they may be able to consider a beard onto their face but do believe that they may be able to work or participate in aggressive physical games i.E. A divide between the social and bodily. This appears to be vindicated by way of the truth that homosexual men can exhibit either behaviours, customs or physique actions as camp or straight appearing regardless of the goings on of their pants. An additional thing is the truth that homosexuality is so universal(even repressive countries like Iran) which working women,and house caring ones are usually not and aren't even homogeneous. Edit. Anything in regards to the possible physical influences of mind on gender the point I was making is that an erection is a singular response to a stimulus while customs, roles and body language are a mesh of responses: they're a bundle of traits. Some which naturally don't add up. For example women are supposed to be communicators which is important in exercises that need co-op sporting events and politics. But their is paucity of participation in each. Co-op sporting activities in itself is a bundle of characteristics, its no longer best being aggressive, but co-operative and communicative. So even if you would say that aggression(like sexuality) was biologically determined you absolutely could not say that gender roles/gender or recreation as a whole were. Theres certainly a transparent cut qualitative bounce there.", 11336, "mFirTIMuaa", 0],
	136991 : ["you have complete control over those 2ndary thoughts. im pretty sure your not gay, your just contradicting yourself. your adding a gay thought to every hetero one because you would rather sit on the fence than accept the reality that you are straight.", 11336, "None", 0],

	136993 : ["You make a good point with The Bella Twins. A lot of people want to see a feud with them and Awesome Kong, but you make good points there that makes it seem as if it won't happen. I think Beth Phoenix should be the last out of those divas that she faces. It would be an amazing match and it should get a lot of buildup considering Beth & Kelly Kelly seem to be friends in the ring.", 11338, "IKS5C5bYaa", 3],
	136994 : ["That was my first thought when I heard she signed. Laycool brings in Kong to counter the physically superior Natalya and Beth Phoenix.", 11338, "None", 1],
	136995 : ["Actually, that would be a great idea for WWE to do regarding Awesome Kong.LayCool could say that they have found a answer to the power of Beth Phoenix and Natalya.They tell them that at the Royal Rumble, they will defend the Unified Divas championship to the surprise opponent at the Royal Rumble, in a 2 on 1 Handicap match.LayCool also say that if the surprise opponent wins, LayCool will once again be Co-Unified Divas champion. At the Royal Rumble, Awesome Kong beats both Beth Phoenix and Natalya in the 2 on 1 Handicap match.After the match, LayCool asks for the titles, but Kong refuses and gives them both Kong Bombs. Awesome Kong defends the Unified Divas championship to LayCool at Elimination Chamber successfully. A tournament is announced on RAW the following night, with the winner challenging Awesome Kong at Wrestlemania 27 for the title(Melina turns face and wins the tournament) At Wrestlemania 27, Melina defeats Awesome Kong to win the Unified Divas championship.", 11338, "LY7vI8bnaa", 0],
	136996 : ["i think of its a sturdy concept simply by fact for the final 5 or 10 years (consistent with risk longer), that they had completely flipped around the definition of a WWE Diva. at first, it replaced into extra touching directly to the wrestling skill and much less approximately finding sturdy (i.e. Luna Vachon, Jazz & Chyna earlier the mouth surgical treatment). Then, it began being all approximately finding sturdy and that they began hiring each and each physique of those females without wrestling skill by any skill. i think of they actually broke the form while they desperate to hire surprising Kong and that i choose they could've desperate to maintain that substantial 6'9'' bytch from NXT season 3.", 11338, "NttLbwRqaa", 0],

	137007 : ["I agree, I understand that is their job to be annoying, but to me, it's starting to get repetitive to see them act like the same personality every single week on whichever WWE brand they go on.

	137008 : ["'sd' has no idea. Natalya could out-wrestle Lita, Trish and just about any other female wrestler there's been in recent memory.  To answer the question... I'd say... kinda. Michele McCool is the number 1 female heel in WWE (only due to her marriage to The Undertaker), and Natalya is arguably the number 1 face, but it's not the same. Lita vs Trish was a rivalry built on repect between two women that totally deserved their spot. They had their on/off friendship, and were clearly the top 2 women in the company at the time (with the exception of Chyna, who left as they came into their prime, Molly Holly and Victoria/Tara). They could both wrestle, and surprisingly enough, were actually given TV time! They were given longer than 3 minutes to wrestle, got promo time and got to develop a character!!! Something nobody outside of Laycool gets to do nowadays. I wish Awesome Kong could come in, destroy everyone (including McCool) and get pushed as a monster heel. Give several diva's the chance to take her down, start with Eve, get to Gail Kim, then Natalya and Beth Pheonix. Push Kong as unbeatable, and then when someone finally beats her, it will be a massive deal! Natalya, Beth, Kong and Gail Kim should be the face of the Diva's division; not Michelle McCool, Layla and Eve.", 11339, "Kt3xQu7baa", -1],
	137009 : ["I disagree. For a good, quality match, I think Beth Phenix vs Natalya would be much better. Beth is the top Diva right now (talent wise), and Natalya is also very good. This match would be sure to entertain, just like Lita vs Trish.", 11339, "QlJGjNspaa", 0],
