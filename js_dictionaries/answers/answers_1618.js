Unfortunately you are in the same predicament as most people in today's job market, and you will end up in the cycle of can't get a job without experience, and cant get experience without a job. But there is no need to panic just yet. You are young and this is going to be a learning curve for you. I know you may need a little extra cash to help make ends meet and pay the bills, etc., but just think if you put 6 or 7 years into building yourself into a successful young lady, and then had a 40-year career in front of you. I know you don't want to do menial jobs, but you HAVE TO to start with. I would certainly not set any sights on a decent salary until you have experience and knowledge under your belt. Try and grab that job for $400 a week - you'll get that waiting at tables in tips alone. Go for the experience and try and get possibly a few voluntary positions to start building. Start at places that are not known for being high payers. Try state run hospitals, they all have psychiatric units and may just jump at a chance to get a psych graduate that at least knows the basics and can help in the wards or counseling. Try the medial centers where lots of doctors and other medical professionals work. Someone somewhere wants what you have. And remember, when you write a job cover letter, it is all about psychology. It really is: It is YOU against the reader. Think about this a little Mrs. B. Once it makes sense to you, you will think totally differently. Hope this helps,", 9236, "92KiPcF3aa", 0],

That's why I didn't graduate when I was close to getting a BS in psych and instead switched to nursing.  Honestly? Psychology is one of the most common degrees out there and many schools will be up front and tell you most psych majors don't work in the field.

	86595 : ["You just asked the perfect question, for showing the flaws in conservative reasoning. Nearly every answer you received shows how they just repeat talking points without really thinking things through at all, and they cling to ideologies that are far simpler than the real world is. Let's start with Longing4more and the answer that people should \"find a different job\". Only about half the jobs in the United States actually pay a living wage, the other half are low wage jobs such as Wal Mart. No matter how hard everyone tries to get a living wage job, only half the people in the US will have living wage jobs. There just aren't enough good jobs for everyone. If one person is finally lucky enough to land a living wage job, another low income applicant for that same job didn't get it. Someone is always going to get the short end of the stick. Is it fair to create a system where half the people in the country will not get paid enough money to live on?  The user who claims to be \"Exposing liberal lies\" posted another argument that is easily refuted, by saying that a higher minimum wage causes inflation and nobody comes out ahead. First of all, many products are made by workers who don't actually make anywhere close to minimum wage. The cost of a house, or a new car, or new appliances, wouldn't go up at all. We wouldn't actually pay twice as much on everything if the minimum wage were doubled. We might pay a bit more for groceries and fast food, but many other products would stay the same. The cost of living would certainly not double. What an increase in the minimum wage would really do is reduce inequality, by giving more money to the people at the bottom. Does inequality need to be reduced? The bottom 50% of Americans make less money than the top 1%, even though those bottom 50% actually work harder. That is an obscene and unjustifiable level of inequality. It is unconscionable. It ought to be reduced.  Conservatives say that people ought to earn money rather than take a handout from the government. I agree with them about this. So how about we start by creating a system where everyone is able to earn enough money to actually live on? Minimum wage is not a handout, it is money that people earn through their hard work.     Then electripole brought up the \"voluntary charity\" argument and said you should just donate money to low income people. Really? That's the solution to all the poverty in the United States? For you to be told to dig into your own pocket to take care of the whole problem? Bill Gates couldn't even do that. It just goes to show that these people haven't thought anything through. They're just repeating a talking point that someone else told them, that they have never really given any thought to at all. I used to be like that, years ago... then I started actually thinking for myself and questioning these things with logic and reasoning, and I became a liberal.", 9235, "nu8s8NKpaa", 4],

I really don't care what needs to be done, I quit. My children are in bed and I can read, watch tv, go to sleep, whatever. Sometimes that means that there are dishes in the sink, or laundry in the washing machine but I honestly don't care. If I didn't do this, I'd be nuts.

	86601 : ["Actually, if low end workers all started making a lot more, the price of goods and services would skyrocket.  That is called inflation.
