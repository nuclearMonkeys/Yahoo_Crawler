Up until about 40 years back Christianity was thriving and there was no conflict with others but in just those few short years the modern christians have become intolerant, hate filled, bigoted and persecuting resulting in a growing backlash against christianity and causing christianity to loose over ten percent in less than a decade with the loss accelerating!

Water doesn't collect because of the rotation.  Those forces have worked out billions of years ago when it formed the earth into an oblate spheroid.

It is just nonsense.   2nd Note:  CR (climate cultist) is one of the good examples of lack of education that I am referring to.  He thinks he can predict the future.  In fact he can't.  He suggests <<<The South Pole itself will not warm to above freezing until most of the rest of the ice in Antarctica melts.>>>  The colossal ignorance of a statement like this is pretty hard to fathom.

I can't answer for everyone, but I just cannot become that stupid just so as to answer a question!

The South Pole itself will not warm to above freezing until most of the rest of the ice in Antarctica melts. But one effect of the melting of ice in Antarctica, which is land ice, is rising sea levels.

	72183 : ["I agree with both Matt's & your list of suggestions !!! Y!A would become so much better if these were implemented :-p  To add a few more to the list : 1. Highlighting.  When we want to stress something, we are limited to a capital initial or word [despite the fear of being seen as rude & shouting] or addition of a asterisk before & after the word/phrase. If only Y!A could give us One additional punctuation feature to highlight a word/phrase. It could be bold letters, italics, underscore, one different color, one diff font, one diff font size, ........ This is something I've been wanting to survey for a long time.... 2. Number of web links that can be added in an answer is strictly 10.  I often need to give many more in my H&C & D&I answers. With even 1 link per idea, I sometimes have to trim it down. Since my files contain hyperlinks or active links, it is a nuisance to deactivate, type out the entire url & then add to answer. I wish they could increase the number at least after reaching a certain level [one of the perks, as Matt mentions]? 3. Report system .   While Matt has already detailed many aspects, I have included it again to reinforce the lopsidedness of the system. 2 of my answers (in H&C) have been reported; Both were reported After a gap of 1-3 years. I found nothing wrong with the content, the language, the relevance, etc. Yes, there were a whole bunch of websites that I added to my ideas. A couple of these might have changed in the interim. Even if that were so, I had no reference to the original Q, no proper appeal, no proper feedback, no sense of justice being done & the answers were deleted. I felt as if the system was loaded in favour of the reporter rather than a fair trial system. I keep wondering whether it wouldn't be a bad idea to allow even the reported Q & As to be democratically open for voting. It would ensure a sense of fair-play & Openness. 4. An all-inclusive category. P&S is one such category but it has a general time-pass attitude. Rarely does one get serious answers. There are some Qs that defy being slotted into a single category. Or one wants a multidisciplinary canvas. I've been wanting to ask a Q on the relationship between pain & sound for a long time but haven't been able to figure out a good category. I would like the thoughts of people from diff backgrounds including biology, neurology, psychology, medicine, anthropologists, etc. etc.  Where can I ask such a Q? There could be a 'miscellaneous\" or \"multidiscipline\" category to house such Qs. 5. Search  I've faced similar problems ! There have been occasions when I typed out the entire Q verbatim, and still did Not get the correct search result !!! But Google gave me the link !!! Lot of work required by Y!A here. 6. Privacy I second Matt's suggestion about segregating sections so that one has the option to keep one's Qs private but A's public & so on. That's my 2-bits for now.  Hope you are tuned in, Y!A :-))) Edit - Add : 7. Blocking  I understand the need for this option. My only contention is that when a person has answered a Q & is subsequently blocked, s/he can no longer access her/his own answer ! It seems a bit unfair that all the \"power\" lies with the asker. An answer has as much importance as the question, even if it is in response to the latter. They go hand-in-hand ; Yahoo!Answers wouldn't exist if nobody bothered to answer ;-p My simple suggestion is that while the answerer may be blocked, the page should be accessible/visible as a Read-Only page with no scope for any modifications, edits, additions, etc. This would apply Only to what the contributor has already contributed in the past & Not to any future activity that the blocker performs.", 8668, "d0f5RJ8Jaa", 9],
