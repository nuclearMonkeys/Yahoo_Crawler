The dog had vomiting and loose stool and it miraculously went away literally within 36 hours of changing food. I've heard a few bad things about the Hill's PRescription food so I will be looking for a replacement, but still similar ingredients, (so it will continue to work, of course!!) Taste of the wild is what i've found so far that is the closest (but without the suspect ingredients in the Hill's) So if your dog has Food allergies I would go with the Taste of the wild. If it doesn't work, Ask your vet for Hill's D/D prescription PS - Basically this was done to get my dog off grains and get him on a protein other than beef or chicken....The Hill's D/D is Venison and Potatoes. it's $28 for an 8lb bag.

Leaving your six year old to fend for herself against aggressive children will do nothing but cause her life-long problems.  It's horrible to be bullied, and not the victim's fault, but the fault of the adults who allow it to happen.  Do not put her in situations where children are so aggressive - these are not kids you want your kid around - or in situations where there is so little or lax adult supervision that kids are hurting each other.  You say you want her to learn to stand up for herself, but actually what she would need to learn is how to become one of the bullies, how to become aggressive and inconsiderate.  Is that really what you want?  Probably not.  I know it's how we were mostly raised, but that kind of thinking has been shown not to produce the desired result.  Kids who are not aggressive do not become more aggressive, they only become more afraid when they realize they no one - not even the parent they trust - will protect them.  So start standing up to these bullies yourself - they have no right to harm your daughter.", 10467, "FlqYAueEaa", 0],

I don't care what the name brand is or what the label says or what the ingredients are ALL dry and canned dog and cat food is highly processed garbage. If it were the real deal it would require refrigeration while in the store and at home. You COOK for your dogs and cats. It's not as expensive as you might think and you cook a whole bunch and then store in zip bags or containers in the freezer in smaller portions and simply thaw and feed or thaw and heat and feed. Chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, rice, oatmeal, potatoes, peas, green beans, carrots, white fish, and tons more, you COOK for your dogs and cats. The rates of all cancers in our dogs and cats is at an all time high and it's in large part due to the processed junk we put in them. Also the rates of diabetes and kidney failure in our dogs and cats is at an all time high despite the overpriced 'premium' processed foods. Don't pay $75.00 for a 27.5 lb bag of processed junk, put that money into real foods and some human food safe freezer bags or containers and get cooking!

Hey baby you ain't got to prove to me that your some kind of macho man. You've wasted so much of your life running through the dark nights let me shine some love light down on this bluesman I got so sick from speeding all the stuff they said I wasn't needed if I was to keep pleasing all of my fans. I got cuffed on dirt roads. I got sued over no shows but she came and took all that ole load down off this bluesman. Hey baby I love you too. Hey baby I need you. Hey baby I do get tired of this traveling band. I'm thirty years old now nights would be cold now if you hadn't stuck it out in this bluesman.

She's not yet old enough to truly understand her actions and her subconscious feelings.  Kids' personalities are what they are and you can't really change that about her... what you can help change is channeling her anger, fear, and sadness by teaching her coping skills so she will be well-adjusted as an adult.   Depending on what she likes, she could have a place in the house where she draws about her feelings or writes about them... something to help her vent without having to confront anyone (including you) except for herself.  You could open the door and allow her to feel safe to come to you and share her drawing or writing with you and you could talk with her in an empathetic way.  Ask her what she needs from you.  Talk about when you were a child being picked on and how that made you feel and what you've learned that helps now.  Also, have you considered any sort of sport that allows her to vent frustration?  Something like Tae Kwon Do would be perfect because it also teaches people to stand up for themselves.  Good Luck!", 10467, "9562be96c04b7e2ec57044a6e9b6f1cfaa", 0],

(Went down to fourth last year thanks to Euro 2008). And I must agree with Injured Rugger, that it should be sevens rugby. Because of the amount of games that can be played in a shorter time, more nations that can compete, the pace etc. But also because it is easier to get into the rugby groove via sevens if you know nothing about rugby. And to add to the more nations....If they can accomodate Baseball, they can certainly accomodate rugby! P.S: The Last time rugby was played at the Olympics only three teams participated: America, France and Romania at the 1924 Olympics in Paris. In the end Romania lost all their games and got the bronze medal. On 18 May 1924 America defeated France 17-3 in front of a 30 000 capacity crowd to take the gold.
