	116481 : ["I used to self harm and I am now a mentor to help students who have gone through the same things as me. First off all I am sorry about your wife's death, it's very sad. When teenagers start to self harm, the majority of the time it is caused by a past experience that has happened. In my case it was the bullying and the abuse I was going through at home. As your wife passed away a few months ago, this could be the reason why your daughter has started to self harm as she is very upset and heartbroken over her mother's death and she doesn't know how to cope about it. People who self harm keep their feelings all bottled up, and sometimes they blame themselves and they go through guilt, but most of the time they feel that physical pain is easier to deal with than emotional pain and they feel in control and in power when they start to self harm. Self harming is a very horrible thing to go through and your daughter is going to need a lot of help. Your daughter needs to know that you are not mad at her and you are there for her, and supporting her. Don't be mad at her and just be there for her. No matter what you are feeling, put your emotions and feelings aside, and don't be angry. When you are talking to your daughter make sure you talk to your daughter in a nice calm voice, don't interrupt, listen to her, remain eye contact, smile, hug her, be there for her and talk to her. Your daughter might not open to you as you are very close to her and she might want to talk to somebody she doesn't know - teenagers do hide things away from their parents so don't feel upset if she does and also remember that talking to somebody is the best thing to do, and your daughter should talk to somebody who deals with this like a school counsellor or a therapist.

If she does, just sit there until she's comfortable and ask her why. Put your arm around her so she doesn't want to run away because you'll make her feel safer, and see if she replies. Just be patient until you get what you want out of her, be calm and stroke her cuts. Don't be mad at her because you'll keep her worried and she'll block everything out so you won't find out any information on why she did it. The most obvious cause would be the death of her mother/your wife, so ask her if it's that. Stroke her cuts and cuddle her if that is the reason. Tell her you love her and that you're there for her, make sure it's crystal clear that you don't want her to do it again but don't throttle it into her, she's delicate at the moment.

First of all I must tell you how truly sorry I am; you two must be going through a lot of hardships right now... I truly hope the best. I think your first step should be to find out what's wrong. She most likely doesn't want to talk about it easily, especially considering the way she ran, and she might even think that you're upset. Don't let her feel that way; open up to her so that she can do the same. Is she insecure about herself? How emotionally stressed was she after her mother passed away? These are all things you must consider to find the cause of her self harm. She could be being bullied, she may be included in 'girl drama', she may be being cyber bullied, or she may even think that she's at fault for something and is 'punishing' herself. Ask her subtly, that's the only way to find out. She needs you, she needs your help, but she's not going to admit it easily.  Your next step should probably be to comfort her as best you can. I understand that you're both stressed right now, so try to take it easy on your daughter, and she will most likely do the same. Don't bring it up for a while so her stress is lifted, do things to make her happy. At the same time, you should do your best to move any sharp items she could use out of her reach without her noticing. Show her how much you love her, tell her how pretty she is inside and out, take her out to have fun. It'll be hard, but it'll help her realize that her daddy is there for her. Let her go out with friends, and in the meanwhile make it really hard for her to be alone. Don't stress her out, of course, just do it so she can't cut. Next you should probably seek help. Don't get me wrong; I'm sure she's very controlled and that you're a very loving father (I can tell) but some things can be, and should be solved by experts. Visit a counselor if it gets bad. Your daughter will be reluctant at first, most likely, but she needs help if she's harming herself. After all, we don't want the harm to get severe. So go outside to the step and gently comfort her. At her age she probably feels alone and helpless, so as her father you have to counteract those feelings. Show her that you love her, that you'll protect her on any means.

She may be one of those brides who has an emotional breakdown after her wedding, because her \"big day\" is over and gone, and now she has to live regular life. She sounds like a bit of a spoiled brat, too. That's not entirely your fault... she's legally been an adult for the past 7 years, and for those years no one is responsible but her. I think she IS at very real risk of reducing her life to being \"Mrs. _____,\" followed by \"_______'s Mom,\" which she'll eventually realize was a mistake -- not for being a wife and mom, but for ONLY being a wife and mom. Still, it's her life now, and there's nothing anything poignant enough that you can say to make her wake up and smell the coffee in just one conversation. And besides, her wedding day isn't the time for that conversation anyway. So keep it simple. Tell her you're happy for her, your sad to let her go, you think Brad is a great guy, etc. And add this: \"Always remember this, my dearest. Love isn't just a feeling.

Weddings always bring out so much emotion, both good and bad. You obviously love your daughter very much, but loving her means letting her go. Letting her go to make the mistakes you're afraid of her making and working it out for herself. She'll never grow into a well rounded woman if you're always there to catch her. And that's what she is now Jack, a woman. I know you still see her as your little girl but she's not anymore. Perhaps that's why she reacts the way she does towards you - you're not letting her be herself. That's why I think she's so comfortable with the in-laws.  You are such an eloquent writer with your feelings, perhaps you can write what you want to say rather than tell her. That way you can take your time and write what's in your heart. When you verbalise your feelings, they don't always come out like you'd like. Plus, with so much on her plate, you can't always be sure you have her full attention. As your daughter grows, she'll come to value you as a father and a friend. I always thought my father was lame and embarrassing and it wasn't until I got married and had children that I realised how much he loved me and what that love meant to me. Living isn't always just about growing old. It's also about growing as a person physically, emotionally and spiritually.

If I was a father I would tell my daughter to never allow herself to become solely dependent on her husband, and I don't mean just financially but emotionally. Also to never make hasty decisions for important choices in life. I'm sure if you really think about it, you can find the right message you want to convey.

Obviously you came of age before text-messaging.  :-)  With your talent for writing, and a rough draft of sorts, I recommend you put your thoughts in a letter to her.  Not an email, but an old fashioned letter on paper that she can read over and over.  Most people are visual learners rather than auditory, and she will likely receive more of your message that way. In your letter, do not apologize for being a failure!  You sound like a great dad!  Your love for her shines thru in every line. Re. her late mom's heirloom wedding dress:  Forget about selling that idea.  Many brides would rather wear a new dress of their choosing.  The part about her late mom wanting her to wear it might not be accurate and any case kind of puts your daughter on a guilt trip.

I blurt out that I only want someone who will always love her twice as much as I do.\" That was an awesome answer!  I don't think you stuck your foot in your mouth at all. Re:  Wedding Expenses:  I think you're being too much of a pushover.  Your daughter seems to have no idea of the value of a dollar or a business plan for her future.  Don't just tell her you can afford to pay for her wedding and essentially write her a blank check.  Tell her you are chipping in X amount of money, for example $5,000.  Anything beyond that, she's on her own for funding her wedding.  You're not obligated to pay 1 dime for her wedding.  It's a nice thing to do, but you're not obligated.  I'm concerned that you're a guy of modest means essentially writing a blank check to your head-in-the-clouds daughter. Also, she has not been to college?  Is not self-supporting in her career?  If you have only limited funds for her, those funds should be saved for her college education (or her future child(ren)'s college education), not a wedding.

	116514 : ["They say that a fool lives to eat and a wise man eats to live. But then the question remains: for what purpose does the wise man live? Living is not an end by itself. There has to be a purpose for man to live for. So what is this purpose?  Where from? Where to? And Why?  Any ignorance, however great, could be forgiven except for man to be ignorant about the secret of his existence, his aim in life and what will be his outcome after death. Some thinkers express these questions in simple words: where from? Where to? And why? Meaning: where did I come from? Where am I going? And why am I here?  Those who only believe in the material world and who do not believe in a Creator- the atheists- only believe in sensory data. They say that this universe and everything in it came by itself. All its order is simply due to blind coincidence. They say that man is simply like an animal or a plant and that he will exist for a short period and then end like any other animal or plant.  An Arab Poet, Elya Abu Madhi (a born-Christian), not long ago expressed his uncertainty about the purpose of life in his Arabic poem Al-Talasim, meaning “puzzles,” which I have translated into English. He says in his poem:  I came not knowing from where, but I came.  And I saw a pathway in front of me, so I walked.  And I will remain walking, whether I want this or not.  How did I come? How did I see my pathway?  I do not know!  Am I new or am I old in this existence?  Am I free and unrestrained, or do I walk in chains?  Do I lead myself in my life, or am I being led?  I wish I know, but…  I do not know!  And my path, oh what is my path? Is it long or is it short?  Am I ascending in it, or am I going down and sinking?  Am I the one who is walking on the road,  or is it the road that is moving?  Or are we both standing, but it is the time that is running?  I do not know!  Before I became a full human, do you see  if I were nothing, impossible? Or do you see that I was something?  Is there an answer to this puzzle, or will it remain eternal?  I do not know ... and why do I not know??  I do not know!  This feeling of doubt and confusion about the presence of a Creator and whether He sent messengers and prophets to guide mankind must be quite painful because it deprives the Atheist and the Agnostic of tranquility, security and peace of mind. The unbelievers do not have credible answers to the purpose of one's existence. And thus they say that man lives for himself and for the pleasures of this life. So what happens when life turns sour? What happens when one goes through hardships? It is no coincidence then that the largest number of suicides takes place amongst Atheists, Agnostics and people who do not know their purpose in life. Do you know which country has the largest number of suicides? It's Japan. In the year ending March 2000, there were 33,000 suicides in Japan. That is 91 suicides per day or 1 suicide every 15 minutes! This despite Japan being the second largest economy in the world wherein people do not have to worry about providing a roof over their heads or about food or medical care.
