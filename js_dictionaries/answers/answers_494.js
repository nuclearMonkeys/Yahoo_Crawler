If you are concerned about the shoes giving you trouble (or they actually do) try putting some kind of support insert in them to give you additional arch support or cushioning (whatever you need, there are various inserts to help with various issues).Â  . There's no specific reason racing shoes would be a problem. Considering they are expensive most people wear them ONLY for racing, so they last longer.

	27418 : ["I generally run at around 9 minute miles if I just want a relaxing run regardless of distance.Â  I've covered a marathon at that speed without too much trouble before apart from knee soreness afterwards because I didn't build mileage up over enough time. When I first did a Marathon distance I decided to start the run at about 10.5 minute mile pace, within about 5 miles I was having problems with my feet, hips and knees.Â  This was because at that pace my form was not correct for my body, the way my feet were striking was putting more impact through my body rather than creating forward motion and I didn't notice any benefits from an effort standpoint. I'm only 5'6\" tall and weighed about 65KG at the time so I would guess heavier and taller people would suffer even more at a slow pace. The way around it would be to get up to a pace that your body is comfortable with then once you are there gradually keep adding distance.Â  I know I can't drop below a 9.5 minute mile pace without problems, an average person who is taller than me probably doesn't want to be doing any great distance slower that a 9 minute mile. I always use top end footwear with the correct (neutral) gait and support for me, decent trainers are important as is stretching after your run.", 4285, "IHXo7seOaa", 0],
	27419 : ["Jogging is basically just a very slow run. Joggers also don't tend to have as long of a stride as some runners (although some runners have a short stride).Â  . Good form includes not slouching (stand upright with shoulders relaxed), having arms relaxed at your sides with elbows bent at 90Â° and hands relaxed (as if you were holding a potato chip with your fingers). Arm swing should be forward and back (avoid crossing your hands in front of your body).Â  Lean forward slightly, from your ankles (don't bend over) to help propel you forward. Keep your feet under you when you jog/run to reduce the impact on your body.Â  . You can look up articles and videos on proper jogging or running form. The article below can give you some info as well.", 4285, "AA11447210", 1],
	27420 : ["Form matters, and so does how unfit you are. If your form is really bad, you can strain tendons and ligaments, so the basic idea is that you plant each foot straight and directly below its knee. If you do that with every step, the rest of your form is likely to follow naturally. Your body was made for doing this. Here's a little guidance:  When you start running, go as slowly as you can while still calling it running or jogging. Yes, you could go faster, but the distance you cover will be small and you'll be so winded you can't go on. Running slow and easy until you have to stop, then walking at a brisk pace until you can go again, is the way to begin. Set a target, either time or distance. Most beginners who are not substantially overweight (75 pounds or more) can do a mile. Keep at it until you're jogging the whole way, then increase either your distance or your time.", 4285, "None", 1],
	27421 : ["Hmmm. Answers to this question would necessarily be opinions. This would be a good question for an \"Opinion and Surveys\" category. In my opinion, no.Â  With some exceptions, professional athletes in teams of major league sports are playing for their particular teams because they were drafted, traded, or chose the team that offered the best contract. Before joining the team, they did not necessarily have any association with the city where their teams play home games. Their loyalty to fans in the area lasts as long as they are with the team. When they are traded or become free agents and agree to play with a team in a different city, their fan loyalty shifts to the new team.Â  If, as a sports bettor, you place bets on a game-by-game basis, you care about the outcomes of particular games, not necessarily about teams themselves. You care about the well being of the players because it helps you win your bets. You might care about a particular team if, at the beginning of a season, you bet on where the team might be at the end of the season.Â  Organizations such as the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL are entertainment organizations. I'd rather support college and other amateur sports.", 4286, "k7hBT7MGaa", 1],

Jogging helps you to grow your leg bones naturally and makes them stronger.

	27436 : ["It is hard to say, given the information you provided. They look like good running shoes. You should be able to walk or run in them * IF * they are a good match for your biomechanics. If they are a poor match, you might be injured whether you use them for walking or for running. That's true of any good running shoes. It would help to know more about your heel pain, and whatÂ  happened to cause that injury. It could be the result of using shoes that do not match your biomechanics, or it could have another cause.Â  It would help to know why they are the wrong shoes for you. I don't see they were designed specifically for racing.Â People who reviewed them classified them as trainers. I would be concerned if they were racing flats. Update, based on update in the question: Thanks for the update.Â  If the Saucony shoes are the right size for you, and the arch support and stability features they have is a good match for your arches and pronation characteristics, you should be able to safely use them for walking, running, or both. Additional update: Saucony classifies it as a neutral shoe. Neutral shoes are best for underpronators. Neutral shoes also typically work best for runners / walkers with high arches. If you have flat feet or overpronate, you should avoid neutral shoes. If you have average arches with average pronation, you might be able to use these shoes. But, they might also be a problem for you.", 4297, "k7hBT7MGaa", 2],

	27440 : ["Because people's bodies are different, people's effort is different, people using the same training plan don't train exactly the same (they workout differently, eat differently, recover differently), and people's abilities are different. It would actually be odd if everyone progressed/improved at the same pace.", 4298, "AA11447210", 2],
	27441 : ["There are different reasons. What are the differences between the two people in your example? It may be one of your athletes was more active before the first practice. One might have been running, playing soccer, or swimming while the other was reading, taking extra classes, or designing things while sitting at a desk. Are they built the same? Maybe one has a better build for running. Even when two people have body types suitable for running, it might not be the same type of running. One may be built to be a sprinter, while another may be built to be best at 10 kilometers. What about motivation? Is one driven to workout more or harder than the other? Do they have the same health history? Was one seriously ill, while the other avoided serious illness? Was one seriously ill more recently than the other? Do they have different living conditions? Does one live in building with good air quality, while the other lives in a \"sick house\"? Does one live in the city, while the other lives in the country? Is one poor,Â  while the other middle class?Â  Does one have a healthful, well balanced diet, while the other eats a lot of junk food? What are their genetic differences?Â  There are several factors that influence our athletic potential. Each factor has a different weight. The pluses and minuses interact. Pluses can work together to make a better athlete. Minuses can work together to impair athletic potential. Pluses and minuses can interact, offsetting each other in different ways. Gifted athletes have stronger pluses and weaker minuses.Â  Edit:Â  Genetics is a big factor. Genetically gifted athletes can work out harder, longer, and more often before they suffer the consequences of overdoing it (overtraining syndrome or burnout). This allow them to develop their ability faster and to a higher level. Comment: A runner at our high school mentioned his morning workout. Another runner, surprised, said \"You work out twice a day?Â  You're nuts!\" Another runner said \"He's not nuts. He's the state champ.\"Â ", 4298, "k7hBT7MGaa", 3],

Running on concrete or asphalt outside with poor cushioning like many shoes lack can cause some joint pain even among seasoned young high school cross country runners. Running on a cushioned treadmill or with good shoes outside can help prevent the joint pain. The studies go both ways on running either strengthening or hurting the joints.
