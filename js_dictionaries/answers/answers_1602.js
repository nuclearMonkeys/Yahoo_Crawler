	85763 : ["It's stupid.  First, yes I agree it's moronic that a teacher and a school would instruct people to call an egg a sphere, which is obviously wrong.  (Hope it wasn't a math/geometry teacher!)  Secondly, why is it called a \"spring\" sphere?  As opposed to a winter or summer egg/sphere?  How in the world is an egg controversial?!!  Gimme a break.  They've gone so far over the edge to be politically correct that now they're mathematically incorrect.  It's sad and ridiculous.", 9204, "dmCAiuMGaa", 0],
	85764 : ["I would say yes, it's a little like Sesame Street. He has that crinkled up look, when he pulls his chin in and you can see the wrinkles under his neck. That look reminds of Kermit. Also Dennis Miller reminds me of Oscar the Grouch.                    Now onto Keith Olbermann That guy would be the Liberal Extremist O'Reilly but I don't believe O'Reilly is a true conservative, while Olbermann actually believes the words coming out of his mouth. I think I find O'Reilly to be slightly less annoying, but I haven't watched him in about 2 years.                There's really no cure for Olbermann and his self-created feud with O'Reilly (um you pester and mock the guy for months in order to get his attention, and you have the gall to call it a '\"feud\"??) so I think the only cure is a McCain victory. His head will explode when he realizes that America doesn't think JUST LIKE HIM and he'll say something really off the wall and get fired.  ", 9206, "neFd6a4paa", -1],
	85765 : ["Bill O'Reilly used to be much better than he now is. He now has this strange populism thing going on. And yes, he often talks down to \"the folks\".

	85783 : [" I guess this makes sense. What else are fatherless children to do, but run around like a pack of wild dogs? Success...umm...right.  Just goes to show that we did in fact tear down a self sustaining sovereign nation, and created a welfare state.   We have now killed over a million Iraqi's. That leaves only 6 or so million more before we 'win'.  This went so well that we are about to do a threepeat (Afghanistan, Iraq) with Iran.   Our politicians tell us how bad Hitler, and Nazi Germany was, yet they are doing the same damn thing as far as global conquest is concerned.  Attempts at global conquest by the elite to create a one world government are a constant throughout history, and they have all failed. If we keep this up(which we will), we will find ourselves smack in the middle of WWIII.   America is about to learn(relearn) that war is hell, comes with sacrfice, and war=death.

	85787 : ["I think changing Easter to \"Spring Spheres\" is absolutely STUPID!!! What the heck does the name have to do with anything. Come on, peeps (no pun in tented) pull your heads our of the ground! Easter is about the kids, and do we really need to get political about this fun Holiday? Seriously, what is this world turning too? Are they going to celebrate \"Spring Sphere\" at the White House? I remember when I was in school we celebrated everything! These days, you get flack if you want to send balloons to your child's school for his/her birthday. Should we change the name Sunday, because so many people to Church on Sunday? Are we going to go grocery shopping, and when looking for eggs and can't find them, do you ask the grocery clerk, where they keep the easter spheres? If they are trying to be correct, then we couldn't call it a Spring Sphere either because an egg is not a sphere. It's not moving on a ellipsoid...so eat that you ridiculous high paid people nad underchallenged people who have wayyyyy to much time on your hands in the workfource!

	85788 : ["Sects like the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and others have consistently had to come back up with some way of distinguishing themselves from mainstream Christianity. in any different case they might have no reason to exist. one way of justifying their life is to declare that mainstream Christianity has been contaminated with unChristian innovations, with pagan innovations. gala's are one element they have latched directly to, in part in basic terms arbitrarily yet in addition via fact some previously Protestants had finished an identical. They often declare that Easter and yuletide are easily initially pagan gala's. there is not any actual historic information to assist this concept. in certainty the information exhibits previous life like doubt that Easter is rooted in the Jewish Passover, in accordance with the Bible's asserting that Christ died and rose back around Passover time. transformations in customs and in calendars now advise the two are no longer so heavily appropriate. Edit: approximately those shepherds in PALESTINE. you already know, Palestine the place wintry climate temperatures hardly drop under freezing, the place lambs are born in December/ January via fact in the event that they are born any later, they are going to be weaned in the path of summer season whilst all of the grass has been burned off. the place traditionally shepherds spend ALL their day holiday with their sheep, 3 hundred and sixty 5 days a 300 and sixty 5 days, 24 hours an afternoon. Mormons are SO commonly used on the u . s . a . they might't conceive of life being distinctive someplace else.", 9204, "None", 0],
	85789 : ["I think it's good that government schools are secular.   I agree with you, however, that 'spring spheres' is a stupid name.  And I am a school teacher in Australia, in the Southern Hemisphere so Easter is not even in the spring here.  What am I supposed to hand out? Autumn Balls? Instead of banning religions, I think it would be nice if schools paid homage to different religions of students in the class - and gave out tokens for different religious occasions for different cultures.  I think this is nicer than banning all history and culture from the room.", 9204, "4ahG4jEbaa", 1],
