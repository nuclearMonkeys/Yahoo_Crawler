	109521 : ["I am suffering with this same issue, it is a terrible way of bringing one's  self esteem down... my solution that I am currently using is the Aspirin Mask! I started about 2 weeks ago and it has definitely taken some scars that i've had for years! The aspirin mask works so well because it is composed mainly of aspirin which contains salicylic acid also known as Beta Hydroxy Acid, BHA for short. BHA is an exfoliate and has anti-inflammatory properties. It causes the cells on the epidermis to unstick itself, removing the dead skin cells off and allowing regrowth for new skin. Studies have shown that BHA improves wrinkles, hyper pigmentation of the skin, photodamaged skin, roughness and acne! if you wish to do this, just go to CVS/Target/Wal-mart/Walgreens/Rite Aid any place they sell Aspirin, buy some NON-COATED aspirin because it dissolves faster. take about 2-3 pills of aspirin and put it in a bowl or plate, take about 2-3 drops of water on each pill wait about 1 minute till the pill can be crushed... take the crushed aspirin and  put it on your face and exfoliate, don't rub too hard! just rub it slightly to exfoliate your face and take dead skin cells off. make sure the aspirin has enough water so it sticks to your face, you can add either honey because it's a mosturizer or aloe because it helps as well, i use both! keep the mask on for about 10 minutes then when it's dry just rinse off with lukewarm water. don't forget to mosturize! i use lubriederm because it works so well in mosturizing! you must use a mosturizer because remember you removed dead skin cells so new fresh cells are now on your face and can be harmed from the sun! you will also notice how redness goes away and how  UHHHHMAZZZZINGGGGLY SOFT YOUR SKIN IS! i hope you DO USE THIS! IT WORKS  W O N D E R S it also SHRINKS your pore size!!!!!!!!", 10100, "Tivaoib8aa", -1],

	109524 : ["Greek, and the Romans adopted \"Ploutos\" as \"Plutus.\"  If you're interested, here's some background that might clarify the Big Picture . . . Plouton (ending in -n-) was the later Greek name for Hades.  However, a euphemistic way of referring to Hades / Plouton was by the Greek word \"ploutos,\" which means wealth. A divinity with a negative connotation may be referred to in a positive way so as not to make them angry.  For instance, the Erinyes, the avenging furies, were also called the Eumenides, \"the gracious ones.\"  With Hades/Plouton, it's just a coincidence that his euphemistic name, Ploutos, is almost the same as his actual one.", 10097, "x1LmS9vTaa", 2],

Be sure to hoard money, and don't share anything with anyone except for grief. Eat what you like, drink, smoke and try to get your hands on some recreational drugs. Do your best to live in luxury, and pursue hedonism with a passion. Party every chance you get. Lie, cheat, and steal and stab even your friends in the back for a cheap thrill. Get whatever you can from your parents and family. Tell them you need money for charity work you are doing. Keep the truth a secret as long as you can, especially from family -- that you are a rat.

	109554 : ["Satan worshiping has never existed in any real sense.  The Roman Catholic church and other bodies have accused various people of worshiping Satan just so they would have an excuse to kill those people. Some people have emulated the things Satanists have been accused of, but it seems like it's just an excuse to have some orgies.  Then, when they get bored, they move on. When you think of Satan, you probably think of him rebelling against God and all that rot.  That's from mistranslations, poetry, and stuff that people make up.  Satan only has a bit part in Christianity: the Book of Job.  And that sounds more like a parable telling people to worship God even when bad things happen to them.  There's no reason to believe that it was anything other than a fable or that Satan was in any way real. Lucifer isn't Satan either.  Lucifer is the planet Venus.  In some places in the bible, the Greeks translated \"morning star\" to Lucifer.  Lucifer doesn't exist either. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying that God exists.  I'm just saying that even if God did, neither Satan or Lucifer has anything to do with God.  They're just characters in stories. The Church of Satan does weird ceremonies, has orgies, etc., but it's about atheism, not Satanism.  They're mocking religion, not being a part of it.  You have to be some kind of cool partying hippie to join the Church of Satan, and you need to be invited to one of their grottoes somehow.  I think it's alot harder to get into the Church of Satan than to get into regular churches. You can buy membership cards for the Church of Satan on the Internet, but they don't actually make you a member.  You're basically spending $500 on a piece of paper that doesn't do anything. If you want to act evil, you need to pick a pagan god, such as Moloch.  Moloch was the Hebrew god of fire and demanded sacrifices.  To perform a sacrifice to Moloch, you would first build some kind of statue to Moloch that had a furnace of some kind inside.  Then you would throw wheat, goats, and especially infants into the fire in the middle of the statue.  Then you would close the statue, and Moloch would \"eat\" the sacrifices with fire. Yahweh, the \"god\" you're speaking of, was a foreign god that got added to the Caananite pantheon.  As time passed, all the other gods somehow got lumped together and called Yahweh.  I imagine Yahweh as being sort of like Sylar from Heroes.", 10098, "1AZIDkNlaa", 2],
