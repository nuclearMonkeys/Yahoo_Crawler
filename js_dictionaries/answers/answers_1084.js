He is allowed to watch TV TWO HOURS a day. He is expected to play outdoors and ride his bike and get physical exercise and READ in his room, also. If you want a \"well-balanced\" child, you need to enforce some rules and set some boundaries. That's what good parents do.", 8054, "d39dc2a48a86bf08c5bfb20d68522559aa", 0],

	59696 : ["Jihad has many meanings the one you refer to that leads to martyrdom is doing every thing possible to fight the invaders of Muslim's land as in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine. Yesterday in CNN, they show the tragedy of the 15 year old Iraqi girl who was raped by five Americans before they killed and burned her with her mother, father, and little sister. Her two brothers were at school, and when they came they were shocked, if those two brothers in the future take revenge from the Americans by performing suicide bombings which is the only way they can afford then they are martyrs even if the whole world said they are terrorist. Some wise persons should study the real causes of the spread of terrorism in the world and I think it is not difficult to find the truth, watch what is going in Gaza and Iraq and you will know who the victims are and who are the real terrorists.", 8056, "AA11089327", 0],
	59697 : ["I'll give you the right answer for your question. In Islam there is 2 kinds of jihad, Major Jihad and Minor Jihad. The major one could be fighting against the enemies of Islam or even holding to your Islam where there is a lot pf pressure against Muslims. The minor Jihad could be studying far away from your family or working overseas while your family live in another country. That's only few examples.", 8056, "AA12090743", 0],
	59698 : ["Jihad literally translates to \"struggle.\" Islamically, Jihad is any form of struggle or effort exerted in the cause of Allah (God). In Islamic theology, Jihad is not limited to, as popularly understood, holy war. Jihad is of many types, with two major categories: Jihad al-Akbar (the Greater Jihad) and Jihad al-Asgar (the Lesser Jihad). Jihad al-Akbar is a struggle against the self, a jihad bin nafs, struggle of the soul. What this means is that a Muslim struggles to control their temptations and remain good Muslims. Jihad al-Asgar is a physical struggle, often associated but not limited to fighting. There are often five overlapping categories of Jihad. There is a Jihad bin nafs, already explained. There is also a Jihad bil lisan, a struggle of the tongue. It is essentially correcting the evil perceived in the world and encouraging the good through speech, writing, and other such forms. There is also a Jihad bil ilm, or struggle of knowledge. It is any struggle to gain beneficial knowledge and to use it preferably to correct evil. This knowledge is not limited to Islamic knowledge and extends to the art of rhetoric, logic, medicine, et cetra.   There is also a Jihad bil yad, or struggle of the hand. It is a struggle of good and evil by the Muslim taking action to correct it. This can be using one's wealth to perhaps create a school, or taking care of one's parents, et cetra. Finally, there is a Jihad bis saif, or a struggle of the sword. This is a war that can only be declared by the leader of a unified Muslim state (most hold that only the Caliph can order war) and is bound legally by several rules of war in Islam. There are two types of such war - defensive and offensive: Defensive warfare is permitted whenever the Muslim state is attacked. Offensive warfare is permitted whenever oppression exists in a land, as traditionally understood. Extremist sects and other Muslims draw varying interpretations.", 8056, "54e3c9c3be595e67191b51354d2915ccaa", 0],

	59701 : ["Well it's ur choice if u want to follow god or not. That's what free will means. Obviously if u want to follow god then u want to live by his law. The holy spirit is not there to control us, its there to guide us. Satan can't control u either. He can influence u though. Think about it, he could say \" jump of the bridge!\" or u gonna do it or not? See, free will. Or ur about to turn, are u gonna turn left or right? no one tells u what to do, U choose.

	59702 : ["Not according to the believers, but I do think so. - We never had free will in the first place. the choices we make are always constantly being influenced by our experiences.

	59703 : ["I know very little of what little is known of the Essenes. Here's what i know. they were a very strict and very accurate religious group of old covenant Israelites that lived separate from normal Israelites society.

I hold Saint Dymphna in high esteem for her intercession for the disturbed.  I find Saint Jerome shares many of my personality flaws, but I lack his heroic virtue.  I am blown away by mystics like Sts. John of the Cross and Teresa of Avilla.  Followers of the Poverello are attempting to educate me.  Padre Kolbe shows the ultimate love.

	59715 : ["Jihad is a holy war based on strong religious beliefs in which   fighting and death are considered necessary in order to bring about the desired change.  Martyerdom occurs when a person acting on their strong religious beliefs; usually in missionary type work, are killed by people who don't have the same belief.  Jihad involves violent attacks on others to force them to change.  Martyerdon involves being murdered because of expressions of belief.  Both seek to affect change, however, a jihad initiates aggressive violent attacks to bring about its desired change.", 8056, "fefedd9e756983ba173b70d412c7a40baa", 0],
	59716 : ["jihad simply means struggle... we all struggle. the idea that struggles with others are greater or more meaningful than struggles with ourselves can be a harmful and evil delusion.  we must not blame others for our own shortcomings or lack of faith.  Allah would rather have a world full of infidels than a single deceived, lying and false Muslim.   Martyrdom is self-sacrifice.  We can sacrifice parts of ourselves if it will serve Allah or the greater truth.  But only Allah can judge that sacrifice or determine if we are truly martyred.  The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr.", 8056, "None", 0],

John the Baptist was an Essenes, He was send by Zechariah \"to eat lotust and honey in the wilderness\"  Are you expecting Zechariah will left his boy alone in desert? John baptist people in Jordan River including Jesus... John the Baptist ALSO have relation with Jesus (through Elizabeth and Mary) 6 of Jesus disciple are reported as Zealots,  the military branch of Essenes... Jesus didn't marry, like the Essene... And Joseph, Jesus' step father is an Essenes too.  That's why they fled to Egypt, where another Essenes community was establish there. Basically, Jesus condemn Pharisees and Saducess and never condemn Essenes... =)", 8058, "FFqWeIX7aa", 1],
	59720 : ["There and elsewhere.  He refers to his followers (in the New Testament manuscripts) as the 'Ebiones' (usually translated as 'the poor' to avoid awkward questions), and Josephus refers to them as 'Essenes'; the customs of wearing white, living frugally in communities, holding money in common, obeying the Torah and following a way of life emphasising spiritual preparation and development are common both to the Essenes and Jesus' followers of The Way. In addition, Jesus shows the qualities of a Jain Tirthankara, or 'Keeper of the Way', and demonstrates many of the principles of Jainism, including non-violence ('Ahimsa'), forgiveness of karma ('Samvara'), attention to the causes of Karma ('Asrava'), virtue ('Punya') and liberation from worldly bondage ('Moksha'), which are not part of Jewish tradition (or if they are, they are not widely publicised).  He combines this with the healing skills of the Therapeutae, and the long-lost Suerni skill of creating food from air.  This suggests a well-rounded education to give shape to his incredible natural talents. When active in Judaea, he was active as an Essene.  His followers lived by the Essene principles of frugality, cleanliness and having all possessions in common (including their money, looked after by Judas), and despite not being a Pharisee or Sadducee Jesus was recognised as a 'rabbi', a knowledgeable teacher of Judaic law.  This is easily explained by concluding that he was an Essene. So yes, he was an Essene - and more than an Essene.  But whether he was taught and trained at the Qumran community, or whether he founded it, that is another question.", 8058, "3P3ntjCgaa", 0],

At first I blamed Him for all the troubles in my life, then I reasoned there couldn't possible be a God if all these horrible things were happening. But after talking to the Witnesses and them showing me from the Bible that these evils are from the Devil I learned the truth about God and His son Jesus Christ. I now have a peace and sense of security that I never dreamed I could attain. Becoming a Witness of Jehovah has been a blessing to to my life.", 8055, "aecec2f4a386520d306854dcbedb6345aa", 0],

I was raised Catholic and never really felt any connection, even though I sat in church every Sunday/Holiday and attended many classes.  I married a Catholic guy and still can't connect with his beliefs or attend church with him.  It is just not me or who I want to be.   I'm going to get thumbs down for this, but I think that organized religions are for the weak or easily brainwashed.  Someone jams a theory down their throat and they just accept it because thats the way it is.  There are a lot of religions out there, so in my mind that proves that no one religion is right.  However, everyones religion is right for them.

These things take their minds off tv etc and they feel great when they are not only spending that xtra bit of time with you - but also feel they are helping you as well.
