I'm asking if anyone else is having issues with their federal refunds, derrrr. Was that hard for you to understand? 3) What would be a reason it's still processing then? What could be the hold up? Try responding kindly instead of being a punchable, argumentative, little soy boy. 4) I've never spoken to you before you delusional weirdo, stop being so pretentious, look at my question history, there are many \"Mike's\" you know?

You're going to keep assuming I've talked to you before in your response when my history will show I clearly haven't talked to you.

Check the Mike you talked to and confirm we are not the same person. Answer 3) Why was that so hard? You had to be a weirdo autist loser looking for a fight instead of just saying 8 weeks isn't that long, 16 weeks is long? Was that so hard? I've never spoken to you, internet tough guy champ.

Get professional assistance if the success of your business means anything to you. You could be taxed in one of many different ways, depending on your circumstances and which elections you've made. Elections? Huh? Many states will charge any business entity that exists whether it makes money or not. California, for example, charges at least $800 per year to renew your business license. What's your business start date? A business has started once all systems are in place for the business to operate whether any sales have been made or not. For example, a storefront business start date is the day the doors are opened for the grand opening, whether they sell anything or not. Most businesses are not as clear on the start date.
