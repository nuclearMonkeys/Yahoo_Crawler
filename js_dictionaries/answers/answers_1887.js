	100086 : ["Either way, you'll never get together if you don't make the first move. Remember - SMS, Texting or Face Book are impersonal tools and lack personal touch and are treated as such. Here are a few tips on how to ask that special someone on a date.  1. Take a deep breath and try to stay calm - You want to seem interested in her but not desperate for attention. 2. Think about why you like her - In your head, make a list of a few things you could talk about with her -- or a question you've been wanting to ask. 3. Give her a call or find her online - Or, if you're brave, get her alone after school or somewhere that you often see each other. 4. Ask her if she can talk for a couple of minutes - If it's not a good time to talk, ask her when a better time might be. 5. When you find a good time to talk - have a conversation about something you have in common: a class, a neighborhood, a favorite band or sports team, etc. 6. Once again, relax - Laugh when she says something funny. Listen to what she has to say. Be yourself. 7. Tell her that something she just said is really great and ask she if she'd like to hang out sometime. 8. If She says \"Yes\" - Make plans about when and how you want to get together. Good for you! 9. If she says \"No\" - Give yourself a pat on the back for trying. Everyone gets turned down sometimes, and you'll have plenty of chances to use this technique in future. Tips: 1. Above all else, be YOURSELF. You want the other person to like you for you, not some Phony version of you. 2. Have an idea of what \"Hanging out\" might consist of - A Movie, a Trip to the park, a Get-together with some friends, a Sporting event, A Play/Theatre etc. Share your idea with the other person and ask what she thinks. 3. Try to do this when you're feeling good about yourself - If you've just received good news about something, there's a great reason to call up the person you like and spread the happiness around. 4. If you get \"NO\" for an answer - don't dwell on it everyone have their own likes and dislikes, it does not mean rejection.  You're just as great as you were five minutes ago, but with a bit more dating experience. Good Luck>r", 9721, "6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa", 0],

It has a fox girl that is madly in love with a boy from a small town... The boy is terribly shy and is constantly sexually harassed by the girl, which makes this show the 2nd funniest I have ever seen! Then a new transfers who also is supernatural falls in love with him which throws him into The a LOVE Triangle.   Follow up Clannad up with Shuffle It is super sad... It mad me madder than Clannad because of how ushio dies... but The way my favorite character in shuffle goes crazy hurt me. That technically isn't a spoiler... Sekirei is 1st and is a top 5 of mine! It involves action, fighting (mostly girls), super powers, romance, a few deaths. It is a Great show to see!  2nd Highschool of the Dead a zombie series, The hole world has been infected by a virus and the main characters are in shcool when the virus hits! The fight for survival begins. This show is super good but im kinda scary and I wasn't to freaked out. watch it.   3rd Kanokon is next but way different. It has a fox girl that is madly in love with a boy from a small town... The boy is terribly shy and is constantly sexually harassed by the girl, which makes this show the 2nd funniest I have ever seen! Then a new transfers who also is supernatural falls in love with him which throws him into The a LOVE Triangle.   4th is Crayon Shin-chan which is all laughs and has no real plot the main character is like 6 and is really Funny and bad! the 3rd funniest show I know.   5th is Zettai Shougeki: Platonic Heart which is only 5 episodes but has the best ending to a show I have seen! The twist is crazy! all action   6th Amaenaide yo!! or ah my buddah is a show with 1 boy that lives in a temple with Hot girls and 1 other who likes him... enough said. Not the best storyline but not bad it is a 6/10 on a normal scale. maybe 7/10 on an ecchi because the typically do'nt have great plots   7th Girls bravo which is Super funny for it's sexual humor... plot isn' super great but basic, Finding love. It doesn't sound great to a guy but it is funny and include tons of Giants Boobs...   8th Chobits it is a romance and a slightly comedy, a bit hard to explain but is fairly decent   9th Rosario + Vampire is really repetitive and would be higher on the list if It wasn't. It is about a boy that some how was enrolled to a Monster school and every ones trying to kill him, The only way he lives is his 1st friend he made there is a Vampire  All are dubbed if you like dub Most all have some comedy In them...  These are non ecchi  Schoolrumble- is funny to me because the main character is a guy and there are moments that he said stuff that has gone through my mind... I can relate @ times   Ouran highschool host club Is super popular and will not disappoint!  Fruit basket is also funny it is close to oura highschool host club   Shakugan No Shana is a great show for romance with action 2nd to only sekirei and not counting highschool of the dead because there isn' t muuch romance...   highschool of the dead super good! but i am a complete horror scarry cat! I watched it in 1 night so im up @ 3AM like (0)___(0) and was a bit slow to leave my room to get a pop tart... It isn't really sorry either which is the sad part. I know... smh   Dont remember if i listed spice and wolf... Ill list it any way This ia another top of the like show that is funny because of how fisty the girl is (Holo) super pretty and likes to drink. Good show!   Desert punk is also good! Funny and has action, the show is based in the desert he is like a 15 yr old mercenary for hire, the demon of the desert! It is good and only like 28 eps  Next is durarara I strategic and a comedy that also includes supernatural one of my favorites.  Eden of the east is a 10 too it begins weird but is great! Really tactical and like code geass with less fighting  Code geass is good but I watched it young, it is tactical and has lots of action.  FLCL it's reall random and there are only 6 episodes but it has great comedy   All are english dubed so have @ IT", 9725, "DzeGbg1Laa", 1],
