	133427 : ["There are so many but since we have a multitude of different faiths here in Yahoo Answers I give you this: In a Letter from the Prophet Mohammad (Peace be upon him) to The Assyrian Christians he says: “If a Christian woman is married to a Muslim and does not want to embrace Islam, she has liberty to worship at her own church according to her own religious belief, and her husband must not treat her unkindly on account of her religion. If any one disobeys this command, he disobeys God and his prophet and will be guilty of a great offense.\" The prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) married a lady who was Christian, Maria, and another woman who was a Jewess, Safiyyah. Both reverted to Islam before he married them. Tolerance like this is found in no other religion. As one witnesses everyday, the other non-Muslim party usually sees the beauty of Islam and they themselves revert to Islam, on their own accord.

Two generations after WW2, I am appalled that the word \"internment camp\" can be spoken seriously. Let's just round up the Jews in concentration camps, while we're at it-- and how about Japanese-Americans? We can arrest them all too.  Some people have short memories. People who make these sorts of sweeping generalizations do so out of blind fear. They refuse to believe that there are moderate, peaceful Muslims because it clashes with their preconceived notions.  There is no central authority in Islam. There's no pope, no one final arbiter of correct Muslim theology. Muslims differ in their beliefs vastly. A Western Muslim can be as different from a Saudi Muslim as a Christian is from a Hindu.  Western Muslims ARE speaking out against terrorism. I interviewed a young Muslim woman in the wake of the Danish cartoon controversy who was the head of a Muslim Students Association at her university. She was furious about the rioting overseas and the terrorism that was being carried out in the name of Islam. I think her exact words were, \"People who kill in the name of Islam are not Muslims.\"  She wrote about it. She spoke about it. So have many other Muslims. They're not being heard, for one reason or another, either because the media isn't giving them an adequate voice, or because people choose not to listen. \"Find them and kill them\": Is this really your name? Are you serious? Grow up. And read the Bible, while you're at it. The Qur'an doesn't have the market cornered on religious verses that seem to condone violence.  Do you call everyone a \"left-wing sycophant,\" or only people who disagree with you?

	133439 : ["I think that Israel, as a legitimate nation state, has a duty to protect their citizens from military attacks. Strictly Speaking's view of rocket assaults on innocent civilians as “comical” is only one of the maladapted views he displays. Quickly, before he makes it private, go see Strictly Speaking q & A history of rabid bigotry directed to all people of color. One “question” disgustingly asks  How many poor brown people's lives is an American citizen worth? He has questions and answers that reveal he is an admitted Holocaust denier and rabid antisemite. I doubt he cares about the Palestinian Arabs and their darker skin as evidenced by a number of his comments.  He simply hates Jews MORE than he hates Muslims.  But make no mistake, he has displayed contempt for both Arab and Israeli in his Q& A history. “What do you think of westerners wearing the keffiyeh (Arab scarf)?1 week ago Best Answer - Chosen by Asker  by Dr. Congo  the same as their wearing Che Guevara badges/shirts: it has sadly become a commercial icon for complacent pseudo-radicals; a form of moral masturbation.” His voice carries no meaning because of his self displayed admissions that  people of other colors, nations, or beliefs have no meaning to him.  I now move on from such wothlessness, to something more important. No other nation on the planet would have been as restrained as Israel has been in trying to protect its very existence for 60 years of onslaught.  Israel dedicated itself to working with the nations surrouding it to establish a peaceful Middle East in it's Declaration of Independence. Look at the charters for Hamas and for the PLO. They are dedicated to elimination of Israel. Only when their desire to build a nation in peace is greater than their desire to destroy Israel will they live and work toward that peace. Israel is ready.  A simple search engine can show anyone interested how many BILLIONS of dollars of humanitarian aide has been given to Gaza AND the West Bank in the past decade.  If my home state had half that much our highways and bridges wouldn't be so dilapidated.  They also have a per capita higher percentage of university graduates.  The tiny area of Gaza..has 3 universities.  Two of them funded by both US and HAMAS aide! The other also receives assistance from the US, but supports Fatah.   When Gaza was a part of Egypt, they were not crying out to the world...\"OCCUPATION\".  Now, when EGYPT threatens to break their legs if they return, they don't cry to the world against Egypt.  They cry against the nation state that pulled out and GAVE them millions of dollars of economic infrastructure in the form of greenhouses..PURCHASED by the way with AMERICAN JEWISH DONATIONS as a gesture of goodwill so that the Gazans who had formerly been employed there could now be the people who OWNED their businesses.  What did they do? Hours after Israel retreated, Gazans TRASHED the greenhouses!  Literally stole food from their own babies with the wages they could have earned shipping produce and flowers all across Europe as those greenhouses had formerly done when owned by Israelis.

Sister you cant really say ONE beautiful thing in Islam, its covered with beauty that anything will make you ponder over the beauty of Islam. Anyway sister about you asking something that a lot of people dont know about is i would say being humble when you are being mocked at... Allah says in the Quran(25:63) \"And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allah) are those who walk on earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness.\" Why i chose this verse is because many and many of the non muslims believe Islam to be a violent relegion... Subhanallah praise and glory be to thee Lord of the worlds how much more beautiful can it get than this sister. take a look at that does it ask us to bomb the person who mocks us but it asks us to reply back with MILD words of GENTLENESS. And another teaching of Islam that i would say is really beautiful is the treating of one's mother. The mother is honoured three times more than the father. This does not mean Islam makes women superior to men... men are over women in certain responsibilities so are women over men in certain responsibilities.. OVERALL both are equal... the prophet muhammed (pbuh) has said \" Paradise lies at the feet of your mother\"... Subhanallah i love that hadith", 11177, "c7c3218549b25859f7068df49213e12faa", 8],

	133455 : ["Malory Towers is a fictional Cornish seaside boarding school which features in a series of six novels by British children's author Enid Blyton. The series follows the heroine Darrell Rivers from her first year at Malory Towers to when she leaves. Other characters include Sally Hope (Darrell's level-headed best friend), Felicity Rivers (Darrell's younger sister), Gwendoline-Mary Lacy (the form's spoilt martyr), Alicia Johns (sharp tongued, competitive and smart), Mary-Lou (small and timid, but very kind hearted), Irene (scatterbrained musical genius), Belinda (scatterbrained artistic genius), Jean (shrewd and straightforward) and Wilhelmina (Bill) (completely horse-mad). The characters tend to be stereotypes and are very similar to the set of characters in the St Clare's series, which Blyton also wrote. The series is believed to be semi-autobiographical, and the name \"Darrell Rivers\" is clearly drawn from Blyton's second husband's name, Kenneth Darrell Waters. It is also widely supposed that Blyton based the creation on the famous Scottish boarding school St Leonards School in St Andrews, which is, of course, the heroine's University destination. Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow. Darrell, the main character in the story, begins her career ingloriously: determined to do well and make friends, she falls under the spell of the brilliant but mischievous Alicia Johns, neglecting her schoolwork in favour of fooling around and playing pranks on the staff. The reader is treated to an early exposition of her violent temper (inherited from her father) when she rescues Mary-Lou, a smaller, weaker girl in her form, who is being held under water by the malicious Gwendoline Mary Lacy, and delivers a stinging rebuke to Gwendoline with the flat of her hand. She rebuffs Mary-Lou's attempts to make friends, since she believes Mary-Lou to be feeble and unable to stand up for herself and clashes with fellow new girl Sally Hope, who insists that she is an only child despite written and verbal assurances from Darrell's mother that she has an infant sister. This leads to another altercation, in which a violent shove from Darrell possibly exacerbates Sally's smouldering appendicitis, forcing Darrell's father (a surgeon) to perform an impromptu appendicectomy in the school's sick-bay. The experience of thinking that she has made Sally seriously ill, leads Darrell to a greater determination to conquer her temper. Sally's attitude is revealed as pathological jealousy, which is resolved by her parents leaving her infant sister behind to visit her. Sally and Mary-Lou later stand by Darrell during a malicious episode (orchestrated by Gwendoline) in which Darrell is unjustly accused of spitefully destroying Mary-Lou's fountain pen. The first book ends with Darrell and Sally being firm friends and Mary-Lou an associate. Darrell's career from this point is smoother, and she eventually covers herself in the personal, scholastic and sporting glory that was originally expected of her: she is head of the fourth form, games captain of the fifth, and head-girl in her final year as well as being a successful lacrosse and tennis player. In all of the books she plays a pivotal role, though she is not always successful in her endeavours and indeed is temporarily stripped of her fourth-form captaincy (she is caught shaking a smaller girl who was threatening to reveal a misdeed of Darrell's out of personal spite), though she gets it back again by resolving a particularly complicated case of sibling rivalry. She is on friendly terms with most of her classmates and even makes her peace with Gwendoline Lacy at the end, when a personal tragedy strikes the vain, selfish class outcast. At the end of her school career, Darrell is bound for the University of St Andrews.", 11179, "c8bc04a4b8ec1e70c85caf42db80fd60aa", 1],

YA has been inundated lately with some horrifically racist and xenophobic posts and I remain hopeful that this is not indicative of British society as a whole. Thankfully the type of sad, deluded individuals who revel in mischief making and abhorrent, vile accusations (sometimes fuelled by drink, sometimes by their own sick mindsets) are being shown up for what they are on an ongoing basis by the fair-minded and sensible posters on YA who actually have a modicum of intelligence.  Sweeping generalisations and stupid stereotyping will not help to alleviate the frightening issues the world faces today. What will take us forward is constructive dialogue, genuine understanding of what causes such huge resentment and a combined approach to tackling terrorist issues all over the world, WHOEVER is committing those atrocities.  My final comment (could go on all night but hey, I need some beauty sleep as well...lol) is directed at the educated racists (yes, there are some) who can actually string a coherent sentence together. Lies and scaremongering about Islam do nothing to further your cause - the fools who subscribe to BNP idealogies may listen but those of us with more than one brain cell are not hoodwinked by your vitriol.  Arguing, finger-pointing, recriminations, abuse, wild accusations, covert and overt racism don't make for a happy society - in fact, the opposite is true. Disaffected youth led to riots in the past - why are you hellbent on going down the same road again? Why not actually learn something about others instead of blatantly stupid remarks such as those witnessed so often on here over the past week or so? I repeat something I said the other day on a post, when someone tried to lie about the Qu'ran and what Islam says. The Qu'ran CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY states that there is NO compulsion in religion. Despite despicable attempts by many to suggest otherwise, Islam is NOT about the sword....it is about peace and living in harmony. Stop being fooled by the idiots who misinterpret the religion and twist meanings and directives to suit their own evil, misguided and intolerant aims. These are criminal attacks and are deplored by the larger muslim community - I could not have thought of a better slogan for this campaign.
