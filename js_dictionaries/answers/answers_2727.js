I used to have very bad acid reflux, and when I had a bad night, I would get clear bubbles on the inside of my lip from the acid. They were painful, but after applying a lot of chapstick and eating Tums, they would go away in a few hours. Now, it's also possible you have an infection in the cracks on your lips. Try using antibacterial Neosporin, if this is the case. Ultimately, if they don't go away very, very soon, go to a doctor. If its an STD or a staph infection, you will want it treated right away.

I also like their appreciation of stevie ray vauguan. I almost forgot Eddie van haleb should probably be in the top 10 or 5 and Randy rhoads should be top 35 so should Joe Walsh. I believe that both Hendrix and allman should be lowered slightly but not by much and at least put Clapton in the top three. Kim thayil and Robbie krieger should be higher. And Andy summers should be included somewhere. I'm glad that they had tom Morello though. Pete Townshend should be higher.

If you actually read through Rolling Stone issues you'll see them praising to high heavens various people, but when it comes time for their \"500 (100) greatest (albums/songs/artists/whatever)\" lists, they conveniently forget what they write.  I honestly believe they contrive these lists simply to sell copies.   Case in point:  if you get an old \"Rolling Stone Album Guide\" you will see that no Warren Zevon album ranked any lower than 3 1/2 stars, and in 1980 they labeled Zevon's \"Stand in the Fire\" \"the greatest live album ever made.\"  But they issue their \"500 greatest albums\" list, and there's no Zevon on it ANYWHERE.  What, did 500 albums better than Zevon's get released between 1980 and 1995 when they made the list?  No, the REAL answer is putting Zevon and other \"critics' darlings\" on the list won't sell copies, so they throw out the good for the mass appeal. Pathetic.
