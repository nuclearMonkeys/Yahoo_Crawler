	55327 : ["Tachyons are theoretical particles and have never been detected.  The idea that some shameless woopeddlar can sell you a lump of rock that's going to reconnect your chakras, protect you from the evil effects of your mobile phone or whatever is just a load of festering bollocks!", 7702, "b6e0dc8ffe2b0db9a1e3d82efa351d40aa", 3],
	55328 : ["There are crystals which emit Cherenkov Radiation, which is similar in the sense that it's caused by particles exceeding the local speed of light in that medium.  Diamonds for example tend to look bluish because of that.  But tachyons probably don't exist, and if they do, they are unlikely to interact with baryonic matter such as crystals.", 7702, "0GPMDJYKaa", 0],

	55340 : ["Well... sorta.  There's no doubt that comets & asteroids pummel the sun every so often... the material in those objects can be described as 'dirt' - metals, silicates, etc.   Those fall into the Sun, and become part of it.  That being said, the atoms are then ionized - stripped of their electrons; compounds break apart, as atoms can no longer be bound to other atoms, so... you essentially have the basic elements that went into the chemical makeup of those objects on/in the Sun (and, a good portion is likely blasted into space as well...) So - the chemical elements that used to make up 'dirt' may exist there, but becoming part of the Sun means they're no longer bound to other atoms that *make* \"dirt\"...  ", 7718, "FiCIAYGGaa", 2],

	55348 : ["Speaking of practicality: what exactly would be the point of a \"human base\" up in outer space? The ISS is useless enough, so what would be the point of having fragile humans with all their cumbersome life support systems holed up on another planet? What would it actually DO for you? What would it DO for me? What use would it be for anyone? Funny but once you puff away the clouds of hype that surround the notion of humans on Mars, there is no substance. Nobody discusses what we do with it, what use it would be, and how the colossal cost would be justified. All you hear is airy fairy ways to go about it and the corny old cliche: \"oh Mars is the stepping stone to the next planet\". Lol, it begins to look like a cosmic Ponzi scheme. Fund up a Mars base, then based on the sheer hype, seek funding to the next planet, then more hype, and fund to the next. At what point does the public realise the pointlessness of it all?  If we truly want to explore the planets, moons, asteroids and comets in the solar system, the tried and proven way to do it is robotically. It costs less than one percent of cumbersome and troublesome manned missions, is far more reliable, and just as effective if not more so.", 7722, "bXMPytYEaa", 0],

	55354 : ["Yes, we \"can\" build pyramids exactly. We just choose not to. We could probably align them even more precisely with the three stars of Orion (even though these three stars do not form a perfect line... therefore they are not \"exactly aligned\"). A French architect did explain how the pyramids were built without the need of aliens. He explained it in a paper that was peer-reviewed, verified and re-verified... over ten years ago. Intelligent people have known, for a decade, that the pyramids are just what they seem: piles of rocks built by humans. There are no DNA symbols in hieroglyphs. Just because Americans (who have trouble speaking proper English and understanding what democracy should really mean) don't want to understand how the pyramids were built, does not mean that aliens are needed to explain them.", 7715, "524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa", 4],
	55355 : ["The real question is why do you so passionately want space aliens to exist? All those things you mention have perfectly earthly explanations. We prefer to build stuff out of steel girders these days. Piles of rock went out of fashion millenia ago. You can read almost anything into hieroglyphs. It never occurred to you that a double spiral might actually represent rope making? That stuff about figurines, paintings etc was a craze decades ago. Most people have had a laugh, grown up and moved on since then, rather like believing someone can bend spoons with their mind. Perhaps instead of believing in nonsensical interpretations of other people's artistic peculiarities, you could instead critically examine why exactly you so much want boogiemen  to exist up in space. Even if they did exist, what difference would it make to you? Why does it matter so much for you to believe that they do exist? By examining questions like thee you will learn something real about yourself, and about others who follow cultish belief systems. Don't waste your time on those creepy websites that pretend that space aliens exist and are involved in anything that can't be explained, even when it can be explained. Their procedure is to ingratiate themselves to you by telling you that  you are \"special\" because you believe their nonsense. In fact if you do actually believe their nonsense, you really are special, but not in a very complimentary way, and certainly not in the way they make you believe. Don't lower yourself to believing such infantile rubbish. There are far better things to spend your precious time on.", 7715, "bXMPytYEaa", 2],

	55361 : ["Because the acceleration and deceleration of the planet is very slight.  Earth spends half the year accelerating and the other half decelerating, at a rate of 1.3 km/h/h.  If you were in a vehicle travelling at 80 kph and after an hour it was travelling at 81.3 kph, you wouldn't notice.", 7705, "0GPMDJYKaa", 0],
	55362 : ["Energy came to a point ; the Singularity' and exploded ; the 'Big Bang'. That is the mathematics of it.    My own  thought is that the universe is a continuum. It is not a straight line continuum, but follows a wavy line of Expansion and Contraction.; a Sinusoidal curve. Currently we view the universe as an expansion; everything is moving away from each other.  At some point in time billion/trillions/quadrillions of years in advance it will contract. ", 7706, "0cc349e5b23bb03a0dcb7d4307ba36b0aa", -1],

	55366 : ["There are several issues here.  Yes, more money and resources, committed for decade plus lengths of time, would help develop more efficient launch systems, and reduce the costs of launches.  The next problem is that there really isn't a good substitute for Earth for settlement purposes in this solar system. Bases on the Moon or Mars would require a lot of life support and long term residency on either would weaken the resident such that they might not be able to withstand Earth gravity if they wanted to come back.  Space based habitats, such as O'Neil cylinders, could work better, but they'd have to be built in space, which requires a far greater infrastructure then even a few decades of serious investment could create.", 7709, "BZnWmkofaa", 1],
