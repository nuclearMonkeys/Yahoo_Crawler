	75990 : ["I think it is very good that you are considerate of how God views all your requests of Him.   The fact that God continues to assist you even when you openly sin (having sex out of wedlock) shows His mercy.  Your guilt is based on your continuing to take from God.  You are starting to realize that you are not loving Him in return, and this is starting to wear on your heart.   Begin to pray for things that strengthen your spirit, rather than things that make life comfortable.  Ask God to help you become more obedient.  Like not having sex out of marriage.  Obedience is a natural occurrence that comes from loving God ... and you are not there yet.  Pray that God puts love in your heart overflowing for Him.   These things bring God pleasure to do for you as they are requests that help you love Him back.  God really doesn't care about your bike.  But, He knows your spirit is weak, and He is showing you His love for you.  But, if you do not return His love some day ... things may change.   This is a relationship your in with God, and it is coming time you carry your weight.   Start today, ask Him, no beg Him for wisdom and to flood your heart with love for Him.  Ask for forgiveness for you pettiness and express your gratitude for His patience with you.  You have a HUGE event ahead of you ... your marriage.  You'll need God to answer the flood of prayers that will come when things get tough.  And believe me, they will get tough.  A natural progression with true love for God is talking (praying) to Him every day, not just when you need some material thing.  Like a marriage ... your relationship with Him must become refined and continue to grow.   If your husband to be is not a Godly man or has no intention to become one ... life will become even harder still.", 8824, "7C3Bhp7baa", 1],

I always ask forgiveness for my sins-(too many to count) and I thank God for the blessings he has given me. I've learned it's easy to blame God for the bad things in life, but you have to remember-God gives everyone free will. Whether it's the lock you chose for your shed or the bad neighborhood you parked your car in. He also gives criminals free will.(Sucks for the good people like us) Instead of feeling guilty about asking God to help with your car and financial situations, thank him daily for the blessings he's given you. Maybe he's answering these prayers of yours in the hopes that you'll become closer to him.

Or is it just not as \"icky\" as a man and a man?  Really though what is the difference?  If it's not only accepted but common practice for opposite sex couples to engage in anal sex, why is it any different for 2 men to do the same? Either way you look at it that hole is not meant for that, but it's okay if a man does it to a woman, but not okay if a man and a man do it?? It makes no sense, horrible hypocritical double standards!! There is no legitimate, non-religious reason I can come up with as to why gay marriage should not be allowed..  Their sexuality is no concern of mine, same as any straight couples sexual appetites and practices are no concern of mine.. What people do in the bedroom has no bearing on marriage, not really.. Should BSDM couples not marry because their sexual acts are \"icky\" or unusual to others? Should opposite sex couples who practice anal sex not get married because some think it is \"icky\"?  You see what people do behind closed doors in their sex life has no bearing on marriage.. they can do what they please and what pleases their partner and it has no effect on me, or anyone else. People want to get married because they want to be recognized as committed, devoted and in love.. people get married so they can enjoy the legal benefits.. what they do in the bedroom does not detract from who they are as people every day.
