When we are reduced to our simple truths, we are all humans, we have brains for thinking and mouths to pass the thoughts on, just because each brain and mouth are located in an identity, it does not mean that the identity holds the same gravity. For example; what/who was more important, the founder of a martial art, or the fact that the art was used to save lives? Students of the arts refer to their instructors a lot. This is because an instructor does not just teach martial arts, he/she teaches a way of existence. Instructors are mentors in life, they make very big impacts and change most students for better or worse.

MMA types and fighters address me by my first name although some will instead use my last name and Mr. with that.  Even when they use my first name its not done with a lack of respect and that's fine for me in that environment. Students and other instructors though use Sensi or Mr. and that's fine.  I don't consider myself a master; nor do I want to be lumped into that category that misuses and mis-applies that title either like many do today.  In my style, Shito-ryu and the group I am affiliated with the master himself never uses that title except when signing something like a promotion certificate.  Others see and recognize him as that and he holds that title but does not wear it on his sleeve.  His name and reputation precede him along with his knowledge and ability really among all of us anyways.  It is also the same for the Shihan of my style although technically he falls under that category of \"master\" also. For me its much like when I was in the military especially in my later years and a person of rank, experience, and ability.  If I had to constantly rely on my title and rank then that indicated maybe a lack of skill, experience, and ability.  Instead I always wanted my reputation and that together with my skill, experience, and ability establish who and what I was so that I did not have to rely on my title and rank.  Title and rank just gave me something more in the way of authority and some privileges and responsibility; not necessarily the respect and admiration of my superiors, peers, or those under me.
