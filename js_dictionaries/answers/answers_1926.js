Mitt Romney won Illinois Republicans' inaugural state fair presidential straw poll Thursday, though with fewer than 1,000 ballots cast, its impact is limited at best. Still, Romney's win, with 40.4 percent or 373 votes, Despite the low-key nature of the straw poll, with none of the Republican presidential contenders in attendance, In the straw poll balloting, Thompson finished second with 20 percent or 184 votes. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was third with 18.9 percent or 174 votes; Giuliani was fourth with 11.6 percent or 107 votes; and McCain finished fifth with 4.1 percent or 38 votes. Paul's libertarian stylings and campaign of strict interpretation of the Constitution has earned him an unorthodox band of sign-carrying supporters. They frequently interrupted TV reports of the event and at one point, Romney's Illinois chairman, state Sen. Dan Rutherford (R-Chenoa), ripped a sign out of one Paul supporter's hands and threw it on the ground. [end snips] Hard to say what happened, but it shows the difference between un-paid Ron Paul supporters and the \"hoodlum\" like tactics of paid supporters of Romney!!!!!! Maybe Mr. Sen. Rutherford is lucky he didn't lose a few front teeth, in the incident!!!....Big Smile! *************************************************************", 9800, "1954d00657ad5d2db05870d7cbd8dafaaa", 4],
