So, you lost money in your stock or in your home. That is what is called an 'investment', and there are no guarantees. Obama could have, instead, offered to insure investments are a far less cost. And, not interfere with a private business. Now, he is meddling in the car companies affairs'. So many people got in 'over their heads' in debt.

And oil industries employ a whole lot more people than you imagine: distributors, manufacturers, engineers, foragers and land scouts, chemists, and the like. But maybe now the \"average American\" will take a note from Obama and his cabinet - six of them have already been convicted of tax fraud.  Out of how many ?

If I were his wife I would have brought him to the street and spat on his body all over. He had no respect for the womanhood of his wife. He had no respect to the girl next to whom he laid naked. In short, he was an insane person. Today, if anyone did that, he would be prosecuted and thrown into the prison, in any country as a matter of fact. He was a casteist. It was at his heart. He was not a noble man as many are making him to be. When he was in Africa, he did not fight for the blacks. In India, he did not fight against caste system but on the contrary he believed in it. In this day and age anyone who believes in castes would be considered uncultured, ignorant and uncivilized.  I am honestly wondering why he is called Mahatma. Please don't.", 10750, "hw08qlQ6aa", 0],

I have a confession to make that I am not intelligent as the individuals in this discussion, still cannot restrict myself from jumping in out of my habit after seeing such an excellent discussion that are not very often to see on this forum.  Without reading this poser I would not have known that Henri Ford's passion toward Gandhi, also I would not have known about what today the people think about Gandhi. I read the views of Mr Poondi, Ms Haritha, АѴІλт✪Я, contribution of Ms Jasmine. Everyone has their own views about Gandhi.  I have also read several other views about Gandhi on this forum from several other users, and I was very surprised to know that these were critical of Gandhi-Subhash Chandra Bose relations, I am sure, they don't know that in 1945, Subhash Chand Bose called Gandhi as \"Father of Nation\" and in response Gandhi called Bose as \"Prince of Nation\".  Second debate on this forum that often confuses me is, Gandhi did not save \"Bhagat Singh\" and other two. And the supporters give argument that Gandhi did appeal but that was unheard. Any insane person can understand that British wanted to hand Bhagat Singh and they hanged him, I don't understand, how Gandhi comes into picuture? This is just an excuse to accuse Gandhi.  There are several other critical analysis been made, and several analysis been published over the years against Gandhi. And no one is above criticism, even Raja Ram and Shree Krishna have been criticized on various occasions for various reasons. And Gandhi was just a human, titled as Mahatma by Gurudev RNT. जाकी रही भावना जैसी, हरि मूरत देखी तिन तैसी| So basically, who wants to look good in Gandhi, they look good, because they have good feeling in them self, and who want to look bad in Gandhi they look bad. And that is true not only for Gandhi but for any one on this universe.  What is the credebility of these critics of Gandhi? What have they done in their entire life for the society? Disgusting part is they use nationlists like Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chand Bose for their purpose, who in their life time respected Gandhi. They had differences in the path to achieve freedom, but not difference within them self. Gandhi has definitely done a lot of good work for the world that is why the world talks about him. And as human he must have some short coming too. And I am sure, these 9-5 job type of people in their old age after retirement to get some publicity decided to create some controversies, and rather than looking at the good work of Gandhi started to find what wrong did Gandhi do. Nothing wrong in that, but at the least they should not be un thankful to Gandhi who gave them opportunity to become famous. Jai Hind. Jai Bharat.", 10750, "None", 6],

The summary judgment by Judge John Dietz upheld several Texas campaign finance laws that had been challenged on constitutional grounds by King Street Patriots, a tea party organization known for its \"True the Vote\" effort to uncover voter fraud.   The ruling grew out of a 2010 lawsuit filed by the Texas Democratic Party against the King Street Patriots. The Democrats charged that the organization made unlawful political contributions to the Texas Republican Party and various Republican candidates by training poll watchers in cooperation with the party and its candidates and by holding candidate forums only for GOP candidates.   more: ", 10752, "mDs10wbbaa", 1],
