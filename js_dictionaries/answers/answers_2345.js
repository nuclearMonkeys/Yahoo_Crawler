	123064 : ["I'm not voting for any of them. Why? They are puppets... all of them. It's the wealthy elitist f***'s that have taken control of our government. David Rockefeller, the Council on Foreign Relations and the U.N. are a bunch of GLOBALISTS pukes, and they have a huge amount of control over our governmental policies. It has been said they groom our presidential candidates before we ever pick them. Since they groom both sides of the aisle, we only get the ILLUSION of choice with the 2 parties. That's why no matter who we put in office, nothing seems to get better, only worse. The globalists in our government have different agenda than the rest of us. They are all about power and control. And because no one really sees what's happening, (most people are just living their lives) they have inflitrated every level of our government from the president down. Go to the Council on Foreign Relations website ( www.cfr.org ) and type in \"North American Union\" into the search bar. Look at some of the speeches and papers, particularly the ones by Robert A. Pastor, and you'll find that they are working toward merging the U.S. with Canada and Mexico in an EU-style North American Union (NAU). This group is the real power behind our government. The CFR has 100's of the most important people in our country (and others), mainly politicians and wealthy corporation owners. Some people say they want one-world government, some say that's just a conspiracy.  But... If you look at the policies they are implementing in our country and around the world, and you think about how sneakily they are pulling off this NAU thing, I don't think there can be any other conlusion other than they are trying to erode our sovereignty and get rid of the U.S. altogether. By the way, Hillary, Obama, McCain... all CFR shills. See, so you really don't have a choice. How can we afford more war? How can we afford national health care? We can't. They are tanking our economy on purpose, devaluing our dollar in order to introduce us to the \"Amero\", one currency for the entire North American continent. (That's why oil is so high... it's NOT... the dollar is so worthless.) I'm not crazy, and I'm not making this up. Look around, you'll find the evidence. This is exactly how they did it in Europe. It took them about 50 years in Europe, starting with simple trade deals (like NAFTA). They are moving faster over here. So... you guys just keep voting for who they tell you to vote for on TV. That's exactly what they want. Oh, and you can give me all the thumbs down you want. I know you will, because you are all voting for one of the 3 evils. But if you do some investigation, you'll find out I'm right. They are tanking our economy, and Bush has already signed many agreements with Mexico and Canada. WAKE UP PEOPLE. They don't tell you this stuff on the idiot box.  Look it up on their site and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. As an example... Obama wants us to spend around $800 billion helping starving people in other countries.  I don't mind helping poor people, but right now we are the 175th wealthiest nation... out of 175.  We can't afford to feed our own at this rate.  The economy is for s****.", 10732, "None", -1],

	123066 : ["If you're staying on the Strip, don't bother renting a car. Traffic on the Strip is horrifying. It will take you much less time to walk or take the Monorail to get you where you want to go. If you want to go to Hoover Dam or something, there's bus tours that leave a couple of times a day, every day. Valet parking is free at the hotels on the Strip - you just tip about $5 when you pick up the car. A taxi should run you AT MOST $15-$20 - and that's like going from Mandalay Bay to Downtown. Average is about $5 or so. There's also the Deuce bus - a double decker bus that runs almost 24 hours a day and costs a couple of bucks a trip and stops at all the hotels.  What else does Vegas have? If you can think of it, it's probably here. Go to www.lasvegas24hours.com - it's the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce's website, and that will list EVERYTHING in the city - because I don't feel like typing it here.", 10727, "AA11536773", 3],
	123067 : ["It really depends on what you plan to do.  If you take a day trip out of Vegas you may want to rent a car. I've only rented a car once in all the times I have gone.  I find walking is a lot quicker than dealing with parking.  We used the monorail for one day just a couple of weeks ago.  The rest of the time we walked or took a taxi if it was too far to walk. Rental will cost about 40 bucks a day and tipping the valet drivers will be 2 or 3 bucks a time. We spent less than 80 bucks in 5 days on taxis. Casinos are the main attraction in Vegas, but I go for the shows.  I see a different show every night and try to take in one afternoon show if I can. There are a number of museums to kill some time and the Fashion mall (on the strip) near Treasure Island, my wife spent a number of hours there. Go to Vegas.com for more info on what to do. Have fun For those saying that the hotels offer free shuttles from the airport to their hotel, only a few non casino hotels do that.

	123068 : ["I wouldn't bother getting a car if you are staying close to the strip, and not going far from the city, like Hoover Dam or something. Whether you drive a car or take a taxi, the traffic on the strip is heavy, especially on the weekends.  Taxi lines outside of the hotels can be long, and the price of a short cab ride can be $20, but it's probably still less hassle than renting a car, sitting in traffic and parking it (that costs money too). Lots of casinos are in walking distance of each other, and you can also take the monorail.", 10727, "AA10922449", 2],

Not just because they're beautiful, but because each piece has a sentimental attachment for us. Since you are not going to be there, I think that you should look into getting her a day at the spa, or a piece of jewelry with some flowers.   If you want to go the jewelry route, you could get her one of those journey necklaces and they are available in a variety of price ranges.  Or any one of those diamond pendants, the circle, a heart, whatever appeals to you.

How about a video of you telling her how much you love her. You know, all that romantic great stuff she loves about you that she misses. You know a phone call, video and letters means the world to girls who would give up so much to see their SO. How about a spa day.  If she adores massages, facials, waxing, nails...you know the whole works........how about you get her set up for a spa (possibly a female friend to go along with her). How about a concert to her favorite artist? (a friend or family member can go with her). Does she like animals? Maybe a zoo pass?

	123104 : ["No, not at all - just as healthy as any other time in your cycle.  During menstruation sex can be more enjoyable as women are more easily aroused and more sensitive to different forms of stimulation such as g-spot stimulation, also women's moods can shift so they feel more sensual. Sex during menstruation can also ease menstrual cramps and menstrual headaches.  Risk of blood born STD's such as HIV for the man is slightly higher, and risks of pelvic infections for women are slightly higher, but as long as you're practising safer sex by using condoms etc. then the risks during menstruation verses any other time of the cycle is minimal. The only other health risk to consider is that the cervix may be sitting lower and be more sensitive so more easily hit in certain positions and with deep penetration - this won't cause serious damage, but can be a little painful.  It's biologically impossible for women to get pregnant during menstruation (no egg present and uterus lining shedding), but it IS possible to get pregnant as a result of sex during menstruation as there can be fertile quality cervical mucus present that can allow sperm to survive up to 7 days, by which time the woman may ovulate. Pregnancy risks are slightly lower, but still you should always use birth control.  Sex during menstruation can be messy - but so can sex if you're doing it right - you can reduce mess by having sex on light flow days, in the bath or shower, or just put a towel under you to avoid mess on the bed. Mess can be avoided all together by using menstrual options like softcups, soft tampons or diaphragms as menstrual cups - all these stop blood leaving your body, but sit high enough in you vagina so that they allow penetration during sex.
