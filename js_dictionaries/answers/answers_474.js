In the event that you get him, and on the off chance that he can discover a piece of your hand adequately little to fit in his mouth, he may attempt to tear into you, however I question you'd feel it. They don't have teeth. All the more critically, you would prefer not to dispose of them. In the event that they're there, this is on the grounds that there's food there. Nourishment for them is little bugs, similar to gnats, flies, insects, silverfish, cockroaches, and so forth They can eat at least twelve of these bugs each day. Consider that briefly and lets do some math. 1 gecko x 12 creepy crawlies a day = 4380 bugs for each year. In the event that you see one gecko, there are likely at any rate twelve you don't see, stowing away in the dividers, under the floor, in the upper room, and so on 12 x 4380 = 52,560 Thus, in a year that is 50,000 bugs in your home without any hunters to eat them!", 4127, "7bvFMcMgaa", 1],

	26244 : ["Basically they take a very small portion or the virus or pathogen that causes harm and injects it into you. Your body notices the small bit of foreign material and deems it as harmful. This material would be called an \"antigen.\"  You body then goes through the process of creating an \"antibody\" (AB) to kill the antigen. Once the body creates this (AB), it stores the unique (AB) design of it so that if you come across the antigen again, it takes less time for the body to produce (AB) and eliminate the antigen.  So like the COVID vaccine contains a small amount of the virus and injects it into you so you body activates an immune response just enough to make your body produces the (ABs), but not enough to produce COVID symptoms and make you sick. When getting the virus, your body may not produce the specific (AB) to eliminate the antigen before it produces to the point of symptoms. That is also the reason why if you catch the virus a second time, you are less likely to be sick, since your body has (AB) to eliminate the antigens before symptoms can occur.  The reason it take so long for your body to produce (ABs) for a new pathogen is because it has to make the one SPECIFIC pattern that eliminates the one specific pathogen. It is like a lock and key design to two puzzle pieces. Only two fit together perfectly. Your body goes through millions of different patterns of antibodies before the right one is made. They are then mass produced and wipe out the antigen.", 4135, "nl1x5N31aa", 0],
	26245 : ["Kara.  She is a lab mix rescue that we got about 8 years ago.  Right after we got, my daughter began have issues with seizures.  Some how Kara was able to sense when a seizure was coming and originally would circle my daughter, then learn to lay on her feet blocking her from moving instead.  That usually gave her a minute of two warning so that she could get herself seated or otherwise in a safe position before the seizure hit. She will fine one second, and the next on the ground totally out of it.  With Kara, she has some kind of a warning.  Kara had no training.  She just some how knew how to do this all on her own. One of her falls from a seize ended up injuring her spinal cord and leaving her in a wheel chair.  At the point Kara became invaluable for doing \"everything\" for her.  She is her lifeline to a normal life. We just recently acquired a new puppy (three months old) and are beginning the process to train her to take over Kara's duty.  At 9 years old, she is starting to slow down and show signs of her age.  (But if you harness her she can still pull a wheelchair up any kind of a hill or ramp.)  We are not looking forward to the day when Kara is no longer part of our lives.", 4122, "AA11622701", 1],

My son would badger him all day and he would never growl or bite. Whenever Bear had enough he'd come sit by me. Unfortunately Bear was a runner. One time I let him loose while I was camping and he took off. He was gone for a few hours. He casually walked back into camp like nothing happened. That was the last time I went camping that year. He died that next winter so I never got to let him roam free again. That's the one thing I wish I did more with him. Just let him loose so he could do whatever it was he was doing in those mountains.", 4122, "Zw5g2kyAaa", 1],

	26252 : ["I own rats as pets. I think they're some of the most amazing little creatures out there. But most people would disagree with me. When people hear that I have rats they almost always respond with a \"Eww! Rats??? WHY on earth would you want RATS??? Of all the things you could own, why rats? Don't their tails freak you out?\" Granted, before I owned rats I too was weirded out by their tails, but their sweet personalities quickly won me over and it only took interacting with a rat for 5 minutes for me to get over any weird feelings I had about their tails.  Before the pandemic when I would have friends over and they would meet my rats, they would always think they're adorable, even pretty. That is, until they learn that they are rats. Then they're all like \"Wait, THOSE ARE RATS??? BUT THEY'RE CUTE...\" Or they're suddenly  weirded out that I would keep rats and not a \"cuter\" rodent like a rabbit or hamster. Or they'll think they're cute, minus the tail and feet. Some say their feet look freaky or don't like how the tail and feet are \"naked\" and thus \"feel weird.\" I think their little hands are cute, but many people find it creepy that they don't have paws like a dog or cat. Some of my friends straight up refuse to call my pets \"rats\" and instead opt to call them \"mice\" or \"hamsters\" because to them those are \"cuter.\"So generally it's a mix of things; the tail, feet, their teeth, etc. But also there's always some sort of stigma people have when they hear the word \"rat.\" Usually they think of a sewer rat or the type that raid their kitchens as pests. Sadly they can't differentiate between sewer rat and domestic rat. There's a huge difference, but to most people they think of the household pests that damage property with all their chewing, and that carry diseases.  Typically rats have more of a stigma than mice do, and thus are more feared and hated by a large number of people. That isn't to say people aren't afraid of them though. Same with rats, many people can't stand their tails, and are afraid of catching any diseases from them. Really though, it mostly comes down to being afraid of what's unfamiliar. Many people weren't raised around mice and rats, or taught to view them in a positive light.  But then too, some people just have phobias to different things, even if we know that it's an irrational fear. For instance, I'm afraid of moths and butterflies, even though I know they couldn't possibly hurt me. I just can't stand the idea of them being anywhere near me, and especially not in my house. Could be similar for people who are afraid of mice and rats.", 4136, "DXhr2CS9aa", 0],
