	89865 : ["Jesus might have taken her to the prom and bought her dress too, but I don't think that helps you. I suggest she try to find a decent boy who respects her enough and has enough character to do what he says he will do. There's probably lots of those without prom dates even with 8 days to go. Encourage her to check in the chess club, those guys have a hard time finding girls and sometimes it only works if the girl is willing to step up to bat. They often end up going into engineering, medicine or science, which is a lot more realistic than going pro in baseball. The down side is they can't dance. Since the Harry Potter movies, nerds have gotten a serious boost, so the stigma of going to prom with a geek isn't what it used to be. Why is 8 days too late? It's not too late to hope! You say she's a good looking girl and she sounds responsible, buying a dress with her own money and all, she should be able to find a good guy.", 9340, "eX6MrV9Daa", 2],

	89868 : ["Your nose looks oily, so I suggest using some blotting sheets throughout the day to get rid of the shine. Have a professional shape your eyebrows. You have big eyes, so get some sleep so you can look more awake.  Use a little concealer under the eyes. Mascara and black eyeliner. Straighten your eye or get some full curls. Just have it different form how you have it now. Lipgloss. Blush to add color or use some bronzer to contour your face and make it appear slimmer.", 9342, "None", 0],
	89869 : ["Hmm...your face looks like it has soft skin, but also a bit of breakout and extra fat that keeps it from looking as enthusiastic as it should.  Omega-3 supplement and oxy-pads should give your skin's look a boost.    I know this sounds like a weird tip, but smiling a lot can help make your jaw stronger and help get rid of the fatty look.  That and exercise, of course.    The main thing though...is to show more enthusiasm: smile, open your eyes...and, perhaps most importantly, give a \"flirty look\".  The pic you took makes you look like an everyday mother more than the \"girl next door\".  And, believe me, sassy-ness helps, your face needs to have a bit of a look that says \"I'm a bit aroused and I feel like having fun & not guilty about it\".  One easy \"famous\" example of such a naughty \"cat that ate the mouse\" look: Ben Affleck.  BTW, opening your eyes more obviously helps, but opening them and dilating your pupils so you look slightly aroused helps more.   I would say it's about half attitude, half looks.  But if you look sassy but not overstated...you're good to go: I, for one, have at times been attracted to girls much chubbier than I'd guess you would be because they just looked like they were having such a good time, were so sassy, and seemed to have so few issues/baggage (and so have many of my guy friends).  So...if I were you I'd go for that look.", 9342, "c26320ed99e8b0867d42f5b83226d3c2aa", 0],
	89870 : ["Yes it is still sin (I believe this is spoken of in the Old Testament and again by Paul). Once you realize it is sin, you ask for forgiveness and work on not doing it again. Children do not know stealing is wrong until they are told. Their behavior is still sinful, but they learn that it is wrong and are taught not to do it. Christianity is not focusing on what not to do; it is focusing on what God wants you to do. It is not so much don't use swear words; it is more use words to build each other up and to glorify his name. Can you do that by swearing? No. Though the Bible says not to covet, the bigger focus is on having joy for the things that you already possess. You see the difference?", 9341, "mDWh5lbQaa", 2],
	89871 : ["Sin is a relative term even among Christianity, since different denominations treat things differently.  Basic things like harming someone else on purpose and without reasonabel cause is always a sin to all Christians - and most atheists, too. Swearing (loose definition - vulgarity) is not always a sin.  Swearing (tight definition - use of God's name in the utterance) usually gets you. For some technical sins, it is required that you know it is a sin before it counts as such. But it is really a mixed bag when the action in question is only marginally bad behavior and particularly when not done in malice. Then, when you are an atheist as I am, sin is easy to define.  Hurting someone else without reasonable cause is always a sin.  (To me.)  Swearing?  Not a problem at all.", 9341, "aj5IBTuXaa", 0],
	89872 : ["I would have to say a sin is still a sin. Somewhere in you, you know cursing isn't right. That's why so many people look down upon it. I have a hard time believing you don't know what you're doing is right or wrong. You might have been caught up in the moment so much you didn't think anything of it, but there is always that little person punching at your gut telling you this isn't right.

So it makes sense that, if your friend's rat had mucus in their throat, they could bring that up. Here's a great article that explains this clearly, and compares it to the human esophagus too - you know when you regurgitate something from halfway down your throat? Well, rats can do this too. But they can't vomit anything that has passed beyond this esophagus muscle - check out the article on the finer points - ", 9345, "AA11702116", 0],
	89877 : ["I'm not quite sure where everyone is getting that this is so cut and dry here. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not murder, that doesn't make it any clearer! If someone were to walk into my yard and shoot my dog, I would most certainly consider that murder and I think anyone who has a family pet would think so too...(if not, you don't need one), and the person would go to jail for the crime, too. Also, one thing to think about is if it does only apply to humans, then why do so many support the death penalty? War? It does not give specific exceptions on this rule in the Bible, and it most certainly doesn't specify what not to kill or murder. And \"eye for an eye\" was wiped out by Jesus himself, so that isn't valid either. He specifically said turn the other cheek. Great question. Keep them coming, you may actually cause one or two of us at least to think around here. EDIT>>> ukrgrl: how exactly do you know that animals don't have spirits? And if they don't, how exactly is God going to punish an animal for killing a human, if all of his punishments come in the afterlife?? Something that has no spirit would not even have a clue that a punishment is even coming from God, nor would it have the ability to receive it.", 9346, "mEGdP2AMaa", 1],

Help her concentrate on the evening as a whole and what is still to be enjoyed. My niece and nephew live with us and their noncustodial parent is *constantly* canceling plans with them.

He was damned if he did, damned if he didn't. What I can't imagine is that the school didn't anticipate this and schedule around it, my high school certainly did. Edit: Oh, well if he knew then he's just a dick. I was assuming he didn't anticipate the conflict prior to asking her. In that case, he should have realized that sometimes you don't get to do everything you want. But then again, that's an adult talking.
