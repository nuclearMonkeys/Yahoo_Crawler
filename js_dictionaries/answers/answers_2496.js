I honestly feel like in your situation, it would be appropriate for you to get an abortion.  The environment you would place a child in is NOT appropriate one bit, and your kid will be very messed up, no offense.   Also about people telling her to give the baby up for adoption- there are so many children who don't get adopted.  They live without parents and live a very lost and confused life.  Even if they are adopted, there is so much they are thinking about.  Also, giving up your baby will bring you more stress. Also, if you're gonna drink, party, and do drugs while you're pregnant just get an abortion.  I know you might say you won't, but 9 months is a long time.  Especially if you're considering suicide.  If you can't handle your life, you can't handle to bring one into the world. Get on serious birth control or stop having casual sex.  Please... Also-- abortion is not killing the baby.  If it's done early, it's killing a clump of cells.  It's not a baby or a human or anything yet.

	130630 : ["before going wireless, make sure the router is working properly wired.  I have actually seen a route and modem configured with the same network address (192.168.1.x) and won't work together.  I had to manually change the router to a different network (192.168.10.x) to make it work.  The modem would not allow a change. If that works, meaning your computer gets an ip from the router and you can get out to the internet, you can then try wireless.  You can either give your laptop a static IP or try DHCP, if your router has DHCP turned on and configured.  Your router will propably have an IP of 192.168.1.1.  You can configure your laptop with 192.168.1.2.  Subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and Default Gateway 192.168.1.1 (pointing to the router).  DNS should also point to the router (192.168.1.1).

	130650 : ["I wondered how long it would be before someone came up with the answer about record revenues. It never takes conservatives long to reach into the Sean Hannity book of right wing lies in order to try to justify a failed policy. So let's look at what really happens. First the painfully obious. All things being equal as our economy grows, the tax base grows and so revenues grow. Pointing at \"record revenues\" does not mean they were created by tax cuts (that best friend of Republicans - the post hoc ergo propter hoc argument). Rather in judging the idea that tax cuts lead to increased revenues while tax increases lead to reduced revenues we shall examine three two term presidents. Reagan, Clinton and Bush Jr. Reagan and Bush are famous for thier massive across the board (read mainly for the rich) tax cuts, Clinton for his increase (although he did substantially cut capital gains tax late in his administration). In order to remove the impact of inflation all figures quoted will be in constant 2000 dollars. The revenues in the last year of the Carter administration totalled 1.028 trillion. Revenues had grown an average of 5.9% under Carter. At the end Reagan's first term revenues had fallen to 1.017 trillion (the previous year was significantly lower), and revenues on average shrunk 0.1% over this term. Conservatives will argue that the initial impact of the tax cuts will be countered by the strong growth that comes later so let's look at Reagan's second term. By the end of the Reagan administration federal revenues stood at 1.236 trillion, an increase of 5.0% pa over Reagan's second term and 2.4% over the entire administration. So Carter, who conservatives love to pillory for his economic performance saw revenues grow twice as fast as Reagan, and faster even than Reagan when his tax cut years are disregarded. Clinton's first term saw 5.0% annual real revenues growth, and in his second term 6.8%. This meant an average of 5.9% for his two terms. The smallest increases of the Clinton administration were in his first year before his tax policy took effect and immediately after his capital gains tax cut. So Clinton was able to produce a record that significantly beat Reagan's in both consistency (revenues never fell during Clinton's reign, something that Reagan and neither Bush can claim) and output. Bush's first term saw revenues fall 4.1% each year on average.  Bush's second term has so far seen average revenue gains of 7.2% pa but sluggish growth this year will see this fall to about 5.9% for the entire of the second Bush term and approximately 0.9% for the two terms combined. The inference is clear. Revenues generally rise but certain conditions/actions can cause savage reductions that take years to correct. These coincide exactly with tax cuts while consistent growth can only be aligned with either tax increases or no change.  Had the Bush administration merely maintained the 2000 revenue levels, an extra 1 trillion dollars would have been collected over the Bush administration.  Had Bush maintained the revenue growth rate of Clinton our national debt would be nearly 6 trillion lower (or just one third of what it is). On the outlays side- while Bush has increased the federal budget at a faster rate than any president since Carter - to blame this for our current balance sheet is simply wrong. Outlays have increased by 3.5% per annum - a number that could have been matched with a responsible taxation policy.", 11078, "NqNbIp2caa", 2],

Wen u do go rehab make sure u try ur hardest to quit these things, get plenty of sleep, exercise, fresh air, healthy big meals, make sure u see a councellor and go to these sessions and things and try and think about ur life and clear ur head 3) You need to get back into education. I dont know if u are or not but having a good education is the key to a good life. remmember a good education means a good career = money and with that money u can do whatever u want like buy a nice house, car, travel, spend it on nice things.
