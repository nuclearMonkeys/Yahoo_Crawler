From the perspective of the Bible, God is the source of all wisdom and knowledge, but you have to fear Him to begin to grasp wisdom and knowledge. How will you determine if this is true. You have to test it. If fear of the Lord is the beginning, then at the time of Adam and Eve, the only way to fear Him is to disobey Him. And the only way to disobey Him was the one thing that God made a rule for. Did God want Adam and Eve to eat the fruit? That is speculation. Only God can answer that. My speculation is that God provided a way for us to gain wisdom. As a loving Father, He would not withhold anything from His children. I believe, that He trusted us enough to survive and grow from all that is.", 8164, "DqzHiql1aa", 0],

I don't see why anyone would get so upset about you saying \"apple\" instead of \"fruit\". First of all, the Bible has been translated so many times over that words have been changed, lost, added and altered to the point that arguing over semantics is futile. Also, if they are going to get uppity with you over your inaccurate use of the word \"apple\", they sure as hell better be 100% accurate in all of their interpretations as well. Otherwise they would be hypocritical. Hmm.. that's a thought. Religious people? Hypocritical??? Take care", 8164, "xIgBlGm6aa", 6],
