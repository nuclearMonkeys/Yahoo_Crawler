Yes, the feeling has become stronger as I've grown in faith.  Jesus is getting to be a better friend the more I learn about Him.  There are days that I feel He doesn't hear me (although I know He does) and there are days that I think if I turn around, I'd see Him sitting in a chair listening to me.  Many times, I'll be praying about something and a verse of scripture will come to mind, or a song on the radio that deals with what I was questioning, or even another person will say something to me and I know that's God's way of giving me an answer.  People say talking with God is one-sided.  We do all the talking.

	125571 : ["When I pray in faith,  the feeling is 'blessed assurance'.  I need to feel Gods assurance that He hears my prayers, that God loves me & I can trust His Word that He will never leave or forsake me. I always receive assurance.  I have doubted, & that is when I feel miserable & have to come to repentance about doubting.   I have numerous types of feelings in my relationship with God.  And some can be unpleasant, discipline (like when I doubt). Faith is an assurance or is received when one receives Gods Assurance.  Faith is the title deed to the house.  You may not see the house, but God gave you assurance that it will manifest.  And when it does manifest, then you are so happy & thank God more for the house. Also, it is written that faith comes by hearing & hearing a Word about Christ / God.  And also to build up (excercise) your faith, praying in the Spirit.  When I pray in the Spirit, especially during praise & worship, the anointing gets stronger & my faith in God grows.  Because I know it is the Holy Spirit speaking in me & my faith is growing in the process. At times though, when the Spirit is strong on my in my prayer closet, I pray an intercessory prayer for someone else.  This happens if someone needs prayer right then.  And also, the gift of faith is stronger right then. Just believing in God & not excercizing ones faith, the faith can become unfruitful.  Faith without works is dead. Remember that Faith, Hope(blessed assurance) & Love is everlasting.  The greatest of these Is Love.  God Is Love.  These are Heavenly & everlasting life rewards.  These are a number of strong feelings, as there are different types of love, yet love is loving God & loving others in all the different types of love.  (Lust isn't love. Lust is wanting what others have & hurting others to get it for yourself.  Lust is selfish).   And I have experienced these feeling; faith, hope & love.  When one has an out of body experience & goes to heaven, these feelings are much magnified.    .", 10830, "3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa", 2],
	125572 : ["The central doctrine of the Christian faith, which is salvation, can be understood by anybody who is neurologically unimpaired.  There are many things that the average mind can grasp through faith and revelation by the Holy Spirit.   That is why you have some people that are functionally illiterate, but can understand much of the Bible and God's purpose for their lives.  I believe that there are arguments among learned men and Ministers of the Gospel, because nobody had the full and complete revelation of God.  This is because  He is so infinite.  At other times, not all learned men, both worldly and biblical, are adequately led by the unction of the Holy Spirit.    Remember there is one Holy Spirit and one truth,  therefore, they should not be as divisive as they are.  However,  God is honored when you seek the deeper things concerning Him.  If you love a person wouldn't you want to know Him in a deeper way.   The same is true about God.   God wants you to understand Him adequately that is why He has given unto man the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians 12: 1-12.

I suppose the way to explain it is, if you, yourself, wanted to work on a computer, but you knew very little, you might want to educate yourself, by taking classes, or reading. Having the proper tools will help you to understand what there is to learn. With God's word, you can study with various learning tools like the Smith's dictionary, the Strong's concordance, and also study groups within your community and or church. Always pray to God before getting into His word, that he will give you wisdom to learn. With the proper tools, the bible is the best guide to read for a fulfilling life. Just because a person is a priest or minister, doesn't make them completely understanding of God's word. Some men of the cloth, though they are so called, 'of God' can be rather clueless when it comes to the truth of God's word.

	125574 : ["Because Christians believe in a God who entered history in order to save Israel from bondage and above all became incarnate in history, we need to understand the historical context of biblical times. God works in history, in the messiness of history. That is what is so great about Christians, history matters because that is where God works. God works with us, so the stories of the Bible have not been zapped into humans. Study guides and commentaries help you understand the history. Having said that, it depends where you are in your faith. The Bible is not a newspaper or a science textbook. It is not about opening the Bible and discovering how the world works; the Bible is meant to develop a relationship with God. When you open it, make it a conversation with God. About your hopes, desires and frustrations; learn what God has done with us, wants to do with us and will do with us. Every time you read the Bible, the story will have a new meaning for you, if you are in a relationship with God.  Having said that, simply pick up the Bible and start reading the New Testament from beginning to end; Matthew through Revelation. 1 chapter a day and you will finish the New Testament in less than a year without study guides or commentaries. Study guides and commentaries are meant for those who wish to get a better grasp of the historical context.

	125578 : ["The purpose of being a Christian is to know God through His Son Jesus Christ, with the help of the Holy Spirit inside us. Jesus defined eternal life as \"knowing the one true God and knowing Jesus Christ whom He has sent\" (John 17:3). Only through knowing Him - His heart of love - will we be satisfied, nourished, strengthened and fulfilled, and we will live to glorify His name, out of the overflow of love we have received. For Jesus also said, \"Freely you have received, freely give.\" (Matthew 10:8) Speaking from my experience, trying to live a Christian life without knowing the love of God can be dry, frustrating and ultimately meaningless. We may find ourselves doing Christian stuff without any motivation, just for the sake of being religious. Before long, we may find ourselves worried and troubled about many things in our busyness,  just like Martha did (Luke 10). Or if we do not want to serve in the church and instead go about our own lives, pursuing our own dreams and goals without involving God, we will sooner and later end up hating life, as King Solomon had also realised many years ago. (Ecclesiastes 2) \"Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me, for all is vanity and grasping for the wind.\" (Ecclesiastes 2:17) Surely our Lord Jesus Christ did not suffer and die at the cross, simply to give us a life that is merely existing without any real meaning, while waiting for Him to return to bring us home? The good news is: YES, there is a better way. For Jesus has come to give LIFE, and life more abundantly! :) And as I discovered, the abundant life is knowing the love of God. Just as a car needs petrol to travel, we need to feed on the love of God to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. Many of us began our Christian journey excited about the Bible, and then began to get too caught up with works and service because we forgot to do that ONE THING needful - sitting at Jesus' feet and listening to His words of grace and truth. (Luke 10:42) \"But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.\" (Luke 10:42) Later on, we saw how Mary worshipped the Lord Jesus by anointing His feet for His burial, simply because she did that one thing necessary - sitting at His feet and listening to His words. In the same way, when we focus on first receiving from the Lord His gracious words, either through reading the Bible or devotionals or listening to the gospel of grace of Christ, we will experience the fullness of His heart, and we will want to serve Him and serve the body of Christ out of an overflow. In closing, there are two characters in the Bible I greatly admire for their devotion to God - King David and the apostle Paul. Both have done great things for God, yet the secret of their great accomplishments lies in their desire to know God's heart intimately.  David was described as a man after God's heart. (Acts 13:22) This is because he has a heart knowledge of God, not just head knowledge, and he always sought to know the Lord and His ways (eg Psalm 25:4-5 and Psalm 27:4). It was David who boldly declare that the Lord's lovingkindness is better than life! (Psalm 63:3) Surely he had a revelation of God's love! Paul wrote two-thirds of the New Testament and played an important role in church planting. Yet of all the accomplishments he could have boasted, he chose to count them all as dung, and instead held the precious knowledge of Jesus Christ close to his heart, placing Him high above all else. (Philippians 3:8-11) He wrote, \"For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.\" (1 Corinthians 2:2) The death, burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus is Paul's primary focus in life, which speaks of His power and wisdom, and above all, His love. Indeed, God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8) The more we meditate on what happened at the cross, the more we see the love of God working all things together for our good, and we will live a life full of hope, full of joy and peace, and full of love.
