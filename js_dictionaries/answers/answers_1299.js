But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?  It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,  Who is already sick and pale with grief,  That thou her maid art far more fair than she:  Be not her maid, since she is envious;  Her vestal livery is but sick and green  And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.  It is my lady, O, it is my love!  O, that she knew she were!  She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?  Her eye discourses; I will answer it.  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:  Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,  Having some business, do entreat her eyes  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven  Would through the airy region stream so bright  That birds would sing and think it were not night.  See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!  O, that I were a glove upon that hand,  That I might touch that cheek! \" -Romeo \"Good night, Good night! parting is such sweet sorrow… that I shall say good night till it be morrow.\" -Romeo :O my love, my wife!

The fragrances used in lotions often irritate sun burnt skin and cause it to redden more. If you use an unscented moisturiser it may relax a little and start to pigment more. If you're in pain, use an aloe Vera. It will instantly soothe. If you're just worried about colour, this is not your best choice. Stick with the unscented moisturiser (Gold Bond makes a good one) By the way! Stay away from the vinegar it will give you pimples...

Cocoa Butter works great too. Zinc oxide should help it heal much faster as well. But nothing is goin to take it away in less than a day. So try to use some light cover up. Preferably powder, not too much liquid cover up, because you may take the lotions off.  Drink plenty of fluids as well. If you are in pain in those areas,  i heard that raw tomatoes and aloe vera straight from the plant. Then i would definately stay out of the sun until you need to leave.
