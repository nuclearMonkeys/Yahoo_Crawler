If your mom has any pains left over herself this would help her as well, even if she just has headaches this will help.  Here's how to free up your neck muscles to get rid of the pain: Neck Put your hands alongside your head so your thumbs are on the front of the muscle under your ear and your fingers are on the back of the muscle behind your neck.  Squeeze your thumb and fingers together and hold.  Relax your body.  When your fingers and thumb touch, about two minutes, slowly lower your head as far as you can, release the pressure but hold your neck lowered for another 30 seconds. For best results relax your body first by taking a deep breath and exhaling then remain this relaxed.", 10972, "djUMvICoaa", 0],

	128241 : ["You may need to see a orthodontist in the future if it affects you with headaches, face aches & ear aches. Don't move your jaw side to side and don't test it. I have TMJ caused from whiplash in a car accident. It can get so bad that it feels like my ears are exploding and my face is imploding. Stress kills the whole healing process and even working out can increase the actual stress rather than reducing it. I had to stop working out all together and just hit the pool. When it's really bad, I drink my breakfast or porridge, lunch (soups) & eat soft pasta for dinners.  I don't touch uncooked vegetables or fruit, avoid popcorn, gum, corn on the cob and anything that involves widening the mouth or moving it side to side. Medication that say TENSION HEADACHE help more. ht now to take the swelling down in areas moved and bumped that you don't even know about. 1. I used to use a combination of medications which included 400mg Ibuprofen 4x a day with food. This takes the swelling and inflammation down. DO NOT exceed1600mg in one day and you may need prilosec for stomach protection as ALL ANTI INFLAMMATORIES are difficult on the stomach. ***You can use Tylenol with Ibuprofen and Aspirin watch for daily maximums & don't exceed. 2. Robaxacet is Tylenol (acetominophen) combined with methocarbonal (muscle relaxant)...this also comes with codeine on request from the pharmacist. This only relaxes any tight muscles around the pain and helps reduce some pain. You can use Robaxacet with Ibuprofen and Aspirin, BUT NOT Tylenol as it's already an ingredient in this pill. 3. Robaxacyl is Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) combines with methocarbonal (muscle relaxant)...this has a blood thinning active ingredient and isn't ideal for anyone under age 16 years or complications with blood pressure, ailments, etc. This both takes down the inflammation as well as treats the pain.You can use Robaxacyl with Ibuprofen and Tylenol, BUT NOT Aspirin as it's already an ingredient in this pill. ------------------------------... 4. Aleve is a Nonsteroidal Anti Inflammatory (Naproxen) which will helps reduce the inflammation, and as the inflammation decreases so does the pain; BUT you CANNOT mix this drug with any of the above mentioned safely. 5. Dynamint has been used on horses legs for years, but it does an amazing job on sore neck muscles. It's ingredients are Peppermint Oil, Eucalyptus Oil , Tea Tree Oil and Calendula Oil. 6. Deep Cold Gold is an alternative rub that works very well on tight aching tendons on your upper shoulders, neck and TMJ joints. 7. DHE treatment in emergency is also an alternative. This can be used by people who are on serotonin inhibitors like tryptalines, but not by triptans as it could induce heart attack or stroke. 8. I recently asked my doctor if I can keep ATIVAN & DIAZEPAM on hand for when the clenching is either unbearable or the pains are really affecting my daily life skills.  You should always keep track of your headaches on a calendar in your room or dayplanner so you have something to show the doctor if this becomes an ongoing problem. If you were doing something the day before or earlier in the day that may have triggered it, then mark that down too. A lifetime of headaches, migraines, TMJ headaches, head injury, etcI also asked for diazepam or ativan to help with stress as in the night and at school the automatic response is to CLENCH. I found my mouth piece increased my clenching and I've broken 3. Since I stopped using it, things have settled much quicker. There is an EXERCISE CALLED CLUCKING. You put your tongue up to the top of your mouth and move the tongue forward to make a clucking noise until she's tired. If she can try to be conscious where she places her tongue. It should rest at the top of her mouth and not flat or back down. She doesn't touch the top front teeth when she clucks. Please review the links for diet & exercise outlines and youtube videos to show you how to do it. Remember to do things in moderation because TMJ is debilitating and can put you in bed for weeks with immoblized and migraines with vomiting which hurts to vomit.

	128243 : ["Precursor da arte moderna, morto prematuramente aos 31 anos de idade, Amadeo de Souza-Cardozo não teve oportunidade de ver seu trabalho reconhecido: seguiu a mesma trilha dos vanguardeiros de todos os tempos e de todas atividades, administrando a incompreensão alheia. A humanidade custa a aceitar novos processos ou idéias diferenciadas e assim, para os precursores, a apreciação objetiva e o coroamento de seus esforços se dá, ou no final da vida, ou somente após sua morte.      Nascido em 1887 e falecido em 1918, as primeiras experiências de Souza-Cardozo se deram no desenho, especialmente como caricaturista. Aos 19 anos, mudou-se para Paris, tomando contato primeiro com o Impressionismo e depois com o Expressionismo e o Cubismo.      Valeu-lhe muito sua aproximação com Amadeu Modigliani, de quem se tornou um grande amigo, compartilhando com ele um ateliê e até realizando exposições juntos, em 1911.      Preso ainda ao traço, em 1912 publicou um álbum com 20 desenhos e em seguida, «com paciência de beneditino» copiou o conto de Flaubert La légende de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier, trabalhos ignorados pelo apreciadores de arte. Este último trabalho, depois de ficar por muitos anos nas mãos do editor, acabou sendo adquirido pela própria viúva do pintor, para evitar que fosse destruído.      Depois de participar de uma exposição nos Estados Unidos, em 1913, voltou a Portugal, onde teve a ousadia de realizar duas exposições, respectivamente em Porto e em Lisboa, causando entre seus patrícios, o mesmo escândalo que seria provocado no Brasil, anos mais tarde, por Anita Malfatti: suas obras foram criticadas, ridicularizadas e, em momentos, houve até confronto físico entre críticos e defensores da arte moderna.      Com o término da Primeira Guerra Mundial, em 1918, surgiria a grande oportunidade de desenvolver e encontrar reconhecimento de sua obra, mas Souza-Cardoso não teve tempo para esperar. Morreu nesse mesmo ano e muito tempo se passou até que as opiniões fossem revistas e seu nome ocupasse o devido lugar na história da pintura portuguesa.", 10970, "None", 0],

In the French capital it gave up the intention of being arquitecto and was decided for the study of the painting, having stopped friendship with Italian painter Amadeo Modigliani and coexisted other Portuguese painters who met there. In 1911 it displayed for the first time in Salon DES IndÃ©pendents, in 1912 published album XX Dessins and in 1913 it was chosen to integar in the Armory exposition Show, in New York, together with other artists as Picasso. In Paris Juan Gris knew, Brancusi, Max Jacob, Archipenko, and the Delaunay, among others.

Then u keep a ruler infront of ur eye an just move 1m to the left or right at a right angle. measure the angle of separation between the two buildings and then use simple trig to get the distance to the 1st tower.

Females (males too) sometimes can be the biggest gossips, but the mistake women make, is telling their friends too much personal detail within their own relationships.  Don't do it in the future. Think of it like this, if you told a friend the sexual antics you got up to last night, and felt easy with that, how would you feel if you found out your boyfriend/husband was telling other guys very personal things about you ?  I don't think you would like it - now do you get my point. These woman gossipping about you at the moment, are not real friends - and they'd be the first ones to scream and shout if you revealed personal details about them, but two wrongs don't make a right.  I would be inclined to ignore them unless something is said directly to you, then I'd suggest you gave them a bit of your mind - and in public.  Humiliate them and shame them. Like I said, they are no friends of yours, and if that is the way they treat their friends, I would hate to see  how they treated their enemies.  One thing you can be sure of though is this - the people that they talk to about you, are fully aware that half of what they are being told is lies, cos gossips always exaggerate - so play nice at work, continue in your normal nice way, others are not thinking any less of you, probably thinking they wished you find yourself some nice people to be friends with.
