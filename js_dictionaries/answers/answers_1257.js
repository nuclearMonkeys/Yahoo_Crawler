	68385 : ["Very simple solution! iTunes uses a web-based account management system. Anything you have done on your iTunes account from their online store is recorded, stored and backed up through them. All you have to do is log into your account from another iTunes. Think of it like accessing a hotmail account, all you do is log in and everything is there. Keep in mind, anything YOU put on the iPod you didn't get through Apple, will have to be copied. So if you still have all the songs, video, photos, etc (any digital content), just make sure to put them on some sort of external source like a flash disc, external HD, etc. Once you do that, just re-import all the content into iTunes on your new laptop and you're ready to go again.", 8455, "CCPdJRkZaa", 0],

You should have locked in a fixed loan so your amount would not shift that much.  You can refinance to fix that.  As for the billings - only one is valid. Find out which.

Plug it up to the second computer using the other end of the cable and it pops up on the new computer asking if its your old computer or new and you say new and BAM it starts the transfer and you come back later when its done :) You can also get this at your local walmart in electronics for $20.", 8455, "XEf0aMWwaa", 0],
	68413 : ["You could use the external harddrive, but I'm assuming that it doesn't have a eSATA or USB3 interface, which means that transferring files firstly to your external, and then onto your computer will be a painfully slow process.   A better solution would be to take the harddrive out of your old computer and install it into your new computer, then copy everything you want across.  This means you're only transferring your files once, and it will be via a SATA interface, which means it will be unbelievably quicker.  Also the chance of data corruption is greatly reduced as you only have to copy the files once, furthermore when media files (movies, music, photos etc) are copied and pasted there is a slight reduction in quality, so one copy will keep those files in better condition.", 8455, "None", 0],

But don't be fooled many people have debit cards and spend to much money.  I had a Greendot back in the day and i ordered some home gym equipment and they took the money away from the company i ordered from and so i have to pay the company the money before my debit account is unfrozen.  So that is not all glamourous.  So the best thing i can suggest to you would be to get a debit card or just find some where that accepts checks.  Because they are going out of style but some companies like their money and will do anything to keep their customers coming.
