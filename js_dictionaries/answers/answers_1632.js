	87277 : ["Corporations are no different than unions. They are EXACTLY the same thing. The only difference is in who gets rich and how they are structured administratively. In both cases it IS NOT the lowly worker that is getting rich I guarantee you that. Both lobby the government. Both are frequently corrupt and party to sweet back room deals. Both make use of \"cheap\" or otherwise \"less privileged labor\", and both place their own collective profit above any and all other concerns. As far as personal responsibility is concerned, rarely are even individuals held to a terribly high standard as far as personal responsibility. Our corporations and unions, as well as our very government as a whole, is virtually identical in level of \"morality\" as the whole of the general public. This is a government \"for the people, by the people\", so if the government and laws and policies they enact are flawed, inadequate, or rife with abuses and corruption, what does that tell as about society as a whole? Furthermore, what does all this tell us about the likelihood that any of it is going to change any time soon? I mean if you want to single out corporations that's fine. But that is like sticking your finger in a dike to plug a hole and stop a leak, when you are surrounded by a thousand more leaks.  So to answer your question a little more directly, I don't really think ANYBODY takes enough responsibility over ANYTHING. So in a manner of speaking, our society has basically exempted all of us from a great deal of responsibility that we all ought to be tending to but don't, because we aren't \"forced\" to. You see that dirty little word \"freedom\" comes into play at some point here, and yes that means corporations as well. If we can individually enjoy freedom, their is no reason whatsoever why we cannot allow \"collectives\" of individual people to enjoy the same freedom.

This is a long and contentious issue, quite similar to that of African-American movements.

Each of these groups fight for equality, though some (such as White Males) argue that equality has been achieved.  Perhaps it has, but even if so, that doesn't necessitate a stoppage in their movements because such could lead to marginalization and thus oppression all over again.

	87294 : ["Yes.. this is really an great question and I just would like to say \" amen\" to our brother andrew's portion. Many shared different views concerning this matter. Some said no. some said yes. All I can truly share is my own experience of loving and knowing the Lord and as believers, we should be full of feeling from the indwelling Spirit living within our own spirit. One of the beautiful things about our spirit that has been regenerated is that it is the deepest part of our tripartite being. The bible, in 1 Thes 5:23 shares that we are made up of three parts. The spirit, soul and body. Our spirit was made with the capacity to receive God, who is Spirit and this part of us has three main functions.  The first is the conscience which is very much full of feelings about almost everything related to man. Sister, have you ever been impressed in an approving or disapproving way about things in your life?  Where you feel bothered in your conscience about sin or a situation or how you spoke to a person?  This is actually God speaking and impressing us with His feeling concerning that matter through our conscience. The next crucial function of our spirit is Fellowship. It is here where we enjoy the Lord's Presence and He enjoys our presence.  The thing about fellowship sis, is that it can be frustrated because of sin in our lives. But once we obey the speaking, sense and feeling of our conscience, and are those who come to the Lord for His cleansing blood to wash us thoroughly, then right away, we are renewed and brought back into free sweet communion with the Lord.   This leads us to the third function of our spirit, the Intuition. When we are those taking care of our conscience, which leads us to restore our fellowship with the Lord, He may speak something to us from His word or in prayer through the Intuition in our spirit. Sometimes we may get a sense from the Lord to pray for someone, or to call someone, to call upon His name. I am sure that in your own walk with the Lord, this has happened to you, this is the Intuition, the inner sense and speaking of the Holy Spirit that sometimes, may not even seem logical, but the impression is there and we turn to the Lord on behalf of ourselves and so many, because of the feel and sense of the intution in our spirit. This dear sister, has probably been a saving for so many and the Lord truly depends on us to be sensitive to His urgings and leading. amen. We may say that the Lord's Presence is so strong when we are coming along well in our christian life and not so strong when we are not pursuing faithfully, but this is not necessarily so. Sometimes its when we are like the Prodigal son, having our \" straying time\" away from the enjoyment and fellowship of the Father, that we truly sense the grieving of the Holy Spirit within us.  When we are in our quiet times, laying at night and away from everyone else, doesn't the Lord come to us? Impressing us with a saddness in our being concerning our broken fellowship with Him? Oh sister.. how full of feeling I am when I have these times of straying!  How we need to treasure these feelings from the Spirit indwelling us because they work to lead us back into the bosom of our Father! I also love sister, that when we are those who are taking care of our conscience, fellowship and intuition in our spirit, that this kind of condition truly opens us up wide to be filled with feeling from the Lord.  We sense His presence so intimately. I know, from my own experience, that when I am restored in my fellowship with the Lord, that right away, I am full of feeling for others. I want to be with other believers, I feel burdened for my friends, neighbours, loved ones who are either backslidden or unsaved. These \" feelings\" are very precious and the Lord treasures when we are able to respond to what is on His heart. The more we take care of our relationship with the Lord the stronger our sense is of Him. 2 Tim 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit, Grace be with you\" Keep on abiding sis.
