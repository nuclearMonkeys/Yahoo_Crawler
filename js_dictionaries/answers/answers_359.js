Conversely, I've also been treated well..it all depends on the cop and the luck of the draw. I try not to give them attitude about anything, and announce all my movements (getting my wallet, etc) before I make them. Unarmed white people are also killed out of hand by law enforcement. I was also waved through a license check once..the reason being that I wasn't Mexican.  (the cop told me not to bother with license and registration, they were looking for Mexicans with no license/insurance.  I kept my trap closed, but that made me feel icky.)", 3145, "6W8DUo36aa", 2],

I have never  been asked to exit my vehicle for any reason in the USA, during the few traffic stops in which I have been involved during 50 years of driving.

I had done nothing wrong and they only stopped me for entertainment purposes. They behaved like complete @rseholes but seemed to find it amusing.

There is also a partial exception for consensual sex between a minor who is 11, 12, 13, or 14 years old, and a defendant who is younger than 17. This is a partial exception because, while these parties are protected from felony prosecution, they may nonetheless be charged for sexual misconduct (a misdemeanor), which can incur a sentence of up to one year in jail.
