	77956 : ["This is the end all argument for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.  Note that I am not a fanboy and have played both consoles and by far the Playstation 3 has longevity than the Xbox 360.  These are facts and I have numerous sources.  Why is this answer long? It refutes everything that Xbox 360 owners say about the Playstation 3.  Also, if you're about to dish out $400-$600 for a system, you want to know all you can. Company: Microsoft is a company which experiences are mostly computers not games.  Windows Vista is a disaster and 50% of people switch back to Windows XP.  Microsoft never answered people's problems, this is why people turn to Mac.  When Microsoft heard about their Red Ring of Death, they didn't fix it, instead updated the warranty. Sony's first Playstation was a success, so they know their field with this.  Their smart and reliable and always help their customers when they need too.  When Playstation 2 had a lens error, it was Sony who provided how to clean your Playstation 2 with a cotton swab and alcohol, not someone else.  They didn't ask you the send your system in so they can fix it, they admitted the problem and gave a simple do-it-yourself solution. Price: Look at the bigger picture.  With the Playstation 3 you are getting a Blu-Ray DVD player which like $300 on the market for the cheapest one.  Playstation 3 most expensive model cost $600 bucks.  Xbox 360 most expensive model cost $450 bucks.  Let's say Microsoft don't come out for another console for 5 years so lets add their $50 subscription fee to play Xbox Live.  That's $250 dollars + $450 dollars for a Xbox 360 in 5 years minus the games.  So you are paying more than the Playstation 3 just to use it's features.  Features that should have been granted to you when you spent the $450 bucks for their console. Problems: Playstation 3 had a slight bug problem (0.2% in consoles worldwide) but was fixed right away with re-releases of the consoles and firmware downloads.  People complained about their Sixaxis controller not having rumble technology so Sony has worked on Dualshock 3, which will be coming out in Spring 2008.  They actually listen when someone complains. Xbox 360 currently has a major hardware malfunction called the Red Ring of Death (A play off the name Blue Screen of Death) that only Microsoft can fix.  This is a problem in 33% of their consoles in the United States (1 out of 3).  Even in their new consoles, these problems still occur.  Microsoft has offered to fix it for free and extended their warranty.  The problem is it takes 6 weeks to get your Xbox 360 back and it could get stolen in the mail and you won't get reimbursed.  In fact Xbox 360 is number 1 in the top ten bad electronics in 2007.  Everyone I know is on their second console.  If only Microsoft would tell local Gamestops how to fix the problem, but they don't have the best interest in gamers in mind. Games: Xbox 360 has better games than the Ps3 now, but by the end of 2008, the Playstation 3 will have way more better games.  How do I know? E3 2007 graded every console.  Wii got a C- because they talked about their success.  Xbox 360 got a C because they talk about their games in 2007 such as Halo and BioShock.  The Ps3 got a B- because their longevity is noticed and their games in 2008 will be the best out of the 3 consoles. Xbox 360 has had a head start for a year and their games are slightly better than Ps3.  Their top 3 games: Halo 3, Gears of War, and Bioshock are all First Person Shooters.  They don't have a mix array of games.  Microsoft dishes a lot of cash to the developers to keep games exclusive. The best games for the Xbox 360 has come and gone.  So you tell me you're going to sit there and wait 2-3 years for Halo 4. Well right now there's Resistance, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Ratchet and Clank, Virtua Fighter 5, Heavenly Sword, Stranglehold, Assassin's Creed, Virtua Tennis 3, Folklore, Uncharted, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, Guitar Hero 3, Singstar and Call of Duty 4.  Some games are for the Xbox 360 as well. Upcoming exclusive games for the PS3 are Killzone 2, Haze, Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy XIII, Gran Turismo 5, Afrika, Motorstorm 2, Wipeout, Yakuza 3, LittleBigPlanet, Infamous, White Knight Chronicles, Disgaea 3, The Getaway 3, Heavy Rain, SOCOM: Confrontation, Wardevil, LA Noire, Tekken 6 and God of War 3 will all be coming out as PS3 exclusives. Also the maker of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus is making his next game exclusively on PS3. Thats like 15 exclusives with high 9.0 reviews from Gamespot & GameInformer.  Most of these games take over a month to complete so you won't be putting the Ps3 down for quite some time now. Developers had 2 years to dish out games for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 is not far behind. Accessories The only accessory you need and should really buy is a new inter cooler fan for the Xbox 360.  You should buy it before the Xbox 360 break on you.  Why won't Microsoft give it you guys for free? Because they don't care about their gamers and see this as a lost. Playstation 3 on the other hand has numerous accessories.  They had bluetooth headsets, the new eyetoy which will make the Ps3 a lot similar to Wii with kid games, internet browser.  Did you know that Sony is creating an application to allow users to record Live TV.  So you're getting a TiVo with a Blu-Ray DVD Player. Online: Xbox 360 online is better because more people since it came out a year earlier than the Ps3.  When Ps3 introduces Home, the online community will become more connected and better.   In Home, you can play pool, billards, bowl, and jump right into games.  You don't even need a ps3 game to have fun.  Expect a major knockoff from Microsoft, it's in their character to do so. In closing, you can't go wrong with the Playstation 3.  Playstation 1 and 2 were major hits and the Playstation 3 will follow. Getting a Xbox 360 is like having a Daweoo, a pretty dumb idea. Who are you going to choose? The 2 time back to back winner of the console wars or the sophomore that came back unprepared for a rematch (When I mean unprepared I mean buggy [like the ring of death]) The Ps3 is a end all hands down winner.", 8925, "None", 3],
