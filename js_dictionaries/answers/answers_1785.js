	94979 : ["One of the most amazing things about running is that your body will actually train itself on how to run more efficiently. You don't need a fancy running program or routine. As a beginner all you need to do is run. I would suggest to start just 3 days each week including your mile run at school. The key is to run not walk even if its at the slowest pace and you feel like people could pass you by walking. As you run your lungs will develop greater lung capacity which will make breathing as you run easier and far more enjoyable. You will also find that your body will develop a running rhythm. I would start with 2 miles each for the 2 runs you do in addition to your mile run. Remember don't walk any of it if you give in to the temptation to walk your body will always want to stop when it gets tough and will not improve. Just slow your pace down and push on. Your body will adapt to support the stress. Your first goal should be to complete the mile run without stopping to walk at all. The extra 2 days will help you develop a base of 5 miles per week which you can then build off of as the 5 miles becomes easy. To be successful in running you have to enjoy running and the only way to enjoy running is to build a solid base so that running a mile is not painful or uncomfortable. Build your base and in 4 weeks you won't be finishing at the bottom of the pack any longer.", 9527, "yTTGssXRaa", 1],

Your timing issue sucks because normally you would be in a cut back time, to get ready for the 26.2 miles right now, but instead your looking to increase well past your required training. Your fortunate that you are also looking to walk/run the marathon, I believe you can do this, I would do a 4 miler tonight, a 5 miler tomorrow, then a 3 mile thurs. Rest Friday and do 6 on sat. and 15 on Sun. Monday X train then do 4 on Tues, 6 Wends, 4 Thurs. rest Friday and follow it up with 6 on Sat. and 17-18 on Sun. Rest the week going up to the marathon, do only light running, don't overstress yourself, then when you get to the marathon, walk through every water station. Start off slow, really pace yourself for the first half, then take the second half based on how you feel. By doing this I know you'll finish, you may walk a bit, but you would only be 2 miles shy of the 20 mile training program goal.

I kept pace and breathed properly and found myself breathing normally after 12 minutes of running- no gasping or panting at all but my legs did get tired. Is your run a race, or is it just timed? If it's just timed then ignore where everyone else is at and resist speeding up to keep with them, you may not finish first because some people are just naturally athletic and can run like that but if you keep a steady pace you will beat the kids that are also not so good with endurance.
