	40898 : ["Are forest fires caused directly by global warming? No. Are  heatwaves and fires made more frequent, more intense by global warming? Yes. In recent decades we have many effective ways of forestry management - with techniques like creating firebreaks, and of course, our ability to drop water on forest fires from the sky and from fire engines on the ground, which was not an option 100 years ago. These have hopefully reduced the extent of damage caused by forest fires, but something has stopped the effort translating into a reduction in the proportion of forest burned. That something may be global warming, with increased temperatures and perturbed precipitation patterns. The improved fire-control techniques that we now have are offset by the increased global temperatures, and the intent of global warming deniers to show that global warming is unrelated to forest fires is another of their failures. We need to put far more effort into containing forest fires. Generally, we need early warning of fires so that they can be identified and put out when they are starting, satellites and drones might be useful here and we need to put more effort into creating firebreaks an clearing litter.  Controlled burning, when fires are set a short time before expected rain, can be helpful because fire is part of the natural cycle. Forestry management needs to be part of the Green New Deal.", 5973, "None", 0],
