I'm on it again now (started 5 days ago, so far lost 1.5kg), to lose the last few kilos (tried lots of other diets but they don't work for me like atkins).  If you google atkins you'll be surprised how many positive things are said about it and how many people are correcting the myth that its dangerous and all about fat fat fat. I guess my tip is to be prepared  - take the carbs out of the cupboard if you can, make up some diet jelly in advance (to snack on) and make sure you have nice cheeses, smoked salmon etc so that its not hard to find something to eat when you're hungry.   If you're like me and need 'crunch' ( I find that the hardest part), then you can get low carb bars and tortillas etc - there are lots of online sites - including the Atkins one - that you can order this stuff online from.  And the Atkins site is good becasue it has recipes Just read the induction rules carefully - eg you can have nuts but not in the first 2 weeks so make sure you don't undo your good work by inadvertantly eating something you shouldn't. Everyone's different and for me it works and my doctor has expressed no concerns.    Go for it and good luck.", 11573, "None", 0],

Even if you are not an athlete, you still need sufficient amount of carbs to sustain normal activity.  Think whole grains!!!  Good carbs for you!

This diet can dramatically increase your triglycerides and do Kidney damage.  There is such a thing as too much protein and fat.  But if you are dead set on doing it go to doctor get your base line levels before starting then get it checked at least monthly if not bi-weekly.
