	142495 : ["In the news currently, is the outrage that Anders whatshisname, the man who killed the kids in Norway, only got 21 years. This is the maximum sentence, ie, life. Now in the US he could have been given consecutive life sentences, so that he was in jail until the day he drew his last breath in this life. It was reported that when he was told 21 years, he laughed, and has been quoted as saying something along the lines of how he had no regrets and he would do it again. This is a man who though given life, will still be young when released, rehab isn't going to be invalidated. As for justice, he killed 71 people, you would love to see him broken while incarcerated, but he has rights. He is in custody, he has the right to live. What I would like to see, in this ideal world, would be lives lived out in monastic conditions. No speaking, hard work, be it scrubbing, plowing, sowing, tending, growing, harvesting, all without modern convenient means. Make them grow cotton and hand harvest, back breaking work. Every resource not used in the prison should be given, not sold, to the community. There would be no prison yard, just hot sun and hard graft, in complete servitude.", 11542, "c4VSOHdaaa", 2],

In justice and law, house-arrest (also called home confinement, home detention, or electronic monitoring) is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to a certain residence.
