	134275 : ["You cannot train a dog you don't spend time with.l For the dog to bond with you and care what you want, he has to spend time with you.  Bring him into the house.  First training exercise is housebreaking.  Biting is easy:  give him safe things like big Kongs or original Nylabones to chew.   When he bites you, take hold of his skull in both hands, holding his muzzle shut.  Look down into his eyes and growl at him, in as low and forceful a voice as you can manage, \"NO!  NO TEETH!\"  Then push him away and walk away.  He needs to learn that biting ends the interaction with you.  If he jumps and puts his paws on you, turn around fast with both arms swung wide and high over your head, to make you look HUGE, and snap, \"NO!  BAD DOG.\"  Then walk away again and continue to ignore him.  When he comes up to you with his ears flattened and his tailtip wagging low, then tell him he's wonderful and pet him. Hyper is just pent-up energy.  You need to provide him with an outlet for it.  most GSDs are natural retrievers; get a safe solid rubber ball and roll it across the yard.  Get one of the big meter-long knotted rope toys and encourage him to grab it and play tug.  Swing him around (gently-- you don't want to break a tooth!) and sound happy when you play with him. Look for a puppy kindergarten now; enroll him in basic obedience ASAP.

You cannot train even an adult dog for 8 hours a day. About the most that can be done at any one time is 10 - 20 minutes and that is with an adult dog and not a puppy. The attention span on this baby is extremely short and training session should be no more than 10 minutes and twice a day. Additionally, there isn't going to be much learned if you will only be training for 5 days. Obedience training is cumulative and is done over a much longer period of at least several weeks to several months.  What you can charge is determined by your experience, reputation, and accomplishments and in a case like this, should also include guaranteed expectations.
