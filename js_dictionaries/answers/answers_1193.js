Then, about 5-6 months ago, the Ambassador stated that he is \"...amused at how gullible Americans are,\" at believing Obama was born in HI. I even posted the article here on Y!A and Yahoo removed it because of what it said. Now, most liberals deny that the Ambassador said anything at all. Some when as far as to say that they don't care what he said because they are going to believe what they want regardless! In fact, during the campaign when the Government of Kenya realize that Obama could lose the election over it, the Kenya government made it where NO ONE could ask any of Obama's cousins, etc, any such questions dealing with where he was born at. A government representative had to be present eveytime the media wanted to interview his cousin about Obama to make sure no such questions were asked. The liberals deny that as well. But it shows you how little they cared to find out. And last but not least, the very week that BO won, Nancy Pelosi authorized the DNC to help pay for any of his legal fees dealing with his BC issue in hopes of keeping him out of the courts. wmayers99, What BO \"offers\" to the pubic is nothing but a fraud!

He is winning states mainly due to the Independent votes, for which in general elections he will have to fight with McCain and Nader now.   Overall, in the general election, she has a better chance of getting the black vote than Obama of getting the hispanic votes.  Don't forget, if Obama is not the nominee black voters may skip out on voting completely, but if Clinton is not the nominee, hispanics may end up voting for GOP as they have done in the past. As for the African American populations, while they make up large populations in some state, most of them already voted in the primaries.  Now if 80-90% support among black voters gave Obama slightly more than 50%, once you throw in the Republican voters, he is quickly sinking below the mandate level.   And as you talk about LA and MS going against GOP, Obama's lack of support of FL democratic votes and pushing for them to be excluded from the primary will not win him a lot of support in that state.  MI is also not too happy with him.   Overall, he may win more states, but she has a better chance of winning more electoral votes, but winning states like NY, NJ, PA, OH, FL, CA and possibly TX on the strength of the Hispanic vote (although that's highly unlikely as I'm sure Bush will campaign for McCain there).", 8286, "None", 0],

Secondly, this depends on if you want a gaming pc or not, but a good graphics card is good because a poor graphcis card will slow down your game considerably.    Thirdly, RAM. RAm is Random Access Memory. RAM pulls off memory from your harddrive and places it into itself so you can access it faster. For example, if you play a game, your game will be downloaded into your RAM and the game will run off of it. RAM affects how much memory can be placed into it before it dumps old memory off the edge.   Lastly, a harddrive. If you are a hardcore music listener or movie watcher, a harddrive is important. A harddrive is you main computer memory where everything is stored. The average harddrive nowadays is about 500GB I think.

The American entrepreneurial spirit will generate enough tax revenue to close our budget shortfall and begin to pay down the National Debt without resorting to substantial tax hikes. Edit:  Sorry, let me translate for you.  \"trim back government waste\" = \"cut government spending\"  That doesn't mean we need to butcher Medicare and Social Security to balance budgets, though.
