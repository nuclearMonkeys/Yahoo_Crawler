Examples: Infancy Gospel of Thomas Chapter 3: 1 - 4 The son of Annas the scribe was standing there with Jesus. Taking a branch from a willow tree, he dispersed the waters which Jesus had gathered.  When Jesus saw what had happened, he became angry and said to him, \"You godless, brainless moron, what did the ponds and waters do to you? Watch this now: you are going to dry up like a tree and you will never produce leaves or roots or fruit.\"And immediately, this child withered up completely. Then, Jesus departed and returned to Joseph's house.  The parents of the one who had been withered up, however, wailed for their young child as they took his remains away. Then, they went to Joseph and accused him, \"You are responsible for the child who did this.\" The Infancy Gospel of James Chapter 13: 1 - 7  In the sixth month of her pregnancy, Joseph came from his house-building and went into the house to find her swelling. And he struck his face and threw himself on the ground in sackcloth and wept bitterly, \"How can I look to the Lord God? What will I pray about her, for I took her as a virgin from the temple of the Lord and did not guard her? Who has set this trap for me? Who did this evil in my house? Who stole the virgin from me and defiled her.  Has not the story of Adam been repeated with me? For while Adam was glorifying God, the serpent came and found Eve alone and deceived her and defiled her - so it has also happened to me.\"And Joseph got up from his sackcloth and called her and said to her, \"After having been cared for by God, what have you done? Did you forget the Lord your God?

You can teach your dog how to play hide and seek with you...hide toys or treats or bones...whatever you give him...and teach him to go find them.  Then when you leave, you can hide things around the area in which he is allowed, and he will have something to do.  There is a great toy dispenser that you can pick up at most pet stores.   You put kong balls with treats inside and set the timer...and it will automatically throw out toys, say every 3 or 4 hours for your dog to play with.  And yes, most important...LONNNNGGG walk, play, exercise before you leave him.  Is his crate available to him when you go out?

There is NO NEED to \"create\" more breeds unless they perform jobs and tasks current breeds cannot - which is a slim to none possibility. Look at Labradoodles - the guy who started breeding them had a valid reason: to create hypoallergenic guide dogs with lab and poodle traits. However he was UNABLE to get the program animals to breed true. They never developed predictable traits and he could not get that \"hypoallergenic\" trait to pass reliably. He gave it up.  And the kicker is there is ALREADY a dog that shares lab/poodle traits - it's called the Portuguese Water Dog.  Instead of creating \"new\" breeds i think the focus should be on preserving strong bloodlines of existing breeds. Getting rid of puppy mills and back yard breeding.

	134158 : ["If that breed has a purpose, then yes, I am 100% in favor of creating a new breed.  If no other existing breed would be able to do the job of this new breed, then a new breed is necessary.  However, there are hundreds of breeds out there fulfilling all purposes and functions (and most dogs can be trained to do most jobs) so most of the time the dog you need already exists. I raise puppies for The Seeing Eye in New Jersey.  Although they use German shepherds, labs, and golden retrievers, I can honestly say that none of these dogs closely resemble their AKC counterparts.  The frequency of hip dysplasia in GSD's is 1/4, but in The Seeing Eye, only 1/100 dogs has hip dysplasia.   The Seeing Eye also crosses labs and goldens, then breeds the resulting pup to a lab to make something they call a \"crossback\".   The crossbacks are better than labs and goldens at being a guide dog, and the females have an easier time giving birth than goldens and also have short fur (easier for a blind person to groom).   So although they haven't really created a new breed, the dogs in the seeing eye are very different than the AKC breed standard and are almost a different breed.  I approve of this because they wanted to make the healthiest best guide dog possible, so they bred with that in mind.  They pay no attention to physical appearance of the dog, so they wind up with weird looking dogs sometimes but they have the right temperament for the job and they're 100% healthy so nobody cares. ADD-- to the third poster: the woman who bred the first labradoodles actually released a statement saying that she regretted breeding the dogs because of what happened when they got popular.  However, labradoodles do make good hypoallergenic guide dogs!  In Australia that's all they use for people with allergies.  Although at The Seeing Eye, we normally just use boxers.  But boxers aren't perfect, they are often too high strung for the job.  They are working on finding/creating a breed that will be perfect- good temperament for a guide dog and hypoallergenic.  Portuguese water dogs don't make good guide dogs, their prey drive is too high- they are likely to get distracted if the person walks through a park with kids playing soccer, or a squirrel runs past... situations like that. ADD2- BTW, here is my \"German Shepherd\" who I adopted from the Seeing Eye.  She was the 1/100 with bad hips (they're not really that bad, just not perfect), so they rejected her and didn't want to breed her, much less use her as a guide dog!  As you can see, she looks way different than a regular GSD.  She weighs 45 pounds at age 2. She is about 100 years of breeding removed from the AKC standard, and as you can see, she looks pretty different!
