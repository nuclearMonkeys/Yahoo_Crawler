He still had to register as a Sex Offender for the remaining term of his sentence and he lost his public service job, as well as his reputation, so he and his family had to move to Canada. My best advice would be to get a good lawyer who specializes in this kind of cases. If he's truly innocent, a good lawyer will increase his chances of not going to prison, going at it without a lawyer or with a Public Defender is suicidal, as even if he's innocent, he'll probably be convicted.

This answerer becomes greater sinner by answering this question (without questioning this question!! Edited: R K Narayanan's story  ' House Opposite'  in support for Sri J SWAMY's remark here -  The basic plot of the story includes a holy man (only referred to as \"the hermit\") that is living along with the traditions of an Indian lifestyle.  The hermit becomes aware of a prostitute living across the street, and cannot ignore her presence. Throughout the story, the hermit complains about the \"awful monster\" and regards her as the \"personification of evil.\"  \"A harlot was sent to heaven when she died, while her detractor, a self-righteous reformer, found himself in hell - his guru explained that the harlot sinned only with her body, physically, her detractor was corrupt mentally, obsessed with the harlot and her activities, and could meditate on nothing else.\"  This serves as a very good explanation for what truly occurs in the story. While neither is pure and good in the situation, the man who could not overcome her existence and was ruined by her was much worse off. Even the woman was able to overcome her humiliation at his remarks to her, and call him by a respectful title, swamiji, and ask for forgiveness from him. The hermit remained a broken man, who had been cast out of his home by the thought of such an \"evil woman,\" while the woman was able to hold onto her dignity.", 10429, "LZF76BLXaa", 9],

It's located at the heart of the Gaslamp District, and it's only $19 for a dormitory style room with 4-8 beds, or $48 for a private room. The next cheapest would be maybe the Motel 6 Downtown, still walking distance to the Gaslamp District (6th Avenue and Front). Rates are $64/night plus tax for one person, another $5 for two.
