I repeat that for the duration of my run (which is often around 3 miles). . Strength work is also helpful, especially lower body. I've linked to a couple of articles below, that you may find useful.

Some ways to help reduce the chances of running injuries are: Wear quality running shoes suited to your feet and biomechanics, and change them out every 350-500 miles (depending on your running conditions, style, and weight) Warm-up and cool-down/stretch before/after your runs Foam roll and do self myofascial release regularly (with a tennis ball or similar) Strength train to help your body stay strong and better able to handle the high impact pounding of running Talk to a good running coach or physical therapist skilled in running technique, to ensure your form is not one that will lead to possible injury (some physical therapy clinics or personal training facilities can do a gait analysis and help you see if there are any issues or potential issues)", 4300, "AA11447210", 3],
	27497 : ["There's no way to tell how it will affect you, as an individual, except to keep running until you are 50, or 60, or 70, or ... Some injuries that affect running are the result of non-running activities. Even so, a lot of runners have injuries caused from running. These tend to be repetitive use injuries, with causes that are correctable. I believe running injuries can be prevented by avoiding mistakes.  A common mistake is running in shoe that poorly match the runner's biomechanics. If you feel some pain, find out what is wrong. Find the cause, and correct it early. I'm a fan of othoses (orthotics). These can compensate for biomechanic issues not corrected for shoes. There is a good chance there is something different on your left than on your right, so an orthosis can be used to balance your left and your right. Personal note: I've had mild knee pain starting when I was a kid. It doesn't bother me when I run regularly. I believe running is good for my knees. I have had knee pain, but I dealt with it by modifying an insole one one shoe. Essentially, I made my own orthosis.  It is possible your mother has joint aches because she *didn't* exercise regularly.  Of course, there are many other possible reasons for your mother's aches in joints. She should go in for a medical evaluation. She should ask her physician about her risks from an exercise program. ", 4300, "k7hBT7MGaa", 2],

Between now and then, cut your workout time to about 50% of your current load this week, and to about 30% of your current load next week. If it is more than 2 weeks away, I suggest 200 meter or 400 meter intervals once a week or once every two weeks. If you have time, do hill repeats once a week or once every two weeks for 6 weeks before starting intervals. We typically run faster when we are in a race than we do even when doing a hard workout.

	27513 : ["You didn't give us much information about your history. How much did you exercise in the time between when you were fast in the 40 yard dash, and now? I'll assume you had some sort of period where you were not sprinting. If that's the case, it's likely your leg muscles are no longer conditioned (trained) for sprinting.  The short answer is this:  It's likely because you are out of shape, with respect to sprinting.   If you want more information, here it is: Jogging is an aerobic exercise: It raises your heart rate and breathing rate, but the effort is kept below the \"anaerobic threshold\", also known as the  \"lactate threshold.\" Sprinting, on the other hand, is above the anaerobic threshold. This means your muscles are demanding more energy than your cardio/vascular/pulmonary system can deliver for use by aerobic metabolic pathways. Your muscles try to make up the difference by metabolizing blood sugar via a pathway that doesn't require oxygen.  This \"anaerobic glycolysis\" pathway is less efficient. It produces metabolic waste faster than your system can remove the waste. The accumulation of this waste inhibits muscle action. If you sprint as far as  you can, your muscles will accumulate enough waste so you will be forced to stop. Your muscles' reaction to accumulation of metabolic waste is what makes your legs feel heavy.  If you include sprint training in your workouts, you will train your muscles and your system to tolerate a higher level of the metabolic waste at the same time you train your body to remove the waste in less time. But, don't overdo it. Avoid burnout. Comment: Lactic acid is generally regarded as the major metabolic waste when working above the anaerobic threshold. But, I read an article in which the author claimed that hasn't actually been scientifically verified. The author intended it as an example of science hastily coming to a conclusion when discovering a correlation. The author suggested the major metabolic waste is actually lactate, which is a base, and lactic acid is produced in order to help remove the lactate. ", 4294, "k7hBT7MGaa", 1],
