	136528 : ["You almost answered it yourself. Is it possible that astrology is useless?  There are those who defend astrology by pointing out how accurate professional horoscopes are. Astrology “works,” it is said, but what does that mean? Basically, to say astrology works means that there are a lot of satisfied customers and one can shoehorn any event to fit a chart. It does not mean that astrology is accurate in predicting human behavior or events to a degree significantly greater than mere chance. There are many satisfied customers who believe that their horoscope accurately describes them and that their astrologer has given them good advice. Such evidence does not prove astrology so much as it demonstrates the Forer effect, and confirmation bias. Good astrologers give good advice, but that does not validate astrology. Many of the claims made about signs and personalities are vague and would fit many people under many different signs. Even professional astrologers, most of whom have nothing but disdain for sun sign astrology, can't pick out a correct horoscope reading at better than a chance rate.", 11320, "531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa", 0],
	136529 : ["Astrology is empirical- two astrologers with the same data will not arrive at the same conclusions. Also the interpretations are subject to personal interpretations. There is no single scientific formula that fits in such a way that two independant people with the same data will arrive at the same result. Hence astrology is not a science in the true sense.", 11320, "zJPkEWktaa", 0],

	136566 : ["It's hard, but sometimes I struggle to know where I stand with WWE. It's been said, but at times they can be brilliant and produce wrestling's most memorable historical events, and other times they can be plain stupid either on the creative side or just not recognizing that they have guys on their roster who eiher need a push or have a lot more to offer to the company then they're given credit for. It's also that issue of WWE's old ideals vs new. They struggle with moving ahead because they still have guys like Undertaker and HHH. It's much easier for a company like ROH to move ahead make stars and listen to fans because they're only priority is to grow as a company and so they attract the fans who stay behind them. So what WWE's problem is that they struggle with their 80's and 90's wrestling mentality along with keeping things relevant and those two ideas clash greatly. But at the end of the day they'll target a certain demographic, please that group of people, and then move on wit the next one believing that if they can do what they want to do then their all is well if they throw out bones to their fans. And by bones I mean those elements of programming that might please kids, adults, and other certain demographics including races and ethnicities. And creatively, in reference to your example about Ric Flair, it seems based on the shoot interviews I've watched from guys like Steve Corino that WWE is hiring a lot of writers who really have no experience in wrestling. If we were to interogate the two big wrestling promotions, TNA would have a lot more explaining to do since they only started up a couple of years ago. They went from this company that embraced good wrestling to this circus that went from faling miserbly to now looking as if it's trying to create the second coming of \"attitude\" I haven't neccesarily lost confidence in either company because at the end of the day I know what each one is trying to accomplish and I what they look to do. So in a way, WWE and TNA have both set my expectations. Now everybody is looking for ROH to emerge and show them how to get over as wrestling promotion not a global entertainment phenomenom.", 11322, "None", 3],
