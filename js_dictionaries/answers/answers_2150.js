How do you know that any answerer here that gives you what you think sounds like the right formula isn't just making it up?  How do you know there is even a formula to follow? How do you know that 9 to 11 year olds still need pictures in their books?  Are you assuming that they do, somebody said they do, or did you actually research that?  10 year olds are in intermediate school (5th grade), and fully capable of reading a real book without pictures. Do you actually know the categories of children's books?  Picture, story, and chapter books are not all there is.  What is LG, MG, and YA?  Can these be broken down into genres?  What word count is average for each? What age group do these apply to? What age are children are in primary, elementary, intermediate, and middle school grades?   There is more to writing for children than just how many pictures and where to put them.  Writing for children is not as easy as most people think, and it can be more complicated than writing for adults.  Should there be talking animals in children's books?  What age should a main character be in relation to the age of the reader?  What kind of plot adventures are reasonable?  Should parent characters help solve the child character's problems or not?  Is it okay to portray parent characters as being stupid?  What word count, vocabulary, and sentence structure is best for each age group? Does a book have to have a moral?  If it has a moral, should it be obvious?  Is magic appropriate for the age group?  What about violence?  Should gender roles be strickly enforced?  Should characters incude different races and ethnic groups, or should that be left up to the reader to imagine? What about disabilities? What about stereotypes?   I don't say all this to be mean.  I'm hoping it will help you understand the writing/publishing better. You really do need to do some research if you want to have a real chance at getting published by a reputable company.

When it comes time to getting changed (into pjs/out), they must get changed in seperate rooms I think if these conditions can be met, if your son can agree to your rules and can agree to follow the other parents rules when he's at their home, then I see no reason why he shouldnt be able to have a sleepover at her house.", 10342, "cZsUg6mqaa", 1],

	113318 : ["Welcome to this most fascinating study. Even if, one day, you should end up dumping all you believe about astrology, I promise you that not one second of your studies will be wasted. Astrology is a different way of looking at the world, and if you learn only that, you'll be way ahead of all the skeptics. >Apparently, according to the cosmos, we will be entering a new world order and all of the governments will become one. It will be totalitarian and a complete police state.< Relax. End of the world as we know it predictions are as old as predictions. They aren't only made by astrologers either. Pluto needs to be held at arms length. Many astrologers are persuaded of its vast influence, I'm not one of them, but Pluto never quite lives up to its advance billing.  In the 17th century  end of the world types went so far as to cut off the head of Charles I of England. They thought by getting rid of the monarchy, they would speed along the second coming of Christ. They restored the monarchy instead.  In the 14th or 15th century, I can never remember which, there was a rather large gathering of planets in Pisces. More end of the world stuff. This time it was the second great flood. Needless to say it didn't happen. So take all that with a grain of salt.  There are tons of beginner's books, some good, some bad, most are indifferent. The one you mentioned is popular. The key is to find a book you like and resist the temptation to buy more and more books in the hopes that the next one will make everything simple. There is no such book. Get one down pat and then move on, not before.  Join a Yahoo Group that is tilted towards beginners. You may have to join more than one until you find one that is more interested in astrology than it is in the egos of the members. They're out there, but you have to keep looking. If you live in or near a large city there is probably an astrology group or organization that gives lessons to newbies. Find it and join. Don't be afraid to announce you're new to the subject. On the other hand receive all suggestions politely, but you will get many and will need to pare them down. Most of all, have fun. Take baby steps and don't get frightened by the technical jargon. It will all become as familiar as your family's names in no time. Enjoy. EDIT: Trying to reason with Baron is like trying to reason with a rock. This particular Baron is a bit nastier than others who use this particular ID. He has no knowledge of history (e.g. his stoning remark) and even less of astrology. He just spews cliches and doesn't even bother to use appropriate ones. He's a cut and paste commenter. Save your efforts. \"End of the world\"  as I used it was a metaphor and perhaps \"end of the world that we now know\" would have been better.
