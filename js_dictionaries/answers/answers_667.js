	37175 : ["It is a BAD idea to get her declawed. It's a cruel procedure that's outlawed in most civilized countries now. It causes a large amount of pain during recovery and often lingering lifelong pain. My own cat was declawed in front by his prior owners before I got him from the shelter. He was then surrendered to the shelter a few years later because he began to pee outside his litter box as the litter hurt his feet now, and bite their children, hard, likely out of a combination of pain and feeling defenseless. He had already begun to develop arthritis due to the gait alterations removing the first joint of their toes causes. To make matters worse, the vet that did the procedure did a bad job, leaving bone shards behind and causing masses of nail tissue to regrow *inside* his toes. My vet said it must have been like walking on broken glass, for years. He had to have surgery to remove the debris from his feet, essentially repeating the declaw procedure. I've never seen a pet in so much pain. Even with strong pain medications, he wouldn't even stand on his own for three days, and hardly walked for a week, just laid in his bed and cried, had to be carried to use the litter box and brought food and water. While he is substantially happier now, he still has severe arthritis. I cannot even imagine the kind of person who would put their cat through that much pain for their own convenience.  Get some glue-on rubber nail caps, and/or keep her nails trimmed. Give her plenty of acceptable places to scratch. If she's clawing your arms, examine WHY.

One of the problems is likely that if you adopt a foster dog, then you won't be available to foster more dogs.  I would not go against the contract. You did not expect to fall in love with the dog, but you signed the contract. This is legal and rescue leagues can be quite rigid if you go against them. You could easily have the police at your door. Then, you would never be able to adopt from any of the other groups - they usually know one another. Abide by your contract, but politely ask if they will reconsider. If not, then go with that and find another dog to adopt. Adoption fee of $450? Fees must have gone up.", 5532, "p7ZdohGTaa", 1],

	37203 : ["What are my Rights ?   OK.... Legally the contractor MUST give notice of upcoming building / demolition works - quite often notices are planned on local street lamps or similar, rather than letters through every letter box. Contractors ARE allowed to carry out loud works, but only during set (pre-approved hours), generally that is weekday days  from about 9am to 5pm - ie when most people are out at work / school etc. If that is the case, then there is NOTHING you can do about loud works.  However, that said, if this continues into the evening or over a weekend, then the contractor could well be breaking the rules. Re the heavy machinery - well that is necessary equipment and nothing you can do - unless they are blocking the pavement / road with it. Perhaps a phone call to your local Council or to the contractor involved will give you more information  Unfortunately if you are home during the day, then you have very little 'rights' The other 'right' you might have is if the contractor somehow damages your house or car - is that the case ? Obviously with heavy construction work, there are going to be vibrations.  In RARE cases prolonged heavy work in close proximity can cause damage to property.. This includes cracking in walls, damage to home mechanical systems, doors and windows misalignment, damage to concrete and concrete blocks, exterior stucco cracks and other signs of distress - in which case you or the landlord need to contact the council AND contractor immediately", 5554, "lIO4uiJmaa", 1],
