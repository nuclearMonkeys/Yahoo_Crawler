	88067 : ["Creationism is the religious belief that humanity, life, the Earth, and the universe were created in their original form by a deity (often the Abrahamic God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam) or deities. In relation to the creation-evolution controversy the term creationism is commonly used to refer to religiously motivated rejection of evolution as an explanation of origins. Creationism in the West is usually based on creation according to Genesis, and in its broad sense covers a wide range of beliefs and interpretations. Through the 19th century the term most commonly referred to direct creation of individual souls, in contrast to traducianism. However, by 1929 in the United States the term became particularly associated with Christian fundamentalist opposition to human evolution and belief in a young Earth. Several U.S. states passed laws against the teaching of evolution in public schools, as upheld in the Scopes Trial. Evolution was omitted entirely from school textbooks in much of the United States until the 1960s. Since then, renewed efforts to introduce teaching creationism in American public schools in the form of flood geology, creation science, and intelligent design have been consistently held to contravene the constitutional separation of Church and State by a succession of legal judgments. The meaning of the term creationism was contested, but by the 1980s it had been co-opted by proponents of creation science and flood geology. Such beliefs include Young Earth creationism, proponents of which believe that the earth is thousands rather than billions of years old. They typically believe the days in Genesis Chapter 1 are 24 hours in length, while Old Earth creationism accepts geological findings and other methods of dating the earth and believes that these findings do not contradict the Genesis account, but reject evolution. The term theistic evolution has been coined to refer to beliefs in creation which are more compatible with the scientific view of evolution and the age of the Earth. Alternately, there are other religious people who support creation, but in terms of allegorical interpretations of Genesis. When mainstream scientific research produces conclusions which contradict a creationist interpretation of scripture, the strict creationist approach is either to reject the conclusions of the research, its underlying scientific theories, and/or its methodology. For this reason, both creation science and intelligent design have been labeled as pseudoscience by the mainstream scientific community. The most notable disputes concern the effects of evolution on the development of living organisms, the idea of common descent, the geologic history of the Earth, the formation of the solar system, and the origin of the universe.", 9283, "None", 3],

	88072 : ["Let's define LIFE first.. perhaps that would clear up the conundrum. How do you define LIFE?  Perhaps we'll find that God is not \"life\" as we define it. And that saying that no life existed.. is talking about Life as WE know it. Let's propose this.. I believe this is the generally accepted defintion according to most Bilogists... Life is the \"semi faithful reproduction of genetic traits and all the processes that incorporate metabolism\" Something like that.  Semi-faithful because we know mutation happens. Metabolism..because that's how we know something is alive, if it is metabolizing.  Viruses and Pryons are still a bit of an issue.. one can argue they neither carry out metabolism NOR can self-replicate on their own (without infecting and thus hijacking another cell) Is God reproducing himself? - NO, it says we are in his \"image\" but not a semi-faithful reproduction and \"image\" could mean anything, like the seeking of truth, rational mind, etc.  Is God metabolizing things.. taking in raw materials and through metabolic processes breaking those down into life sustaining energy? -- Probably NOT. So is God \"lilfe\" ??? Answer: NO So he can exist BEFORE LIFE, because he is not LIFE.  We can claim he is alive.. as \"alive\" is simply the state of existing and acting.  However.. we can not say he is LIFE and therefore subject to the limitations of life as we know it.  He is a spiritual being. See the difference?  Make sense? _________________________________________________ ::EDIT::: {{Nunchuks}} who posted before me, regarding infinite time. You are right.. we can't get here from Infinite beause it would take an infinitely long time... However, AGAIN.. this is a limitation of Materialism.. or a material view of the Universe.  Materialists presume that Time has always existed.. and that time is linear.   This places Limits on God, as if he exists within an already created Universe which has time. However, before the Universe existed.. NO TIME existed.. hence one can not say that infinite or eternity means that the Universe could never be created.  God exists outside of time.. that is what makes him Eternal AND would allow him to create the Universe.  Not create the Universe at a specific TIME.. because Time did not exist. He simply Created it... that's all we can say.  We can't pinpoint WHEN, because time is a measurement we use to place events in a linear sequence.  You see, sometimes I see Atheism relying entirely on Materialism and because of this, it runs into some logical mistakes when trying to contemplate things which are eternal, outside of time, OR non-material.  I see often times, Atheism/Materialists trying to apply natural laws to non-material things like God, Angels, Devil, etc.  This seems to be a limit to their world view. Something that holds them back and confuses them. I once heard it said, in an argument with Richard Dawkins...that Atheists view the universe as a clockwork mechanism and thus must ignore the contradictions in life.

In fact, the idea of this above Quranic verses was originated from superstitions commonly believed by Pagans in the Middle East.

Among the Egyptians for example, it was the involuntary separation of Geb (the Earth god) from his wife and sister Nut (the sky goddess) that was responsible for the division of the earth from the sky. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh likewise describes the moment “when the heavens had been separated from the earth, when the earth had been delimited from the heavens” as a result of the separation of a sky God (An) from an earth Goddess (Ki) [THHuxley].

The fact that if a human would live on a planet of identical graity as the earth and the same rotation but larger size that person would age slower.

	88112 : ["OKAY David Davidson I'm getting a little tired of your judging all of us as if we are maniacs trying to convert you. I'm a Christian and I believe very differently. And that's a little unfair saying just Christians believe that! I believe (yes of course) God created the earth from nothing. I guess the BBT could be true but I would rather believe we evolved from human than germs. Christians (the sane ones, cause friend I hear ya when you say there are some weird ones out there...but I let them be...who am I to say they are bad people just because I do things differently.) are usually born with something...and other religions too...that allows them to feel God. That allows them to feel hope, to feel love, to feel happiness and what's so wrong with that? Religions...so what if there wasn't a God, what is so wrong with believing in something  that gives you a tiny bit of hope and a tiny bit of knowing someone cares.  I am SO not offended when the BBT is brought up. I enjoy opinions and theory's... it's a great argument-debate if people respect each other's view.  I believe in the Lord and you believe he does not exist but it doesn't give people the right SAY he doesn't exist, label Christians excluding ALL other religions and saying they are wrong ... saying they all are \"offended.\" When you are 6/7 years old and someone says you are an idiot!   is NOT real. The kids dreams, imagination, hopes are crushed. When you mature and still hold your imagination and add faith to it... God does exist and it's rude to put someone down or telling them he does not exist. It's sort of the   situation at a mature age. I understand you could be offended if someone says your theory is wrong but they have no right to say it is wrong whether their beliefs agree or not. I think the problem isn't religion in these situations - it's society. In all honesty...sometimes...people can just suck (:", 9281, "I1t5wRMdaa", 0],
	88113 : ["Actually a literal interpretation of Genesis implies that the earth was already here, then light, then the ocean, then plants, then the sun, moon and stars, etc.  It doesn't match up. Not that this was a problem for Georges LemaÃ®tre, who besides being the physicist who first proposed the Big Bang model, was also a Belgian priest.  Obviously, he had no problem resolving his faith as a clergyman with his work as a scientist.  Ditto for Gregor Mendel. I think the biggest problem people have is getting over the habit of thinking of time in Newtonian terms.  We know from Einstein and other discoveries of physics from the past 100 years that time isn't linear and constant like Newton had assumed.  Space-time is a thing that was created with the Big Bang itself, so asking what happened \"before\" the Big Bang is like asking what's 10 miles north of the north pole.", 9281, "None", 3],
