However, if you believe that they have any less worth because you don't find them attractive, then that's racist... Probably the reason why you aren't attracted to them is that you grew up watching shows where the main characters were almost always white people. For this reason the Western ideals of beauty were imprinted upon you.", 11393, "nvc6D974aa", 7],
	138636 : ["If you need more lessons, purchase a sewing machine from a sewing machine dealer that offers lessons. Visit as many dealers as you can and if you are still a minor, take a parent or guardian with you so they will take you seriously. Try out the machines and ask for demos of the buttonhole maker and blind hem stitch feature. You want any easy, one-step buttonhole maker and and blind hem stitch that can be adjusted for width.  A needle up/down feature is also great as the needle down will hold the fabic in place should you have to lift the presser foot to change the position of the fabric. The other features are mostly basic with all machines. As the machines are being shown to you, take notes and after you have exhausted your resources, choose the machine you like best from the dealer you like best. You will need a good relationship with the dealer as you have have questions, need assistance and need a reliable source when the machine needs to be serviced. New machines come with warranties and some have free first year maintenance (routine cleaning, lubricating and over all check-up). When you get your machine home, open the user's manual and lay it right next to the sewing machine.  Go page-by-page, paying careful attention to the threading details (presser foot always up) and test each feature with two layers of fabric scraps. Keep the manual handy for future reference. Best wishes in your pursuit in honor of your grandmother.  This will be a great remembrance.", 11395, "6N3yjlXhaa", 2],

It seems that everyone wants all of the bells & whistles on everything nowadays, but simple & basic is a great beginning.  You can pick up machines at garage sales, craigslist, the local thrift store.  Just be sure to bring material, thread & a NEW needle to make sure it is operating correctly.  If, after a year or so you've become addicted, you'll have more \"where-with-all\" & know just what it is you want from a machine and be able to make an educated decision.  Don't rely on a sales person to give you a proper \"fit\".   Talk to your friends & acquaintances, you never know who has a machine that they simply do not use and would like to either lend, sell or give away.  Used machines...that is all I buy.  I generally do not pay more than $20.00.  Several I've picked up for $5.00.  My treadle I did pay $50.00 for, but I know they can come much cheaper.  If money is an issue, be patient.

	138652 : ["I don't think it matters too much which machine you buy as long as you don't buy one of those Pixie things (or of course one of those hand-held stitcher things).    If you wanted to spend a *lot* of money (and get a machine that runs ultra-smoothly and quietly and/or has bells and whistles like a start-stop button on the machine, etc), that would be wonderful of course, but most people don't have that kind of money.   If you decide to make this a primary hobby at some time in the future or to make money from things you sew in production quantity (and you have the bucks), then I'd definitely go for one of the expensive ones though. Most of the well-known names like Singer and Kenmore, etc, have sewing machines even in the under-$100 range and those are fine and will do all kinds of things and have all kinds of stitches, so nothing more is really necessary.  Personally, I bought a Singer 8280 when I wanted a second machine --I think at Target or Walmart (though it was at other places too) because it was on sale for I think only $69, maybe $20 off-- and it's been totally fine for quilting (piecing), repairs, sewing clothing and crafts, buttonholes, etc.  Can't think of any \"costumes\" I couldn't make with it either. There are various places you can research sewing machines online though too.  Amazon.com is one place I like to check out because there are a lot of *purchaser* reviews for lots of models all in one place (and not just manufacturers' reviews, which aren't all that trustworthy). Here is one page for sewing machines at Amazon if you want to do a little checking out yourself: (you will notice on that page that you can select machines to look at by price range or by brand on the left side of the screen-- a very helpful feature) ...To read reviews on any particular machine, click on it, then click on the \"Customer Reviews.\" Here's another place with reviews of sewing machines: P.S.  I think your grandmother would love it very much (even if she doesn't totally understand) if you sewed something for her to use where she is now, and maybe personalize it in some ways too since dementia doesn't seem to affect music and art the way it does faces, etc. I made a small lap quilt for my grandmother in the same situation (she was an artist), and used colors I knew she'd liked.  Sometimes she could remember someone-she-liked had made it, but she always enjoyed using it and showing to others even when she didn't.

Dealers can have some great prices on trade ins.  Once you decide that you want to stick with it, I would buy a Bernina.

Give him the hotel invoices you have paid to date and he should reimburse you those. I've had customers sit down with me once a month, and I'll pay them back for the Coverage D for that prior month.  Also, get with your contractor. Find out how long they think it will be to repair the house.  If it looks like you'll be out of your house another 6 months, contact apartment complexes in your area. You may be able to sign a 6 month lease. That may be cheaper than the hotel and more comfortable.  Most apartments will not sign a lease for less then 6 months.  You have hired a public adjuster.  Not needed but your choice.  A good insurance agent can answer the questions we have. Or a good adjuster will walk you through the process. But it's your choice to hire a public adjuster. Not needed in my opinion, but your choice.  The public adjuster gets paid a % of the money your policy pays out. The insurance company does NOT consider the public adjusters fees in their pay out.  His fee is NEVER a factor in what they determine to pay.  So, if the public adjuster's fee is 10% - then he will get $12,500 of your $125,000 payment.  That means, that's $12,500 less you have to repair your house.  Let the contractor know about the public adjuster, you may need to use some cheaper finishes etc so that you can repair the house on the reduced funds.  Since you have hired a public adjuster  and will be paying him from your settlement proceeds - you really need to let him earn his money. Start picking up the phone and asking him all your questions.

Now that you have the cost of repairs, it should only be a week or two before they can actually begin . . . and you'll have to move either into a trailer or apartment.  Communication with your adjuster is KEY.  Regarding the replacement cost on your contents.  YOU provide them the list, with your actual purchase price, or the cost to replace.   The EASIEST way to get that cost to replace, is via internet shopping.    They WILL depreciate the value, ONCE, and pay actual cash value up front.  When you actually REPLACE the item - and usually you have six months to do that, they give you the difference between what they paid, and the ACTUAL cost - for like kind and quality.     You have a public adjuster.  You're giving him 10% of the TOTAL value of the claim.  You let HIM fight this out with the insurer - you're paying him a HECK of a lot of money to do just that very thing. Do you have an agent?
