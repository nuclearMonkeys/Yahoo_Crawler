Are you actually advocating that since I just feel like killing my neighbor because he's annoying, that I should, because I should have the freedom to do it? Stop being an a$$! No...I shouldn't. Why?

I know there are jersey's hanging in Edmonton, LA and New York, but I'm not sure about St Louis, I would imagine there is but I don't know that for sure.   Another interesting thing is the league also waived the mandatory 3 year waiting period for being inducted into the Hall of Fame, and on doing so declared that would never happen again and they would never retire another jersey league wide!

	93221 : ["The dead are dead. We should focus on the living. As such, there are two concerns relevant for how we should treat the dead: 1) The relatives of the deceased. Having a loved one die is traumatic. We should honor the dead as a way of helping the living cope with the loss. 2) The feelings of the individual before they die. We're creatures capable of imagining our own deaths. Knowing that your body might be desecrated after you die could be distressing. By honoring the dead, we remove that concern from the minds of those still living. Personally, though, I'd be in favor of turning people into fertilizer or something.

There were peoples from all races and religions fighting on Germany s side during the war, even some Jews, known as Hitler s Jewish soldiers.  The Polish issue you refer to was not racial at all, it was more about a long standing rivalry between German and Polish.  The real reason Hitler invaded Poland was because the Polish were busy committing genocide against Germans living in western Poland.  We never hear the main stream media talk about this?? A lot of the information in the mass media about WW2 Germany is not historically accurate.  People should stop accepting everything they see on TV and start researching for themselves.

They did have Indian, Turkish and Arab Legions (the Grand Mufti of Cairo, served as imman for the Muslims during the war when he wasn't discussing the Final Solution with Hitler)  because Himmler wanted to make the SS international so he made a couple of moves behind Hitlers back.

In the extremely rare situation where no-one claims a body from the morgue I personally think (f it is not too badly decayed) it should be sent to the nearest medical school for the education of future doctors, and/or research into disease (or whatever). Then cremation, and bury the tube anywhere it is lawful to do so. I want to be cremated and have my ashes scattered along the shore of my favourite lake where I spent a lot of happy childhood hours.

We are wasting precious nutrients by enclosing these bodies in concrete. Here's an informational tidbit, they don't feel anything, and we encourage people to donate hearts, kidneys eyes, etc, why not donate their bodies to creating fertile earth for their descendants? Farmland could be renergized naturally instead of dumping nitrate fertilizer that ends up in the water supply. (We would need to cremate bodies that have problems that might leach into the water supply, but a natural death, doesn't make sense). If you insist on a container, let's cremate everyone, then drop the urns into these abandon oil well shafts, I'll bet you could fit millions of these things into the shafts in this country alone. Cemetaries are for the living, not the dead. It's so you have a place to pretend you're talking to someone who's no longer around and feel better instead of accepting the loss and moving on.

The vine suspended him midway between two tigers. Two mice, a white mouse and a black mouse, began to gnaw at the vine. He could see they were quickly eating it through.

	93244 : ["Nuclear weapons are not just powerful bombs, they are an entirely different class of weapon. The blast from a modern nuclear weapon is enough to obliterate an entire city, and leave the surrounding areas compleatly uninhabitable due to radiation. The radiation burns the flesh off anyone close, and causes cancer and other mutations in the population many miles from the original blast. Such weapons are absolutely terrifying - they can kill hundreds of thousands of people each, civilians included, and just a handful of them can bring an entire country to ruins. Their only real use is as a detterant - a policy known as MAD (mutually assured destruction). For example, during the Cold War, The USA and Russia constantly competed to build the most nuclear weapons. They had so many that they could each blow each other up several times over. The idea was (and still is) that as long as every nuclear-capable state keeps enough nuclear weapons to be able to compleatly decimate another country, no two would ever start a nuclear war because the result would be so devestating for them both. Essentially, by building more and more nuclear weapons, the chance of a nuclear war actually went down, because no leader dared sentence themself or their nation to complete obliteration. For this reason, there is almost no situation when a nation would ever use a nuclear weapon, especially against another nuclear-capable country. The only time a nuclear weapon was used in war was in 1945 by the USA against Japan during WW2. It was a tiny explosion compared to what we are now capable of, but was still devestating. The only reason it could be used was because MAD didn't apply - the USA was the only nuclear capable state in the world and so it did not fear a retaliation. Nowadays, I cannot think of a situation in which such a weapon would be used, unless if stolen or constructed by a terrorist group or other party which did not fear nuclear weapons being used back against them. The Syrian situation is not an example, because the Syrians are no threat to the outside world. They are fighting amongst themselves, and a nuclear explosion would be so devestating that it would be as bad for the rebels as for a government - and it would plunge Syria into chaos. As I said, it would destroy an entire city, and the number of civilians killed either by the blast or slowly by the radiation would be unimaginable. So no, we wouldn't nuke them :)", 9477, "bAv2UFQYaa", 0],

Thailand, India, Most Middle eastern countries, russia, usa, Britain, ireland, Scandinavian countries, ethiopia, angola Nigeria, japan, China, Afghanistan....I could og on With Canada, several South american countries like argentina, chile Equador, peru.......in fact People from all over the world served in the german military. The nurnberg race laws had one thing trumphing most other Things, .............it was not about being of a race, but being classified as one... The Jews in the military, predominantly in the kriegsmarine-navy were classief as non jews, or they were de-jew-ifed and then arian-ized etc...... this gave the so called race laws a little bit of a mer economical and more political aspect, like 90% of the jews killed were basically non jews still clasified as such...or bunt-juden, as they are referred to, meaning basically non jews With a possible jewish ancestor or even non, just With the wrong political views etc. So yes Hitler s military had soldiers from all over the world including blacks and jews and as in officer positions.
