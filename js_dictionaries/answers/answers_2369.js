Secondly the keys to a car is not in of itself a threat to safety since if your kid grabs the keys he's unlikely to get far. Granted there are a couple of extreme cases but actually those young kids drive surprisingly well..  Driving a car recklessly or under the influence is the real threat.  However, keeping a gun lying around the house is just a contant threat to safety since your kid could very easily pick it up and accidently fire it.

Google chrome the second fastest browser it has an appstore as well you can play e.g. angry birds just in the browser if you want. You will get ad blockers as well. Opera my favourite one its simple runs smoothly is almost as fast as chrome and will come with necessary plug ins as well.

	124308 : ["It's good that you're thinking about and analysing yourself. That's good for self insight which can help you to work on improving yourself to be what you think is a good and healthy person which presumably you would like to be.  On the other hand don't think that your problems are necessarily completely your fault. Often people have problems because they're in an unhealthy environment that has not helped them to develop into a healthy person, but into an unhealthy person. Unfortunately the family is often the cause of creating unhealthy people. Just like a plant in the wrong type of soil, light, temperature or climate doesn't do well, until it is moved somewhere it will do well.  I wouldn't get into trying to diagnose yourself as having a psychological disorder as though it is you that is the problem, rather than the environment that created you. This could just leave you in a rut and take you nowhere.  It would be better to, while self analysis is good, to rise above this and think to yourself how you would like to be. Think about what you think constitutes a healthy person and try to become one. This will probably mean you need to change your environment to try and become healthy yourself.  Something that is really helpful is to think of someone who you think is a good role model and psychologically sound with a good and happy life and think about how you can become like them.  If you cannot think of such a person in your life, don't worry as it is possible to have a role model if you don't know any in your life. You can feed and fill your brain with good and positive role models by listening to inspiring and interesting programmes on the radio (such as BBC Radio 4) or good books or tv programmes.  Think of your brain as the hardware of a computer. You want good software to make it work well and be healthy. Choose what software you want to put into your brain. If it is healthy, you will be healthy.  So, I don't think there is anything wrong with you, I think there is something wrong with your environment that created you to be the way you are and have the unhealthy problems you have. Think about what you think is good and healthy, think about good and healthy role models, fill your life and brain with good and healthy things, if the people around you make you feel unwell find new people, even if this means seeing your family less - your psychological health is more important than a family who are probably the cause of your psychological ill health.  It's probably best for you not to tell your family that they're responsible for making your psychologically unhealthy, that is unless they are particularly intelligent, peaceful and open minded people. If you tell them this it could hurt them, they might label you as having a problem and it's best for you to avoid trouble while you're fragile.  Just go and do what you think is healthy for you and it's fine to spend time alone, that is not unhealthy. Its sounds to me that you are the sort of person who needs a lot of space and that is fine, that is definately not abnormal or unhealthy. It actually is a sign that you are intelligent. So I have high hopes for you becasue of this. You sound like you would do well to do lots of reading and independent thinking. You sound like the kind of person that would thrive if you had more space to be on your own.  Don't isolate yourself completely though, that would be unhealthy. Try and meet new people. If you're rejected, think about why, anaylse things but don't beat yourself up about it. Keep trying to meet new people. Never give up. If you don't give up, you will keep learning and if you keep learning you will get better and become more healthy. Keep experimenting. Keep learning and have fun learning.  It might take a while before your find people that are good for you and help you in your quest to become more healthy. On the other hand you might find great people that you click with straight away. Careful not to meet people who have unhealthy psychological problems though. Although you might find you click with them because you currently have negative thoughs, they could prevent you from trying to become healthy. You really need to focus your energy on helping yourself while you are still quite fragile and finding your own way in life. Sure, by all means help other people, but if you find it is making you unhealthy then stop. Continue your quest to improve yourself.  I know how you feel when you say that you say things that shock people. Perhaps you might have aspergers syndrome, but that is controversial and I'm not sure that would be helpful. You just need to work on understanding your problems, understanding other people and why they think the way they do and work out carefully and thoughtfully what you think is healthy is good. Perhaps these people are wrong and you are right. Perhaps they are right and you are wrong. Just try and seek the truth.  If you're a female perhaps you get mood changes because of hormones. Keep a chart. It takes time, but it could help. See if there is a pattern to your moods. It would be really helpful if you see a patturn then you understand yourself better. Then you can dismiss moods and temporary and just make sure you are alone during this time, even go to bed if it is that bad. Taking your bad mood out on other people is a bad thing and will give you a bad name which will be bad for your image and self image. If you need to be alone at this time, be alone.  Other reasons for mood changes are simply the thoughts we have. If we think negative thoughts, then are mood will change. Simple. Think about the thoughts you have and think about whether you think they are healthy and rational. Sometimes you might not know, but don't worry too much about it. We're all like that at times.  Other common reasons for mood changes can be because of lack of regular eating and sleeping routines and eating bad quality food. Rule number one in life is regular sleeping and eating routine and making sure you eat good food that is low in fat and sugar. Eat lots of fruit and veg (8 different fruit and veg a day ideally) and make sure you get your protein and carbohydrates too.  Make sure you go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. Ok you can be flexible now and then, but if you are, be aware that this will have an effect on your health and mood to some extent.  Anyone who doesn't eat or sleep well could easily be diagnosed as having a psychiactric disorder!! A bad eating and sleeping regime alone could be the source of all your problems.  Mood changes can also signify a general disatisfcation with your life. Are you happy with what you are doing in life? If not, try and think of something you could do to make it better. If you can't think of something, at least occupy yourself with something that is healthy and good for you. This should then lead onto other healthy and good things for you. Try and do and experience different things. Listen to people, think about thing and try and understand different perspectives on things. This will help you so much intellectually and as I can tell you are already intelligent and independent I can tell you will be good at this.  Thing like not being surprised by things, people thinking you're emotionless could just mean that those around you are the opposite and you are calm and collected. We're all unique, each one of us, we all have our quirks. I wouldn't try diagnosing yourself as having a disorder, especailly at the young age of 20 when you're still trying to find yourself. If it helps you to know I have always found it difficult to understand why people are bothered by friends or family dying. At funerals I am usally quite blunt which hurts people. I'm just different I think because I didn't form any good relationships with my family. Not my fault, just because I was the youngest and my mum went to work while I was young and spend most of my childhood in the house on my own.  I deifnately care for people. I can't bare to see anyone suffering or in pain. I'm just not bothered about death, they're not suffering, so it's ok. My dad is similar, so maybe it's a genetic trait, but I don't worry about it. I think I know the reasons and it's not a problem. We're all different. I think there are many people are are different, but try to look like the norm to fit in.  About what you say about you finding it hard to get close to people, not trusting people and running away from them; this, again, suggests that you come from an unhealthy family or peer group environment that created you to be this way. Again, I stress that you need to meet new people, find a better envirnoment that will help you grow into a healthy person. Do this asap before you deteriorate. So, in short,  (1) Try and understand why you get moods, (eat, sleep, hormones, negative thoughts) keep analysing yourself and try to understand yourself and why you react to certain situations in certain way and think of healthier ways you would like to react. Try and stabalise your moods by living a healthy lifestyle and using healthy thinking.  (2) Change your environment to a healthy one for you. Fill your life and brain with healthy, intelligent and inspiring things.  (3) Experience and think about different people and environments and choose the best ones for you. Make sure you're not isolated. Find groups to be a part of that you like and enjoy being in.  (4) Be happy on your own and don't feel that is a bad thing. We're all on our own and it is important to realise this (many people find that painful to grasp).  Sorry if I'm repeating myself but I hope this helps.", 10788, "fQumqrdhaa", 0],
