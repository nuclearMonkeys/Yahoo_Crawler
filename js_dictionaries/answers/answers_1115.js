	61256 : ["Assuming that you are enquiring about ASL, and not some other \"tongue\", here it is in a nutshell: 1.  ASL is every bit a foreign language.  English is not the base for ASL.  ASL is compleatly different in structure than English; it has its own syntax and grammar.  We use many English terms, but we organize them, and use them, very differently than you do.  We do not simply trade Signs for English words--  tit for tat.  Signs have to be organized properly, according to ASL rules of grammar, in order to make sense. Here are just a few key differences between the two languages. *  ASL, of necessity, puts the Objects first  (English puts the Object last) *  ASL has no \"state of being\" Signs--  IS, ARE, WAS, BE, BEEN, et caetera *  ASL has no Signs for articles such as THE, A, AN *  ASL has no Signs for prepositions such as TO *  ASL has no Signs for conjunctions such as AND, THEN, OR, NOR, SO *  in ASL, we form plurals in many unique ways; we do not add \"S\" *  in ASL, adjectives and adverbs come after the noun--  as they do in French *  ASL doesn't use word endings such as -ing or -ed *  in ASL, to make a term past tense, use a \"time\" Sign or FINISH 2.  We usually use Signs, rather than fingerspelling, whenever possible, as it is more efficient.  We also have many special techniques for modifying Signs---  which does not work well with fingerspelling. 3.  There are not half as many Signs as there are English words.  Signs are created by Deafs and assigned to those things that we routinely talk about.  Less common things, things that we do not routinely talk about, are not given Signs.  Those words are fingerspelled and/or described using multiple Signs.  But Deafs quite often will not recognize the English word when you spell it.  If they don't, if they are not interested, you just have to let it go. Sometimes, we give a list of hints. BAMBOO--  I would Sign TREE + ASIAN + ROOT DEEP + GROW FAST, maybe adding FLOOR + LIGHT + NARROW PLANKS.  If I know someone who has a bamboo floor, I would say, \"You know; Becky have\".  They either know what bamboo is or they don't.   4. Proper names are fingerspelled. 5. We often fingerspell short words like CAR, even though there is a Sign, just because it is easy to do so. 6.  We often fingerspell words to emphasize them--  like I was EARLY!  Changing to the left hand also lends emphasis. 7. We fingerspell the words in a title. 8.  We don't use words like OXYMORON.  If you were to fingerspell that, no one would know what it means.  It is not relevant in the Deaf world. 9. Words like AMBIGUOUS, along with all idioms and slang, have to first be reduced to their basic core meaning.  (To my mind, the closest Sign to AMBIGUOUS is VAGUE.  I realize that that is not a perfect translation, but it is the closest one that I know.  You could also use CLEAR NOT and maybe MEANING DOUBLE.  It would depend on the statement.) 10.  We repeat key Signs twice to make them into nouns. Example: Using the same Sign--  Signed once =  SIT, and Signed twice = CHAIR. 11.  We \"inflect\", with the face and body, to distinguish between nuances--  like BIG and HUGE. 12.  Then there is a host of other unique techniques that we use to indicate appearance, size, location, movement, texture, relationships between things, and so forth.  I would not be able to explain that here and now!  This is a separate college study. That is just the tip of the iceberg.  It is GROSSLY oversimplified.  But you start to get an idea.  Poke around   , and you will learn a lot! I am Hard-of-Hearing, a native ASL Signer of thirty years, a nurse, a Sociologist, an ASL teacher, and an authour of various ASL media.  I have lived and Signed all over the United States, so I am well-versed in regional Signing.  It is my mission to dispel myths and urban legends regarding Deafs and ASL.

Then there would be class management considerations: being late, constantly rescheduling, having expensive test and \"licensing\" fees. Then there would be technical considerations: not having verifyable experience, not providing what was agreed on, no competence in the style.  I would expect the instructor to have some competency along similar veins as a personal trainer.  Does he have a set timeframe to skill benchmarks - like belts and sashes?

They select from the people interested those who uphold their values and pass on more than just the techniques but also their own philosophies, experiences, and life-lessons.   If you can find an intact traditional martial art that was transmitted as a whole from one generation to the next then you can learn so much more of value than the techniques of the style.  I'm the 7th generation of my style, which means what I've learned was the accumulated summary of the most important lessons, advice, and experience of 5 generations plus the valuable lessons modeled in my sifu's life.

	61262 : ["Sorry, I wrote a book... Traditional Marts are not dying per se as the others have focused on, but the training is... all over the place. Thanks to the mcdojo of the world, the training has almost completely disappeared. The current training styles are nothing like they used to be in the honestly traditional schools. This really can be attributed to by the 'want it now' mindset, and by the getting 'something for nothing' mindset. Both mindsets lead to (for impact sake) crappy instruction, and crappy quality of the art they are trying to learn or pass on.  People think they can pay $1,000 for a weekend seminar that guarantees them full-proof protected from any criminal advances, and they pay it. The issue people aren't understanding, mainly because they aren't told (thanks to great advertising) is they have a LIFETIME of instinctive reactions that they will revert to when forced under pressure. A 'weekend' of training consists of a few hours sitting while an instructor talks about situational awareness, and then they practice a few moves to take home with them so they FEEL better. Then while home a week or so later, a would be aggressor comes after them and they cringe and shriek and curl up in a ball instead of using what they were taught. So much for that $1,000 being a worthwhile expense.  Now, that individual will spew propaganda based on the uselessness of traditional martial arts, or any type of self defense class.  This same type of circumstance happens within the 'traditional martial art schools'. The students only learn kata for example, and never learn how to think in the mindset of the kata, or move in the nature of the kata. They never learn the techniques within kata that train these concepts. When they spar its the ridiculous slam dancing from fifty feet away. How on Earth can a person learn to defend themselves properly when they train this way?  The problem here lies in the first two mindsets I mentioned. These drive up insurance costs, breed uneducated people determining what is safe and what is extreme, propagate the 'my baby is too delicate for that' ideology, etc etc. That keeps the training from what it should be to what it is. As far as the mainstream is concerned that is what is happening to traditional martial arts and their respective training methods... (They are dying) However, that is only in the popular mainstream culture, which traditional martial arts are NOT a part of. Traditional martial arts were always a system in the dark, trained in secrecy, and with a moral and social attitude of being honorable and just.  Whether we'd like to admit it or not, morality and spirituality being taught alongside martial arts is not something new, and only recent of the 19th century. These ethical codes have been around since the early recordings of martial arts, (at least in the Asian systems). The martial arts were always connected with a religion, be it Taoism, Buddhism, Shintoism, etc and as such had moral codes to adhere to. This part of the training is also fading back into obscurity. The sport of MMA may have closer training methods in learning to defend oneself to that of the olden days, but it is (as previously mentioned) nothing new. It is just brought into the mainstream eye. This sport has done good (in it's crazed growth from a brutal 'prove it' match in '93 of any size any style to what it is now) of calling out the mcdojo of the world. This is something that 'we' traditional martial artists have been huffing and puffing about for decades. I personally am very glad of that fact, and hope it continues, but in a well monitored state. Unfortunately, the rest of the world, (the one that does not practice any form of martial art) is led by propaganda, and is so incredibly gullible that they believe the mcdojo to be all martial arts, and they believe the mma sports to be the 'true' ways of learning self defense. Thus 'traditional martial arts' are a waste of time, and mma gym and training is the way to go.  How sad and wrong (yet in some ways absolutely correct) they are about this situation. YES, those mcdojo are a complete waste of time, energy, and money. Yes, most mma gyms have better training methods... NO, that is nothing new, and nothing better than training in the correct traditional manner. Maybe, thanks to all of this wonderful propaganda, people... the gullible public, will begin to think, and they will realize that nothing good can be gotten without hard work, and hard work performed in the right way. Maybe, this will pull people out of those mcdojo, and force them to close down; or maybe it will force them to adjust and better their training methods.", 8114, "None", 6],

	61273 : ["I'm not an instructor of either style, but am a student of Japanese Aikido.  And this subject came up explicitly when I joined: refer to sensei as \"Sensei XXXX\" or \"XXXX Sensei\".  Never \"master\". In Taekwondo, a Korean style, most of my current and past instructors (maybe all?) are referred to as \"Master XXXX\".  I do not ever refer to them as \"my master\", but rather \"my instructor\".  As such, I use \"master\" as a title - a pronoun - but not otherwise a noun or adjective. Some refer to me as \"Master XXXX\", and I am quick to correct them \"Mr XXXX\" or just my first name. EDIT: Thanks JW!   Taekwondo founders came from a variety of backgrounds: military, college, etc.  The term \"Sabumnim\" can be used as generic \"instructor\", and typically refers to 4th dan and above.   Koreans tend to equate this as \"master\", as there was a time when 4th was the highest one could attain.  Certainly, when one reached the highest degree, one could then be a master, yes?  But of course, we've added in more degrees, and - not surprisingly - the term \"master\" stuck.  We have master carpenters, master chefs, master smiths, yes?  And attaining the title \"master\" in those respective professions took a long time - not that different than the then-4th dans. But today, we in TKD also have a tendency to be hierarchy-driven as well - particularly in larger schools whose kwan founder was in the military.  Each dan tends to have a meaning - like lieutenant, captain, major, etc.  It's not unheard of for 1st dans to be referred to as \"jokyonim\" (junior assistant instructor), \"kyosanim\" (junior instructor), \"bu-sabumnim\" (assistant or vice instructor), \"sabumnim\" (instructor), \"kwangjangnim\" (head instructor, grandmaster, headmaster), and chong kwangjangnim (chief grandmaster), yada, yada, yada.  You tend to find these in styles whose original kwans were military based. For comparison, in the US: - Master carpenter can take as little as 7 or 8 years - usually takes 20 years or more - Master technician requires about 4 years of study. - Master diver requires 40 dives. - Master mason - can take as little as 8 months - Master jewelers need at least 5 years of study - and about $40k of investment - Master electrician - at least 7 years as an apprentice, or, earn a BS in Electrical engineering - Master sommelier - they say only a few years minimum.  There are 201 master sommeliers in the world today. - You can be a chessmaster in a year - you just have to win a lot of tournaments - Master barber - around 4-5 years - Master chef - several years as an apprentice, then, qualify to take a test offered once a year.  There are only 100 in the world today. - Master plumber (in new york city) - minimum 10 years - Master blacksmith - at least 10 years So a title of \"master\" in different professions is valid - some are \"certified masters\" if they take a test.

So you and I both know that many of these questions are being posted by either those that don't train, Or, they do not know what a master is and thus assume or are wrongly told that their instructor is a Master. For what its worth none of my students refer to me as a master. Although I hold masters titles in several arts, I don't like to be called one. I know I have much to learn yet.  If we were to use titles we certainly would not use English titles such as Master. My students call me Sensei. When talking to others about training with me they may refer to me as their Sensei. In cases where the question is asked they will say that I am a master.  I was taught that when in a dojo training under a Master that the correct way to address him is Sensei. BUT, when outside the dojo to refer to him as Shihan, or what ever his correct title is in Japanese.   I find hearing young people refer to their instructor as Master distasteful. If we are going to wear Asian style uniforms, belts, and use Asian terminology for the techniques, style, ...etc then to use the term Master is just wrong.  Often here we also see people that supposedly study a Japanese, Korean or Okinawan martial art call their instructor a coach or trainer, and the place where they train a Gym.  Anyone that knows anything about correct Japanese, ...etc. terms knows that the Asian terms have a Deeper meaning. to call someone a coach when they are a Sensei, is condescending at best. Sensei is loosely meant to mean Instructor. BUT, its real meaning is not teacher or instructor. The meaning is more like \"He who has gone before\". Meant to indicate someone that is much more than just a teacher, instructor, on coach. The same holds true with the meaning of the word Dojo. It is not meant to be just a gym. It means Do-Jo, or Way-Place. Or more in the way we talk \"The Place where you learn the Way\".  Again meant to indicate a place that is special and much more than just a Gym.

Newer, watered down instructors have taken their place, in shopping centers usually in their multicolor, sweat suit looking uniforms trying to teach and motivate students that think coming to class for an hour twice or three times a week will give them great skill, knowledge, and ability.  Most students don't care to devote much more effort or time than that as they might have to give up golf or video games and what is even crazier is that they pay more for watered down training over the real thing much of the time. So martial arts has really transitioned and TMA has been largely replaced by what I refer to above for some of those reasons and all things do change really when you think about it.  There was just a question I answered this morning about boxing and the lack of legitimate boxing programs out there.  That trend started a long time ago as other sports became more popular and now most youth, young adults and adults look for traditional sports and things like aerobics, spinning, and cardio boxing and cardio kick boxing now for fitness and exercise.  That is not all bad though as most of them could not cut it in a real boxing gym or real TMA school and I send them down the road to the fluff and puff place if they are not cut out for my school.   How far this all transitions and causes TMA to shrink even more is hard to say but this trend has been happening for some time now.  Balance this and the way people view things and how hard they want to work at something, how much time they are willing to commit to it, and their reasons for taking it against some of the things common in TMA training at a high level like time commitment, sweat, hard work, maybe a little pain and physical discomfort at times, and other aspects really also puts TMA in this situation also to some extent.  Will it die completely?  I don't think so but I do think it will become very hard to find and even less common than what it is now.", 8114, "2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa", 5],
