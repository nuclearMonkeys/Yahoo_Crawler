A 300k engine has about had it, and no insurance company will warrant the life of it.

You have to be careful about that in hiring people who can do the work but not have the aptitude to be your competitor.  If that won't work, then you have to have a skill that pays well and you live at a standard of living far below it.  You invest that money saved and overtime it will become sufficient to provide for you.  Of the 3, the one most used is No. 1, believe it or not.
