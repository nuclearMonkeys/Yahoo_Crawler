Bangladesh had a very good run in 2009, and were competitive in the recently concluded ODI series, although they did not win any matches. Zimbabwe have a depleted side, thanks to the political situation there. And it will take some time for them to stand up again. 2. There are talents in both of these countries, but most of the players, especially Bangladesh, fail to utilize their talents to maximum extent.  Zimbabwe had quality players in the part, but at the moment, they are all just mediocre to average. From Bangladesh, Imrul Kayes, Tamim Iqbal, Shakib-ul-Hasan, Mashrafe Mortaza, etc. are very talented. Ashraful is talented, but he seems to have lost his way.", 8644, "wPlfPc0gaa", 0],

I am not sure how it can be explained. France may not find a way to qualify to the 2nd round. South Africa still does have a chance. I think South Africa and mexico will probably tie. 1-1. Referees help. I think the U.S. and England will also tie perhaps. 1-1 as well. I'm just looking at the probabilities but I hope both win. I'm still enjoying how Italy (cheats and divers) lost. Lol.

	71693 : ["South Africa outplayed England in 3 of the four test matches, and should have won the series 3-1 if they had the real killer instinct. England played well at Durban, but just didn't turn up at Johannesburg - which is appalling for a side representing their country.

Since God or Brahman is beyond the reach of senses, the Yogis subdue the senses and in the stillness of their Mind, they perceive the Bliss that is indescribable!  Had not the Siddhas told: கண்டவர் விண்டதில்லை; விண்டவர் கண்டதில்லை.. The ones who had \"seen'' (Read: perceived) it had not told it, the ones who had told (of) it had not seen it! Meaning that those who all speak about God had not seen Him, while those who had seen Him /It had not (been able to) described Him / It! Suppose you meet a person who had not ever seen the ocean, being far away from coast and he asks how big was it.. was it as big as the big lake in the neighbourhood or like the big roaring river flowin through another town.. It would be difficult to make him  comprehend a water spread upto the far horizon! Unless he is taken to a beach and shown the vast expanse of water, he would not be able to appreciate how it actually was! Even so, to make an existential entity to comprehend the one beyond sensory or man made tools of perception, would be pretty hard. Yogis only teach how to tame and calm the mind, so that one develops the subtle perceptions to experience the Divine! However realized saints like Paramhamsa Ramakrishna could make sincere aspirants to experience the Bliss of Divine communion, like he did to Swamy Vivekananda himself! A big magnet makes another iron piece in its proximity to get magnetic power too! But for that the iron piece should be free from rust cover (Read: blemishes of mind). So only the ones free from evil or able to get the 'charge' of divinity from saints!

If one were to completely cleanse the dust from ones mirror, one would eventually come to the realization that the mirror was no longer there. The mirror would have disappeared, vanished. When the mirror vanishes, there will be no reflection, and all that will remain is \"The One\". That is the essence of \"Self-realization\".
