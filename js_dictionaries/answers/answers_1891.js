	100290 : ["Man these people have no idea what they're talking about, under the bed and pillow are the 1st places people look. And who's going to rip up their floor? I've got a younger brother who's been stealing my weed for years and I've found the best places are usually right out in the open where someone wouldn't think to look.

	100292 : ["If it's an old house, a loose floorboard is the best. But in a newer one, just in a box because no one would think to look there. Like my diary is in this old box that used to hold Harry Potter books.", 9732, "W56zw6Zaaa", 1],
	100293 : ["British all the way!! (I'm proud to be an American but not in this respect). You forgot to mention The Zutons, Corinne Bailey Rae and The Libertines. But there are lots of great American bands. The problem over here is not lack of talent, it's the system of DJs being paid to play worthless junk instead of real music. If you want an idea of just how many great US bands are flying under the radar, check out The Village Green, The Black Keys, The Redwalls, Cold War Kids and The Shins. By the way, to be fair, you should also mention Queens of the Stone Age, The Raconteurs, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Strokes, The White Stripes and Sheryl Crow.", 9730, "dyWE56A9aa", 0],
	100294 : ["If I were to count down all the bands and divide them in this order, I would say British. But, it doesn't necessarily mean I like them more than American ones.

Other American bands are: Nirvana Foo Fighters The White Stripes Audioslave British: Arctic Monkeys Kaiser Chiefs Franz Ferdinand Queen The Beatles Moloko Muse Oasis Snow Patrol..etc. Too many.", 9730, "bhL5HcKAaa", 1],
	100295 : ["I really prefer any European Rock Music over American Rock Music.  Europe just seems more passionate about Rock, than America does about it. Favorite American Band: Nevermore Favorite British Band: Falconer I bet anyone could have guessed that from me.", 9730, "vFrnGtiDaa", 2],

(Arcade Fire <3 and also to the person who said it depends on the style of music... *warning, generalisation:* recently, american bands are channeling the 'emo/scene/pop punk' eg. paramore, fall out boy, panic at the disco, etc, whereas the uk are liking the retro-indie sound eg. maximo park, futureheads, cribs, etc. Anyway. Me? To answer your question: FAVOURITE AMERICAN BANDS: I * love* Green Day, yes, they are American. Killers are good, and so are the Strokes, but that's because they sound English :S FAVOURITE BRITISH BANDS: Arctic Monkeys, Libertines, Smiths, Cure, Joy Division, Bloc Party, Muse, Radiohead... WHICH DO I LIKE BETTER? I really do like both. See, my favourite band of all time are american, but the other 9 of my imaginary top 10 would be british. So it balances out??
