	33467 : ["None is overrated. DAN MARINO The quarterback's main job is to put the ball into the receivers hands. It's like saying that Jerry Rice wasn't a good receiver because he was a good pass-catcher but wasn't exceptionally fast or strong. Your proof goes both ways, the Dolphins won 8 playoff games during Marino's career and only 1 afterwards (in 22 years). Their record in games started by Marino was 147-93, and 159-177 since he retired. BARRY SANDERS I watched Sanders play on many Sundays, and by watching I don't mean flashbacks but watching full games, and his ability to break tackles and makes defenders miss was something I've never witnessed again. Barry Sanders actually did his job at picking up blitzes, especially when you talk about a 5'8, 200-lbs guy against 250-lb linebackers at full speed. And his receiving numbers are comparable to his HOF contemporaries Emmitt Smith and Terrell Davis (and average more yards per reception), Thurman Thomas was a better receiver than the other three but Sanders held his own. And about the line, I agree he had Lomas Brown and Kevin Glover but still...he had a 2053-yard season without Brown and when Glover was already 34, Glover played two more injury-plagued seasons before he finally retired.", 5090, "8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa", 3],
	33468 : ["You're wrong about Marino.  Both factually and analytically.  He was an all-time great QB whose quick release covered for his TEAM'S weaknesses.  He only played one year with a good defense and went to the Super Bowl in his first full year of starting (1984).  His OL gets talked up but it was Marino's release that protected them. If you want to say that Marino's success hurt the Dolphins because he kept them from being awful and doing the total team rebuild they desperately needed, that's an argument that could be made.  But Marino was amazing and did it with barely-NFL caliber supporting casts. Sanders you have a point, but not one that ANYONE is unaware of, and you massively overrate it's value.  Everyone already knows that Sanders' running style was high risk.  This was a thing he was forced to do because of the bad teams he was on.  Fontes stuck with the Run & Shoot long after it should have been obvious that it wasn't working.  Sanders was ROUTINELY met in the backfield by defenders.  Don't tell me how good two of his linemen were because I watched them play and Sanders constantly had to evade defenders in the backfield.  As a total unit, his offensive line was TERRIBLE.  And they used neither a TE nor a FB, but also most of their WRs couldn't block.  Sanders had to make every yard himself. If the Lions were a great R&S passing team that forced defenses to back off that might have been something, but no one feared Rodney Peete and the other collection of rejects Detroit marched out at QB.  Defenders routinely put more defenders in the box than the Lions could block.  And the Lions handed off ANYWAY and just asked Barry to perform a miracle every down.  And quite often, HE DID. Look at how Sanders performed when he got a competent offense installed near the end of his career with Bobby Ross.  A career high 2053 yards and a career high 6.1 ypc.  Why?  Because his blockers actually were coordinated as a TEAM and Barry wasn't asked to perform miracles to get 2 yards. You're ALSO wrong that he couldn't catch.  Certainly, he wasn't Thurman Thomas.  But Sanders wasn't a bad receiver, his offenses simply didn't ASK him to be a receiver.  His totals of around 300-400 yards receiving a year were better than average for RBs of that era.  And his catch % was actually right around 70% which is pretty comparable to Thurman Thomas.   I'd love to have seen what Sanders could have done had he been drafted onto a competent team with competent coaching.  Or to see what Marino would have done if he'd gone to one of the 80s superteams instead of the Dolphins who were an aging team under Shula on the verge of collapse when Marino was drafted.  But great players don't always go to great teams...and in football where performance is so team-dependent, separating that out can be tricky.  But these aren't that tricky.", 5090, "3Cd8Iq5gaa", 6],
