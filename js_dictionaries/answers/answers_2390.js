Focusing just on Him set me free and when He removed the \"hole\" that prevented me to connect to Him, my testimony made an impact to many of my friends and family.  God changed me to be a fulfilled and full of God's purposes in my heart.

They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 13. Their throat [is] an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps [is] under their lips: 14. Whose mouth [is] full of cursing and bitterness: 15. Their feet [are] swift to shed blood: 16. Destruction and misery [are] in their ways: 17. And the way of peace have they not known: 18. There is no fear of God before their eyes. Ecclesiastes Chapter 7 20. For [there is] not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. James Chapter 3 6. And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. 7. For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 8. But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Psalms Chapter 14 2. The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, [and] seek God. 3. They are all gone aside, they are [all] together become filthy: [there is] none that doeth good, no, not one. Romans Chapter 3 23. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 1 John Chapter 1 10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. Jeremiah Chapter 17 9.

And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 16.
