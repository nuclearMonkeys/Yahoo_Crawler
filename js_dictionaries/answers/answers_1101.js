In case you're reading this in what you perceive to be my voice, I'll try to explain my accent, 'cause most people'll assume I'm either ridiculously posh or proper \"Laaaandaaan\" Cockney. I'm not either. I probably speak sor' of like this, which is kindov like Cockney, bu' my accen's more posh like from London, it's just become a habbi' to leave of some endin's and random letters. Anyway, now we've got that sorted xD  I quite like the New York accent. My geography's awful so I'm not sure where NY is, but if I'm right it's somewhere in the middle-top part. Somewhere... :P And if I'm right, then the NY accent is what they speak in programs such as 'Friends' and 'How I met Your Mother'.  Canadian accents are okay, too. The \"Aw HELL naw\" accent just makes me laugh, it's quite nice to listen to though... In small doses;) There's only one accent I absolutely can't STAND, which is the Texas, down South, \"horse riding, country-singing, Hannah-Montana\" accent. It's beyond awful *shivers*.  I'm really sorry, I'm just being honest. That's only my opinion, and just because I don't like the accent doesn't mean the people can't be wonderful and very lovely, so please don't take what I said personally.  And I know you only asked about North America, but I thought I'd cover it all, 'cause as I said, my geography's really, really bad. And I'm sorry if I missed out any vital accents that \"everyone knows, duh!\". But it has to be said that often one of you guys'll forget that over here we have Welsh accents... And West-country... Yorkshire... Northern... Liverpudlian... Birmingham... The list goes on ;) Love, <3", 8076, "hgHboK2gaa", 4],

I don't really find any accent more appealing than any others- although I'm not a fan of the southern drawl. It just kind of annoys me (usually when people exaggerate it)", 8076, "dpSa5quXaa", 3],
	60550 : ["I think it's because some of us expect to be attacked and so are defensive about everything.Others of us are spiteful and if we feel we are in the inferior position kick the other guy in the shin and run off to report a violation of the guidelines. There is another group that seem to think that any difference of opinion is a direct affront to their intelligence and just talk to drown the other guy out. The least attractive of the reactive bunch are the arrogant ones, who think that a well placed insult is the ultimate weapon, but weep as little children when the insult lands on them. Most common, though, is probably the affliction of average intelligence, and the lack of training in critical thinking and arguments.

	60551 : ["Yes, for proof of the God of Israel please read below: The Judo-Christian God of the Bible is the One and True God because He is the only God that has withstood the test of time, science, history, and prophecies of the Bible. This can be seen through the Dead Sea Scrolls that were written over 2000 years ago; proving that it with stood the test of time because it matches up word-for-word of the Hebrew Bible today. Verses such as Leviticus 17:14 stating “For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.” and Isaiah 40:22 stating “It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:”. These verses in the Bible are proven to be scientifically true thousands of years after they were written! The Israelites being enslaved to the Egyptians 3000 years ago and the Israelites spending 40 years in the desert is historically accurate proving that the Bible stands the test of history. And the test of prophecy is being fulfilled right now by the world leaders discussing and making plans how on they, the leaders of the world, are able to unite the world through a global government and economy. This is written in the Bible in verse of Revelation 13:7 “And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” and in Revelation 13:16-17 “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”.", 8084, "IkeCzc4Yaa", -1],

I do love Canadian accents (maybe b'coz I have a lot of Canadian friends). It seems \"softer\" to listen to.

If it's the stereotypical one - in American films all British people sound like prim, posh tossers, in British films all American people sound like bimbos who can't enunciate - then no.  It mostly American English that annoys me. I like Minnesota (I think, is that where Minneapolis is? xD) accents, my favourite band had them and they've grown on me.  Some American accents just sound 'normal' to us because of television and stuff.  Most American tourists I meet have very annoying accents. Some have really nice, subtle accents though, so it depends on which bit of America they're from. Overall we don't like American accents anywhere near as much as you like UK accents, but they're ok.

	60564 : ["Actually these arguements have not been debunked.  Let me break it up: 1) Cosmological/First Cause arguement: Atheists use the following arguement \"Science has a limit, so we cannot describe what created the particles that created the big bang. Its not a contradiction, its a limitation.\" This arguement does not work because atheism does not allow 'christians' to use the same logic. AKA, atheists don't allow Christians to use the arguement \"God is outside the laws of nature, so we cannot describe how he did ___\". Same logic. 2)Fine Tuning Arguement: Actually, even atheist scientists are unwilling to say that the universe came about my chance (beause it would be too chancey) Athiests use the escape patch called the 'multiple universe theory' which makes chance more believable. However, the multiple universe theory has NO evidence to back it up, and thus atheists can't use it. 3) The holy book: Athiests say it is not reliable. However history shows otherwise. In fact, it is considered, by archeologists, to be one of the most accurate historical documents known to humankind. Historians have trusted many other historical documents with much less evidence to back up its reliability.  I could continue but I am tired....", 8084, "4O66TWORaa", 0],

As the gaseous remains of the “big bang” spread out Some of it became galaxies, stars, and planets v.3 Millions of years passed by. On the planets it rained and it rained v.4 Millions of years passed by. Some rocks dissolved into puddles, And this became the primordial soup v.5 Millions of years passed by. Something in the soup decided to be life v.6 Millions of years passed by. This “life” mutated and mutated and v.7 Millions of years passed by. this is where ALL life comes from!
