The climate cycle drives the carbon cycle.\"  Yes, in the natural cycle, CO2 does lag behind the temperature increase.  It is agreed among all climatologists that natural forcing does drive climate.   In past natural cycles, CO2 acted as a feed back mechanism, furthering the warming after other variables initiated it.  Now, CO2 that has been introduced UN-naturally assumes the same role it has performed in the past.....it raises temperatures.  The evidence for rapid climate change is compelling: Sea level rise Global temperature rise Warming oceans Shrinking ice sheets Declining Arctic sea ice Glacial retreat Extreme events Ocean acidification >>Now, Deutsche Bank   Climate Change Advisors, working with the Columbia Climate Center at the Earth Institute, Columbia University, reviewed the suite of skeptic claims \"that global warming is a hoax, natural, or good for people\" and found no evidence to support these contrarian positions. \"Simply put, the science shows us that climate change due to emissions of greenhouse gases is a serious problem. Furthermore, due to the persistence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the lag in response of the climate system, there is a very high probability that we are already heading towards a future where warming will persist for thousands of years.

I have been to a lot of good games; way more good ones than bad or mediocre ones partly because of Albert.  He is only one player though and the Cards still have a good team without him.  I am glad that prices at the ball park will not be going up also maybe because of signing him.   The other point I would like to make is that I hope the fans and the Angel's team stay and remain happy.  I doubt they will though as they are going to expect him to produce now and every year for that kind of money for the rest of his career.  They have no prior allegiance or love for him or his previous performance and I don't think they are going to be understanding or forgiving much when his numbers start to slip or he has a mediocre year like he did this past year with the Cards. At the same time I think Albert won't be very happy either as he has shown a certain amount of sensitivity to things in the past.  Will he be be any happier making 250 instead of 209 mil and with a fan base that boos him and a team and management that feel short changed because he is not putting up the numbers and is still being paid all that money?  I suspect not and money is not everything and I am willing to bet that there will be a lot of unhappiness down the road for everyone including Albert.  If he had stayed in St. Louis he could have burned down the Arch, beat his kids, and kicked his dog and the fans would still love him and is there really that much difference between 209 and 250 in the relative scheme of things?  I just don't see this as turning out all that well for him, the fans of the Angels, and the Angels team over the long run. The pitching he will be facing is tougher in the regular season right now, his numbers will slip some in the future and is a designated hitter worth 25 mil per year while it bankrupts the rest of the team down the road? At the same time I am glad for the team we still do have and the coaching and management-just look at their record the past twelve years.  Actually a bigger loss was Larussa in my opinion and I hope Albert and the Angels and their fans will be happy while he is counting his money but I doubt it.", 9103, "2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa", 1],

	82322 : ["Sorry to hear your question got deleted, happy to repost my original answer (thanks Gary for your offer of assistance, fortunatley it's not a problem for me to repost).  Original answer follows... Part 1:  “Human actions, most specifically our burning of fossil fuels, is leading to significant climate alterations, including but not limited to a significant rise in the average temperatures of the atmosphere, near surface, and oceans.” This can not be falsified as it's governed by fundamental laws of science, notably quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.  Some people might not like this, they may not even accept it, but the inalienable fact of the matter is that it's a universal and invariable certainty.  Any attempt to dismiss it would mean dispensing with the laws that govern the structure and characteristics of the universe. The use of the word ‘significant' is of course open to interpretation.  Some may feel that an increase of say 3°C in the average global temperature is significant whereas others may see this as only being  a small increase.  It depends on the larger context.  If you're talking in terms of timeframes of a few hundred years then it's very significant, primarily because it represents the fastest ever change in global temperatures in the known history of the planet. On the other hand, if you're referencing such a temperature change in the context of say a full ice-age cycle then it's a comparatively small change, representing as it does, about one tenth of the full cyclical temperature swing. Part 2: “Further, this rise (I believe somewhere between 2 and 5 degrees a century, at present estimates) will cause significant disruptions to both natural systems and human social organizations if unchecked” Again, we have the problem of quantification due to the inclusion of the term “significant disruption”.  Only a fool would deny that there has already been some disruption consequent to a changing climate, whether this is construed as being beneficial, detrimental, significant or otherwise is perhaps more down to individual interpretation and exposure to consequence than anything else. Due to a combination of atmospheric residence periods, global warming potentials, radiative forcings and volumetric concentrations of greenhouse gases coupled with more thermodynamics and QM, it is an unassailable fact that the underlying and running mean global temperature has to increase.  Only the introduction or unforeseen enhancement of an opposing mechanism or consequence could negate this. On the basis that such an event, whist having a very low probability, can't be categorically ruled out, then there is potential for falsification of the claim but only insomuch as it would require the introduction of a concept alien to the original discussion. The referencing to a rise of “between 2 and 5 degrees a century” can not be falsified because the statement has been qualified by stating “at present estimates” and is therefore factually correct.  Given that these estimates may change in time and that real world observations in the future may be outwith these parameters, it may therefore transpire that the figures are indeed shown to be erroneous, but not in the context in which they are used here. Given the nature and content of the text you quoted and that it isn't well bounded or contextualised then provision for partial falsification exists.", 9102, "AA10993476", 3],

	82329 : ["Using actual observational data, Lindzen & Choi, 2009 demonstrated that the climate sensitivity to a doubling of pre-industrial CO2 is ~0.5°C. Using actual observational data, Spencer & Braswell, 2010 demonstrated that the climate sensitivity to a doubling of pre-industrial CO2 is ~0.6°C. CO2 has an atmospheric residence time of ~15 years. ~60% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions are taken up by carbon sinks. This fraction has been relatively constant since ~1850 (Knorr, 2009). Humans put about 8 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. That equates to a bit less than 4 ppmv. If carbon sinks take up 60% of the anthropogenic CO2 each year and the sinks don't know when the CO2 was emitted... By 2006, only 0.0000013 ppmv of 1991's emissions of 2.9 ppmv remained in the atmosphere. From 1991-2006, humans put 51.2 ppmv of CO2 into the air. The annual 60% decay rate took all but 2.5 ppmv of that 51.2 ppmv out of the air. Plant stomata and Greenland ice cores both show that CO2 levels have routinely been between 330 ppmv and 390 ppmv during the Holocene, during interstadials of the last Pleistocene glaciation and during the previous interglacial (Sangamonian/Eemian). The carbon cycle does not drive the climate cycle. The climate cycle drives the carbon cycle. Man and all of his carbon emissions falls into the noise level. Even if we assume that mankind was responsible for all of the CO2 above 350 ppmv, the climate sensitivity (0.304°C) to 390 ppmv is statistically indistinguishable from the climate sensitivity (0.210°C) to 350 ppmv. That's a difference of 0.094°C - A number too small to accurately measure... The RSS and UAH interpretations of the satellite data routinely differ by more than 0.094°C.", 9101, "CPHd5xS9aa", -3],

This part is easily tested by measuring the isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The hypothesis is not falsified by the isotopic data. 3. The temperature should rise between 2 and 5 degrees (K) per century. The observed rate of increase is consistent with the hypothesis. If the rate of increase were significantly lower in the next 3 decades, the hypothesis could be falsified. 3. The hypothesis can be falsified by showing that there are not significant disruptions to natural systems. If it can be shown that a majority of the earth's ecosystems have the same types of species in the same abundance as a pre-industrial reference period then there is no effect and the hypothesis is falsified.
