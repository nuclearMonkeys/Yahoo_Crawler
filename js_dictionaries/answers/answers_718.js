I suggest you eat an hour or two before you go to sleep so your body can have time to digest. And know your limit.

	40036 : ["Being communist or what has nothing to do with \"what is happening in Russia\". Physically, President Putin is building. Laying foundations, welding steel, pouring asphalt, laying bricks, casting concrete prefab. Putin is doing all this with Russia's wealth. He is growing tomatoes, cucumbers, even roses 24/7/365. Yes, year round even when snow covers the hothouses in which these crops grow. We have a TEN ACRE (4 hectare) rose operation just outside our city. President Putin's projects hire Russian labor. Russian oil makes fuel and asphalt as well as an export commodity. Russian clay becomes bricks, laid by Russian stonemasons. Russian steel, mined and smelted with zRussian labor builds skyscrapers, high rise housing, Ladas, Nissans, Renaults, Chevrolets, UAZs, and many other cars. What is going on is a country is running. Children are loved, not an 18-year problem, educated, and life goes on. No gunz are on the street to randomly cut down innocent people. Only outlaws have handguns... and they are few. President Putin gets my credit for doing all this because Gorbachev maybe didn't take time to do it, Yeltsyn DID NOT do it, but 20 years of Putin IS DOING IT basically since day 1.", 5875, "AA11835015", 1],

	40040 : ["All you need is a good travel guide book, ideally one for each country you want to visit - just to clarify, Europe is NOT a country, it's a continent. These are available for free in local libraries, and once you've figured which of the 44 countries in Europe you want to visit, buy travel guide books for those and keep them with you when you travel.  You just need to organise flights and possibly tourist visas, depending on the countries you're travelling to - most don't require visas for Americans visiting for a couple of weeks, but it's as well to check.  Depending on the time of year you're travelling, you might need to organise accommodation in advance. There are lots of good websites for this, I've used www.hostelworld.com for budget accommodation.  If you're thinking about renting a car, be advised that there are age restrictions. Car hire companies will not take on anyone under or over a certain age. But most European countries have very good rail and bus services, and if it's good enough for Europeans, it's good enough for you. ", 5877, "95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa", 1],

Momondo.com is a good place to start. Words of advice: - It's not a good idea to drive around in the big cities. Take the metro, taxis, buses instead. - You'll need a pin code for your credit card - Don't exchange huge amount of cash, use your credit card, but make sure to look up fees, especially for ATM's - There are some cities where you have to watch out for pickpockets.

Babylonian captivity = 73 year captivity. 3 year Apocalypse was served in Russia under miniantichrist Lenin. Commies will officially come back; then China attacks Russia; then WW3; then resurrected saint Seraphim of Sarov shows new Ruski Orthodox Tsar; this tsar will slay traitors inside church and gov't. If there are 300 bishops, then 297 will be executed while 3 will be left to live. Ecumemism = all religions getting together to praise Satan = 263 heresies. Modern documents are from Satan; burn them. To escape mark of the beast, hide within a small group (10-15 people); no documents; no electronics so that you won't be tracked. Alaska will be Russian like Kaliningrad is. So, hide in Russia's north (a little bit away from coasts because of manmade tsunamis and H2S stinkjob). So like 100 km away from Moscow because it will sink. If you're in America, migrate to Russian Alaska (away from coasts). Again: no electronics once you hid because antichrist will be shown on broken unplugged TV set from 1970s because of Tesla's ether; forgive me.", 5878, "None", -3],
