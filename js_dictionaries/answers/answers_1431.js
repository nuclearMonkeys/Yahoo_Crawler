What about his other documents.... oh yes.. he said he didn't keep any...what is that?  We know of some of his ear marks in the US Senate and he kickbacks he gets from them. Such as $8MM request to go to Univ of Chicago where his wife works at the VP of Community Affairs .... oh, and by the way .... she was making $121k per year before he was in the US Senate .... once in the Senate.... she now makes $350k per year.....what is up with that?

Memorial Day is a day for remembering and honoring military personnel who died in the service of their country, particularly those who died in battle or as a result of wounds sustained in battle. While those who died are also remembered on Veterans Day, Veterans Day is the day set aside to thank and honor ALL those who served honorably in the military - in wartime or peacetime.  Veterans Day has its origins early in the 20th century. In November 1919, one year after the armistice ending World War I went into effect, President Woodrow Wilson declared November 11 as the first commemoration of Armistice Day with the following words: \"To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nationsâ€¦\" jrb", 8875, "751fb24335cd22bded43998794933810aa", 2],

	77211 : ["Not all non-Catholic Christians believe works are not necessary. Some believe and continue to follow the word as written concerning salvation. The idea that works are not necessary to complete salvation stem mostly from Southern Baptist theology. They say that anyone who relies on works denigrates God's grace, falling back on the need to live by law, instead. Anyone who loses his salvation was never saved at all. To a great extent they are correct, but they fail to see that living with the Holy Spirit prompts one to do good works. Denying those works denies the leading of the Spirit, placing man in the position of becoming his own god once again. That is what started the whole mess in the garden and God never gave us a plan to continue living in sin. After turning to Jesus for help he told people, \"Go and sin no more.\" The salvation he granted from their immediate circumstances could easily be thrown away by wrong actions. It is the doctrine \"once saved always saved\" that causes confusion. We can continue living with the Holy Spirit or we can turn away. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the only unpardonable sin because Christ will not die again. There is such a thing as gratitude that we express to one another but so many times we deny that same sentiment to God. As was already pointed out, Noah could have had all the faith in the world. Without the work he would have been lost. Just as Noah was saved through the waters of the flood, we are also saved through the waters of baptism.

	77213 : ["This is the best photography course online:     You can be like the masses of humanity and buy a camera you can afford that has auto this and that for worry free picture taking. And learn through trial and error how to use something like aperture or shutter priority auto modes or even attempt to use the thing on full manual mode.  You seem to know already there is some thinking to using a camera and to take pictures. A good place to start is by reading the owners manual that comes with a camera. Read the information and look at the illustrations with part names and look at the real camera. Handle the camera and take pictures. Let me rephrase that. Take pictures to learn how to use the camera and maybe even to keep some. Don't start with important stuff you cannot photograph over again such as birthdays, a toddlers first steps. That puts picture taking out of the learning phase and puts the pressure and emphasis to taking pictures for real and to keep.  These first pictures are for you to learn how to use your camera. And you have learned how to use your camera when you can take pictures with it and can teach others how to use it. Honest. You can also go to a college in your area and take a beginning photography course. There you will be taught the basics even a pro must learn and do in their work. Camera handling and use, taking exposures with film and/or digital cameras, and maybe even some photo assignments to get some real time learning. In this learning do not take serious pictures you must keep as that detracts from the learning aspect of the class. Do so only if you have mastered the use of your camera before class is over.  It's like growing up in a way. And I am happy you know there is a way to learn how to use a camera and take pictures. It's like learning how to drive I suppose. Someone can teach you or you can get taught at a driving school. Both will get you a drivers liscense.

	77220 : ["   You do not want to do that, period.    There are several reasons why ;    1)   W98 is so far outdated that no hardware drivers can eb found for it anymore. Risks losing video, audio, and all other hardware.    2)   WinME is basically the newest version of W98 and below. If it ran 98, it will run ME. ME can be bought several hundred places for under $10.00 per disc - But see #1 above also.    3)   The hardware supported by XP will completely choke to death any version of 98. RAM support for 98 is under 512Megs, hard drive support maxes out at only 4Gigs (FAT32 even), and video cards will run faster than the CPU speeds 98 was built to run on.    If You downgrade to 98 You will not only downgrade Your OS, but everything else inside the case.
