On my 22 inch screen, my word documents have enough room to show two columns of text, so it's far easier to find something in a longer document.

	58553 : ["AMD RX 5000 series cards had a lot of problems until driver version 20.4.2 which came out April of last year. After that, there really haven't been any problems. There are a lot of people who make comments about computer tech but they're not up to date with what's going on in the tech industry.  The Radeon RX 5000 series is based on a brand new architecture, which took AMD several months to work out all of the bugs on the Driver level. The RX 6000 is a refresh of the RX 5000 series. I haven't heard of any Driver level problems with the 6000 series as of yet. Both brands have a good and a bad side. As far as Nvidia goes, The talking heads on Youtube will tell you that 8gb or 10gb of VRAM is enough but it won't be here in a couple years. AMD's RX 6000 series cards might come with a decent amount of VRAM but the Nvidia RTX 3000 series cards are better with Ray Tracing. In 2-3 years you will probably see more games that gobble up VRAM and these games will be able to make good use of Ray Tracing. Power efficiency between the RTX 3000 and RX 6000 series is about the same. AMD gained a bad rap with messed up drivers for the RX 5000 series cards and the power efficiency of some of their past GCN cards like the Vega 64 and R9 390x was pretty bad. AMD has done a lot to shore up the gap with the RX 6000 series cards. If you can somehow manage to get an RX 6800 for around $600 then that would be a good buy.", 8110, "210366f079220c727fec4c0249d14085aa", 1],

	58558 : ["You have two types of slot - the orange and the small white is a PCI-e slot, the lower 2 white slots are PCI slots. You can discount the PCI slots these are considered legacy slots. There are plenty of PCI-e cards. Your choice of PCI-e graphics card depends on what you are wanting it for and the power needed to run it. For general use such as watching videos, web surfing, office work then a cheap low power card would be fine. For gaming it probably isn't worth adding a graphics card as the rest of the machine hasn't the power or performance to keep up with a gaming graphics card.

	58564 : ["The minimum size for a partition is based on the purpose of that partition.  Many OEM Hard Drives have a \"Recovery\" partition set aside for the storage of System Recovery files, and in some cases I think it is as small as 1 GB (Gigabyte).  50 or 100 GBs might make a bit more sense from a practical standpoint, given the storage requirements of modern Operating Systems including those of Microsoft Corporation and the many, many dozens or hundreds of \"flavors\" of the Linux O.S. A partition is simply a set aside space, so without more context, your question reads a bit like asking, 'What is the minimum size of a Spare bedroom on a house?'  Is it going to have only 1 spare bed, a Twin bed, or does it need a small desk, a dresser and \"room\" to turn around while doing the Hokey Pokey?", 8113, "qZE0OSqqaa", 2],
