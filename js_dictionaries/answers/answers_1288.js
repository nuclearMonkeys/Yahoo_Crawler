Just remember, when and if you do start calling Kate, Mom, just remember she can and never will take the place of your real mother. Same with David or their real father.  They know that. They will love you just the same. It is just a title to give them. So if she/he treats you/them right, and you feel comfortable enough to say Mom and Dad, then go ahead.
