IMO a good cycle can happen.  I just recently had to replace it - but that was due to pressure from everyone since I'm 39 and had yet to own a brand-new car (My car previous was a 1991 Subaru wagon and I had this Avalon since 2008, where it was already pretty old by then even). Throughout the years until just earlier this month I did occasionally mull buying a new car... but always flaked out since I loved not having a payment and - one day my mom conversing with a salesman goes 'I don't know why he wants a different car since his is running just fine...'

Ear size correlates with temperature. Jackrabbits (actually hares, as are domestic \"rabbits\") have rather large ones, which dissipate excess heat. Snowshoe hares, which live in the Arctic, have shorter ears, which conserve body heat. There are several differences between hares and rabbits. It's been more than half a century since my last course in mammalogy but I vaguely remember that they differ in whether they dig their own burrows and whether they are born altricial (needing care to survive) or precocious (ready to go).

You never get two wearings out of your clothes except pants; everything else has dried sweat on it. Dark and rich colors fade if you spend time outside, even on days it's not hot.

You can easily break a sweat walking fifty feet to the mailbox.

I had a lot of nosebleeds when I lived there. You do get acclimatized to some degree, so you can tolerate the heat.
