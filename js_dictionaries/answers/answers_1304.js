You empty glass bottles from all that extra   bubbly, plastic bottles, your   cards and wrapping paper.  Limit the food you buy so that its not wasted and compost the leftovers or feed them to the birds/your dog or something like that. Either buy an artifical tree that you can reuse year after year or even better buy a real one with roots and replant it each year in the garden. Dont buy new decorations every year, stick to ones that are special to you and your family like nannas old glass decorations or babys first   decorations and other special ones like that. to fill in any gaps make decorations you can eat, cookies and sweets. Yum, use   spices in the recipies and they even make your room smell nice!! (saves on pine fresh   tree smelling sprays! lol) Use energy saving lights with LED bulbs. Shut your doors and make sure the seals on your windows are decent to cut down your heating bills, dont use a tumble dryer where possible dry your clothes on a radiator. Same goes all year round!! :) Re use gift bags, dont use foil wraping paper, walk or take the bus to the shops if possible, Take your own reused carrier bags or a shopper when doing your buying for   food and gifts, Dont put your fruit and veg from the suermarket in the little plastic bags to seperate it use paper to wrap them or something else (maybe a new use for your old giftbags! hehe) As tempting as it is to have the TV on constantly watching all those   specials and films havent you probably seen most of them 100 times before?

Also iliminates the need for the spare drinks fridge we use during the summer The perfect gift for a 'eco warror' :) pay for their car CO2 emitions to be nutralised through this website -   or give a gift tree. Buy a film renting subscription for the movie nut in your family rather then a bunch of dvds, wind up torches and phone chargers make good and unusual gifts. Use ebay for gifts! it saves things going into the bin and saves you money in the prosess. If your thinking of buying a silly novilty gift for someone dont, chances are they will just throw it away, which brings me to another great tip Freecycle unwanted   gifts - www.freecycle.org  Limit the packaging on everything you buy and if it has to be packed then make it recyclable packing. Lets be fair you cant not buy your childs dream toy because it has a lot of packing around it. 'Sorry jimmy bob,   didnt bring you the space rocket you wanted, there was to much packaging on it' Na!

	70821 : ["I dont agree with u on Sri Lanka or any of India's immediate neighbours. Have a neat look at India's played matches in last 3-4 years on cricinfo by clicking on past concluded series. Lanka doesnt come to India every year. Lankans were winners of 1996 World Cup. I doubt how many people considered India as a real team before it won the 1983 World Cup. In 2007 world cup India has lost the match to bangladesh. India have been unable to win a test series in Lanka after Azhars' team won in 1994. It is Australia who is invited by BCCI to play in India every year in some or the other form of cricket and having a good practice on Indian pitches and Indian spin bowling. That serves as a preparation for 2011 WC to be held in subcontinent and future test series in India.  In return Aus invites India to Australia only once in 4 years and that too keeping a loaded schedule of tests followed by one dayers. Before the first tests starts against India in Aus, very few practice games are kept. The first test is held at venues like Melbourne or Brisbane where Aussie pacer bowlers will take Aus 1-0 up in the series. But here BCCI gives practice games for visiting Aussies, doesnt keep one dayers mixed with tests, allows non retired Aussies to play in IPL before India tour (like they did in april 2008) and even makes green tops like the one that was made in Nagpur test of 2004. India-Aus series held in India are of no use (even if INdia wins ) to India compared to for Aussies. The test series held in October 2008 was won by India 2-0. Still the test match venues had poor attendance of spectators. BCCI can afford to scrap India-Pak series after Mumbai bombings. India-pak matches are so popular and money making that even countries like Canada and emirates wanted to host them. Australian cricket board also doubts the popularity of  and money made from India-Aus series as it invites India to Aus only once in  4years. India-England series like the Natwest trophy of 2002 was also a huge hit. English counties invite many Indian, Lankan and Pakistani players to get cricket practice in summer when cricket is not played in subcontinent. I agree with u that India should focus on other 9 countries too . India should plan their future tour schedule in such a way that no opponent team outside the subcontinent gets frequent and too much exposure of bowlers and pitches in the subcontinent and home advantage is taken completely because Australian cricket board will never give that frequent exposure of its wickets and bowling style to any  opponent team and will always ensure that in Australia it is Australia who will take 100% home advantage and only Australia. Stop inviting Australia to play cricket in India every year. Sachin, DRavid , Laxman and Sehwag have a good record against Aussies. Bhajji is still a headache for Ricky and his team mates. Sehwag has a good record against Pak and SA too. They dont need Bangladesh or Lanka to score runs and get in form. Dont underestimate any opponents as minnows or underdogs.  Australia had just managed to win the test last played in bangladesh and that was due to Ricky's hundred in the 4rth innings.", 8597, "98634fbc821254395379a835475e6453aa", 0],

They've had a bad summer to be honest, apart from the T20 wins, they couldn't dominate a strong England line up during the ODIs and Tests. Plus the world cup final loss is something to reflect on and the Aussies. To be honest, I think there maybe a reason behind this, it maybe the captaincy taken up by Thilakarante Dilshan, ever since he took it up, we haven't won any series apart from the T20s against the Aussies. Sanga was a far better captain, having made the right decision and he himself is a role model, has experience and is calm headed on the field.

What I reckon should happen is all teams play a 3 test series against each other every year.  One year the teams will play at home and then the other year they'd play away.
