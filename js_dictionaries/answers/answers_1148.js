	62901 : ["This is probably the most excited I have been about one of their releases (keep in mind I wasn't alive during the time they were popular) From reading the previous answers I can tell that they have not heard or previewed the album. Luckily, I have been able to hear parts of it and I am telling you it is what most Doors fans have been waiting for. Firstly it is an early year concert which hasn't been too released or shown. Don't get me wrong the later year concerts are good too but they are lacking something that the earlier concerts had. In this the band is fresh and just has this unmatchable energy and spirit that was broken by all of the crap that they went through. Compared to Boston this is pure gold, better than gold. Even compared to Pittsburgh it is obvious that this is so much better. This has truly been a release that the true fans have been waiting ages for; I actually never thought that it would be released but fourtantly I was wrong. Everyone speaking badly about this album has no clue what greatness it holds, but they'll realize after they hear it. It is unrelated but the album will be released one week after something really horrible happened to me so it is nice to finally be able to look forward to something.  My favorite song: Not to Touch the Earth   ", 8191, "pljzOzReaa", 10],
	62902 : ["When they blatantly change their sound knowing it'll make them more money. Here's an example: Megadeth's albums were all thrash metal until they released Countdown For Extinction. They went for a more tame approach with this album but even though alot of their fans might have been pissed off the songs were a bit more sing a long but not in a \"we've sold out theme\" Green Day were a raw punk band in the 90's. A little maistream but had alot of respect from rock/metal fans. Then they took a hiatus for a while and released the brilliant Warning. It didn't sell too well so they took a seat and thought hmmmm, lets get rich. So they enlist the help of studio execs to make songs to target \"rebel teens\" and violla you have the \"emo\" American Idiot!!", 8189, "HNmO2ZwXaa", 2],
	62903 : ["THE PROPER SUBJECTS FOR AN ARREST was the name of I group that I heard when I was in high school back in the 1960's. I haven't heard much of them since... Maybe their name was not a good idea.... Maybe their music was so bad that they actually got arrested... Anyhow, a dumb name like THE BEATLES made it, and I do not need to elaborate upon this name any further... or name any of their famous songs. The name is important. The appearance of a band is important..But the things that really counts are the songs and the music blended with a little courage to be different...", 8189, "None", 1],

	62914 : ["I am like you. People listen to the heavy themes of John Lennon and are blown away. But Paul had a point of view and his words were more uplifting. I have always felt that John's work was not as good after Yoko, because she wanted to be a part of his creative process. Paul, on the other hand has continued to be successul with his music after the Beatles break-up. Like so many groups, they were the sum total of all their individual talents, and it is a shame that they could not stay together for another 10 years. The works that could have come from the total creativity they possessed. Perhaps, in a way, the group dynamics led each to pursue their individual talents, and return as a tight band.", 8190, "None", 0],
	62915 : ["this was a compilation album that was put together to make money by Allen klein and Apple corps as they had negotiated an improved royalty rate and wanted to capitalise on this.

	62925 : ["That's when a band starts putting out material that is intended to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Very often, that means a change in the musical style so it alienates a lot of their fans. An example of that could be \"American Idiot\" by Green Day.
