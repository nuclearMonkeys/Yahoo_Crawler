You might think by over reacting you are being cool- no, you are acting like illiterate who doesn't know anything despite of his parents providing him an education. You have no knowledge. I bet you have no intention to have knowledge. We have our own country from our own hardwork and sweating- Mr Jinnah- Father of nation. Full name Mohammed Ali Jinnah. We didn't need anyone's favour, he became a barrister and devoted his life to us otherwise you would have been a slave now! His sister- who supported him all his life- Fatima Jinnah and she inspired him to  write great quotes on women. Read them on brainyquote website. Hindus rape- Female foeticide in India. Population imbalance causing many men to stay unmarried. They have rituals of dowry, \"rakhi\" a band to be on brother's wrist for him to be protective. \"karwa chaud\" hindu women fast for their husbands. We only fast for Allah all equally. Their is the biggest Patriarchy mindset in the society. In India, Amir Khan (muslim respected celebrity) made a show that brought justice and showed the truth and shocking truth that happens everyday of aborting baby girls secretly without mothers permission with greedy doctors using code language of Goddess for girl and God s name for baby boy. Watch any hindu show you will see how much the God expect the woman like Goddess parvati to suffer, tolerate and go through even as a mother. She is always seen crying and saying sorry for almost everything.I am not completely against their religion as they show ma kaali- fierce goddess- powerful mother's love and feminine power but India is dangerous for women. We still respect other religions and never have bad intention against anyone with our big hearts. These are my natural values and from my grandpa who died from heartattack when my mum was 8 but he had  a big heart and has done favors to settle many families lives whose future generations willl continue to live happily.", 8059, "GoHVVnT1aa", 0],

I love the manga more than the anime and have sort of - separated them and liked them differently. So the fact that they're going to make the manga into another anime - I hope it's good.... Also curious *how* they go about doing that since the manga and anime are mainly similar in the beginning... Will they start again? Or just go 'after episode so and so'... Hmmm... Also they're going to be lot of irritated-worried people who're pretty possessive of the manga (it is honestly better) and worry about it being 'ruined' in the process. Lots of excited people too of course :) This of course means that the manga will end by next year or so - definitely before the new anime... sob. Ah well.

Stay FAR away from anything by Silver Ravenwolf. Best of luck to you on your path. EDITED TO ADD: Contrary to what another poster has written, Wicca and Christianity do NOT mix.

	60056 : ["Yes.  Zen Buddism IS Buddhism. Buddhism is when you believe enlightment can be attained through meditation, self-contemplation, and intuition rather than through faith and devotion.", 8068, "None", 0],
	60057 : ["Zen is a school of Buddhism. Dhyāna is the Hindu name, \"Chán\" in modern Chinese, \"Zen\" in Japanese, \"Seon\" in Korean, \"Thien\" in Vietnamese, and \"Samten\" in Tibetan. It's difference to other schools is placing paramount importance on meditation and experiential wisdom. It is said there are 3 rules in Zen 1) Pay attention 2) Pay attention 3) Pay attention First you must pay attention, then perceive that which is paying attention, finally you must Observe the perceiver of that which is paying attention. That is a bit confusing, don't worry if you don't get it. Another way of looking at it is when you put on some music for enjoyment. At first there is a listener and a sound, but later as you become absorbed in the music, there is no listener and there is no sound there is just the hearing. That non-dual state of consciousness where you and the universe are one and not separate beings is the \"No-Mind\" that Buddhists seek.  The problem with explaining Zen is that we are forced to use words, and all words are just symbols and not reality. it is like confusing the map with the terrain or mistaking a menu for food. Zen is an experience, rather than read a book it is better to sit down and pay attention.  If you have never meditated before, then please sit with your back straight you can do this on a chair. Keep your head up so that your throat is open. Then just breath and pay attention to your breath. Doing this will give you a greater understanding of Zen than merely reading an answer. Your own insight will help you far more than any teacher outside yourself.  A Hindu story  tells of a fish who asked of another fish: \"I have always heard about the sea, but what is it? Where is it?\" The other fish replied: \"You live, move and have your being in the sea. The sea is within you and without you, and you are made of sea, and you will end in  sea. The sea surrounds you as your own being.\" In the same way people live in 'sea of awareness' (or Zen) but ask what is Zen. _()_  ", 8068, "8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa", 4],
	60058 : ["\"Zen Buddhism believes that the Law isn't something you can teach, that as soon as you explain the Law it's not Law anymore, and that there's no Law that can be taught, you just have to figure it out intuitively. That's why Zen can't teach any Law today. The Zen Buddhist Bodhidharma spread this idea, and it was based on one thing Buddha Shakyamuni said. Shakyamuni said, “no Law is absolute.” So he founded the Zen sect based on that statement from Shakyamuni. We'd say the sect is going down a dead end.\" A portion of the section “Different Levels Have Different Laws” is copied above, from the Zhuan Falun Lecture on the web. You can find out more discussion about Zen Buddhism there. Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist Schools. Falun Gong is based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance.

[Qur'an 5:32] You may fight in the cause of GOD against those who attack you, but do not aggress. GOD does not love the aggressors. You may kill those who wage war against you, and you may evict them whence they evicted you. Oppression is worse than murder. Do not fight them at the Sacred Masjid, unless they attack you therein. If they attack you, you may kill them. This is the just retribution for those disbelievers. If they refrain, then GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful. You may also fight them to eliminate oppression, and to worship GOD freely. If they refrain, you shall not aggress; aggression is permitted only against the aggressors. (2:190-193) Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors. (2:190) Except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you, their hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you or fighting their own people. And if Allah had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not made for you a cause [for fighting] against them.

While some feel the movie wrapped up the story line, I felt there are so many questions left unanswered.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see the movie and does want to see it. I just know there are so many more FMA stories for both Ed and Al plus there is no reason the franchise couldn't be multi-generational (e.g. include Ed and Al's children). Of course one of the issues is how Ed reconciles human energy being the energy alchemy uses, but I think having it cycle back is one solution.  In fact, this topic could make a wonderful movie and prompt Ed and Al to return to their world.  By closing the portal (oh, here I go with the spoilers, sorry . . .) they disrupted the energy flow and now must correct it or else all life ends for both worlds.

	60069 : ["1) Absolutely. She is incredible. 2) Bad Romance, definitely her most EPIC song ever. Followed by Poker Face and Paparazzi. 3) When Just Dance came out, I thought she was just another pop star one hit wonder with no talent, but then Poker Face came out and it was amazing and I watched her live performances, which blew me away. But I really became a little monster when Paparazzi and Bad Romance came out. Those two music videos are my favorites. 4) I love her style. She pushes boundaries and she doesn't care what people say or think. She's fearless and proud of who she is and expresses herself in many ways, one of them being her fashion.  5) Most people don't realize that her message of being \"born this way\" and her fight for gay rights is genuine and she really puts her money where her mouth is. She was the biggest philanthropist of last year and she fights for gay rights not by saying \"do you ever feel like a plastic bag\" but by actually going out and making speeches and videos urging for political action against Don't Ask Don't Tell and fighting for the legalization of gay marriage. Her charities range from helping homeless LGBTQ youth to fighting worldwide HIV/AIDS to most recently helping Japan. 6) She's herself, and she is a true artist in every sense of the word. The lyrics, the melodies, and even usually the production comes straight from her. She's not about catering to the present trends, she's about making future trends and bringing us the future of music and artistry. 7) I love that she loves her fans and really fights for them and is genuine in her message. She recently ended a deal with Target about her new album because they had donated to anti-gay organizations. She doesn't just say what she believes in, she fights for it, and her music is amazing. 8) One of her lyrics in Future Love goes \"My hair is blonde, but my heart's brunette\" and she dyed her hair because she was often mistaken for Amy Winehouse. I think she looks beautiful either way. She's beautiful in her way and she was BORN THAT WAY :)", 8062, "AA11728902", 0],

Wicca is actually a 'goddess religion' and most frequently you will find the goddess called Gaia, which is 'the earth goddess' ... most Wiccans do NOT 'do spells' or any form of 'magick' ... they use herbs and parts of trees for healing both injuries/wounds, and minds.  They are very gentle people and both female and male people can be wiccans.
