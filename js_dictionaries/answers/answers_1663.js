	88831 : ["Separtation Animals in Bible Separating the sheep and goats (Matthew 25:31–34, 41, 46) Jesus spoke of the final judgment as being like a shepherd separating sheep and goats (shepherds grazed them in mixed flocks). Separating sheep from goats in western countries is not difficult, as the sheep have been bred to accentuate their wool production so they look quite different. However, sheep and goats in Asia and Africa are often similar in appearance—consistent with them belonging to the same created kind, as Dr Lightner pointed out above.1 Non-shepherds find it difficult to distinguish such sheep and goats, but the shepherd knows the difference and easily separates them. For example, there are differences in behaviour: sheep tend to follow; goats go their own way. At the judgment, the Great Shepherd (Hebrews 13:20) will know the difference and will separate those who followed Him (Mat. 10:38) from those who went their own way. God will Separate the Goats from the Sheep  Bible. Yes Separation of Animals constantly in Bible  Jacaob  Even Changed Goats   Colors. Re Kosher Animals And in Different Faith..
