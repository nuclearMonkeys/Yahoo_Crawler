	130343 : ["We are Christians, and of course we have that recognition of Christ as our Savior, but we also have more. For one thing, we believe that God still calls prophets today, that just as He once guided His children through Moses and Abraham and all those others, He continues to guide us through men He has called for this purpose.  As wonderful and inspired as the words of the Biblical prophets are, modern day prophets can help guide us through problems specific to our day. We also believe in something called the priesthood.  We believe that after Christ was killed and His Apostles were murdered, the people were so horribly wicked that God didn't call a new prophet for a very long time.  When the time was right and people were willing to listen again, a new prophet was called, and through that prophet, many of the truths that were lost or changed over the centuries following Christ's death were restored. We believe in the Book of Mormon, which is a record of prophets who lived in the Americas, just as the Bible is a record of prophets who lived in Israel.  We read and study them together, because both of them teach us of Christ and reinforce our knowledge of Christ's gospel. Finally, be believe that our families were given to us to be a source of love and support, and that God doesn't want us to lose those bonds or forget our loved ones when we die.  Instead, through the blessings of the priesthood, we can be married and sealed to our spouses for all time and eternity, in this life and the next.  This means that our families will never be broken apart and that we will still have our loved ones in the next life. If you have any more questions, go to mormon.org.  The website is fairly comprehensive and should help.", 11070, "6DmsiLGbaa", 3],
	130344 : ["We actually try to LIVE the way we believe! (#1)  we aren't perfect by any means...but we believe that God expects us to try to be. We believe our loving Heavenly Father still loves us enough to SPEAK TO MANKIND still through a modern day prophet and that He didn't abandon us like so many believe, when His Son, Jesus Christ left the earth.  We also believe that scripture has & is given to God's children in more places than just Jerusalem <thus, the Book of Mormon which is the sacred writing of His \"Other Sheep\">. We believe that ALL MANKIND are His literal spirit children and all are of infinite value & worth and are not the depraved born in sin creatures that much of Christendom believes.  If we become sinful & depraved it is due to our own CHOICES & misuse of our God given Free Agency in this life. We believe that sacred family ties live beyond the grave and that we can be together forever with our families - not all will - but we 'can'. There is much that is LIKE other christian religions and MUCH that is different.  I like to believe that these differences not only set us apart from \"the world\" but they point to the significance and relevance of the Church of Jesus CHrist of latter Day Saints in this day & time.", 11070, "jdRKZe18aa", 0],
	130345 : ["First of all, thank you so so much for taking a logical stand on a subject that drives people insane and makes them say totally idiotic things because they're too busy dealing with their feelings to make sense.  Yes, I completely agree that dogs first and foremost were tools. If dogs were not useful, then humans would not have bothered domesticating them. However, they have grown so far from their original purposes that they are now completely useless in the practical sense. For example, Animal rights group try to ban the use of hunting dogs for what they were bred to do: hunt. While several breeds are still utilized, such as water rescue dogs and airport sniffer dogs, most now serve as companions to humans.  However, many shelter dogs are so emotionally/behaviorally damaged from abuse and/or abandonment that they can not become pets, and ferals are just so wild that the only thing shelters can do is neuter and release. Even if plenty of shelter dogs can make perfect pets, there are simply not enough households to take ALL of the unowned dogs running around. Some people have allergies, some people do not have room, some people just don't want any, etc. You can't force everyone to adopt a dog just to take care of the shelter population. While the no-kill shelters  appeal to your sense of morality, they are just a giant bottomless pit of resources. In a fair and perfect world, these shelters would have enough money to keep all the dogs that can't be turned over for adoption, but this is obviously not the case. All pets should be spayed and neutered, and it is best if the breeders themselves can do it before selling the dogs. Only several people should be given licenses to breed animals, and their output should be very strictly monitored and controlled. This is the heart of the problem, as there are too many breeders churning out dogs. Part of it is the demand for trendy mixed dogs liked labradoodles and puggles; potential owners themselves must also be educated in how they are actually contributing to the problem. No one side is completely guilty or completely innocent.  I believe extermination is a perfectly fine option, but to be used sparingly. Wherever appropriate, ferals, who absolutely cannot become pets, should first be spayed/neutered and released. If the population does not drop and the problem intensifies, then the dogs should be exterminated. For disowned or confiscated shelter dogs, the emotionally damaged that can't be reintroduced into a person's home should be put down, out of mercy and to make room for dogs that CAN be rehabilitated.  Pet-material animals should be given absolute top priority in shelters, but even then it would be noble but completely foolish to keep these animals in shelters forever. There should be a grace period of perhaps several months, before the animals are exterminated. People have to be logical and realistic about animals, but they must still show compassion and understanding that it was humans that created the problem. P.S. I believe the coyotes in my area take care of the problem of wandering strays. Gruesome, but nature itself manages it that way.", 11060, "eCfSpoYLaa", 0],

You will also have to have a lot of land for that type of deep end.  The pool manufacturer will need a certain amount of room to grade the pool from deep to shallow.  Accessories will be extra.  I would probally say you are looking at 50,000 to over 100,000 and will need a lot on a half acre of land or more.", 11066, "ecedd300662492407b4b61dc35388364aa", 3],
	130350 : ["Depends where you are and what kind of pool you are thinking of buying. I can reply from East Canada, and specifically for Aboveground Pools and Vinyl Inground Pools. If you are considering Concrete or Fiberglass, they tend to be more expensive then Vinyl. For aboveground pool, it's easy.  Depending on Size and type, you are looking at $2,500 to $10,000. For Vinyl Inground Pools,  here are the 4 elements you need to consider: 1. The swimming pool installation cost A fully equipped and installed pool with a heater, lights, salt system, solar blanket and roller, automatic cleaner and simple concrete deck will start around $25,000 and go up to around $45,000 for the very largest sizes. Cost of incidentals as part of the swimming pool installation They include such things as the electrical connection, gas or propane connection, cost of the city permit, cost of the water to fill the pool, re-instating the access to the yard.  Budget $3,000 to $5,000. Fencing required around the swimming pool Most cities require fencing of your pool.  You can expect around $25 - $30 a foot, installed, for chainlink fencing, $35 - $55 a foot for wood, $45 - $55 a foot for PVC and $45+ for ornamental steel and wrought iron.  Certain features such as gates can also add to the total cost. Landscaping around the swimming pool design It is somewhat difficult to estimate the cost of landscaping since there really is not limit to what can be done.  But at its most basic we can expect $3,000 to $5,000 to add a small patio area that ties in to the pool area. This information comes from a post we did:", 11066, "EPCcheAEaa", 0],
	130351 : ["U neglected to mention how easily accessible is the area to get a backhoe equipment into it.  If the fences had not yet been built, then the cost of tearing down the fence/wall won't have to be factored into the cost.   My neighbor has a swimming pool, and they tell me that had they realized the cost of maintenance and pool chemicals were so high, they would've gotten an enclosed pool.  An enclosed pool (with a roof) won't get as dirty (as an open one), which cuts down on the cleaning cost.   In the summer, the hot sun will require more chlorine, and the shade will cut down on this as well.  Another advantage to an enclosed pool is privacy; you can swim in the nude without prying eyes from neighbors, or low-flying aircraft.", 11066, "None", 1],
