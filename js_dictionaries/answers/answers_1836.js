It will get better, and letting him get his way will only wreck their chances of reconciliation, drive a wedge and distance between them, and let your husband off lightly. Kids are resilient and I think they need time to settle to the new arrangement. I don't want to cast aspersions on your kid, but I have seen other ones in similar situations play both parents off against the other and overemphasize their position due to the emotional conflicts of the situation.  There might be a lot of resentment that \"dad has a new gf\" and is neglecting them and spends no money on them. They also complain about their parents as standard.  I think you should put your foot down and have words with both of them. Well done for not saying it in front of them that he is a douche, I have no doubt that he is, though it doesn;t mean there is no truth in the statement. These things are never all one sided. Take the moral high ground. Things will get better. EDIT: lol, that's not tawdry. I'll tell you what's tawdry... I slept with my brother's best man after his wedding.
