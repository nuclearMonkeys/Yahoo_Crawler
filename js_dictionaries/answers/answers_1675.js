	89417 : ["Things that become obsolete by the  time you learn all the bells & whistles or come out with extra features that are really desirable in the product to make consumers want to buy a new one when the first one works just fine. Too much planned obsolesce with electronics.  I am not impressed with some of the electronic toys, some of them look junky and take batteries, most all are made in China. I remember my sister getting a talking Bug Bunny in the late 50's, pull a ring on a cord to make him talk, or a baby doll that cried when you turned it over, not high-tech but fun enough for us and we used our imaginations.  Children are being handed I-pads while their mother's shop, sitting in the shopping cart and playing electronic games. They aren't being taught to be patient and behave themselves but being distracted instead. Distracted to the point if someone speaks to them they ignore them completely, happened where I worked at a store and the kid threw a fit when his mother took the I-pad away so he would talk. People are getting dependent on their electronics, socializing through cell phones and having to stay updated through the work-day.  The up-side to it is that people don't need to call the work-place office and leaving messages like before, the places where I worked started refusing to relay messages to their employees unless it was a dire emergency (someone hospitalized for example). I've read an article today saying that some of the new cell phones can have the camera shut down remotely by the cell phone company, don't know if it is for certain areas or for individual people....now what would be the purpose of that except perhaps to censor people from taking photos of something very controversial? A police raid where there was a threat of extreme violence, an area where politicians and VIPs congregate, or an area such as a casino where no photos are allowed?", 9328, "AAgX0SDcaa", 3],
	89418 : ["I cannot understand the constant need so many people have for being in touch with their friends. Bus journeys are a real pain as people yell into their phones and share their private lives with everyone in earshot. Generally I love the ability to access so much knowledge at with a few clicks. Compared with the slow and frustrating searches through the library catalogues of my youth it is amazing. Unfortunately it does not seem to have reduced the sum total of ignorance to judge by some questions (rants) on Yahoo Answers. I do worry about how so may advances are being subverted not only by criminals but by governments who think mass surveillance is their right, and I get annoyed at the seeming inability of software creators to write code which does not almost immediately need revising. Being able to conduct so much personal business on the Internet is a real time saver, though some company and government websites still have a long way to go to be user friendly. I'm sure that I will make even more use of this as I get less mobile. It is wonderful to be able to download movies and catch-up with TV programmes, unfortunately I find fewer and fewer I actually want to watch. At least I can always download an e-book instead.", 9328, "A3w6miyRaa", 5],

We're definitely hooked on GPS and we're going to get one.  However, we're not all that techno-savvy. We have a hard time understanding the new cell-phones and the best we can do is put in some friend's numbers and 'automatic' dial.

	89438 : ["Our generation is the one that enabled the technology that drives modern society.  We spent many hours with soldering irons and test meters designing more and more complicated gadgets that have developed into today's toys.  For those of us no longer concerned with being at the cutting edge of technology, it means we can get the spin-off's and last year's model for little money. I'm sitting here with a tiny gadget for charging an iPod from the mains.  240v AC goes in one end and 5v DC comes out of the other.  I've built many low voltage power supplies, but how do you fit a mains transformer, rectifier, smoothing capacitor and voltage stabiliser in something half the size of a matchbox?  The answer is that there's a component in there that switches the mains on and off at microwave frequency and the flyback current is sufficient to induce a voltage in an adjacent component that includes a 5 volt stabilising circuit.  If we fell out with China, I could build a gadget to do the same job in a box the size of a half-brick - but I doubt whether many of the younger generation would know where to start.", 9328, "d900XEySaa", 3],
	89439 : ["The one thing that does NOT impress me, nor do I see any need whatsoever for, is a mobile phone with the computing capacity of NASA. I do not want to play silly games, or log-on to the internet whilst eating my soup in a restaurant, or know what the weather is doing in Tierra del Fuego. All I want from a mobile phone is to be able to make telephone calls. Thats what they are for. Neither do I walk the pavements with the thing glued into my hand, staring at it like a fart in a daze and not looking where I am going, which seems to be the modern trend. It rings, I take it out, answer the call, switch it off and put it away again. I didn't need to rob a bank to afford it either. It cost me Â£25 and does all i need it to. And don't get me started on Hi-definition, flat screen TV technology. I am still mourning the passing of waiting for the valves to warm up.", 9328, "Vx9CVrOGaa", 7],

If your grandmother is vomiting 90% of the time from painkillers, she needs to go back to the prescribing doctor and describe her issues, because that is serious.  She could be having a reaction.  There are other choices for her that can ease the nausea or may not cause nausea at all.

I have zero need to be in contact with anyone while I am walking down the street, sitting on a bus or vacating my bowels in a public or private toilet. I have never texted, nor do I plan to. Most of the people I know need more than \"yr rt\" as a response to their intelligent comments. I speak on the phone from the comfort of my desk chair or arm chair. They are conversations, not convos. They last as long as it takes two people to discuss whatever they choose to discuss. The computer is still primarily a tool from which I derive an income, albeit, a part-time one. I use the social features to fill dead spots in my schedule but do not allow it to take one minute from time that I could be using elsewhere.  I use the microwave oven strictly for reheating. I like my food broiled, baked,toasted, roasted or fried, not nuked to death. I do not have an alarm system. If I fall down and can't get up it will be because I am dead. Other than that I will find a way to get up and if I can't, oh well.  I do have the most modern thermostat on the air conditioning system because I like the temperature to be constant and it saves its cost in a year or so. I do not have Blu Rays or any other shades of the rainbow attached to the TV. If I can't watch a program when it is scheduled, it isn't that good that I have to see it ever. The TV fits into my life. I do not build my life around it. MY car has a GPS built in. I have never used it and I have never gotten lost. It has Sirius. I have never listened to it.
