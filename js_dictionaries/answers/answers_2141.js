I am a 63 year old female; retired but working as an Administrative Assistant in my church part time. I am doing the research to find out more about the people in my family. I have been finding out not just who they were, and when and where they lived, but how they lived, why they moved from here to there, who they might have known, the histories of the areas they lived in, learning how they fit into the history of the state or province (some were from Canada) and the country. Learning how my ancestors fit into history has helped make the history that I learned in school more alive for me.  My family started years ago by getting all the information that we could from my grandparents before they died, which wasn't a lot. I didn't really do much with that information until about 10 years ago when we started visiting cemeteries and courthouses to verify some of that information. During the last 4 or 5 years, I have been able, through the records at Ancestry.com and other websites, to access records not available at the county level, and I have discovered and verified even more information. I have also found relatives that I didn't know or know about, and we have exchanged information, as well as formed friendships. It is the last, the possibility of finding and getting to know living relatives however distant on the family tree, that is my main motive for continuing the research.", 10329, "7ZeT3Krkaa", 2],

I guess all I can say, is you'll never know what something is like until you try it. I was terrified of living in the hills with a bunch of rednecks, being a NYer, but I took the good with the bad and overall made some good friends and enjoyed myself. I say go for it, Manhattan is DEFINITELY safe... I believe NY is the 2nd safest city (large city) in this country as the last stats showed. Definitely be alert and conscious of your surroundings, I think that is what gets tourists in trouble, but I'm sure you'll catch on, and if you hate it, you can always go back home, but at least you can say you tried it.", 10333, "f63937af92c89ef0157cec794438d0a0aa", 0],

Do your parents understand how detrimental this name-calling can be for a 14 year old?  Especially from some one who you are supposed to look up to.   Do they know she has called you â€˜fat thing'?  This woman should be guiding you, encouraging you, and helping you to make right decisions.  Instead she is tearing you down for her own selfish and unknown reasons.      You should not sell your pony.  You should look in to what legal actions you may take since your parents are not helping.  Do you have any friends or cousins who are older than you that you can talk to about this?  Maybe have one of them speak to your instructor about her lack of kindness.

	112849 : ["Bullying is when someone keeps doing or saying things to have power over another person.  Some of the ways they bully other people are by: calling them names, saying or writing nasty things about them, leaving them out of activities, not talking to them, threatening them, making them feel uncomfortable or scared, taking or damaging their things, hitting or kicking them, or making them do things they don't want to do.  Have any of these things happened to you? Have you done any of these things to someone else? Really, bullying is wrong behaviour which makes the person being bullied feel afraid or uncomfortable.  They may see it as a way of being popular, or making themselves look tough and in charge.  Some bullies do it to get attention or things, or to make other people afraid of them. Others might be jealous of the person they are bullying. They may be being bullied themselves. Some bullies may not even understand how wrong their behaviour is and how it makes the person being bullied feel.  Some young people are bullied for no particular reason, but sometimes it's because they are different in some way - perhaps it's the colour of their skin, the way they talk, their size or their name.  Sometimes young people are bullied because they look like they won't stand up for themselves.  Some people think bullying is just part of growing up and a way for young people to learn to stick up for themselves. But bullying can make young people feel lonely, unhappy and frightened. It makes them feel unsafe and think there must be something wrong with them. They lose confidence and may not want to go to school any more. It may make them sick.  Coping with bullying can be difficult, but remember, you are not the problem, the bully is. You have a right to feel safe and secure.  And if you're different in some way, be proud of it! Kia Kaha - stand strong. Spend time with your friends - bullies hardly ever pick on people if they're with others in a group. You've probably already tried ignoring the bully, telling them to stop and walking away whenever the bullying starts.  If someone is bullying you, you should always tell an adult you can trust. This isn't telling tales. You have a right to be safe and adults can do things to get the bullying stopped. Even if you think you've solved the problem on your own, tell an adult anyway, in case it happens again. An adult you can trust might be a teacher, school principal, parent, someone from your family or whanau, or a friend's parent. If you find it difficult to talk about being bullied, you might find it easier to write down what's been happening to you and give it to an adult you trust.", 10327, "None", 2],

	112858 : ["Uhh... The Chinese Government is run by PR people. Watch Jia Zhangke's \"Still Life\" and Yi Lifan and Yan Yu's \"Before the Flood\" and tell me of all the great things about the scientists and engineers running the Three Gorges Dam project. China's infrastructure is actually really precarious, mainly because of the extreme discrepancy between the elite and the average citizen (which sounds familiar)... Their recent success is not necessarily tied to capitalism, though. Deng Xiaoping revolutionized their economy in 1980, essentially adopting some form of capitalism. And it took years before their economy exploded. It has much more to do with really good financial planning by the elite and not giving a **** about who they run over at the bottom. A good example was when people were being resettled in the midst of the aforementioned Three Gorges Dam project a family of four was allotted an 80 sq. m. home. If a family moved up from a 60 sq. m. home to an 80 sq. m. home they had to pay somewhere around 700 yuan for each additional square meter. But if a family moved from a 100 sq. m. home to an 80 sq. m. home they were only payed 300 yuan for each lost square meter. They actually made a profit relocating people. And they manipulated and exploited every single poor person that lived in the flooded zones.", 10328, "None", 3],
	112859 : ["China's economy is not centrally planned. They've implemented a lot of free market reforms. However, there are still industries that are state controlled such as the tobacco industry.

My parents were older when they had me and I never met my grandparents. Both my parents were late babies as well and didn't really know their grandparents either. I suppose not knowing much about where I came from has fuelled my interest in genealogy. As with most families there are a few snippets of interesting information handed down that just have to be researched further. I have been told there is a murderer in the family and we're really interested to find out about that. I would say that researching is a big part of my personally.

	112864 : ["I started researching when I was younger.  I went to a cemetery with the Girl Scouts (not sure which badge that was for) and saw family names on the stones and wondered how I could ever find out if we were related.  As I got older, I found one source after another for discovering relatives of long ago.  It just fascinated me to be able to trace so many lines so far back.  Problems arose, such as people being buried in a family plot who were previously unknown- and it's very satisfying to trace those people and discover their relation. At conferences and other such gatherings, I notice that most people are at least in the 60s.  They explain that they have always had the interest, but not the time, until they retired.  Also, what is different as of late, is the availability of lots of records online, as opposed to being available in paper form only at one location open during the day during the week.  The increase in digitization has opened the genealogical research doors to more people, not just retirees. I would consider myself a Type A, perfectionist personality.", 10329, "xPxL6xbsaa", 1],
