Smitfraud applications are programs that are used to download rogue security products and change the user's desktop to display false warnings that the computer is infected with spyware. If your computer has become infected with one of these \"spyware removal programs,\" you probably downloaded an infected codec program when you tried to watch a video online (usually purporting to be an x-rated celebrity video) or you may have been hit by a \"drive-by\" installation of Smitfraud. Smitfraud attacks show fake antispyware programs popups on your screen and/or a balloon popup from the windows system tray displaying a warning message that your computer is infected with spyware (here it is falsely calling it worm.win32.netbooster) and telling you to purchase, download & install their program to remove it.  Often, it will hijack your desktop and publish a warning message in big letters (with their weblink) on your desktop wallpaper.  The infection will usually alter the settings of your current virus protection software (including Norton and McAfee) and render it powerless to delete the infection. The Smitfraud application will also typically disable your ability to launch the task manager with the alt-ctrl-del keys, too. DO NOT BUY THE ANTISPYWARE PROGRAM THAT IS BEING ADVERTISED ON YOUR WALLPAPER AND IN THE POPUPS. The creator of the bogus popups is an affiliate of the particular antispyware program they are promoting, so each time an unsuspecting user purchases the advertised program in hopes of removing the trojan the person behind the attack gets paid.  Not a very ethical way of selling an antispyware, antivirus, or other computer pest removal product. Here is the 100% FREE solution I found on   that worked for me: 1. Download and install the Smitfraudfix tool in the link below. 2. Download and install Super Antispyware. Update definitions. 3. Run both programs (Smitfraudfix first) after you start your operating system is in safe mode. Follow the instructions carefully for Smitfraudfix.  Allow Super Antispyware to quarantine whatever it finds.  To learn how to run your operating system in safe mode: 3. Reboot in normal mode. Run the Bit Defender online scan (no download necessary). Allow it to quarantine whatever it finds. 4. Download and run RogueRemover. Select \"Scan\" and follow the steps indicated.  It didnt find anything for me, but it comes highly recommended. You can continue to follow-up with Spybot and AdAware if you desire.  Of course, you should also keep your regular anti-virus software up-to-date and scan regularly; hopefully it will be working well again after the infection is removed. Be sure to restore the settings which the Smitfraud program altered.  Smitfraud apps are quite nasty, and it may take a while to remove all traces. Good luck!", 11445, "zcu5td9Paa", 2],

These three superstars are all at different levels in their careers, but are dropping slightly, and becoming less popular with the fans because of their gimmicks. These three stars I am about to mention are great superstars of the WWE and are great all-round performers all the time. They just need a big gimmick change to freshen them up abit more. The first star I believe needs a big gimmick change quickly is Randy Orton. Orton has had his viper gimmick a good amount of time now, and it is really starting to get boring and stale, and is becoming very predictable and old. We are seeing the same thing each week with Orton, and his rivalries and storylines are being effected massively because of his gimmick aswell. If WWE don't do something about it soon, Orton will become a hell of a boring main-eventer, and may even be dropped to a slight lower level. His gimmick effects the whole of his character, and needs to be sorted out quickly or it could get alot worse for Orton. The secong star that needs a gimmick change is John Morrison. Morrison is an absolutely phenomenal young rising star, and is a great all-round performer in the WWE and always gives his absolute best. But as of late, he has had a gimmick that is holding back the rest of his great character, Morrison is not improving and not bettering himself like WWE could be doing for him. He is also becoming slightly boring and stale with his gimmick, and it is a big shame because the guy has amazing potential and has a very bright future. So I think WWE should really sort this out quickly before it gets worse for Morrison. Finally, the third star in need of a big gimmick change is John Cena. Cena has been the top star in the company for quite a few years now, and has been one of the best all-round performers the company has had. Cena always gives his absolute best in the ring for the fans, and is a well-respected and well-known character in and out of wrestling. But Cena's gimmick at the moment is beginning to effect the whole of his persona in the WWE. Cena has had this gimmick for an awefully long time now, and it has gotten more stale, boring and predictable more and more each week. Cena is a great star for the WWE, and this needs to change quickly or it could end up getting worse for Cena.
