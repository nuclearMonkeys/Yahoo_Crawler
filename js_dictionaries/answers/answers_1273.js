	69185 : ["Great question. I have been feeding ferals for years. At present, I am not feeding many, because most of the ones I have not been able to humanely trap and bring to the local shelter, if the cats seem somewhat friendly, or to a feral rescue group that places them in approved barn homes, if the cats appear unrehabilitatable, have been eaten by hungry coyotes. I do have several nice houses, filled with hay and waterproof, that the cats can sleep in if the coyotes do not get them en route.  I also have several pet cats which were formerly completely feral, and one that still is. I wish I could get a donkey or something to keep the coyotes away, but such animals are not allowed where I live. I harbor no animosity toward the coyotes, by the way. Much like Mickey Rourke's character in Barfly, I just feel better when they are not around-even though, unlike his character, I am talking about dogs rather than cops! With the severe winter we are having, though, the dogs are desperate for whatever food they can get. I am praying for an early spring. All of my rescued ferals-the ones I kept-are indoor-only cats. They all seem to have adjusted to life indoors, even the wild one. Also, for whatever reason, my cats all get along pretty well for the most part, even though a number of them are neutered toms.", 8495, "None", 2],

Unfortunately, there isn't a national organisation for animal welfare, so it's up to individuals and privately run organisations to do what they can to help. Twice a day I visit the apartment complex where I used to live so that I can continue to feed the local cats there.  There are five regulars who turn up for their meals, and I've managed to spay/neuter all of them except for one female who recently joined the group.  She's so nervous that I'm having difficulty trapping her, but I'm determined she won't elude me for much longer.   The climate here is sunny for most of the year, but we do get a lot of rain in the winter months.  I made some shelters out of plastic boxes filled with straw, though they don't use them that often, it's nice to think that they have somewhere warm and dry to shelter if needed.  I only wish that I'd been able to find permanent homes for them, but there are simply more cats than there are good homes available.  There's also a big problem in Cyprus with people adopting cats and dogs, only to abandon them when they decide to return to their home country.  It really saddens me to think how bewildered these pets must feel when they are turfed onto the street and left to fend for themselves,  At least the cats who were feral, don't know any other life.", 8495, "IuYekkPVaa", 2],

Is she an alcoholic, drug addict?   Honey, the hymen is over rated. People aren't moral or immoral because of religions.... surely in your life you have seen that.   People are moral because of the way they were raised, and if poorly raised, how they view themselves as a product of this society.   And when they figure out that it is in their best interests to be moral, have friends, be trustworthy, they realize that to be otherwise will mean they will have no friends, and likely no happy marriage. It is not the quantity of relationships that matter, it is the quality.....  There's no such thing as sin...

He got really sick after we first started seeing him, and putting food out for him ... I think he may have been poisoned from eating a rat from the property next door.  I nursed him back to health, by feeding him a little food with lots of gravy, while he could barely retreat back under a tree.  I've slowly moved his food bowl down by our front door, and he's learned to come at feeding time for my older cat (7AM and 5PM).  Within the 6 months, I can now sit within a foot or two of his food bowl while he'll eat, but I haven't tried to pet him yet.  He prefers it if I put the food out and close the door, otherwise, he takes a bite at a time, and runs.  I have no idea where he sleeps (maybe under the house sometimes, but probably also under a rock up by the driveway).  He likes to sit in a certain area on the property where he can watch people ... he's not friendly yet, but definitely curious.  I got busy one morning and forgot to feed him - it's the only time I heard him speak ... he found me by the back of the house an let out a few meows.  I'm working on instilling trust, and being patient with him.
