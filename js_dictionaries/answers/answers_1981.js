	104801 : ["I personally do not recommend mass gainers for most people. It contains a very high concentration of calories that mostly gets unutilized. The only time I may suggest it is if servings are greatly reduced for people who are extreme hardgainers, and even then they'd be better off just increasing their dietery calories accordingly. What you should do instead is get a good whey protein powder and possibly a good carb supplement like a dextrin/maltodextrin powder. You are then in a much better position to control the amounts you consume before and after a workout and don't run the risk of consuming too much. Also, there may be times where you don't want to have certain ingredients during your training. This holds true with blended supplements that contain other ingredients like creatine where you have no control over the amount you take. Another problem with blended protein/creatine solutions is that the creatine becomes unstable very quickly in solution, especially the monohydrate variety. The ethyl ester form works much better in solution. Looking at this product online, it's profile isn't too bad for a weight gainer. I suggest trying to halve the normal serving, which is over 1200 calories per serving, and working your way up from there. Make sure this is only taken after a workout, and watch that it does not start adding bodyfat. This supplement has a LOT of carbs packed into it (252 grams per serving), which may be a risky proposition for increasing bodyfat, so be careful. Usually it's not recommended to take creatine before the age of 18 and it's something I tend to agree with. 18 is a good rule of thumb for creatine and for the most part, for those under 18 creatine really isn't necessary since your endocrine system is maxed out. Creatine shouldn't cause harm per se, but it's not really going to be terribly benificial. If you are close to 18 anyway, you can try it to see if it really helps or not. Don't worry about stunted growth when lifting weights, that is a myth with no scientific evidence to support it.", 9903, "QvwHUO9Qaa", 0],
