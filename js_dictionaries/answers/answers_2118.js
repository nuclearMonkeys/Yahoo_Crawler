	111690 : ["First, I have to say I'm impressed with your webpage. I too am a Chavez and a Camacho fan from way back. It's refreshing and amazing to find someone whose favorite fighters are the same as mine. It's very rare to see someone like both Chavez and Camacho. I think because of ethnic reasons, one being Mexican and the other being Puerto Rican. You also need to support Camacho Jr. He's a good kid who is getting way to much negative publicity. He didn't get to be 41-1 by accident. But overall, keep up the good work! To answer your question, if Klitschko defeats Byrd, and I too expect him to do so, the Heavyweight division will be at an all time low.  The four champs will be two unproven fighters (Valuev and Sergei) one journeyman who has lost 3 of 4 biggest fights in his career (Rahman) and a guy who is up and down more than a yo-yo (Klitschko). The truth is that the world's best heavy is Lennox Lewis, who is retired. The world's second best heavy is Vitali Klitschko, who also is retired. There is no third best heavyweight. Just a bunch of clubfighters. If Holyfield or Tyson or Holmes were in their prime today, they would be undisputed heavyweight champion. I have a strong feeling that the heavyweight championship is going to continue to change hands quite frequently over the next few years, until a legit fighter comes along to clear this mess up. A name to remember is an amatuer from Detroit by the name of Isiah Thomas. He recently won the amatuer heavyweight world championship.", 10197, "AA11404816", 0],

	111694 : ["The thing with nicknames are really just names used by friends and family as unique identifiers based on things you do, how they think of you or even what they associate you with. So they are given to you, not (usually) chosen by you. For example, I am a Green band Thai boxer, my name is Kylie and so my friends started to call me Thai Kai, or just Kai. One of my friends has a habit of always having Kit Kats with her (\"just in case I get peckish\") so guess her nickname :-) and when I was younger we used to call my best friend \"Sparky\" - though it was mainly an ironic nickname as the joke was he \"had some very dim moments\" (his words not mine, I swear!)

A lot of the opinions are totally uninformed, and some is based upon performance in sparring matches-and if you look at the different styles, Klitschko is a technicial, and practices as such.  It would be like handicapping a football team based upon preseason games-each team approached preseason with a different goal, and not all play to win or to impress.  Just look at the fights, the styles, and the relative improvement.  There is no reason to think Klitschko is going to be poorer this fight, or that Byrd has improved or trained more, so my money is on Klitschko. For an alternate view: Klitschko has been uneven in his fighting, and handicappers hate that-", 10197, "AA10941511", 2],

	111712 : ["While its unusual for a wireless router to just stop working, it is possible. First, hook up everything normally (DSL-->Router-->PC). Shut down everything (turn off PC and unplug dsl + router). Wait 30 seconds, plug the DSL modem back in, wait a full minute (60 seconds). Plug the router back in, wait another minute. Start the PC, and test for internet connectivity. Why may this help? Well, sometimes, if the router goes down, you have to reboot the DSL modem or otherwise it won't work. This happens often with cable modems too; if you switch devices (or your router turns off/changes an internal address), you need to restart the DSL modem. Didn't work? Try another step.  This WILL get rid of any changes you made on the router since buying it (enabling wirelss encryption). Most people don't bother to do any additional setup on their router, but if you did, make sure to write any custom settings down! You may need to reset your router. Hit \"reset\" (its a hole on the back, use a pen). Hold it for ten seconds, and wait a minute. Now retry. You may also need to shutdown and restart everything as I detailed above (again :P ). If that doesn't work, your ISP may have blocked your MAC address (a unique address assigned to any network device, wireless or wired, PC or Macintosh) due to the fact that its a router. Most routers have a \"clone MAC from this computer\". Give it a shot, it works for many people, and it worked for my ISP (they allow routers, but they don't like MAC address changes) Hope this helps!", 10191, "AA12336121", 0],

Run the entire setup again and follow the directions exactly. It tells you when and how to reconnect everything like the first time. Then hopefully it will work again. If not, your router is shot.

	111717 : ["Wladimir Klitschko is the most fundamentally correct boxer since Joe Louis.  This does not mean that he would beat every boxer since Louis.  It only means that he does everything as it should be.  This looks great on paper.  However, it does not prepare a fighter for the unexpected.   Would you teach a fighter to fight like Marciano?  How about ALI?  Both ALI and Marciano did many things wrong in the ring.  Marciano lacked skills and ALI had a ton of bad habits that got other fighters knocked cold, in trying to mimic them.  However, they worked for ALI and Marciano.  These are just examples of the difference between Wladimir's fundamental use of the art of boxing, and the lack there of, of others.  Wladimir's \"correctness\" would cost him against Holmes.  He is unable to change and adjust when things don't go according to plan.  Holmes rarely \"looked\" great but he always got the job done.  He was not great in any one category, save the jab, but he could do a little of everything.  He could box when he needed to and he could fight when he needed to.  He was deceptively strong on the inside and, again, though he didn't look great, he was effective.  Wladimir's hands and feet would be just a tad too slow for Holmes.  A man of his physical make up should be able to score at least a knockdown over Holmes.  However, the Haye fight, and a few others, convinced me that Klitschko would not even get that.  Holmes' laterally movement would keep Wladimir off balance for much of the fight.   If he gets close, Wladimir could create problems for Holmes.  He's naturally stronger and in supreme condition.  Give me the Holmes who faced ALI.  Though it was not a competitive fight, Holmes didn't know that because no one knew what to expect with ALI and everyone became a better fighter when facing \"The Greatest\".  Holmes was at his absolute best, in terms of condition, against ALI.  That Holmes, or any version between 80 and 82, would be a hand full for any heavyweight who ever lived.  The size and weight would mean little because Holmes would simply be too fast, too sharp and too seasoned.  Wladimir would take too much punishment, once Holmes slows him down and shuts down his confidence.  He has the tools to beat Holmes but he doesn't take enough chances to do what must be done to win.
