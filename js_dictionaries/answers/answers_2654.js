WQ: Yes I think Ricky Steamboat had the talent I'm not to sure about JYD because I really can't see him as a main event talent but I am sure if Hulk Hogan wasn't as overhyped as he was that Steamboat would've been at least a two or three time champion I mean he went to the NWA and won the title from Ric Flair who is way better than Hogan by a mile so I think Steamboat could've won easily.", 11394, "wum4X78maa", 1],

For about $300, she could get the same Janome I just got (and love)  I do quilting, and this machine was a good compromise between price and the size of the throat (the area between the motor on the right and the needle on the left, important in quilting since that's where a big chunk of quilt can get stuffed when you're quilting).  It's not as big a throat as I would've liked to have, but I didn't want to spend a huge amount of money. One of the nice things about this Janome 8077 is that it has a free arm area, which is nice for getting into sleeves and tight places when you're making garments, and there's a platform that snaps in around it to give you a bigger area to work in when you don't need the free arm.", 11395, "AEdhcHNGaa", -2],

I love how we can be loyal to a fault; a Black woman is down for her friends, family, and though at times it's more a curse than a blessing, she's down for her man too. I love how you can look at a black woman, and she can give you a look like, \"you don't want none\", then in the next breath, give you a smile so genuine, you forget all about the attitude, and can't help but to smile back. There's plenty more I love about Black women, I could literally go on and on and on....  Anyway, physically, I love how, generally, we're built Ford tough!
