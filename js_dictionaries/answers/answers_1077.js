For a manufacturer to do this would cost a lot of money, for little benefit.

	59339 : ["No, categorically not. Anyone who designs or fully understands electronics knows what is and is not possible, and what components do what. The post that claims it's possible to monitor audio remotely is correct - however, it uses very specialised equipment and is nothing to do with either computer screens or normal cameras. And it cannot be used for video; though, anyone with the facility to do that could simply film via a telephoto lens from outside the property anyway - but again unrelated to computers. Smart TVs and \"Alexa\" type gadgets with voice recognition are another matter - many send everything they hear to a remote system to do the voice analysis and speech recognition.", 8216, "MHUrF6Ceaa", 0],
	59340 : ["While any LED could potentially be repurposed as a light sensor, the controller is designed to be low-cost, and would not incorporate the functionality to read from them. And even if they were, the controller is easily accessible to anyone curious enough and the right technical skills (which are not rare). AND a driver to use this functionality would need to be installed in the target's operating system.  This is not happening on any sort of wide scale, because people routinely disassemble electronics and operating system code, and monitor network transmissions. I wouldn't completely rule it out on a state actor level, but it would take Stuxnet-level engineering to pull off. It would require intercepting and replacing several components. The resulting footage would be extremely grainy. And it would need to be transmitted over an airgap, such as subaural sounds from a computer speaker.", 8216, "None", 0],

So what do those things mean to you? You stated that it seemed like the thing hanging in or jumping into your window meant you harm. What made you think it meant harm?  Why would it want to harm you?  Does it remind you of anything in your past?  Feelings?  Experiences? After more than 20 years of trying to understand my dreams, I came to the conclusion that how I felt throughout the dream and what it reminded me of in my past were the \"meaning.\" Analysis along the lines of asking myself the questions I've just asked you hasn't failed me once.  That doesn't means it always gives me immediate clarity.  It's just a method of starting to ask questions about your personal experiences that can lead to answers that only you have.

Now they have mobile lending libraries, so you won't see many mid aged people outside shopping for books and nobody want to go out in scorching sun/pouring rain to buy books.    Ebooks took a big toll on book sales. Cost of publishing book is going up because of hike in paper, labour and other printing materials. So online reading is getting popular, some people are predicting that newspaper circulation will completly go away in another decade and everything will be delivered either to your inbox or you have to login to their website to read news. Mobile phones are already delivering breaking news.   Books are good companion and best travel buddies. I do online + book reading. To survive with low cost, I recommend my friends to buy used books. For story books you can always rent it from local waste paper mart for less than Rs.1.   Coming to TV, 1 picture is equivalent to 1000 words. I don't watch serials and other shows, National Geography, SCI-FI (movies) and Discovery are my favorite. Occassionaly I do watch Disney cartoon movies. They are informative programs and our mind can understand visual programs  more than reading books.   So it all depends on what you watch on TV. I wouldn't agree with declining book reading, it is just taking another dimension that's all.  Amudham:   Don't ever smell old books, because usualy there will be bugs inside (Silver fish is one common insect) and you don't want that in your nostrils. Sometime fungus too!
