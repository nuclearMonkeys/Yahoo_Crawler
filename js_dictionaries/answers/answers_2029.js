I'm a huge fan of How it All Vegan by Sarah Kramer and Tanya Barnard because the recipes included are relatively quick and easy and the books contain lots of useful information such as substitutions, foods to watch out for and a glossary of terms used in ingredient lists that might contain animal products.

Think of all you favourite foods and theres nearly always a vegan alternative for it :) Holland and barrett do lovely burgers, sausages and soy mince in their freezer sections and you can also get vegan icecream in waitrose and sainsburys which is even nicer than normal icecream.  You can still make delicious cakes, flapjacks , puddings etc..and you can even get a vegan milk chocolate in some shops which is really nice.  Soy cheeses vary but the soft 'cheeses' are really nice and you can get fake cheese which is really good for melting into sauces and stuff.  To be honest the only thing that stops people from going vegan is they're afraid they'll miss out on lots of yummy food, but they wont. I certainly don't.  Anyway the meat and dairy industries torture and kill countless animals a year- do you really want to contribute to that just so you can still eat cheese sandwiches and mars bars?

Many ways seem right but its end=death==why the Bible severely warns dont trust humans/urself, clergy/churches/scholars, scientists/TV(Jer 10:2-5,23////).
