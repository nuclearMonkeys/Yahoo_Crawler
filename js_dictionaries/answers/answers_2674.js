	139560 : ["Hello Lady Kk, I really don't need to answer this question, because I already have the answer, as do you. I would however like to relate to you a story which might refute the disbeliever. Back some time ago when I was raising my children, my first born, Jacob, complained about pains in his chest (at the age of six). Children being what they are, we were a little skeptical, and payed little attention. His complaints continued, until finally we were summoned to the school by the nurse, and had to take him home. After a couple of days, nothing improved, so we went to the clinic, and were referred to Long Isalnd Jewish Hospital. LIJH is the leading cardiac care center here on Long Island. We spent the day there, and it would have to be one of the worst days of my life, as specialist after specialist was summoned to see Jake for examination. After about nine hours, we were sent home, and advised to keep him quiet, and monitor him by means of a halter monitor which was connected to the hospital via phone. We went through a few episodes, and I have never in my life felt so helpless, or so frightened. To think that my six year old son was in danger with a heart condition was more than I could bear. I spent the next night in prayer, and by the next day, prayer turned into anger, which turned into complete surrender to Gods will, as I had finally understood that I could do nothing about this situation, except pray, and trust God. We were called back to the hospital after a week of monitoring Jacob, and we feared the worst, as nothing had changed, except that the episodes were less in number, and less severe, which we were told to expect. On the morning of the trip to the hospital, Jacob said he felt very well when asked about the pain in his chest, which he had experienced up until that morning. I suspected that he just did not want to do a repeat of the poking and examining. But off we went, and after talking with the specialists after they consulted over the results of their most recent evaluation and the monitior results, they told us what was going on. While they were hesitant to say so at the beginning, the were convinced that Jacob was suffering from a valve problem, and expected to have to operate to repair it. However, this sort of procedure was very dangerous for children under a certain age, and Jake fell into that cross section. They were waiting for some hard symptoms before they committed.  They all admitted this to us that morning. They also admitted that Jacob showed absolutely no signs of any valve problem at all. In fact, Jacob showed no problems of any kind at all, and was the picture of good health. When I tell you that they also admitted that they were extremely perplexed over Jake's condition, they confided that they were certain that we were going to be back the next day for emergency treatment, since all their examinations returned \"red zone\" results. God healed my son, and there is no way in God's green earth anyone could ever convince me otherwise. So to the \"doubting Thomas\", I believe it was Brian E, you have not had the blessing of the knowledge of a kind and loving God because you have allowed yourself to be blinded by lies. You believe that your \"supposed\" knowledge of the world is correct, and that you require nothing more than what you already have. I need you to know that it is not. You will be weighed and found wanting. There is a God, and yes, He does answer prayers, but it requires an intimate relationship with Him to amount to anything.  The Bible tells us that \"a fool, in his heart, says there is no God\". I think that about sums it up. I will pray for your salvation, and for the annointing of the Holy Spirit, which will lift the scales from your eyes, show you the Truth, and deliver you from the attacks of the enemy. Be well.", 11430, "32xRsYa9aa", 0],

I bet you got that from the loan company, didn't you?  Even if you were ordered to make payments, that court order would become void if you file a bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy is filed in federal court.  Federal court trumps lower courts.  This is why you can appeal to a higher court if you don't like a court's ruling.  Higher courts can overturn or throw out a lower court's ruling. Understand that, if the loan is secured, you may have to give up the collateral you used to secure the loan.  But you can file if you choose.

Sure if you file a Ch7 these days the court wants you to pay back what you owe so the judge iwll change it to a Ch13 and insist that you make payments.
