Edwards CLAIMS to be concerned about the poor but he fought for companies that screwed the average consumer & he think $400 are great (of course, the \"poor\" spend that much for a haircut).   So we've got Mr. Hypocrite Edwards, Mr. Pro-Amnesty Richardson, Mr. Racist/Socialist/Liar Obama & Ms. Socialist/Liar Clinton.  Boy, the Dems have some great candidates this year!   We only have Mr. I never supported amnesty McCain. Can't we get anybody good?", 9183, "None", 3],
	85011 : ["I believe John Edwards is a smart man not to endorse either candidate cause he is probably waiting in the wings for the complete downfall of the Democrats after the convention and fall election and, being pretty moderate, figures he will be the right choice for 2012.  The DNC needs to step back and reevaluate their values and position on the issues confronting this country and get ALOT more to the mainstream.", 9183, "OevT2onTaa", 1],
	85012 : ["No, Edwards has alot going for him & it wouldn't matter what color, race, sex or anything else like that would be. He is an intelligent man who cares about people alot. He had a son that passed away after a car accident & he started to meet alot of people who were in accidents but were not compensated properly by insurance companies so he started helping this people as their lawyer. He also has a really great supportive family. He came from a middle class background & has had a great deal of success. There is NO way he would support mccain. I think you ought to watch different tv shows or something to find him in interviews cause I don't know how you could be getting the info. you have got it is way off base.He really admires both democratic candidates.", 9183, "I6dcRgD6aa", -1],

Emotions are frowned upon - look how most everyone jumped all over Hillary for showing emotion.  It's considered a sign of weakness (for being human).  A woman still has to be as good as - or better than - any 'man' to assume and succeed in positions of power in  today's society.

	85027 : ["LOOK AT THE ISSUES:  i don't understand how a Hillary supporter can possibly vote for McCain if he/she is looking at the issues.  What fools, voting out of spite.  Obama and Hillary have very similar policies...any minute difference was magnified  during the primary season to try distinguish the two similar candidate.   The only reasonable rationale for voting would be experience but thats hardly the reason why so many Hillary supporters are voting for McCain.  Some obama people have been inflamed the situation but a sensible voter would be looking at the issues anyways.   By the way another great site about the issues is votesmart.org...shows voting records for every bill with a brief descriptions and more...", 9184, "None", -2],
	85028 : ["You point out John McCains shortcomings, and as a devout, unapologetic, true conservative (no \"neo\" about it, although that's a stupid term anyway, kind of like \"liberal\" - has nothing to do with true liberalism) I have to agree, to a certain extent.  He's less than perfect, flat wrong about certain things, but needs to make no apologies for his statesmanship, nor his ethics. What I can't understand about this cult-like Obama obsession is that he represents the worst of the worst when it comes to symbolism over substance, and old time Chicago Dem corruption.  What are ya'll so fascinated with?  There's no change here....He can't ever seem to recall any of his closest associates and advisors illegal, corrupt, anti-American rhetoric and activities - people he has had relationships with for two decades and more.  Sounds like he took a  not-paying-attention pill from the Bush/Clinton (you pick) medicine cabinet - sorry, the Rev was just one guy, and I hate the political guilt by association game, but when you have friends who were members of the Weather Underground (murderers, make no mistake), and you add a big dose of Tony Rezko, with whom the Obama's are closely tied personally and professionally, you can't just say \"oh I'm all about change\" and expect anyone to believe it...unless, of course, you are an Ivy League elitist type who believes Americans are asleep and/or stupid (and based on the last four Presidential elections, I could go there).  Clearly, he is more of the same.  Only worse, because he is a Marxist in Democrat clothing.  That, above all else (and there are other things), renders him unqualified to be the President of a free nation.  If you want to be a Socialist and pay higher taxes, there are lots of countries you can move to.  You won't even have to  vote, your dictator will handle that for you.  You won't be bothered with that pesky constitution, either...what a relief from all that thinking and critical analysis. As far as the bitter Clintonistas - they've reaped what they've sown.  The Clintons trained the neo-Dems in a particularly ugly, brutal, cannibalistic form of combat politics that got them to the White House, and slapped down any and all opposition through their particular brand of ruthless destruction.  The problem with cannibals is they turn on their own when they're hungry.  Sorry, Hil, your delgates ate you for lunch.  Good luck getting them to vote for your guy, though,they won't stop gnashing their teeth for about two years - and then they'll blame George Bush (it doesn't matter which one, it's his fault). So, Obama, you are the PC candidate...a new religion as well as a new political party.  Gross, seriously.", 9184, "lf0YKX5Naa", 0],
	85029 : ["It's not a question of getting over anything - that is demeaning to supporters of both candidates and unfair. Rather it is a question of realizing which candidate - whether the nominee is Clinton or Obama - more closely represents their own positions. It should then become clear that Obama is far closer to Hillary than McCain will ever be. We do not need John McCain setting back Women's rights decades.", 9184, "HUoZxxhnaa", 0],

She's also a very GREEDY and conniving witch (note the laugh) who will tell everyone what they want to hear so she can become \"President again\" (her words, here's video to prove it) Transcript of video I think the fact that governors are being forced into this position is really unfortunate. They should not be making immigration policy. The federal government should be making immigration policy and that's what I'm going to try to do as president again and I do not believe that in the context of federal immigration reform that that would be an issue that governors would have to contend with.", 9181, "o1PuFnWmaa", 0],

	85053 : ["I have grown up dear, many years ago. Part of my maturing process was to make sure that I did not do something stupid like yanking a straight-party vote just because \"it's my party\".  Anyone who considers themselves to be educated enough to read the newspaper, should do the same thing.   McCain is not going to be responsible for the repeal of Roe v. Wade, nor is he going to be singlehandedly responsible for driving oil prices to $500/barrel, or bringing down the country.  I have heard these scare tactics before, I have been on this planet for a lot longer than you have, at least by the sound of it, and I am voting for *my* purposes, not my \"party's\" purposes.  Because I have a party, but my party's shenanigans, and my party's endorsement of a racist hatemonger, have driven me to the other party. And that, my dear, is just how it goes.  I would submit to you, to get your emotions in check, and stop your mindless droning.  That's just what Senator Obama wants, mindless rubber duckies bobbing downstream in his wake.  That way, he doesn't have to talk about issues, he can just say \"This way!\", and everyone will follow. Not what I consider a good decision, as an educated person.

Telling people who supported Clinton to grow up is very condescending and doesn't take into account their own reasons for not automatically switching to Obama.  Their reasons are every bit as valid to them as yours are to you.    Frankly, Hillary and her supporters have been badly treated throughout this primary.  Obama didn't have to do any negative campaigning himself because the media, the DNC, and the Obama supporters did it for him.   If you think that is a good kind of politics, you are going to live and learn.  I'm old and I understand the old style of campaigning.  There are good reasons for it that go beyond the obvious.

Perhaps if he had spent a few more years in the senate, had some foreign experience and things weren't nearly so dire, I might've jumped on the Obama bandwagon, but I don't think a man who, a year ago, said himself that he wasn't running for the presidency because he \"wasn't ready\" and has yet to even really prove himself in the senate is prepared to take over this nation's highest office in the shambles that Bush has left it in.
