Same answer as before: You may misunderstand what the Bible actually teaches about the reward of the saved and the fate of the wicked. Eventually, the vast majority of mankind will be offered the opportunity to be in the Kingdom of God.  Obedience is not necessarily a condition as much as it is a sign that we return the love that God bestows upon us. It is more our duty than a condition of God's love. 1John 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. There is no one in \"Hell\" right now cooking. Don't let anyone deceive you on this terribly misunderstood subject. THERE IS NOT ONE PERSON IN HELL BEING TORMENTED, nor will there be. The fate of the wicked is to be destroyed, not tortured. The nominal Christians make God out to be a cruel Being. He is not. The very concept of a hell where the wicked are being tortured and suffering continuously for all eternity flies in the face of a \"God is Love\" concept and is an infernal lie. Those who teach this concept are decieved. Edit: How in the false hell did I get 6 thumbs down over this?", 9313, "None", -2],

There can only be 2 reasons for this. #1. SHE wants something more, and thus is trying to hide that she is talking to you from her man, or #2. He is just insanely jealous and she is afraid of talking to ANY man would cause him to flip out.   Either of those is not good. If she has something for you, she needs to do the right thing and leave him and then spend some time recovering and then chat with you again to see if anything can be rekindled. That is the healthy thing to do. By allowing her to text you, you are accepting being the 'back up option'.  There is perhaps something going wrong between her and her man (Which according to the above statement, it is obvious).   If she just wants to be friends, then as a friend you need to tell her that hiding things from her man is not ok. And maybe then this will give her an opportunity for her to open up about WHY she is hiding things from him.  And you will find out more.

(there must be some problem for sure, she will say no, but back of the mind  she is thinking of some problem and if its not him then may other problem.) - need for someone to talk to her, on her conditions without asking questions (as u mentioned, she said dont text me unless she texts you first ) and she knows that you are up and you will reply to her. ( you are there or for support) - fear of something (unable to identify it or handle it ) - Confusion in her mind whats happening  all these reasons are interrelated and result in the situation you are in.
