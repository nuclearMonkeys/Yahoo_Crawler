Wear this bubble on your stomach with pride, see the positive side of this reality and know that you are giving another living thing the greatest gift anyone can give.  I don't believe in abortion, but that is your body, not mine.  Talk to your parents if you can, they might not be crazy jerks, who knows.

	70373 : ["Being married for 38 years there would have to be a lot of history between the two of you.  Think back and work out has her dominance only been occurring recently, or has she been this way for a long time? I would assume she has been this way for a while.  A person will only behave a certain way if they are allowed to \"get away with it\". It is not uncommon that a man, through love, and not wanting to cause waves will allow his wife to call the shots.  I guess too you would have spent most of your married life working and she tended to the house (only guessing)...so she sees it as her domain probably. You need to sit her down and just tell her, that this is an equal relationship with both you and her having an equal say.  She only has this power over you because you have allowed it.   It will be hard at first because its probably something you have never done before.  She will eventually take you seriously when you are consistent in your approach, e.g. when she says it is too early to blow your nose....blow your nose again, and say \"I will blow my nose when my nose needs blowing\"  When she complains that you dont wear undwear, say \"I dont tell you what to wear in your bed, please dont tell me what to wear in my own\".  When she puts your medication away, without a fuss, take it out from where she put it and put it back where you first put it.  Keep on doing this and she will finally get the message, that she is not the only one in this relationship. You have to be firm with her otherwise she will not change.  You need to change your tactics if you want her to change her behaviour. She needs to be reminded that you are not her possession but a real live human being with the same rights as any other human being.  This is not about hurting her feelings, its about asserting your rights.  She doesnt have any right, marriage or no marriage, to dominate you this way and the only way it is going to change, is for you to change your reactions...dont allow her to get her way all the time.  You dont have to do it in a rude way...Just state your case calmly, but most of all be consistent.  If she wants to argue with you....walk away...tell her you will discuss this with her when she is more calm.  Take charge, but because it has been so long with her getting her own way all the time, this change will take some time...that is why I have said consistency is the key...dont back down, be firm and in control.", 8552, "fe384cafe579f3f9cb80f160f8ec4df1aa", 0],
	70374 : ["Hun, calm down. I'm 14 too, except I had sex with my boyfriend, I was totally convinced I was prego, I showed some signs, in the end though, I wasn't at all. Please, calm down, everything will be okay. Take deep breathes, you're not pregnant, I promise. Take an ease, I know what it feels like. But everything will be okay, I'm not your mom, but I can be a friend. You just got the symptoms in your head, you think you are, so you body acts like you are, but for real, you're not. Try doing something, cooking, playing outside, shopping, etc, to get things off your mind. :) If you need to talk about it more, please email me at: ddrowing@yahoo.com.

	70375 : ["You can't possibly be pregnant if you had you period. And you stomach wouldn't be getting larger this early if you were. You've never had sex! You'll be fine. If it makes you feel better, go to the supermarket and buy a $10 pregnancy test.

	70380 : ["Sounds like MartyK and your wife should be together! We'd find out in a quick hurry who'd come out of the fighting ring. Anyway, I truly believe that you have more issues going on in this relationship than her being so bossy. Has the spark gone out of your relationship?  Do you do anything together? Is she bored with her life? Is she bored with you? Is she healthy?  Does she work outside of the home? How long has this been going on? (Since the beginning of your marriage or within the last few years)Do you just walk away from her when she tells you something, or do you let her know you have suggestions & feelings?  You both sound so unhappy. Is there any way you both could get into counseling? If not, I certainly don't feel that this marriage will make it much longer.  Good Luck to You.", 8552, "AA12297049", 0],
	70381 : ["Well, chances are u have allowed her to be like this for the past 38 yrs, thinking she's the boss of the house and it's highly unlikely she's going to change after all this time.  U can let her know how u feel of course but I doubt she will change her ways overnight.  Just stick it out.", 8552, "8b9ca41c1797ec30cf41973174711538aa", 0],
	70382 : ["Sounds like it's time to sweep her off her feet. Your marriage is in a rut and you need to really do something big to make her feal special. After 38 years- take her to Paris, Sydney or somewhere exotic. By doing this, you'll help rekindle that youthful love and she will be in a better place. Communication will probably flow better after that kind of gesture. Good luck.", 8552, "f5f2b74dabec2ba1228e5c57ec1c6370aa", 0],

If she's the one that does all the cleaning, I can understand her wanting things her way, wouldn't it just be easier to put the things away yourself, rather than have her nitpick at you because you didn't?   She sounds fed up. Maybe she feels unappreciated?  38 years.....that's a long time, convicted murderers usually get less time.", 8552, "7a60b5fd43183f696a47e589fef5e146aa", -1],
