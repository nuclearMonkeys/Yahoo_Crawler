	50893 : ["The elite is faking that they took the real vaccine; the real vaccine will cause spiritual and physical damage. When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 7157, "None", -1],

	50908 : ["There's lots of differences. The first and most obvious is that Windows commands are Windows programs and MS-DOS commands are MS-DOS programs. You cannot run Windows programs in MS-DOS, and 64-bit versions of Windows can't run MS-DOS programs without an emulator.   The second major difference is what commands will be available in each operating system. Saying \"Windows commands and MS-DOS commands are the same\" is false, because many commands available in one will not be available in another. MS-DOS does not include ping or systeminfo, for example, and modern Windows does not have DEBUG or EDIT. But I think the real issue is your need to try to compare them in the first place.  Anybody old enough to have used MS-DOS has had 20+ years to learn how the Command Prompt works. And people who are learning about the Command Prompt for the first time do not need to know about MS-DOS. So what if the commands are superficially similar in output? Lots of operating systems have command interpreters. People keep calling the Command Prompt in Windows the \"DOS Prompt\", and perpetuate the myth that Windows is still somehow based on or reliant on legacy code from 1981.
