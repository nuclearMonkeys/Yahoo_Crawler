They are cowards who only very thinly veil their hatred of gays with their false and unsound teachings.   The two great commandments are love God with all your mind heart and soul, and love your neighbor as yourself.  You do not break any of the ten commandments if you follow the two great commandments.  Examples:  sex with kids wasn't spoken of by Jesus, but it is against the second great commandment because even kids are our neighbors, and we know that molesting them does them harm.  There is no love in that.  Adultery, same thing.  You are not loving your neighbor when you have sex with his spouse, and you are not loving their spouse if you are causing them to break their marriage vows.

	95281 : ["Could be that the number of souls, are way over a few billion...maybe trillions or more....and have not yet began THEIR journey to Earth. Mr Newton is talking about karma here, but the reason for Reincarnation itself, is that souls became corrupted, (they too have Free Will) during the Creation of Earth....and these souls then need to be cleansed before being allowed to return to the grace of God.  Using humans as the means to be cleansed, the sould progress upward in goodness, until they reach the required stage of purity, where they then do not return to Earth...their task is finished. The task is a difficult one, seeing how humans can be good or bad...this affects the soul and can cause the soul to regress in stead of progress, if the person is not a real good person.  I think God's plan is not for humans to go to Heaven, but for the souls to return to Heaven.  But the soul, is like a bus...it will hold all the consciences of the humans it has been with. And these then, go to Heaven, when the soul finally reaches that destination.  So, in essence, our living consciences will be in Heaven, within the soul we were with.  God's plan, therefore, has no TIME limits, He will allow all souls to eventually return, however long that may take.  As Newton claims, souls can choose a body prior to returning to earth, using the Karma from the previous person, to choose someone that will help balance the new person.  If for instance, the previous person was a bigot, and hated black people, the soul might choose a black family to be with in the next life, to help balance out the karma.", 9540, "cefa4b46f9dbacdc72ace097afb9b897aa", 0],

What you've described sounds very difficult to cope with on your own, and I would urge you to think if there is anyone you could talk to about how you're feeling. You talked to your Mum before, could you try and do that again? I feel fairly sure she would want to know you are feeling this way. If you find it difficult, you could show her this to make a start. If you can't do that, how about a friend, or maybe someone at school, like a counsellor or nurse? The hyper/tired thing sounds exhausting. I think it would be a really good idea to make an appointment at the Docs . . with or without Mum. It sounds like type of depression, which could be treatable. This may make a difference to how you're feeling right now. It sounds like you are in a pretty bad place at the moment, and I would very much like to think of you asking someone for help.
