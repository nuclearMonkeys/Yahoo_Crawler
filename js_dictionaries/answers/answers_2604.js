	136028 : ["Children younger than Shannon have given evidence in court. This is usually done via video link, so that they are not in the actual courtroom where they may be facing the accused. It is vital for the fairness of the trial that the jury not only have a previous statement, but that they hear first hand testimony so that they can compare the two for inconsistencies. In this case, I believe that Shannon did not appear in court. This is exeptional as she was the only real witness. The inconsistencies from the prosecution are worth looking into. e.g. first saying that Shannon had not been harmed, then claiming after the trial that she had been drugged and was lucky to be alive.   None of this means that the accused were not guilty, but it is a shabby way to conduct a trial where everything possible should be done to make sure the truth is established. It was full of opinions, theories and hearsay. ", 11312, "axZJJ3Evaa", 0],
	136029 : ["I've not heard nor read anything which says that she was in court nor that she has given a statement. Probably the prosecution have only had to rely on the statements she gave at the time she was found to the Police.

Large or small serving bowls, turn a cake cover upside down, you might use a pretty pitcher or a small fish bowl.  It really depends on the flowers and what kind of a statement you want to make.  Consider the occassion and how big of a piece you want and go from there.  You could put single flowers in small glasses and spread them down a table, or fill a shallow bowl with floating flower tops.  Or set a not-so-attractive vessel down into a nice basket.

	136045 : ["She no doubt was interviewed by the police...with an adult there for her of course. But producing children in court is fraught with problems.....not that the child may not be speaking the truth, but the English adversarial cross examination system is very hard on children and they don't tend to do well in the witness box. The prosecution would probably try and avoid that if they could, it wouldn't do them any favours....and by the looks of the case they didn't really need to. So...simply no need to produce the child in court to make the case.", 11312, "24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa", 4],
