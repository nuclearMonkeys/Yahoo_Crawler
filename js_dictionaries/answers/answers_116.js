The US Government is NOT printing more dollars to pay for the stimulus.    What is concerning is the increased national debt. USA has a massive economy to deal with the debt, debt to gdp ratio is not as detrimental for the US government as it is for many other western countries, or Japan for example.    But if we continue to increase our national debt it could decrease our national credit score which will make lending more difficult for consumers, thus hurting the private sector. ", 966, "xHsQFPsBaa", 1],
