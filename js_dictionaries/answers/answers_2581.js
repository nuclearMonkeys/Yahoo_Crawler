	134911 : ["After 27 years as a Marine with 22 as an officer, I have no Cons.  I only have Pros. 1.  Once commissioned, complete The Basic School, excel in MOS school, you are assigned a unit of troops that are under your command.  Most likely, you would be assigned Executive Officer of a platoon (both infantry and MP which has few unrestricted officers - most of them are warrant officers and limited duty officers).  You job will be to ensure that the Platoon meets all training requirements dictated by the Company Commanding Officer and to make sure your Platoon Commander (1stLt) is never blindsided by anything going amiss.  The Platoon must always be ready for the unexpected, the responsibility is the Platoon Commander's, but the execution is the XO. 2.  Once you get promoted and you have demonstrated excellence in leadership and management skills, you then become the Platoon Commander and are responsible and ACCOUNTABLE for everything your platoon does and doesn't do.  Each Marine is your personal responsibility and the XO and Staff NCOs help you meet Company and Battalion expectations.  Screw up and you will be relieved - this is where a few careers end. 3.  Same process as you climb the rank ladder to Company CO (XO and then CO - XO = senior 1stLt; CO=Captain).  The level of responsibility has multiplied by more than a factor of 3 (1 platoon = approx 50 Marines; 1 Company = 3 platoons plus support attachments from Weapons Company).  Ditto for Battalion (LtCol = CO and XO; Majors are Sections heads; Captains are learning to be Majors at Battalion level).  Regiment is next level up (Colonel, and occurs after more than 20 years in the Corps). Raise a family - yep as most of us have.  Will you be home a lot to help your wife raise that family, not likely.  When you and your unit are not in the field, aboard a Navy ship as part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit, or deployed to combat, you hours will be dictated by the training plan.  The other gent threw 1630 down as a end of day number.  The further up the ranks you get that number gets bigger e.g. 1830 or later and office time is 0600 or sometimes earlier.  Much depends on the unit, training schedule and level of responsibility assigned by the Commanding Officer (both infantry and MP). Where stationed for MP is any Marine Base or Air Station.  Infantry:  Camp Pendleton, 29 Palms, Camp Lejeune, Okinawa (several different Camps), in near future - Guam, possibly Australia (1 Battalion now there full time), aboard ship on a MEU,combat zone. If you are really good, you could be selected for advanced military schools like the War College, Command and Staff, Amphibious Warfare School, or even sent to the Naval Postgraduate School to get your Masters Degree and then work in that field for 3 years at Headquarters Marine Corps (like me). Lieutenant Colonel, U S Marine Corps-Retired (27 great years in and out of combat, shipboard ops, and moving an average of every 2 years).", 11249, "uP8GuH2daa", 0],

	134913 : ["Based only on my experience, I guess Warrants are not too high up to be responsible for $hit, but yet, they still get the respect from officers & enlisted unlike junior officers. When I was assigned to EODMU2, there was a Warrant in that command. I noticed that in the morning, he would walk around the building, just chitchatting with different people. In the afternoon, he would be taking a nap at his desk. And at 1500, he would just go home. Until this day, I still do not know, exactly, what his job was at that command. I remember asking my LPO once about his job and the LPO just told me not to bother him (I guess my LPO did not know either).", 11262, "hwbtEVFHaa", 0],
	134914 : ["There is plenty of desk work for everyone.  For some reason the posts on this site seem to feel to get into action you need to be an EM or a WO.  There are plenty of tomb stones in Arlington that mark the graves of lieutenants and plenty of sergeants that have hemorrhoids from sitting behind a desk.  I spent 28 years commissioned service in the Navy.  I have been retired for many years.  I served in the Vietnam era.  I have many ROTC classmates on the wall as well as brother's in Scabbard and Blade (an inter-service honorary fraternity.)  Of the seven guys from my detachment and fraternity 4 were lieutenants (all helicopter pilots 3 Army 1 Marine) one guy dropped out of school to enlist and was an Army W0-1 helicopter.  Both the Marine and one Army guy died as the result of accidents and not as casualties of combat.  One was a Navy pilot who died in a Camp.  He was shot down as an 0-2 but was listed as MIA for many years and was promoted to 0-5 before he was declared KIA in 1972.  The last was a fellow who dropped out to enlist and was KIA as a spec4.  There is plenty of death to go around regardless of your rank.  There is also no way that after becoming a CWO or an NCO that desk work can be avoided.", 11262, "PBaL7dBlaa", 0],
