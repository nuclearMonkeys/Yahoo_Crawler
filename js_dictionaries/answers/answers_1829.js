	97189 : ["1) After a year of body building and training, you decide to climb Mt. Everest. When you land in Tibet to meet up with your climbing troop, you notice Marian Gaborik. Totally stoked, you ask him to be your climbing partner on the hike up Everest. While on the mountain the 1st day, Gaborik explains that he has a fifth of vodka, a huge sausage, a Gatorade, and a block of cheddar stuffed in his pack, for a celebration when you guys reach the summit. Now that stuff is not very heavy, but it starts to feel like a million pounds after a day. So, the next day while hiking up the mountain, you have to leave TWO of the four items behind. You must keep up with the group, so you do not have time to consume the items. What 2 items do you leave? - I'd lose Gaborik and the vodka. Hey, I'm a Flyers fan. 2) Your cousin is the equipment manager for your local AHL team. One night you decided to bring your cousin out to dinner, so after work you go down to the RINK to meet up with him. You get there, and walk through the locker room to find him on the ground, juicing an orange with the Aldege “Baz” Bastien Memorial Award. You have no idea how he obtained the trophy, but he was jamming an orange in the top of it. After smacking him in the back of the head, he pulls away the orange, and you can see the trophy is seriously damaged. You cousin asks you to be the scapegoat, and say that you damaged the trophy, so that he can keep his job. What do you do?  - \"Hmmm, SCAPEGOAT eh? Well, that's gonna cost ya. Season tickets at center ice, 20 rows back, and you drive me to the games and back. Oh, one more thing.  Prepare to get your *** kicked.\" 3) Since you are so freaking wealthy, you have decided to hire a maid. You call a maid service, and they said they would send over a housecleaner, so that you can have an interview and go over what needs to be cleaned in your pad. The doorbell rings, and when you open the door, there is Vincent Damphousse! Shocked that he is a maid, he explains that he was bored in his retirement, new bachelor life, and he had always like cleaning, so he was just doing it to keep busy. Feeling awkward, you show him what you would like spick and span. He comes back the next day, to tidy your house. Do you give him a beer? OR do you let him clean, heck, you're paying him?  - I'd have the old Broad Street Bullies (Schultz, Saleski, Kelly, Dupont, Van Impe) waiting behind the furniture to pound the living fairy out of him while I record it for YouTube.

	97190 : ["re: \"scared that God won't answer as quickly as he did last time because I feel like I only turn to God when I need him\" Dont avoid doing something good, simply because you know theres something better. Do good in any way you can. Turn to God in prayer at any chance you can. And stop with the mindless, thoughtless, verbatim crap. Guess what, God knows your prayers by heart... maybe he'd like to hear from YOU sometime. Tell him openly about your problems, speak to him like a real person who is really listening. Pour out your heart and frustration and gratitude and everything. Stop holding back because you feel guilty. That is a tactic of satan, not God. If you want to reconnect, do it. Keep trying, dont get frustrated if you dont get a beam of light from heaven after a conversation or two. And when you have done this, just be quiet and still for a little while. Give him the chance to respond through inspiration after. When you have a conversation with someone you dont just yackyackyack and then walk away. You let them respond. Give him that opportunity too. I can promise you, life will get infinitely harder for you beyond grades and boys someday. Your relationship with God will make more difference in your life during those times than you can imagine.

It's not fun to feel the way you're feeling, but its a lot easier to risk taking medication and seeing if they work. Granted the first, second, even third option might not help completely, but it does eventually make things a little easier to cope with.

I practice with them by taking them out in the community little steps at a time, in addition to them taking medication and receiving talk therapy. I agree with the first commenter. What you need to do is contact a mental health clinic. They'll ask you lots of questions on your history, family, symptoms, etc.  Its okay to feel anxious while you are there. We are used to dealing with it, so there is no need to feel ashamed.  They'll help you find the help you need. They may recommend talking to a psychiatrist to prescribe meds and they might also suggest a counselor or therapist.  Once you get started, it won't be as scary. You might actually feel relieved when its time for your appointments. You definitely are not alone in feeling like this. There are so many people out there like you.

All I have consistently used is mascara and lip gloss.  On special occasions I have put a light eye shadow on and some blush also very light.

You are supposed to have a natural look.  I think that when it make you look very old, then you are not using a moisturizer and you are letting the makeup wear you, instead of you wearing the makeup.... meaning, people cake too much on their face at one time..... some people put so much on, that it be enough to wear that same makeup for a whole entire week!

Whether you believe in the teachings or not, the \"Christian\" thing to do is to be helpful or to be kind to others. I have let Baptist missionaries into my home, I have let Jehovah's Witnesses into my home.
