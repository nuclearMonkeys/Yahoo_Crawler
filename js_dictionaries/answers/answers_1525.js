The author may seem to push how exceptional and wonderful the \"Mary Sue\" character is on his or her audience, sometimes leading the audience to dislike or even resent the character fairly quickly; such a character could be described as an \"author's pet\".", 9081, "miJdUGlgaa", 5],

	81931 : ["I think before you form a relationship with a woman, you should think about her sex life.  Women have needs that you aren't interested in fulfilling.  So I wouldn't recommend dating a woman unless she's assexual.   Also, I'm curious why you don't find men attractive?  For me it was pretty basic.  From middle school on I knew that I liked guys.  It's kind of scary.  It took me years to be really comfortable with it, but there's nothing wrong with liking guys.  Maybe you are bi, and are attracted to men physically and women emotionally, but in my experience this is very rare.  More commonly with guys in your situation, they were just afraid of their sexuality. Either way, I don't think you have to be afraid or nervous about any of this stuff.

I even recall telling my band director when I was a freshman that I wanted to be drum major some day. All I really remember about my audition is that I maintained eye contact with the band. I didn't bury myself in the music (I'm pretty sure there was some in front of me.) I didn't gaze off into nowhere. I looked band members in the eye. Just remember: There's more to being drum major than just conducting well, calling out commands well and marching. It's a leadership position. You don't just stand on the podium and conduct and your job ends when the band exits the field. It's way more than that. Hopefully you have displayed good leadership qualities to your band director over the years. Being a captain or section leader previously helps, though I didn't have that experience so don't worry about that. I wish I could be more helpful, but it seriously has been a very long time!!! Good luck, and don't be nervous. Stand before the band with confidence and don't forget to BREATHE!!!!!", 9092, "None", 0],

I really could have used some of my short stories to help out with my novel, and now they're gone forever! I've tried restoring my system, but that didn't work. So, no, I don't keep a lot of my writing. I keep the papers I wrote in school that have my teacher's comments on them for future references and I have one or two of my short stories that were handwritten for class this year. Other than that, all of my writing has been deleted besides the first chapter of my most current novel. I would recommend that writer's keep all of their writing and not make the same mistake that I did. They will regret it forever (I know I do deeply)! BQ: The author's that I know of are the ones most (key word: most) people have never really heard of before.

	81945 : ["Writing is something I personally love. I have a large imagination and ideas flow into my head time and time again and with a little planning, a story can be made out of them. They're fun to work on and sometimes the longer it takes, the better. I love getting to see how my characters progress and when I complete a book, it gives me a sense of achievement. Even if I don't share the book with my friends or post it on websites, it doesn't stop me from writing more. It is actually really enjoyable to many people and it can get their feelings across in a creative and exciting way. It is quite calming to write too, I often either listen to music while writing or just focus in silence. It takes me to a whole world which I created and control. I can write about anything at all, there are no limits, you can run free. Writing can be done anywhere and anytime, and I love it. Reading creates freedom in a similar way.

I can imagine what's going on as I read it. I build on what I see, what I think, what I know. In writing, I can express myself. How I'm feeling and what I'm thinking. It helps me vent any emotions I'm feeling. If I'm angry, I can write something with a lot of action. If I'm happy, I can write a more passionate scene.  Reading and writing are everything to me.

	81951 : ["2/10 Why is the language and the content so archaic? The repetition of 'Let us go' is more jarring than making it seem like it has a deeper meaning, which I feel is what you intend to portray. The world 'flirt' doesn't fit with the style of language and sounds crude..generally the  whole of  that line is a bad line... the goats have no relevance to the rest of the poem. There seems to be little common theme in the piece other than flying around on an eagle. I don't understand why you have tried to make a really old sounding poem. Poetry doesn't have to be archaic. 'The heat means you require a fan.' < This is the worst line and is really forced The use of rhyming couplets with rhyme and half-rhyme makes you force words to fit even if other words would be better. It doesn't reflect contemporary poetry or life at all and it doesn't really make much sense. And rhyming couplet suck. The use of 'We' and 'Let' makes the speaker sound almost biblical which irritates me more as it makes the author seem over-pompous. Also it should be birds' not bird's. And soar, not sour. 'Where there be'.. also grammatically terrible, even if you are playing with grammatical structure then it doesn't fit with the rest of the poem as it is inconsistent and sounds like the speaker has randomly become a pirate. Sorry if this is harsh but if you put it up on the internet expect my honest criticism, not unfounded flattery. EDIT: You do need practice as you even spelt 'practice' wrong. Everybody needs practice so stop being so big headed. And if you didn't want criticism then why ask for it? Also by saying 'critics' I'm assuming you are referring to people giving you constructive criticism rather than just writing '10/10' - 'Critics' means everyone who debates about a poem, not just negative ones. Why are you so arrogant - 'If you LOVE this then check out my others'...'I need OTHER wise writers to have a conversation with'(from your other question). And saying you don't need practice... What point are you proving exactly? Stop fancying yourself as a really profound writer, with your picture with the library background.. You have a long way to go, starting with your attitude.
