I know I composed a fairly long poem (over twenty lines, anyway) about how much I liked eating fried fish on Fridays when I was about eight years old. Most of my friends really enjoyed it, and learned verses off by heart - I enjoyed the feeling of notoriety. When I was fourteen and on holiday I met a man around my grandfather's age who claimed he was at school with Dylan Thomas (this could certainly have been true). He got me interested in Dylan Thomas' poetry, and from there it is a short step into serious modern poetry. Later I met Robert Lowell, W H Auden, Bob Cobbing, Christopher Logue, Jeremy Prynne ..... and actually made friends with Harri Webb, John Tripp, Nigel Jenkins, Gillian Clarke ..... I've been very lucky .... in fact, I still am (I had a short conversation with Les Murray - Australia's greatest ever poet - only a few years ago).", 11591, "fd2bb1157c643131beb3c4a1c8160311aa", -1],
