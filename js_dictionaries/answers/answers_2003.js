Or try a dog shampoo for dandruff. I like shampoo with oatmeal, leave it on for ten minutes and massage the shampoo in while you wait rinse and use a good conditioner. You can try adding a little coconut oil to her food as well, I give my dogs a little on top of their dry kibble and they love it. Omega's may be lacking? If your dog has seen the vet and they have suggested nothing then it will be up to you to see if you can figure out whats causing it....Or get a second opinion. :) Good Luck with your baby :)", 9939, "None", 0],

Check with the airlines.  You will need a HARD carrier (think pet taxi) that is just big enough for the animal to stand and turn around in. Fly him as early in the day as possible to avoid heat on the runway and at any layovers. Don't feed him breakfast the morning of the flight, as you don't want him vomiting in his crate.  Do freeze water in a clip-on bowl and you can usually place some kibble in a ziplock bag with the crate; duct-tape it on or some crates have exterior compartments. Make sure he has on ID tags (better yet, microchip him) and also that the crate is clearly marked with your name & contact number, your moms name & number, his name, etc.  You can put an old t-shirt of yours in the crate with him. Most airlines require a current health certificate (no more than 10 days old) This is a good time of year to ship animals; there are restrictions (mostly due to temperatures on the runways) but you should be free of those now.  The airlines usually put them on lt and take them off first.  The baggage compartments are pressurized and climate controlled, but not until you get in the air from what I understand. Other options might be to fly yourself and ship the car, or perhaps better yet; sell the car, both of you fly, and get another more dependable vehicle when you arrive.", 9943, "B0pud0roaa", 1],

Thirdly, be aware that your dog is going to be flying as checked luggage or cargo, and if the airport is small enough, they won't take him since the small planes don't have large enough cargo bays.

I did a lot of research on doggie dandruff & found a whole bunch of possible causes before realizing it was the flea treatment. It is good to research & find the possible causes of the dandruff before visiting the vet, because lets face it there vets not csi detectives, only you know what your dog comes in contact with. But vets will give you CORRECT advise as apposed to web site forums! A few recommendations however that you need to know! 1.Do not wash your dog more the 2 times a month, otherwise you will strip the natural oils in their coat which leads to even dryer skin! not good! however depending on the type of coat of your dog it is essential to stop the dandruff from over accumulating, so brushing & no more then 2 baths a month. 2.Hair Cut. a number 2 all over helps prevent the  dandruff build up & much it is esier to wash the dog. 3.Theire is anti dandruff shampoo out there to help the skin heal itself. The dandruff problem will take weeks to heal so don't be put off if results are not immediate. hope this helps!", 9939, "BehaIPAcaa", 1],

	105939 : ["Although the above answers basically give you magazine times, real world times for a 2005 GTO is in the high 12's to the low 13's range. The long article provided to you by one of the members is on a 2004 GTO with a 350HP LS1 motor.  2005 GTO's came with the 400HP LS2 motor.  Even then, real world times put 2004 GTO in the mid to high 13's range. Also consider that the driver's skill is a huge factor in 1/4 mile times.  Low 12's in a 05 GTO are possible, but the driver has to be real good.  Low 13's is easily achievable.  In a 2004 GTO low 13'a are possible as well with a real good driver but 13.4 to 13.7 is more correct for the average driver. For any person to be pulling out 14 to 14.5 1/4 mile times, they must really suck at drag racing and should immediately stop doing it.  And for those that might jump in here and start saying those times are for modified GTO's, well I'm here to tell you, the times I mentioned for real world drag racing are for stock GTO's.", 9945, "AA10772043", 0],

	105941 : ["There is no BEST pain relief medication.  Each patient has a need for the medication which best meets the needs of their condition, level of pain, and other related medical conditions.  For many with an ACL injury, management with a Non-steriodal anti-inflammatory agent such as ibuprofen (MOTRIN) naproxen (Aleve) or a COX-2 such as celecoxib (Celebrex) control the discomfort and increases function.  For others, their condition or pain tolerance requires a stronger medication such as tramadol or even hydrocodone.  These last 2, however are both opioid medications and may be habit forming, therefore, they are usually preferred for use in patients in the immediate pre and postoperative periods. If surgery has been recommended, the physician should recommend appropriate medication, if it does not control the pain, contact your physician and ask for something stronger. I will tell you that when people approach a physician with a particular medication in mind, they are often thought of as \"drug seeking\", even when they are earnestly trying to manage their pain.  Discuss the pain with your physician and let them prescribe an appropriate medication.", 9944, "DisdrG4Taa", 2],

Remember the dog will not be let out of the crate so it will have to go potty in the crate. The crate will need to be big enough for the dog bed and a place for the puppy pad. Is your dog used to going on puppy pads?? If not the poor thing may get confused. I sent my dog on a plane once and I would never do it again. My dog was always calm and gentle. When I picked the dog up she was so hyper and so very nervous. That has been many years though so I think they don't put the dogs up close to the engines as they used to. Plus the area was cold and not pressurized. I would make sure and ask them when you call. You will need to make sure the dog can get to water. There is a bowl that will attach to the crate for the dog's water. You might want to call your Vet  to ask if he could give your dog something to help calm the dog since it is going on a trip. Your dog will need time to adjust when it gets to its new destination. Good Luck P.S. You are one good pet owner taking your dog with you. Lucky dog!!!!!", 9943, "None", 1],
