	65692 : ["I think that it depends on the situation. I feel that the father has the right to have a say in the situation. There needs to be a compromise. No one likes going through agonizing pain but in that case they should keep their legs closed. Make sure the woman isn't doing it for selfish reasons and if she is try to lean her to a different point of view. If you find that it is because she is scared, confused, or has health problems with her family delivering babies such as frequent still births, miscarrages, and the likes try to support her. When I was 15, I took the morning after pill. It wasn't that I didn't want to have a baby. My mother almost died having all three of her kids. One of her kids did die. It was devestating and scary for me. I couldn't imagine having a baby that was already dead and at the age 15 I did not feel I could handle it emotionally. I decided to keep my next two after realizing if I had to take the morning after pill after every mishap in bed, I would never find out. I had to do some hard investigating after that. I regret taking that step almost ten years ago and would never do it again. Don't expect woman to be strong about something like this. Losing a child or having the reality that you and or the baby could die is a scary thing--in this case it should be up to the woman. Most other cases, I believe if the father wants to raise this baby to be and the mother doesn't, well there should be court orders preventing woman from killing a baby.", 8301, "iOSx7O9eaa", 0],
	65693 : ["I have to ask, have you ever seen an ultrasound? The ones of my kids at twenty weeks don't look remotely human, I could only tell which part was the head because the ultrasound tech pointed it out to me. Leaving aside any morality issues, I don't think this idea would have the practical effect that you desire of making the baby seem more human.", 8301, "08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa", 0],

	65700 : ["Absolutely. I was originally undecided which of the two evils was less evil. Palin's position on Choice and contraceptives made it easy to not choose her.", 8302, "None", 3],
	65701 : ["NO! I'm 100% for letting the little heart-beating, eye-blinking, leg-kicking babies LIVE!!! Just a note to Haley, who answered on here... Haley, your answer is ridiculous beyond anything! You say Palin believes women should be stuck in the 50's, behind the stove and having babies?!!!!! I'm not trying to make you feel bad, but seriously, open your eyes! She wouldn't have even been a mayor or a governor if she believed that! She's the woman who DOES IT ALL!!!!! Before she came into the picture as v.p. choice, she's the exact type of woman all the democrats want to see in America! Now, however, they back away from that image because Palin 's a threat to their party! Dems ... you can't always win, no matter how often you change your tune! This time, it'll be McCAIN & PALIN 2008 going down in the history books!!!!!", 8302, "ea57331baf4a18f47dbbd6f150a03a4faa", -6],

	65703 : ["You are using an answer of mine...did I give you permission to do that?  My answers are trademarked you know... lol Anyways, my answer would be the same. Why make an already agonizing decision any harder? That would be undue and cruel pressure that a women in that situation doesn't need.", 8301, "kB7Wuyknaa", -2],

	65709 : ["The simple answer to your question is no, but if it were only that simple.  If he doesn't stop bringing up race he's going to cease being seen as the Democratic candidate and begin being seen as the \"black\" candidate, and that's a terrible road for him to go down.  If he's going to be above it, then he needs to stop giving the idea credence by talking about it so much.  I'm hearing more and more Democrats who were just starting to warm up to him backing up the bus again because he can't seem to shut up about it.  Someone in his campaign should be smart enough, hell, HE should be smart enough, to know in order to stay above it he can't fricking keep talking about it.  How can he not understand that keeping the subject alive does nothing but hurt him.  Let those who think race is a legitimate factor sound like fools while he and the rest of us go about our business.  What is so hard about that?  What he's now creating is a whole new issue where people are saying HE'S playing the race card, HE'S trying to paint those who don't vote for him as racists, HE'S the one who seems to be race obsessed.  I don't think any of that is true, but he's not helping the situation, he's making it worse.  Not very smart on his part, this could really hurt him because perception is everything in politics.", 8303, "None", 1],

	65713 : ["I would answer that it appears that everyone else is attacking him for his non action on Louisiana.  I bet if it was near Hawai'i it would be completely different.  Palin lives in Alaska - the state that suffered from Exxon Valdez spill, so she has seen first hand what inaction can do to an area that was once pristine.  Even James Carville - Clinton's strategist and prominent Democrat who knows how to position his party to win, was attacking Obama.

	65720 : ["Obama's campaign seems to be determined to keep his race at the forefront and I'm not certain what their motive is.  They appear to think they can demonize the opposition by planting the idea that they are the racists when, in actuality, it is the Obama campaign.

	65722 : ["Umm...no one else's race is an issue.  John McCain is caucasian and every president has been a caucasian male...so where is the issue.  If a Latino, Asian, Native American, etc were running, then race would certainly be an issue for that candiate.   Had Sen. Clinton won, then her gender would be an issue.  If a man in a wheelchair had won then his disability would be an issue.  Race is something different in this race and it is a heated issue in America. And, I've frequently heard him speak of his caucasian mother and grandparents and the significant role they played in making him the man he is today.  What have you been listening to and reading.

He began the issue of skin color and prejudice  himself with his own mouth when he entered the presidential race.  He called his own grandmother a racist while he himself in his own book gives vile epithets to others of skin color different than his own.   I would like to make a larger issue of his religion problems as those are endemic to this country and show his personal deepest character as well.  A mans choice of religion proves who he really is as well as the people he surrounds himself with for twenty years as well as the people he now surrounds himself with in his campaign as well as all the people he throws away as used paper towels when they prove they are not enough to help him achieve his goal of the presidency of the United States of America  and whatever else he has hidden.", 8303, "JWJ0CyWWaa", 2],
	65732 : ["Nope.  The Clinton campaign did, but the Republicans have gone out of their way to be nice to him.  The RNP recently banished a vendor for life from their convention for selling racist crap, McCain has openly pledged to not use smear attacks against Obama and kicked Bill Cunningham's a.s.s for throwing \"H-Bombs\" around and Mike Huckabee warned against the Republicans trying to demonize Obama for any reason. Bottom line, Obama is race-baiting.  If he had said this during the primaries when he was running against Clinton (whose campaign WAS bigoted), it might have made sense.", 8303, "None", 2],

Florida and Michigan delegates being sat at the convention when the DNC said \"NO WAY - if you have your election early\" and all candidates INCLUDING HILLARY signed off on it.  But now that she is in trouble she is fighting for those delegates to be sat.  Also the fact that superdelegate(old inside washington congressmen, senators, governors, ex presidents, etc..)can cast their vote for whomever, basic arm twisting, favor granting/repaying, deal making...not by how the popular vote of their state went.  This is all true.  And no courts get involved in Political fights...its up to the party. BUT...Howard Dean, I do not think will risk a broken convention.  Or splitting the party.  They are all thrilled the YOUNG have come out, the NEW voters to the Party, the INDEPENDENTS.  No... Maybe if Obama has not proven a substantial lead by end of March...Florida and Michigan will have to hold a caucus.  Which Hilliary and her supporters (even in Florida are fighting against) cause she does not perform well in that arena. But do not worry...not yet...have faith.
