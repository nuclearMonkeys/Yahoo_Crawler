	6320 : ["Child abuse is a grave sin. 5 A sin against the victim. It is a sin to inflict unjust pain and suffering on others. As we will see in the next article, the child abuser does just that—he hurts the child in devastating ways. He betrays the child's trust, robbing the child of his or her security. Children must be protected from such a wicked deed, and those who have been victimized by it need comfort and help.—1 Thess. 5:14. Many abuse victims suffer an array of symptoms, including depression. Some also seethe with persistent and at times overwhelming feelings of guilt, shame, and rage. Other victims may suffer emotional shutdown, an inability to express or even feel emotion. Low self-esteem and feelings of powerlessness also afflict many. In God's new world, when poverty will be no more, all children will enjoy an unhurried and unharassed childhood, which is their God-given right. This will mean not only the end of child abuse but also the end of all the painful memories that mar people's lives today: “The former things will not be called to mind, neither will they come up into the heart.”—Isaiah 65:17.", 1040, "GpRxwcNcaa", 0],

	6330 : ["The elite is faking that they took the real vaccine; the real vaccine will cause spiritual and physical damage. When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 1045, "None", 0],

	6346 : ["This is usually the early signs of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, but it's not necessarily so bad. It's good that you can talk about it, so don't turn it out to drama, explain to her that she doesn't have to be frightened, and it's early to make any conclusions with certainty. Tell her to simply and loud say STOP to this voices, instead to encourage them or \"investigate\" about, and if it doesn't stop, then she should do something about it. Teenage years are anywhere from 11, or 12 to 20. Psychosis usually showing up in the later teenage age, 16 - 18, rarely before.

It can be very difficult to ever feel safe after it happens for a lot of people. Some people need extensive therapy to cobble together their lives again, so if they act different or have “changed” you need to have some compassion for them. It is really like being shell shocked or as they call it now, post traumatic stress disorder. And like soldiers who have been to war, very few want to talk about it.  They've been through too much. And a lot of the families have members who come back from war as very different people.  Rape survivors are often traumatized in the same way. ", 1023, "hBCdw91Xaa", 1],
