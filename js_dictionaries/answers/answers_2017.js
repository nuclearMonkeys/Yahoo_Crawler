You will need: leftover ham cut into small pieces a large onion diced 5 or 6 pieces of celery diced 1 bag great northern beans 2 cans of tomato soup a pinch of salt and pepper 1 ham bone 1 bag of carrots sliced in bite sized pieces Fill a stockpot about half way with water. Add the onion, celery, carrots, beans and ham bone in. Let cook on medium flame until beans are cooked well. then add the ham and cook an addition 30 minutes. Add the tomato soup and cook about 30 more minutes. And your done! This only takes one pot to make so clean up is fairly easy. And I make enough that we can have it for 2 nights. After you make it you can freeze the second nights worth, so another night you can have a home cooked meal without any prep work. This soup is very hearty and I serve it as a main meal with a nice garden salad on the side. Hope I helped, Enjoy your holiday and your meal!", 9963, "GGICLrs2aa", 0],

	106612 : ["Sorry, but I can NOT help you with your faith or lack of it... Personally, I have NO faith in faith... What has happened here, is you finally wised up to the FACT there is no evidence to support the claims made by religion in the name of god. You have become aware of logic and how to USE it to find reasons WHY things are the way are. You have questions and you want answers. Science provides answers, answers you can see for yourself. Religion provides NO answers to any questions at all. You are questioning the claims of religion and looking for reasons WHY you should believe the religions when they say there is a god. Religion is like a charge of murder. Religion would convict simply on word alone, simply because they SAY SO, without the smoking gun or any other evidence for that matter or even a body!. Since their first claim, that there is a god, has NO evidence, no smoking gun so to speak, ALL of the rest that rely on this singular claim is also suspect. Logic says that there can't be a heaven or hell without there first being a god and a devil. You can't pick and choose a part of religion to believe. It is all or nothing based on that singular claim that there is a god. Everything in religion stems from that one claim, that there is a god, and if you can't prove there is or ever  was a god, then how can ANY of the rest of what religion SAYS be relied on?.

	106625 : ["Actually, there are a few instruments that finger differently depending on the key and recorder is one.  Recorder music is always written in C and the player fingers differently depending upon the key of his instrument (usually C or F).  This is also true of the tuba (which most people don't know comes in F, Eb, CC, and BBb regularly) - the player always reads a part in C and learns different fingerings for the different keys. BUT in the case of clarinets, the whole family fingers the same.  The difference between the C and Bb is size, pitch, and timbre.  They sound different.  The C is pretty rare as clarinets go, the A and Bb are much more common in orchestras. You can't play C clarinet parts on a Bb clarinet without transposing though.  If you don't have a C clarinet then you'll need to transpose your part.  You'll need to play everything up a whole step to match the C part - just like your concert scales. Also know that the clarinet you probably learned to play is a Boehm system.  It's different than an Albert, Oehler, or Simple system clarinet.  In those cases, they will finger differently - but a Bb would finger differently too.", 9964, "zCOvQwQhaa", 6],
	106626 : ["There should be no difference in fingering - if you have D on the stave you'd play it the same way.  The difference is that it will sound higher (a tone higher) on the C clarinet.  The C clarinet will tune on the same note as most of the rest of the orchestra (usually an A from the oboe) and the Bb clarinet will play a note that is written a tone higher so it sounds the same pitch, as the instrument is tuned a tone lower than the C instruments (usually, you would play a B). I have to admit this seems rather strange to me, as in 10 years of playing clarinet in orchestras, wind bands and even clarinet groups I have never seen a C clarinet used - only Eb, Bb, A, alto and bass.  I hope they have some good music lined up! Don't forget to give your fingers some time practicing the switch between the two instruments, as the C will probably feel slightly small and it might take a little time to get used to!

	106627 : ["Hebrews chapter 11 is about faith; \"faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.\"as you read the Bible, your mind will become clear and renewed; you believe in God, He is your Spiritual Father, He is Spirit, no one can know anything about Him except what Jesus tells us because He is Gods Son. Jesus said no one has ascended to the Father except Jesus. The Bible says no man can look at God and live, Jesus is our Mediator between we children and our Father God. First we are born in the physical flesh, when we believe Jesus is the Son of God, we ask Him to live inside of us, and that is when our spirit is born. That's why people say born again; now you have a baby spirit living in you and your body is the temple for Gods Spirit to live in. As you read and pray, the Spirit inside you teaches you, guides you into all Truth. No one goes to heaven or hell when they die. Jesus is the only human being to ever come back to life, proof that He is who He says He is and that is the Christ  of the Resurrection.When He returns to Earth He will raise every dead person back to life, we will become like Him, in a resurrected spiritual body that will never die or see corruption, the last enemy to be destroyed is death.
