He's an amazing quarterback, and last year he had a lot of bad luck.  From his appendicitis to his motorcycle crash, he made some foolish decisions and had some bad luck.  He shouldn't have played as soon as he did.  Charlie Batch should've taken the reins for a while, but we'll see how the Steelers do with a new coach. As for the Seahawks, they have a pretty solid all around team, though they may be a tiny bit weak on defense.  But I still think they should do a respectable job.", 10503, "pebKMqQraa", -1],

If it feels like the break pedal is pulsing and the breaks sort of lock then unlock lock then unlock and so on then your ABS is working properly. More than likely it's just a sensor.
