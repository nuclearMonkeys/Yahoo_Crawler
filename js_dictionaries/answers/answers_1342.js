	72690 : ["Yes.  The trick to cardio is to shift your body from burning glycogen to fat.  Your body stores glycogen in the liver and skeletal muscles as a quick resource of energy in times of trouble (like if you need to get away from a lion in a hurry or something).  However, this small amount of \"back-up energy\" runs out in about 20-30 minutes and your body has to rely on fat stores in order to have energy.  If you can keep your cardio going for more than 30 minutes, you'll be doing great and you will burn fat.  Good luck!  : )", 8686, "64798c4b35d548062511b26e1e70d4aaaa", 1],

I am obviously trying to point out anorexia and bulimia.  Alright, first 80 pounds in 6 months is far too extreme. You are still at your growing period, so you will need all the nutrients you can get. Also do not forget to take in consideration of growing taller, a lot of overweight people tend to become \"skinny\" once they hit their growth spurt. I don't know what your diet is but I'll assume it is a bit overboard. For someone your age, I recommend 1000-1500 calories a day, consisting of non greasy foods. You have to give up soda and sweets, it will be hard, kids at your age are usually surrounded by them.  Losing weight is no easy task, and the best way is to eat more than 5-6 meals a day, about 100-200 calories per meal. Healthy foods only, you know what those are.

	72700 : ["O-linemen get paid quite a bit, especially left tackles. LTs protect the blindside of most QBs (the right handers), and so, in order for your QB not to get his *** knocked off from behind, LTs are usually the best and most athletic O-lineman, and are typically the highest paid. As for the salaries, LTs are usually paid the most, followed by right tackles, guards, and then the center. However, depending on personnel, it could change. If you have a young, crappy RT, and an outstanding veteran center, the center could be paid more. Again when comparing O-lineman to skill guys. On a lot of teams, the LT is the second highest paid player on the team, behind the QB, and occasionally the RB. Sometimes, though, the LT is the highest (Jon Ogden I think is the highest paid player on the Ravens, and he is a left tackle). Sometimes, when a team has a good QB, RB, and WRs and an average left tackle, the LT could be paid less than the skill guys. As for the rest of the O-lineman, they are usually in the middle of the salary range for starters, although some exceptions with great O-lineman (like left guard Steve Hutchinson), can be one of the highest paid players on the team. As for O-line roles, they are all similar. All MUST be good at pass and run blocking. The LT MUST have good weight, strength, big hands, quick feet, and intellignece in order to combat pass rushing moves (remember, O-lineman are moving BACKWARDS when pass blocking, while pass rushers are moving FORWARDS). The only variatons: The tackles must be the best pass blockers, the center must be able to snap the ball quickly through his legs and then get his head up and block extremely fast, and the guards must be big guys who can run block, since they do a lot of pulling blocks on run plays. Defensive lineman DO utter insults, and vice versa with O-lineman. Defensive tackle Marcus Stroud is known as one of the biggest trash talkers in the league. Learning all the plays is EXTREMELY complicated. Even though teams only use maybe 150 different plays in a season, most teams have closer to 400-900 plays, each one with several different variations. Most playbooks are about 50-100 pages long, although last year the Redskins used a playbook that was like 250 pages long (and it showed; the offense looked lost and confused on the field. Having too many plays can be a bad thing.) For a player joining in the NFL in the middle of a season, it just doesn't happen. The only way a guy will be picked up in the middle of a season is if someone gets severly injured, or a position has players doing, like, beyond awful. I.e. If a team's running backs were averaging only like 40 yards per game after 8 games, a team might sign a guy. But outside of injury, this rarely happens. If a kicker makes a field, he should get about 75% of the credit for doing the hardest part (that being said, on a long kick, the kicker get ALL of the credit, but you asked my opinion, so I'm giving it). The holder and snapper should get the other 25%. Those guys are WAY underrated. To the guy who said snapping the ball isn't that hard, do you know how hard it is for the snapper to flip a ball 17 yards backwards, PERFECTLY, into a window about 10 by 8 inches wide, between his legs, knowing a defensive guy who weighs 350 pounds and benches 500 is going to club him in the head right away?

If a team has no chance of making the playoffs then they are better off losng games to grab a better draft pick to improve the team for next year. I think this happens basically every year. - The Colts had no chance of making the playoffs by week 6 of last year. So them playing in their own stadium was out of the question very early on. @AC - The Colts have over 20 returning players from last year. The only thing that really changed was the QB and RB. Their current RB is actually a downgrade from what they had last year by the way. You seriously think a team that won only 2 games last year, has that many returning players this year and now suddenly they're a playoff team? NO WAY!
