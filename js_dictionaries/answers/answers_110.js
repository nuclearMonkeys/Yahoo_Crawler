	5504 : ["Lucretia Borgia (1480-1519)Â  was 13 when her father, Pope Alexander VI, married her (1493) to Giovanni Sforza. So it was not unheard of in Renaissance Italy for noble children to marry that young.Â  And Prince Arthur Tudor was 15 when he wed Katherine of Aragon. The average age range of an average Tudor bride upon her marriage was her early to mid twenties according to Ian Mortimer's \"A Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England\". Maidens were supposed to be carefully chaperoned to prevent sexual intimacy; but crushes and sexual liaisons happened. Elizabeth Tudor (Queen Elizabeth I) was being seduced by her stepmother's husband Thomas Seymour at age 14. Her previous stepmother, Queen Katherine Howard, was intimate with Francis Durham, a gentleman in her grandmother's household, at approximately 14 or 15 years old.Â  Young people of the gentry and aristocracy aged 12-14 or so were sent by their parents to serve as pages and maids of honour to other gentry or aristocracy \"for their better bringing up in manners\". (as one foreign born person wrote when he enquired about this custom among the English), and apprentices began their training at 14, living in their masters' houses.

	5512 : ["\"the urologist said he wants to put you on flomax but you don't agree because you don't trust big pharma\" however you are willing to trust the answers of strangers on this site?.. this is kinda dumb!! if you are 40 years old or older, the most common cause by far is BPH or Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (benign means it is not a cancer of the prostate as the result of an overgrowth).. BPH is so common that in some communities around the world, one out of 4 men gets BPH.. the diagnosis is mainly clinical with the doctor inserting his index finger into your anus and trying to feel the front side of the rectum; the BPH would be felt like an enlarged marble with a groove in the middle (it can't be felt when you do it to yourself)..` ` ` the prostate is a small gland located at the base of the urinary bladder.. the prostate produces solution (chemical solution) that helps the sperm survive its journey to the ovum (eggs), also it acts like a traffic sign or a traffic light (it prevents the sperm going into the urinary bladder, and it prevents the urine from travelling into your testicles.. more importantly, the prostate surrounds the opening (the exit) of the urinary bladder (like a small valve) and helps to 'to hold the pee' while you seek a rest room or behind a tree..` ` ` in BPH, the prostate gets swollen with age which makes the exit narrow; and it only gets worse from there.. the usual complaint is poor stream during urination, difficulty in initiating the stream and waking up few times at night to pee with little urine coming out.. in addition to BPH, sometimes, a kidney stone forms in the urinary bladder.. small minute kidney stones often passed out in the urine without any pain, but BPH complicates the matter.. even a small kidney stone could block the already narrow exit for the urinary bladder..` ` ` Flomax often prescribed for BPH, for kidney stones and for both shooting 2 birds with one rock.. Flomax offers a simple quick but often temporary fix to your problem.. because A the BPH would only get worse with age producing narrower and narrower passages with age, and B because kidney stones form more frequently than you'd think..` ` ` if the problem becomes recurrent (if the problem happens again in the near future) and if the condition only gets worse, this is when your urologists offer surgical solutions.. they can make the exit wider by inserting small instruments that carves a path inside the prostate (some using steam vapor instead of sharp tools), making the urine passage wider for urine and kidney stones to pass without getting stuck (it is actually a simple procedure and the patient is fully awake during the procedure)..` ` ` in addition to Flomax, there are other medications that shrinks the prostate temporarily for months and for long years, but it may complicate things if you already have a medical problem like heart disease.. so the best advice given here, is to listen to your doctor(s) and stop taking advice from people who do not know about your case.. and.. and all the best...", 912, "AA12361029", 4],
