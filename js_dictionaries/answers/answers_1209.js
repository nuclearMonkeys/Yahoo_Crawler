No matter who it is you can be sure that Sir Alex Ferguson will have some say in who will be selected, as for Eric Cantona and any of the other ex United players while not impossible I would suggest that they will not replace Sir Alex Ferguson simply because the pressure will be emmense on who ever takes over and that requires experience.. Secondly as most United fans know (or should know) when Sir Matt retired Wilf McGuinness took over and lasted for only 23 games part of the reason he failed was that he was too close to the team, a lot of the senior players he was managing he'd played alongside...United will have learnt that lesson.

Also Blanc as never managed a big club in a big league before.Can he Manage United to win the league without any Experiance in managing big clubs?i don't think so.  Also Blanc is lined up to take the France National Team and i believe he will take it.There is less pressure for him(that is compared to the pressure he would have Man United).

	65951 : ["There are lots of exercises for this problem but they will change dependent upon the original problem.  Is the sciatica from a bulge or disc?  If it is then you need a specific type of movement that will help to move the fluid portion of the disc away from the nerves.  Movements such as this would be lying on your stomach and resting the upper body on the forearms.  Alternating between completely lying on the floor and being on the forearms.  If the problem is from degenerative changes in the spine and disc then the movements would be more like the ones lying on the back and slowly bringing one knee up to the chest and holding it for ten seconds and relaxing but not leaving go of the leg.  Repeat that pulling process into the chest again.  Do that routine about five times per leg.  On the last pull done do not let the leg go but bring the opposite leg up to meet it and pull both down to the chest and hold for ten seconds.  Relax a little but don't let go and repeat that cycle for a total of five.  Lying on the back with one foot flat on the floor and the knee bent to 90 degrees.  Bring the opposite leg up to as high a position as possible with the knee straight.  Hold for ten and relax.  Again do that about five times and switch legs.  I would strongly suggest that you seek professional help with this and see a physical therapist who would be able to evaluate you to see what the cause of the problem is and the correct series of exercises.  Yoga and Pilate's are also excellent programs to help with overall flexibility. ", 8312, "EMNwWAuvaa", 0],

The reason is because Oprah disagrees with Ms. Rice's political views and because Ms. Rice is better educated and more influential in the world than Oprah is.  Oprah would never be in the presence of someone whom she knows is above her.  And I will add this, I don't think Oprah is black anymore.  She's an overrated, overexposed, self-important rich lady who was born and raised in America and became a billionaire in the country she was born in, but somehow she thinks that Africa is her home and Nelson Mandela is her relative.

	65985 : ["I believe that one of the causes of Sciatica is a result of putting consistent pressure on the nerve which is located near the ischial tuberosity \"the butt bone\" - for lack of better words. In some people this nerve could run between the \"Butt\" bone, and the surface they are sitting on, thus pinching the nerve which causes pain to either shoot up the back or down the leg.  If you are in a sitting position the majority of the day, you could be at high risk of developing sciatica, notice I said \"develop\". It takes time to get sciatica, so keep in mind that it will take time for your body to adjust back to normal. I don't know if the cure for sciatica has anything to do with exercise. But what seems to help is:  Stretching  Stand up straight and let your upper half fall forward slowly. You should feel a stretch on the back of your legs and on your back. Massage therapy  Have someone experienced with sciatica, work on the problem area, massage has a way of relaxing agitated nerves and muscles causing them to reset their pain receptors- this could be very painful, but effective. Please note, sciatica will not be cured in only one session, be prepared to make it a monthly or bi-weekly activity - healing depends on a person's body. 2 - 6 months, up to a year even. Take a break Avoiding sitting for long period of time. If you must sit for a long time, make it a habit to take a break every 15 to 30 minutes. Get up and walking around. Allow your sciatic nerve to breathe.  Wallets Surprisingly, wallets can add to the development of pain. Sitting on your wallet all day can be cutting off your nerve circulation and could also give you back problems. Be consistent What ever method you choose, the most important thing is to be consistent.  Also see, ischial tuberosity pain and ischial bursitis", 8312, "i58N6gtYaa", 0],
