	30402 : ["Well .. book an appointment for the two of you to go to marriage counseling.  It may or may not help. In the end, NO ONE is perfect, so no mar\"Triage is perfect. Couples often fight for about 10 years, then withdraw into alienated distance for about 10 years, before they understand that only rarely can we change our partner, that all partners have flaws, that trying to change our partner is what CAUSES the fighting ... so we either decide the person is worth putting up with the flaws .. or we leave them. Or they get tired of our dissent and they leave us. I cannot make your choies for you.  You have to decide what priority your various wishes fall into, and choose the strongest priority. As for having a child ..  DON'T.  Not with THIS man. He isn't going to shape up if you have a child.  You will just be working harder. Telling you he will change AFTER a child is born is either his self-delusion or a deliberate attempt to trick you.  HE has to find a job NOW, and hang onto it for ... oh, give it at least 3 years ... before you can believe that he will KEEP a job long-term. No .. he has to show you first. You wouldn't give your car to someone who doesn't repay borrowed money, on the PROMISE that they will pay for the car at a later date.  Dont' have a child by a man who will not work at a job NOR at home instead of a job. The one who stays home full-time serves the one who works full-time out of the home. And it is a 24/7 job for the house-person, and they keep the house to the working partner's standards.  It is actually more psychologically draining than going out to work, because it has no emotional perks to it, no sense of self-worth or accomplishments. The dirty dishes only become dirty the next day.", 4671, "sMtpQ4f2aa", -1],
	30403 : ["Here's the part that jumped out at me “he tells me go right ahead if I don't love him anymore”. That means he isn't listening to what you are saying about his lack of contribution and how tired you are and instead is turning it into emotional blackmail. Don't fall for it. You can love someone and still recognize that the relationship isn't a good one, and staying together is a poor choice. People go through difficult times and struggle to deal with sadness or even depression, and it's fair to support them for a while. But if someone is totally unwilling to work on pulling themselves out of that state (even by acknowledging that they may need professional help to deal with the depression), it's hard to continue to support that. And I bring up depression because he may be clinically depressed and require therapy and potentially medication before he will be able to make progress. You view it as lazy, because he won't do anything, but he may be unable to do much of anything due to something like depression. Does he acknowledge that he has a problem? If you suggest it, does he lash out, or is he willing to consider it?  Maybe the best thing for you to do is give him the final ultimatum. Don't threaten to leave him, inform him that you cannot continue to live like this, and that he needs to change/step up or you will have to do something else. Tell him that he needs to get a job and be contributing to the household by June 1. Or that if he thinks he may have an issue with depression, he needs to find a counselor and be actively getting treatment. Otherwise, you will be moving out and moving on. And then you follow through.", 4671, "KESlvKqQaa", 2],

Maybe you'll like it so much, and knowing how easy it is to get an escort, start resorting to doing that, but then you'll start having sex without the emotional connection which can give you a skewered view of sex and prevent you from having a meaningful relationship with a woman later - just like a porn addiction can ruin real life sex. (There's a difference between making love and just having sex) Maybe you will go in there with this woman who is putting on a show with you for money and feel used and disappointed, which could work against you when it comes to relating to women in general.

Also, having slept with other people doesn't automatically make someone a bad husband or a bad wife. There are also advantages to having some experience under your belt, both when it comes to sex and when it comes to relationships. It's not a one size fits all.
