He was on the floor in his room, in front of the rocker/ glider.  I want to change it but my work just recently blocked Y! 360 so I'll be using it for a while.  There is another picture of him on my 360 page laying on a floatee.  It was taken a few weeks ago while he was in my parents pool.  The other 2 pictures on my 360 page are of my 3 1/2 year old son, Aidan, and I took those w/ my camera phone while at Six Flags.  I'm Nina, BTW, but you probably all already knew that, LOL.   I have found it near impossible to get a really good picture of both of my boys together!!  I wish I could!!!! ETA:  Deborah P.... I have been debating on when and if I should cut my sons hair.

	65242 : ["I have to say, I don't often see 'gun grabbers' saying we wouldn't ever have a standing army, when we had an army under General Washington already in place.  The second amendment does limit the right to bear arms to a well regulated militia. Something totally ignored in a Supreme Court decision. So now we deal with what was left.  Any and every one can have a gun.  A gun grabber would be someone wanting to do what the right keeps saying the left wants to do...confiscate and ban all guns.  But that's their fear, not the reality. We would like to see them regulated, and people with a history of mental problems denied licenses to own or buy guns.  I find it difficult to believe that is a stumbling block for so many on the right unless they fear they wouldn't qualify to buy a gun. I don't find the meat of your question accurate, and while I'm aware you can find someone on the web expressing any sort of opinion, the vast majority of liberals I know, even myself, do own guns, and we aren't looking for grabbing guns.  Just making sure the people who have them and buy them aren't convicted felons.  For myself I'd like to see that extended to people convicted of domestic abuse and alcoholism.  Both those situations have far too often proved fatal for family members.", 8292, "5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa", 1],

And this was to be supplemented at need by citizen militias, who were supposed to supply their own arms.  And that's the point of the 2nd Amendment.  People were guaranteed the right to own arms so they could bear them in service of the militia when needed.", 8292, "d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa", 0],
