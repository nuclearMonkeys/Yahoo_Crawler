	72950 : ["Good evening, Sati I know exactly what you mean and I posited a similar question a year ago (   ). I'm unsure whether the TDs are the result of those considering themselves to be more pure Buddhists than others (frequently referring to others as \"reptilians\") or from those opposed to Buddhism in general. In my practice we are not permitted to proselytize. We are only allowed to answer a question when asked in sincerity. Yes, it takes a considerable amount of time, thought, and effort to compose a cohesive and accurate answer. Will we ever know who is so full of animosity toward another's belief? Are they trolls or fundamentalists of one group or another? Probably not. But I am noticing a greater degree of intolerance at Y!A in R&S over my nearly five years in participating. I've even considered perhaps I should simply continue in my private practice without participating on Y!A at all. But I am constantly reminded that when a serious question is asked it warrants a serious response. Trent may not be aware of the number of TDs that answers pertaining to Buddhism receive especially since many times the question and responses are deleted after being inundated with \"No Best Answer\" votes if the asker does not select a best answer: So the question and responses are relegated to cyberspace without even a ripple. Almost as interesting is that in my case after the asker has selected an answer as \"Best Answer\" you can *still* garner TDs. I believe I exceeded your number of 19 TDs at least on one occasion even after is was selected as \"Best Answer\" by the asker (   ). But we also view TDs as a means of keeping pride in check. It's all a matter of mind where we place the emphasis. Sarva mangalam. EDIT 19 January 2012: We live in a world where many affront another's beliefs with hatred and distrust in their postings be they in words or TDs. I was sent the following link this morning:   . Now, if two unrelated species (a dog and a squirrel) can accept each other, why is it we humans with supposed higher intellect find it difficult to do likewise? Perhaps we can all learn a lesson of civility from this video.", 8703, "None", 2],

The Slik Sprint Pro II or the Slik Sprint Mini II are some good possible choices.  They are not very heavy, and they are good quality and can fit your budget.  The Mini should fit any pack, but its height is sort of barely adequate.  The Pro should fit a medium pack.   According to specifications here  it collapses to 18.5\" (47.0cm).

	72972 : ["Of all world religion, Eastern religion is the one I've most respect for.  I find Taoism a bit confusing at times, but I enjoy it, and if I were ever to convert to something, it would be Buddhism, as I agree with the core of its philosophy. Desire is the cause of all suffering, to achieve Nirvana is to free yourself from desire, and to free yourself from the illusion that you have a self. It's something I agree with. Never really clicked with the idea of reincarnation though. An a side note, I don't see many Buddhist posts in here, nor do I see them get down rated much. In fact, the only ones I see down rated in the Buddhist questions are the answers typically trying to convert everyone to Christianity. I could be wrong though. @Sati I am sincerely surprised at that to be honest. It might be a troll, if I had to guess. Either that or most people have little understanding of what the beliefs of Buddhism are, and may believe you incorrect on the issue. My father is a prime example of this. . He believes Buddhists only believe in what he calls \"the middle way.\" All that aside, I'm 99% certain it's a troll.

I get it, they're really happy with their religion and they want me to experience how great (they think) it is.  But I completely see the other side of it here and I agree with you.

	72981 : ["Such a good point to raise! It's as if one's CLAIMED experience of the divine cancels out all possibilities of another's experience of the divine. What's interesting to me is that, within any given religion, the experience of the divine is quite similar across all followers. This not only suggests that people's experience of the divine is really a \"copy\" of WHAT and HOW they have learned to experience the divine, but is HUGELY indicative of the falsity of each claim.  I do, however, believe we all possess the capacity to experience A (not the) \"divine,\" though this experience is completely SUBJECTIVE and does not require a higher being. For me, the experience comes from genuinely loving others (sounds cheesy) and being as compassionate as I can towards all. What I don't get is why people are so willing to minimize this experience by projecting their responsibility for causing it onto a non-existent god. Again, great question!", 8700, "None", 0],
