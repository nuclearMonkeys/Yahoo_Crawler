Reminds me of the parable of taking the rafter out of our eye before we start to take the little piece of straw out of another!  I could Google right now and show you where topics such as Hell Fire (torment), Trinity (3 gods in 1) and bouncing up to heaven, lol  are NOT Biblical at all but borrowed from Pagan teachings (thus Satanic).

	60338 : ["I guess Jesus was mistaken then when he told that the rich man who was in hell was conscious of his situation, remembered his old life, was concerned about his still living brothers, and able to talk to Lazarus the beggar and Abraham.  None of those things sound like \"hell\" is nothing but the grave. Apparently you think he was a cartoonish as he is the one who drew our understanding of heaven and hell. Paul tells us that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.  He believed that admission to heaven was immediate.  And that we would be in heaven to return with Jesus at the time of the resurrection.  Again, things that make no sense of hell and heaven are just the grave. And the Trinity is clearly taught in the Bible, both Old and New Testament.  While it is a belief also shared by the catholic church, they did not invent it.  The Bible did.

	60355 : ["Do what you find acceptable and let others alone. Oh, I agree with you. It's just a waste of time to bother about what others think. Hell might not even exist, but if it does, I doubt very many folks spend much time there. The Trinity is not to be thrown out without careful thought. After all, I'm sure you are aware, since I'm sure you have looked into this closely, that it took the Church about four hundred years to decide they really wanted to make the Trinity a doctrine.  It's really very silly to say there's nothing about the Trinity in the Bible. It isn't mentioned by name, but that doesn't mean you get to ignore all the places where the different aspects of God are talked about, both in the New Testament and the Old.  However, it's not essential to salvation, so if it isn't helpful for you, just move on. Lots of us don't really think about the Trinity much; others build their faith around it.

As to what Heaven is really like, I can only go by what John tells us in the Revelation. I doubt that we immediately go to Heaven or Hell when we die, since there is a resurrection of the dead when Christ returns.

	60369 : ["You are wrong about creationism not being falsifiable. The basic assumption is not falsifiable: i.e., there is a creator god. However, they make statements based on the Bible that are falsifiable.  It can be pretty well proven that creation did not occur 6,000 years ago. It can also be proven that there was no world-wide flood about 4300 years ago. But, of course, creationists will ignore any evidence that disproves what they believe. Added: @Questioner gets his information from creationist web sites, which are notorious for presenting misinformation about evolution. Karl Popper changed his mind about the falsifiability of evolution.  Evolution is falsifiable. As one scientist said, all you would need to do to falsify evolution is to find a fossil rabbit in Cambrian strata. If you really understand what evolution is about and know anything about the fossil record, you will understand what that scientist means. You also said Darwinism never predicted anything. That is totally false. Numerous predictions have been made on the basis of evolutionary theory and have been verified. Here's an example. When it was learned during the last century that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes but the great apes have 24 pairs, evolutionary scientists predicted that the difference was the result of the fusion of two of the ancestral chromosomes in the human line from the common ancestor. That prediction has been verified. And there are numerous others, but you won't find them on creationist web sites. Also, Michael G. Houts is a mechanical engineer, which gives him no credentials to comment about the validity of evolution, particularly since he is a creationist. Though Don Batten has a degree in plant physiology, he is also a creationist, so his view on evolution is colored by his religious beliefs.", 8070, "OKYZjaxvaa", 0],
	60370 : ["Christians ought  better to be employed  in the good news of  our Creator ...stepping into our very shoes rather than setting up a laboratory to prove Himself or draw evolutionary diagrams,.He actually identified with our real concerns and problems.Very few people care about contemplating their navel, more about their own happiness , safety and destiny. If He had told us we were the product of chance and probability I don't think that would have answered our  deepest needs , do you? Who tries to disprove evolution? Certainly the majority must accept a proven  capacity for mutation within species ,otherwise they would become extinct under environmental change. Even though I and  many more  sensible people including the majority of scientists are not persuaded about  \"Genetic Evolution\"   that doesn't totally discount popular theory or opinion. Darwin and the neo Darwinists of today simply have had an impossible problem with the complete dearth of inter species proof.So to project a fraction of human of experimentation onto a multi billion year canvass of their own invention seems a giant step of Faith in their own devices. Without trawling through the whole of your red herrings (sic)  I think if we spent more time reading about the incredible correlation between  Scriptural revelation and the course of history you would have proof enough that everything ,including the whole cosmos is moving inexorably according to a predetermined climax.

Duh, how are they going to talk to each other from heaven and hell???  2. Do a word-search using a Hebrew syntax and Strong's Concordance: all the words pertaining to hell in Hebrew mean death, grave, burial site, or trash dump!  3. Study the words 'forever, eternal, unquenchable, etc' in Hebrew and you'll find it has a different connotation from English!!!

A.P calc is a really hard class . . . if you're intent on going through with all the A.P exams, don't do it. Do the A.P bio and A.P chem first. The A.P calc exam is really hard and so is A.P Chem.Its going to be like one exam right after the other. Its hard because there's a lot of prep going there. I suggest that you wait until your senior year to take A.P calc especially if you want to get good results. Most good colleges require a 4 or 5 and its really hard to get a 4 on the A.P Chem test. Its easy to get a 5 on the A.P Bio test, but you have really start memorizing a lot.
