	106955 : ["The number one most important thing is good skin tone and having nice eyes, nose and a clear complexion. You cant be too dark, cant be too pale, have to be just right- nice golden brownish or wheatish in skin tone, nice big brown/blue/green eyes, non-crooked nose and even skin tone with clear, glowing skin. The eyes have to be big, not small. If you dont have these attributes, you will not be considered good looking, regardless of your butt, boobs, hair, etc. The face is the most important thing we care about. Then education, personality, etc. But face is #1. Sorry, its the truth.  1. Straight hair is a turn on, but wavy natural hair is fine too. Curly, frizzy or braided hair is a big turn off. Also Black hair or brown hair color is the best looking- red not so much, blonde-it depends on the skin tone.  2.Mascara and eyeliner are definitely great turn ons. 3. Lipstick is not necessary- sometimes it looks too slutty; but chapstick or lip gloss is a must 4. Skinny jeans, and shorts above the knees are good- miniskirts and short shorts not good. 5. I hate it when girls give you mixed signals and use you to get work done. If you like a guy, ask him out- this an age of equality. At the same time- dont give mixed messages to a guy/flirt with him JUST to get your work done and then dump him! 6. Stay in good shape and maintain a clear complexion while smelling good. Good teeth is also important! 7. Leggings and a nice shirt 8. Eye contact and then look away, smiling 9. Talking to her comfortably, and smiling very often. 10. Butt- doesnt matter one bit. Boobs- matters somewhat- cannot be huge but cannot be like a or b cup either- they have to be medium sized. This also depends on the face- if the girl is really good looking, like irina shayk type- then boobs can be a bit smaller- but nothing smaller than a B cup or a C cup. Nothing bigger than a DD cup either.", 9976, "None", -4],

I prefer the natural look, but I don't want like, chapped lips either, you know? 4. I like the skinny jeans, miniskirt, and the short shorts. Shorts more so than the skirt though. 5. What annoys me is when they mutter something to you and when you ask what they said they just tell you. \"Nothing.\" If you were trying to say something, you had better say it! 6. The hottest thing a girl can do... Hmm, lets see. going out of their way to be with you and sticking up for their man. Some guys think it makes them look weak but to me it lets me know just how much they care. 7. Hottest thing a girl can wear... Not a thong. It's like dental floss. No, the hottest thing, in my opinion, is a looses pair of pajama pants (even cuter when it's their boyfriend's), and a kind-of tight fitting shirt, but a comfortable one. 8. Cute things girls do... Laugh, play with their hair, make that odd little expression when they want to kiss you, and play the, \"My boyfriend's better that your boyfriend\" game with their friends. 9. Make her laugh, talk to her a lot, listen to what she has to say, and be there if she needs someone to cheer her up or if she just needs some help with something. And tease her a little bit in a way that's playful, and not insulting. 10. A LOT! In a backwards sense. I prefer a smaller butt and smaller boobs. I don't like it when there's just too much there. If it's smaller, it's cuter. But there still has to be something there too. I mean, there can't be nothing. But, more importantly, there can't bee too much.
