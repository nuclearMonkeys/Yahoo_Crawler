Around July 19, 2007 -- after slightly more than five months had passed since he had declared his presidential candidacy -- Obama clearly became far more focused on campaigning for his White House run, than on performing the legislative duties for which he had been elected to the U.S. Senate. From that date through May 22, 2008, Obama voted on just 34 percent of all the bills that came before the Senate. On the other 66 percent, he cast no vote of any kind, either for or against the legislation in question.  Record Obama's US Senate Voting Record Here is a backup story -- during a meeting with reporters at his Illinois campaign headquarters after his election to the U.S. Senate, he ridiculed as \"a silly question\" whether he would run for president or vice president before his term ends in 2011. \"I've never worked in Washington,\" he said. \"I can unequivocally say I will not be running for national office in four years, and my entire focus is making sure that I'm the best possible senator on behalf of the people of Illinois.\"  \"You know,\" Obama, replied, \"I am a believer in knowing what you're doing when you apply for a job. In addition, I think that if I were to seriously consider running on a national ticket I would essentially have to start now, before having served a day in the Senate. Now, there are some people who might be comfortable doing that, but I'm not one of those people.\" From the time, Barack Obama was sworn in as a United States Senator, to the time he announced that he was forming a Presidential exploratory committee; he logged 143 days of experience in the Senate. That is how many days the Senate was actually in session and working. After 143 days of work experience, Obama believed he was ready to be Commander In Chief, Leader of the Free World, and fill the shoes of Abraham Lincoln, FDR, JFK, and Ronald Reagan. 143 days -- I keep leftovers in my refrigerator longer than that.", 9640, "FEqlziUvaa", 1],

	97896 : ["E85 is a mix of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Most vehicles can safely take up to 10% ethanol (E10), but do check your owner's manual. If you do the math, based on your vehicle's tank size and amount of fuel still in it, and if you are somewhat accurate in your gas pump jockey skills, you could self-mix E85 (85% ethanol) and regular gasoline (provided it doesn't have any ethanol in it already) to get yourself a 10% ratio of ethanol to gasoline... Yes, you can physically put E85 in a \"regular\" gasoline vehicle, but you wouldn't want to. (so do NOT do it! You should NOT put E85 in a gasoline vehicle.) The higher concentration of ethanol can eat away plastics and other fuel line components over time (corrosive to the car). The air/fuel ratio will also be off in your car, giving you poor cold start emissions (triggering a check engine light), and potentially damaging your engine over time with incorrect detonation.  You would need an upgrade kit to modify your car if you want to make it E85 capable. You should only use E85 fuel in a vehicle that is designed to use it, called a flex-fuel vehicle (or labeled E85 capable). Do note that E85 fuel has a lower BTU/energy content than gasoline, so expect your fuel economy to be slightly lower.  According to: E85 has approximately 29% lower energy density than gasoline (E85 about 82,000 BTUs/gallon, compared to about 115,000 BTUs/gallon for gasoline) (I've also heard of a report by an association of fleet owners that report about a 28% energy difference between E85 and gasoline.) The AAA Media Site for Retail Gasoline Prices,   , not only lists the current average pricing for gasoline and E85, but also lists an adjusted price of E85 to compensate for its lower energy content.  As of the last update on 5/30/2009 around 3am, the US national average pricing in US$ per US gallon for regular gasoline is $2.488, for E85 is $2.068, but when adjusting the price of E85 to account for its lower energy content, the national average price of E85 is adjusted up to $2.721.  So, in reality, using E85 is not cheaper than using regular gasoline... Also note that there are few E85 fueling stations, so most flex-fuel vehicles never actually run it. (even though the automakers get a 1.2mpg bonus credit to their CAFE averages for each flex-fueled vehicle they sell!) You can look up E85 refueling stations here:    and  You can view all of the E85 capable flex-fuel vehicles through:", 9642, "d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa", 1],

	97914 : ["Yeah man, truth be known...I still sit there and admire the old albums! I'm an avid vinyl collector, and have been for well over 40 years now. It's my passion/hobby/addiction I guess you could say! I own a ton of CD's as well, but they just don't compare, sonically or visually. Part of the whole experience for me is holding onto that cover, reading and admiring the graphics while the tunes are playing. Wow, there's so many classic covers that have become my favorites over the years. But anything by Roger Dean which included; Yes, Budgie, Gentle Giant, Uriah Heep, Gravy Train, Gun, Clear Blue Sky, Ramases, Osibisa, etc. The boys at Hipgnosis did some great stuff as well; Pink Floyd, Edgar Broughton Band, Nice, Toe Fat, Trees, UFO, Montrose, Wishbone Ash, Brand X, Led Zeppelin, etc. Hawkwinds 'Space Ritual' fold out Poster cover was cool. It was designed by Colin Fulcher aka 'Barney Bubbles', a Hawkwind alumni and graphic arts designer. Then there was the Krautrock band Frumpy, and their 'All Will Be Changed' LP cover. It featured a cool plastic outer sleeve, that when slid across the gatefold cover, it appeared as though the artwork on the inside was moving. The 'Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band' also achieved a similar effect with their 'Tadpoles' LP cover. When the inner sleeve was removed, the eyes on the band members on the front cover appeared to move as the sleeve slid outward. Led Zeppelin 3 was cool with it's rotating dial. Deep Purples 'In Rock' is a classic, and shocked many people upon it's release. Or how about the 1968 release of the Mothers of Invention', 'Were Only In It For The Money', mocking the Beatles 'Sgt Pepper': Funkadelic's 'Maggot Brain' was pretty wild: The Mothers of Inventions 'Weasles Ripped My Flesh' (Neon Park) is a stand out for sure: Of course Alice Cooper should be mentioned as well. His 'Schools Out' album cover with the folding school desk, and the girls panties was quite original! Or how about Cheech and Chongs 'Big Bambu', complete with giant rolling paper! I own over 30,000 vinyl LP's, and I could probably write a book on this subject! My absolute favorite is the Edgar Broughton Bands selftitled album from 1971. It depicted a meat locker full of hanging hind quarters, but if you look closely you'll see a naked man hanging by his ankles amongst the beef: Oh, check out Roger Deans album cover artwork books if you can find them(maybe in a used book store). Also the book titled 'Album Cover Album' is great too, though it's been out of print for close to 30 years, I still see it in used book stores from time to time. It's a compilation of album cover art edited by Roger Dean and Hipgnosis. It has everything from great jazz covers, 60's psych, 70s prog, etc. The best book in my opinion on the subject. The Hipgnosis book titled 'Walk Away Rene' is incredible too! Another really cool Hipgnosis cover was for Keith Emerson's pre 'ELP' band 'The Nice', and their album 'Elegy'. The camera crew went to the Sahara desert, and set up a line of 50 coloured soccer balls across the tops of the sand dunes. But to perfect this shot, the crew had to spend hours raking the sand, in order to remove any foot prints etc. To really appreciate this picture you need the gatefold cover. Coloured soccer balls as far as the eye can see. Try to replicate this the next time you go to the beach...I'm sure you'll have a ball: Also we should mention Jimi Hendrix's UK version of 'Electric Ladyland, which has artwork that is entirely different from any of the North American pressings. Again, the gatefold cover is required in order to \"experience\" this cover properly, so scroll down half way at this Wikipedia page to see it: There were also tons of great Krautrock album covers by bands like Guru Guru, Weed, Grobschnitt, etc. Eloy's garbage can cover with fully functioning lid was neat. Lot's of cool Italian 70's prog bands, one in particular by 'Electric Frankenstein' had a very cool cover as well. I could go on forever with regards to this subject...great question! Edit - Beatle Fanatic... Vinyl never left, it's just been suppressed! Major labels like Columbia have been reissuing their back catalog for years now, along with newer labels such as Sundazed and Akarma...who specialize in reissuing prog and psyc/rock classics by bands like like Spirit, May Blitz, The Byrds, Love, Carmen, Jefferson Airplane, Bob Dylan, Gentle Giant, Mike Bloomfield, Dr. John...the list is endless. These are just a couple labels out of many that are still producing vinyl. Here's a few of many online stores that sell brand new vinyl: NATHANIEL G - CD's and all digital formats are inferior to the alalog LP. None of my records have these \"imperfections\" that you speak of. Compared to all modern digital formats, the analogue LP record, with its signal engraved in a vinyl disc, may look poor at first glance. However, never forget that it is still the only medium (apart from the reel to reel tape recorder) that can contain the most complete and most structured signal providing great dynamics, having the widest frequency band attainable, and has the most refined detail over the entire audio spectrum and far beyond, which no other format can deliver. The analog LP is not restricted to 16 - 24 bits and a limited frequency band. It has 700 bits - so to speak - and the minute upper harmonics which digital formats are missing. The simple reason is that the original LP is analogous in nature. I'd say 95% of my albums play clean as a whistle...no popping or skips at all. I guess it really comes down to proper care/maintenance of ones records, along with correct tone arm/cartridge alignment, choosing the right amp to match the impedance and/or capacitance of your cartridge, etc. Oh yeah...and make sure your stylus isn't worn down to the bone! So many people use to play their records without a stylus...duh, no wonder their records sounded like sh!t, haaa! There are many variables to be considered when trying to get the most out of your records...and this is a large part of the reason why the CD gained in popularity...convenience. So perhaps if you didn't adhere to the simple care/maintenance rules above...then yeah, you've probably got many great rolling, and serving trays too...they also make good frisbees when they're in poor condition as well.
