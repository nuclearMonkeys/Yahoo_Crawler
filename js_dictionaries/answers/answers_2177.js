Usually the serial number is indeed at the bottom of the laptop, but if you can't really read it, I'd suggest just to take a picture of it and say \"here's my serial number\" if someone asks for it xD  You can't say that you don't have one, it's just a bit difficult to read... And normally, the serial number is somewhere in your System folder, but since your laptop is broke, that won't help too... Perhaps, google for \"where to find serial number\"?", 10393, "SG1m8qDXaa", 0],

	114633 : ["YES!! most definately. I've only ever loved 3 men, and all of them in a slightly different way. my first love eventually broke my heart, after a firey and passionate relationship and still makes my heart skip a beat when i see him over 13 years on. The second I loved for his compassion and caring heart. The third man I fell in love with is different; I knew the moment i saw him that he was the one for me. We have so much in common, our personalities perfectly balance each other, we think and feel in the same way and have only ever had one argument (can't even remember what about). The reason I know he is my soulmate is because my heart and soul yearns for him when he is not there. He is my friend, my husband, my lover and so much more. Not everyone is lucky enough to find that soulmate who makes everything click into place, but if you do you will KNOW it.

	114668 : ["It's a 14k gold Omega watch -- at least it seems to be.   The confusing part about identifying it is that it has two manufacturer's names on it. Omega is a well-known Swiss watch manufacturer; Cartier is a French manufacturer.  A watch being signed by two companies isn't unheard of -- there's been some Deville Watches (an Omega brand) that had a Cartier signature on the watch face. Still, it's somewhat unusual. I would call it a \"Men's 14k gold Omega/Cartier wristwatch\". It would be inaccurate, but that's the best I can do.  If you need more information then that, you should take it to someone specializing in vintage watches.   Alternatively, Omega has a database on their website, which is linked in the source below.  It may be possible to find it by clicking the \"show more filters\" link and then narrowing it down through categorization and date.  However, I had little luck in doing so.  As a last resort, you could input the case number. This ensures accuracy, but requires that the backing of the watch be removed. There will be a number engraved on the inside of the casing which you can input on the website.  The Omega database covers watches all the way back to 1946. By the way, it is unnecessary to note that the band is not part of the original watch.  Anyone who can't figure that out on their own shouldn't be answering the question in the first place. ðŸ˜ƒ Think of it as a litmus test for the Dunning-Kruger effect.  If anyone tells you that the watch was made in China, you can then safely disregard any other claim that they make about the watch.", 10396, "28HXN302aa", 2],

	114671 : ["Dude, the information you give is not clear. The 3 series released in 1998 is the E46 Saloon/Sedan (4 door). In 1999 the E46 Coupe was released. In 2000 the E36 soft-top was replaced with the E46 soft-top, In 2001, the E46 M3 was released but was never available as a 4 door. The previous 3 series model was an E36, all saloon parts you list fit all other E36 saloons. All E36 Coupe parts fit all E36 Coupe's. The only cosmetic difference between early and latter E36 models are: 1) Kidney Grill 2) Indicators - orange on early Euro models, white on later models 3)The \"fenders\" (wings) changed slightly to accomodate a slightly different indicators that sit in the middle of the front wings. The only other cosmetic difference was the front and rear bumpers that were \"sportier\" on the M3 and \"Sport\" models. These can be taken off one E36 and put on another of the same style (i.e. saloon to saloon or coyoe to coupe). The E36 M3 that was available as a Saloon or a Coupe, so parts from an M3 saloon, will fit any other E36 saloon and parts from an E36 M3 Coupe will fit another E36 coupe. Coupe parts will not fit a saloon. Saloon parts do not fit Coupe's. If you had a 1999 M3 it would be one of the last E36 M3 coupe's. The parts from this would not fit on any 4 door model. Between 1999 and 2000, the old car was replaced with a brand new, totally different car.... If anyone told you the parts from the newer car bolted onto the older car, they'd be so wrong!! The E46 model was a totally different car to the previous one. It was wider and longer and did not share any body parts or chassis with the old model. You can't bolt on any of the parts from the E46 onto the E36, you'd have more chance of: 1) Platting Fog 2) Nailing Jelly to the wall 3) Walking from New York to London However, there are a few E46 body-kits available that will make your E36 look like an E46, one of which even includes E46 headlights (Auto Tint Design used to do one but I don't know if they still stock it). I've owned an E36, an E46 and an E90 - they're all totally different to each other and parts from one will not fit on another. I hope this helps, Andy", 10395, "yvOIIGqSaa", 1],

In the 1993 model BMW used what is called a \"dynamic open wheel molding\" that actually modified the chassis based on which trim-line you selected at the dealership, or more accurately, the buy here pay here lot that you visited. What needs to happen is you need to measure the angle from the side-cleat of the front end back to the top of the running board.
