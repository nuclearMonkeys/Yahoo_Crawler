	33270 : ["I don't think he will be.  He hasn't played regularly for Spurs this season, and it's difficult to turn in form like you would a tap. England are also stacked with attacking central midfielders at the moment. The likes of Foden, Mount, Madison, Grealish and even a deeper-lying Harry Kane have all played regularly for their clubs this year, and have had success.  There will be a lot of competition for that one place. ", 5069, "AA12299134", 0],
	33271 : ["Delle Ali got old after one world class season at Spurs and even after giving his absolute best,  i mean he played out of his skin in that sesaon where chelsea nicked it - Kane too. despite that, despite having a better team then than now, and despite being the best midfielder possibly all round player Europe that season ( Hazard, Delle Ali, Ronaldo and Messi and possibly Lewandowski were the best performers)  they still couldnt win the title. He looks like a shadow of his former self, Roy Keane was right - he doesn't look the same player he was 4 or 5 years ago. Should he be in the team ? 50/50 for me. He could be a big presence in the side and I'd pick him nonetheless. I'd pick him over Jordan Henderson any day of the week. Bissaka goes,  along with Rashy - thats a given.", 5069, "B0Lzvryraa", 0],

	33273 : ["I'd go for the complete opposite of Klopp and someone who has proven he can retain a consistent level of success at one club. Go for Diego Simeone next. He's one of the few characters in the game who has the personality big enough to actually succeed Klopp. Replacing Klopp is too big a job for Stevie G at the moment. He needs to be the guy after the guy who has replaced Klopp", 5071, "TdmTjKt8aa", 1],
	33274 : ["Serious note, I think Klopp should leave and be replaced with Steve GERRARD not Steve Round LOL he'd be awful.   A lot of people saying Gerrard's not ready blahblahblah but Liverpool have a good squad of players and some decent young players as well. Look at Zidane and Guardiola very little experience coached the B sides, Zidane was assistant as well for some time and then these guys won the champions league with the senior sides. They both inherit strong teams. Both actually inherit teams full of champions league winners already (Barca 06, Madrid 14). Liverpool have a squad full of league and champions league winners as well.  Gerrard has coached some of these young Pool players like Jones, his legend status hasn't worn off yet by which I mean players who grow up watching Gerrard will want to do well under him. One example I have is Roy Keane at Sunderland. I remember loads of their players talked about how they idolised Keane as a player and all this and that certainly helped him, the respect was already there.  So you might think I'm crazy but I think Stevie G should come home. It's either that or pluck another manager out of Bundesliga and I think Liverpool need the change so go for Gerrard. ", 5071, "q1BX2eXuaa", 2],

The game was played at Ewood Park(neutral venue) in front of 5000 and Liverpool played in blue and white halves kit a Blackburn Replica. Blackburn are in freefall at the moment I wouldn't mind starting again tier 3 post-covid fans back through the turnstyles again. It's like during WW2 when they played a shadow competition. I heard L/pool lost more times at home since Biden became President(33 days) in the whole of Trumps/Jimmy Carters terms combined. 5 to 4 something like that but don't quote me on that Ha Ha.", 5066, "e99lvSBxaa", 2],

	33290 : ["If your looking for unhappy players in a defending champions season you'll never beat Le Saux punching Batty. I think it was more frustration as the team was playing sh*t. 4 points from the first 15 Blackburn where never going to defend their title. We rallied a bit and ended up finishing 7th a feat I think L/pool will copy. btw I hope you had the chance to have your photo taken with the Premiership Trophy(probably not Covid and that)do fans still do it anyway I had mine taken and I look so young and has proud as Tim Sherwood did when he lifted the trophy. Edit- Yep that's it, ha ha embarrassing really Le Saux  bust his hand and was subbed and there was a lot of bad feeling towards Blackburn especially with it being in Europe(by the Media) but after that they got their sh*t together 2 weeks later we beat Forest 7-0. Shearer ended up top scorer(31 goals) but the start was just too bad. Shearer, Le saux and Batty all left in the Summer of 96(what a summer that was, a repeat is on the cards) and the Party was over for Blackburn.", 5075, "e99lvSBxaa", 1],

	33293 : ["England are favourites because if the government have their way they'll have full home advantage. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think England have one group game at Wembley, both semi finals are in Wembley and so is the final. Fans or no fans that set up should suit England. I think France yes are probably the strongest team. Euro finalists in 2016 and world cup champions 2018 as well and of course they have an insane amount of depth. They also have who should be the tournaments best player in Mbappe.  I know people fell into the trap of predicting Spain as winners of the few tournaments after euro 2012 and they were bad but Spain have an easy group and in the RO16 if they win their group they get a 3rd placed team so I wouldn't write them off at all.  In the quarter final then Spain will meet either England or a team from the group of death so you never know if they can get past one of the better teams they could go all the way. EDIT Really all games in the groups are at Wembley? So if they go through the next 2 rounds they'll play away from home if the tournament goes ahead as planned right? I think if they win their group they'll play in Dublin so they haven't far to travel for that. Dublin is a home game anyway for Rice and Grealish lol the c*nts. Tournament is all set up for England to win so. be funny if they get knocked out in one of the away games", 5068, "q1BX2eXuaa", 0],
	33294 : ["The Bears will be fortunate if they achieve an 8-8 record with Dalton. Last year, they ended up with an 8-8 record which is quite mediocre, despite making the playoffs and losing in the first round. Unless the Bears somehow draft in key positions such as WR, RB, and the O-line, the team as a whole will be sub par. With Dalton the Bears will be marginal at best. He's not the same QB that he was in Cincinnati.  He definitely isn't a terrible QB, but he is now past his prime. I think the Bears will end up with a 6-10 or a 7-9 record. The organization needs an overhaul and they need a QB who is primed for the future. Dalton is a step away from being a backup, which is what his role was in Dallas. Overall, I don't think the needle moved that much from where it was a year ago. ", 5085, "XLXncQu9aa", 1],

	33301 : ["Eh. I actually tried to flip Pop! toys... barely broke even - but I have a workmate that is all-in and he claims to have made like $600 buying newly-released limited-editions...  I believe him... but it would take great timing and dedication. As far as sports cards go the ironic thing is that eBay randomly advertised to me on the home page rookie cards being auctioned... Tom Brady - LeBron James et al... and they were over $100,000 with many bids and the auctions still going... On the other hand my friend had a Ken Griffey Jr. rookie card way back in the early '90s that was worth like $90 at the time... and to this day it hasn't gone up much for whatever reason... I have no idea how them other cards of other athletes way more recent than him are so high. I mean you can even try to flip an autographed card... but if the player that signed it does a lot of autographing it is tough... and then there are lines of cards that are very expensive per pack by default so getting more than what you paid may be difficult... I think a couple of the lines are 'Flawless' and/or 'Immaculate Collection' or something like that... with an unopened pack or box already being very expensive at MSRP.  I do mildly collect sports cards after decades of hiatus i.e. I threw out my cards back in 1994 and restarted a (very mild) collection in 2018... but I do it out of interest and fun. If it leaves a pile of value to my family if/when I'm gone... great... but I'm not necessarily leaning on it. ", 5089, "749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa", 1],
