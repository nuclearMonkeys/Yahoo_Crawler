It's the bowlers I feel sorry for in that situation, they've been working hard all day and it could, potentially, be a vital wicket that's slipped through the fingers of the fielder.

	119797 : ["It's common for people, including Christians to worry. I don't think it's really an issue of \"goodness\" or \"badness\" as much as it is maturity. I think as we journey on through this life with the Lord and He shows Himself faithful again and again and again, our faith and trust in Him grows. It grows because we come to experience His faithfulness and love in our lives over and over again. When you know His love in your experience that also drives out the fear. \"...perfect love casts out fear\" (1John4:18) which is why it's important to pray Ephesians 3:16-19 like Paul did - \"I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 17so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 18may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 19and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. \"  Pray it everyday throughout the day!! But remember this e4g, that God loves you and knows your needs before you do. And He has accepted you. He won't love you more in the future than He does now. And all your times, ALL of them are in His hands!", 10591, "UWlRLXvRaa", 1],

Finding a happy place, a fun memory or favorite activity you can think about. For some people music will work, playing a favorite song can alter you mindset. If you feel as though nothing works it is always advisable to go talk to a therapist. There may be something triggering your stress that can be resolved. Good luck.", 10591, "u9Kc3qAGaa", 0],

They don't toil, neither do they spin, yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't he much more clothe you, you of little faith?  \"Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?' For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first God's Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
