	91565 : ["Firstly, the contributors to the global warming section of Y!A are always in flux, but there are many who stick to just this forum.  During periods of different news events we see people drop by for a question and answer or two and then make their way back to where they normally are.  In the past week we've seen a large influx on \"non-natives\" with news events but there is an alarming trend to be found. Those who stop by and ask a question typically in support of AGW theory tend to come from the science and mathematics sections (such as yourself) Those who stop by with an ignorant rant about snow disproving AGW typically come from the politics section. Anyways, to answer your question, it certainly seems that this could be a culprit for the unusual weather we're seeing around the globe.  The climate is a complex system and radical man-made changes to the climate are going to have myriad effects.  The false idea that global warming is going to lead to a conversion of temperate climates into tropical ones is 100% incorrect and seems to be held only by those who haven't taken a minute of time to actually understand the basis for AGW theory and the various effects it will have. I give this question a thumbs up! EDIT: Is this Paul B?  Did you change your screen name?  Am I just now catching on to this?

Antarctica was cooling but it was exactly what the models predicted.  But when Steig came out with his paper that (wrongly) showed Antarctic warming, you turn around and said you see we were right.  You want to have all of your bases covered. It does not matter if it is warming or cooling.  It is due to global warming.", 9401, "oxFuN5fPaa", -3],
	91569 : ["Both are great. Whistler has two resorts right next to each other with lots of terrain at both, much like Snowbird/Alta. You won't really need a car when you get there. And the village at the bottom has a great nightlife, good restaurants and bars like Aspen. Banff is cheaper and the scenery is beautiful. But the resorts are much more spread out, like you find at Lake Tahoe. You'll drive a good distance to get around to the various places. You should also take into account the time of year you are going. Whistler is a very low elevation resort near the coast, so the winter doesn't last as long. The snow arrives later and becomes very wet on the bottom half of the mountain in late March, early April. Banff has a much longer season, being inland and at a higher elevation, but can be bitterly cold in the middle part of the winter. My personal preference is Whistler. But I would make sure you go between   and mid March. I'd stay away from Banff in January/February unless you're willing to risk sub-zero skiing. But early or late season, you'll have a much better chance of good snow in Banff.", 9405, "5JPqU8xQaa", 1],
	91570 : ["Previous answers give good information -- if you are a new skier who also seems to be interested in off-slope activities then Banff might be better (Whistler does have more challenging slopes but many would be beyond a beginner).   There are a lot of shops, restaurants, bars, a book store and several cool museums in the town of Banff, also hiking trails that follow the Bow River and a hot spring spa up on Sulphur Mountain outside of town.  Sounds like you've already looked at accommodations -- check out the YWCA's hotel and hostel (Google \"Banff YWCA\") --it's really inexpensive, has nice rooms (like a double with private bath for less than $60/night), a cafe and you can walk anywhere in town from there.  Great place for a younger person -- you can even stay in dorm-type bunks if you really want to save $$  -- then you could afford to go to both!  Maybe start at Banff and then, once you've had a few days practicing, move on to Whistler for the challenge. One tip:  remember that US citizens now need a passport to visit Canada (not to get in, but to get back to the US).  It is now taking from 4 to 6 months to get a new passport -- you have to pay more to get it faster.", 9405, "92a52b22ba85afb653e97e30ca2bf316aa", 0],

If I had to guess, I'd say something with his Thyroid or Adrenal glands.  Perhaps diabetes.   What's his fur like?  Does it seem greasy and sort of clumpy?  Not matted, but when he moves it sort of sticks together?  That's a sign of Thyroid issues. How's his litter box looking?  Is he peeing normally?  What's the poop look like? Anyway... VET TRIP!!!

The antidote is difficult to obtain as I learned not all vets have it readily on hand. The chemicals in the anti-freeze causes the body temperature to continue to drop, so you may notice that he will be shivering. Sadly, it was too late for my Tabitha, but I hope that everyone can learn from my experience.  There are people who are careless or spiteful and will leave anti-freeze in an uncovered container. It is sweet in taste and very palatable to cats.  This is nothing to mess around with.  Time is of the utmost importance.  Whether it is poisoning or thyroid problems, your cat should be seen by a vet, so please take him now.
