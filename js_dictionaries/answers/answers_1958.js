I have done exactly what your friend has done in figuring out the length of the war on terror. Take the current kill rate of terrorist vs the estimated number of terrorists worldwide (which includes the insurgents which the Bush administration counts as terrorists) and it turns out we will be in the war on terror for a thousand years.  It is simply not that simple and yet you have made it out to be as I have done here. I live in China as an ex pat from the USA and I concur, there are more \"hidden\" people here then the official figures show.  There are big fines for having more then one child in the cities.  People who want more then one child and can afford it, pay the fine.  But there are a lot who don't and simply claim the baby is a relative if asked. On to another area.  If China had not instituted the one child policy, there would be 400 million more people, 1.7 billion as opposed to 1.3 billion.  India, on the other hand only has voluntary family planning and their population stands at 1.1 billion with about double the birthrate of China and the USA.  India soon will become the country with the highest population with a family planning system that is not doing the job.  Also, while China's birth rate is less then the USA's, it is only slightly less.  The reason our birth rate is so low is because of the expense and now the social consequences of having large families.  While the few who have very large families still hits the news when a new one is born, there are editorials to outright condemnation from an increasingly larger percent of our population.  India is years away from that, as well as China was when the laws were put into affect.  Back then, it was custom to have 5 to 10 Children. Go to the CIA book of world facts and look up the information on population, then do some comparisons between the USA, China and India.  You will find the biggest concern is not China, but rather India. Peace Jim .", 9851, "None", 2],

	103675 : ["POpulation growth is something that Doomsday fanatics have been talking about for years. It was once believed that the Human population could not exceed 4 billion because there wouldn't be enough space on Earth for everyone to live and still be able to eat or even breath. Currently the population is around the 6 billion mark and I for one can still breath and there's still food. In fact there's feilds that are being left fallow for the next year or two so a higher quality of food can be produced. We as a spiecis have the ability to think and plan for future events. No other animal has that ability or at least to the extent that we have. A squirle for example isn't storing nuts because it knows winter is coming and has to make sure it has enough for the whole winter, like a nut a day. It stores food because it's programed into it's DNA and instincts. I've recently read reports, not by a single \"scientist\" but ones that were published by a large group that actually really researched the situation and came up with the model that if we DO NOT improve our current food, housing and basic scientific understanding, that the Human population can reach about 12 billion before we reach serious problems. So it takes us about 10 years to grow by a billion and that's not counting the fact that the world population is rather top heavy meaning that there are alot more old people than young ones. Honestly there will be problems that pop up, no one will see them coming and they will be eventually delt with. We will continue to grow as a people and our population will grow as well.", 9851, "bwK0p6xTaa", 0],
