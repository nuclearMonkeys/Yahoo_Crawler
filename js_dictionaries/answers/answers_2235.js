	117545 : ["the Colts are the only legitimate contender to beat NE this year; sure any team could have a good day - but let's say you could run a computer simulation of NE playing every NFL team 100 times on a neutral field: Colts could win 30-40 times out of 100 Jaguars could win maybe 15 times out of 100 Cowboys could win 10-12 times out of 100 Packers maybe 10 times out of 100 Chargers 3-5 times Seahawks, Giants, Bucs, Steelers 2-3 times Titans, Redskins, Brown 1-2 times out of 100", 10502, "f60cf28cd381a2e0e755f2274614540baa", 2],
	117546 : ["Believe it or not I would say the Redskins. OK, stop laughing... 1) They are running on all cylinders for the first time all year. Games against NY, Dallas, Phily, and GB all should have been won except for stupid mistakes, not by being outplayed. 2) They are healthy. Pretty much 100%. Not many other teams can say that. 3) They got embarassed when the two played earlier this year. As good as NE is, they are not 40 points better than the Skins, and Washington is not 40 points worse than the Pats. Every other team this year has gone into the games with the Pats hoping to survive. Washington would go into a rematch planning on killing. 4)They have a good solid QB in there who is rested, ready, smart, and strong. Gibbs has a way with getting the goods in crunch time from not all that great QBs. Does the name Doug Williams ring a bell? How about Mark Rypian?", 10502, "AA10275373", -1],
	117547 : ["If it hadn't been for key injuries, I would have said the Steelers could upset them because of their defensive abilities and schemes. That said, I would go with Jacksonville, except that a relatively inexperienced QB would have a lot of trouble with the Patriot D. The Chargers would be a joke against the Pats, and the Titans are even worse. The only team left then is Indy, and I have doubts there, as Manning does not do well under intense pressures, which the Patriots can and will bring. No one in the NFC can even come close....no way. It looks like it's the Patriots year.", 10502, "j1NDtqiEaa", 0],
	117548 : ["The common and obvious answer is the Colts.  They should have beat them in the regular season if not for a great come back by NE.   One team that I think that is playing extremely well in finishing out the season that could sneak up on them and surprise everyone is San Diego.  It took Norv Turner but he finally figured out that if you give Tomlinson the ball, they have a much better chance of winning.  SD defense has gotten healthy and is nasty.  When they played earlier in the year, Tomlinson didn't get enough touches to be effective and the D was missing a few people. I honestly don't think anyone in the NFC can beat them...Maybe the Packers, but their D would have to play one heck of a game.", 10502, "ykujPgQ3aa", 0],

	117552 : ["Hands down my football even though, when I first got into sports I started watching baseball because of school . But man once I went to my first  football game. I was hooked line and sunk. I still love baseball no doubt, just like mom's apple pie, but its the constant action in football that i love.", 10503, "d6d302b925a7f6c8192055493ac9c9a8aa", 0],
	117553 : ["I love my Packers more than my Brewers. I was born and raised a Packer fan while they have been really good and consistent though when I was really young they weren't great but I never really Questioned them. While the Brewers haven't been very good so a couple years ago I kinda made them my half favorite team with the Chicago Cubs while they have been good, and now they are both my favorite teams and I think that the Packers being my sole favorite team I've always liked them more.", 10503, "None", 0],
	117554 : ["Definitly love my football team more, even though neither teams hae actually won the superbowl or World Series.  Chargers are closer to the Superbowl, they provide more excitement, and I enjoy the game of football more than baseball", 10503, "None", 1],
	117555 : ["Catherine Zeta Jones is acceptable! Angelina Jolie is eye-catching to, yet i think of maximum of her charm is merely being interior the A crowd top now. some years in the past, human beings weren't speaking approximately her almost as much as they're now, and she or he regarded merely an identical. i think of CZJ is classically suitable - and merely as compelling while she opens her mouth and talks!", 10505, "QhcmO8rNaa", 0],

	117560 : ["As much as I hate to say it... the Packers. If you can rush the QB and run the ball, you have a chance of beating the Pats. If it ended up being the Pats and Packers in the Super Bowl, I'd put the line at Pats minus 7. If it were any other team, I'd at least double that.", 10502, "uh6oAdI1aa", 1],
	117561 : ["Patriots have the #2 protection interior the NFL. of course they have a shot. LT is the actual deal. Shawn Merriman is one in each and every of the suited protective gamers interior the NFL. The Chargers would be favorite, however the Patriots would desire to correctly marvel them. The Patriots have shown interior the previous few weeks that they have got a great style of weapons and that they are all working.", 10502, "1yx6FQX1aa", 0],

	117566 : ["i like the Green Bay Packers more than the Milwaukee Brewers even though i was raised to like both, i just caught on to football more. It just has more excitement than Baseball in my opinion. But I will always be fans of both but the Packers just a little bit.", 10503, "e90PbXJQaa", 1],
	117567 : ["Thats a tough one, I've been a fan of the Chiefs and Royals my entire life.  I guess my answer would be that I love the Chiefs more though, because if I was told I could only root for one or the other I would choose the Chiefs.", 10503, "c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa", 0],
	117568 : ["Im not really a Football type of person I had started getting into Football two years ago when everybody was talking about it I like the Eagles and all because they are from Philly (Where I live) but I love the Cubs so much that the Eagles don't even compare to them", 10503, "fKAnnQeWaa", 1],

	117573 : ["Definitely Jones, she is pretty. Angelina is actually not so pretty, it is all make up. But I think ppl go for her lips and her nice rack and her sexual appeal.  Actually Jones is not the prettiest dame around either. Watch Oceans 12 and you will see why I say that. I think Cameron Diaz is hot.", 10505, "None", 0],
	117574 : ["I would say the Jags.  New England has beaten all the other good teams already.  Dallas ( beat them in Dallas) Pittsburgh(made them look stupid), Indy ( the refs tried to screw them and they still won), San Diego ( just an all out massacre), Washington (52-7, need I say more),  New York Giants ( close but no cigar),.  Only the Jags have a real shot.  But they have to beat the Steelers.", 10502, "None", 0],
	117575 : ["AFC- Colts by a long shiot NFC - i would go with the Cowboys. Because they have the ability to put alot of points on the board fast. I think thats the only way a team would beat the Pats in SB. To jump out to a big lead and keep piling it on.", 10502, "None", -1],

I thought in the question you were on about Farts, I sometimes gas myself with my own so always know when I have done one of them (not that I do them all the time, although the wife would disagree), but I don't get bad BO", 10501, "None", 0],
	117580 : ["i moved around a lot when I was too young to remember so there are a lot of teams I liked growing up.  My family is from San Diego but we lived in Chicago as well so I grew up liking the Bears but not old enough to remember the Chargers.  I'd always root for any California team regardless so I was happy seeing the 49er dynasty of the 80s and 90s.  But as I moved to our final destination growing up, i distinctly remember my aunt giving me a Yankees jacket as a going away present to Connecticut.  The Yankees were destined to be my favorite baseball team as i grew up from a boy to a man.  I saw everything was right with New York and everything was wrong with Boston so I hate the Sox.  I find I'm more passionate about the Yankees than I am about my favorite football team the Chargers and a close second the Titans.", 10503, "7LhGfkrOaa", 1],
	117581 : ["I'd have to choose the Red Sox over the Patriots. I've been a Red Sox fan since I was 7 or 8 when I went to my first baseball game at Fenway Park. After that, I fell in love with the Red Sox and everything about them. They became my love, passion and obsession...and they will be until the day I die! The Red Sox and baseball are what I love above almost everything (family comes first...then baseball...then everything else!) I became a Patriots fan a few years after I became a Red Sox fan. Everyone in Massachusetts loved their Patriots. After I went to some Pats games and learned about some of their players, I decided they were the football team I wanted to root for (not too deep of a story there *lol*) Don't get me wrong...I love the Patriots...I just have a much deeper love for the Red Sox.", 10503, "None", 3],
