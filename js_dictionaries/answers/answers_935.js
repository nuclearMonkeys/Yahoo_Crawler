One is the Christian tradition celebrating the entire week that Jesus had returned to Jerusalem, was accused of crimes and arrested, sentenced, and executed on the cross (Good Friday), entombed in a cave (burial), then coming back to life (resurrection) on Easter Sunday. It is the basis of of Christianity, that Christ fulfilled a promise made since the time of Adam and Eve that god would send his only son to bring the promise of salvation and eternal life to those who believed in him.  The decoration of eggs, candy, gift giving, and Easter bunny are all remnants of European pagan traditions celebrating spring and the return of life to earth since earth was viewed as either dying or sleeping during the winter. Spring then was the earth coming back to life or waking up.  Even the name Easter originated here (not with Christianity) in the form of the word Eostre, a Spring celebration/the name of a pagan Spring goddess (and incidentally also associated with the term East). Christianity often replaced European pagan festivals as a strategic way to replace paganism with Christianity during the early conversion process of European peoples.   replaced Yule, All Hallows' Eve (Halloween), All Souls' Day, All saints day replacing pagan Samhain celebrations. Presumably there were summer celebrations too but those appear to be lost. All more or less associated with the equinoxes and solstices.  ", 7315, "BrWnVTnnaa", 1],
