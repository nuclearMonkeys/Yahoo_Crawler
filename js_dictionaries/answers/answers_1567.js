	84026 : ["This is a good question and it's not about the candidates, it's about the supporters. First off if Hillary supporters would put there money where there mouth is like Obama supporters did, she wouldn't have the problem. Second, does it really make since that Obama should now go to his supporters and say, \"Please contribute money to bail out Hillary?\"  Her supporters are asking his supporters to bail out their candidate because they themselves don't want to. I understand they can say, \"but this is the way it used to work\", but the idea is to get rid of old politics.  Let's have politics the people participate in, even it it means $20 or $50 dollar contribution.  These same whiners will say, government should not bail-out business but yet want Obama supporters to Bail-out Clinton Supporters.  Where's the difference?

I comprehend they are able to assert, \"yet that's the way it used to artwork\", however the belief is to eliminate previous politics. enable's have politics the persons take part in, even it it ability $20 or $50 greenback contribution. those comparable whiners will say, government shouldn't bail-out company yet yet elect Obama supporters to Bail-out Clinton Supporters. the place's the adaptation?

	84036 : ["I know many vets and alot of them are lefties.  They experienced the military and saw it for what it was.  They also saw it as one of the greatest socialist institutions we have in the country.  They said that was the positive part of it, Universal healthcare for all and the GI bill for pretty much a free education after service.  You may have a different opinion, but they are entitled to theirs and it's just as accurate as you think yours is.  However, if you are talking about John Kerry, Kerry is no leftie.  He's liberal and a Washington elitist but definitely not a leftist.  Perhaps you need a political dictionary to understand the difference. BTW, Most of the vets I know are extremely pissed at this government today and how it has weakened our military.  Most of our money is going to the private contractors. And, our soldiers are doing all the life threatening work so KBR can get their convoys through and the oil corporations can get their boys through.

It's not liberals who screwed up the having body armor and vehicle armor for the troops, and thus getting alot of them killed and maimed. It wasn't liberals who went into Iraq without plan or an exit strategy, and even now doesn't seem to know what it is they are doing. It is not liberals who attacked Iraq based off of evidence that was as flimsy as toilet paper.  I'm surprised that most military servicemen and vets aren't on the left now, especially from the Army who especially got screwed.

Below, I have provided a link to the dictionary definition of socialism. It is NOT only a form of government, as one poster above haughtily (and erroneously) stated. It's \"any system of social organization\" as well. Based on that definition (2 of them), Obama is NOT a socialist, nor does he support anything that would allow the government to \"produce and distribute goods\" to be \"owned collectively or by a central government\". If he did, there would be no need for him to discuss a tax plan for Americans, because for a socialist, based on the definition, a tax plan would be taxing the government which would own all businesses, if we applied that definition.

The government must control SOME things, but not EVERYTHING... Socialism puts too much control in the government's hands. It has NEVER worked out well for citizens under socialist regime and must never be looked upon lightly as a way to run this country.  If Obama wins, my hope is that the checks and balances system will keep him in check and balanced. Socialism must NEVER be considered a good way to run a government. It has ALWAYS been the pathway to absolute power and despotism. No, I am not just repeating words because they sound scary.  I like limited government.
