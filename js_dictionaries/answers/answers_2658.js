Even if you let him outside RIGHT away when you get home, dogs, especially males, keep urine in their bladder for marking.  First things first.  Take the dog for a walk before you leave for work/school. Structured walk. Don't let him pull ahead of you.  Second. When you come home, the dog gets excited regardless, even if you are quiet. You don't have to say anything for it to love you. Don't say anything to it for 15 minutes when you get home.  If it has run of the house when you are gone: make it go to its pillow, or bed, or mat, or whatever you have in the house that is his (yours, but you let him use it). It has to stay there until you say otherwise. DONT SPEAK! at first it may not work because it is used to getting SO excited when you come home, but i promise, if you dont falter, and consistently do the same routine, it works!  If it is crate trained: stand by the crate until it calms down. remember patience is key with a puppy. When it is calm, open the door, but dont let it out! it should learn that just because the crate door is open doesnt mean it is allowed out. Use your release word when it is calm again. Once it is out of the crate, DO NOT PET IT, OR SPEAK TO IT! Let it outside, then put it on its 'place' (crate, mat, pillow) but still dont speak to it. After it is calm for about 15 minutes, you can go over to him and spend some time with it calmly. dont go ' OH HI! HI! HI! I MISSED YOU BOOPIKINS! WERE YOU A GOOD BOY?' He will pee.  Essentially dont get it excited and it wont pee.  When people come over, dont let them get it excited. Tell visitors ahead of time, to COMPLETELY ignore the dog, but dont let it jump. send it to its 'place' for 15 minutes, and then let them say hi, but without getting it super excited.  I know this will work for you if you are consistent. It worked several times for me. EDIT: i forgot to add, If you keep getting him excited when you come home, your dog will develop separation anxiety which is probably THE worst problem a dog can have, and the #1 reason dogs are euthenized in north america, aside from disease or illness.  My dog got it because I was ignorant and thought his peeing would stop also, and to stop him from peeing when I got home, I would spend a couple of minutes with him whenever I left. BAD MISTAKE!

Under Barack Obama, things have been much worse. The month after he took office the unemployment rate rose above 8 percent and it has stayed there ever since. #2 Under Barack Obama, the velocity of money (a very important indicator of economic health) has plunged to a post-World War II low. #3 Real median household income has decreased by more than 4000 dollars since Barack Obama entered the White House. #4 The United States has plenty of oil and we should not have to import it from the Middle East.  Unfortunately, Barack Obama has an absolutely nightmarish energy policy.  Under Bill Clinton, the number of drilling permits approved rose by 58 percent.  Under George W. Bush, the number of drilling permits approved rose by 116 percent.  Under Barack Obama, the number of drilling permits approved decreased by 36 percent. #5 When Barack Obama took office, the average price of a gallon of gasoline was $1.85.  Today, the average price of a gallon of gasoline is $3.71. #6 Under Barack Obama, the United States has lost more than 300,000 education jobs. #7 Since Barack Obama became president, the number of long-term unemployed Americans has risen from 2.7 million to 5.2 million. #8 For the first time in the post-World War II era, the employment-population ratio has not bounced back after a recession.  The percentage of working age Americans with a job has been below 59 percent for 35 months in a row. #9 While Barack Obama has been president, U.S. home values have fallen by another 12 percent. #10 More than three times as many new homes were sold in the United States in 2005 as will be sold in 2012. #11 Electricity bills in the United States have risen faster than the overall rate of inflation for five years in a row.  Thanks Obama. #12 When Barack Obama first entered the White House, an ounce of gold was going for about $850.  Today, the price of gold is over $1630 an ounce. #13 Since 2008, our economy has lost 1.3 million jobs while at the same time 3.6 million more Americans have been added to Social Security's disability insurance program. #14 The number of Americans on food stamps has grown from 31.9 million when Barack Obama took office to 46.4 million today.  How much more \"hope and change\" are we going to be able to endure? #15 As I wrote about the other day, it is being projected that Obamacare will add 16 million more Americans to the Medicaid rolls. #16 If you can believe it (and this really is hard to believe), more than half of all Americans are now at least partially financially dependent on the government. #17 The total amount of money that the federal government gives directly to the American people has grown by 32 percent since Barack Obama became president. #18 Under Barack Obama, federal spending as a percentage of GDP (25 percent) is the highest that it has been since World War II. #19 The Obama administration has been spending money on some of the most insane things imaginable.  For example, in 2011 the Obama administration spent $592,527 on a study that sought to figure out once and for all why chimpanzees throw poop. #20 The U.S. government has run a budget deficit of well over a trillion dollars every single year under Barack Obama. #21 Under Barack Obama, U.S. debt was downgraded from AAA status for the first time ever. #22 Since Barack Obama took office, the U.S. national debt has increased by 50 percent. #23 Since Barack Obama became president, the U.S. national debt has increased by an average of more than $64,000 per taxpayer. #24 During the Obama administration, the U.S. national debt has grown more than it did from the time that George Washington became president to the beginning of Bill Clinton's second term as president.", 11404, "Y3YuQhPUaa", 3],
