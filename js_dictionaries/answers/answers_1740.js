	92697 : ["I like this one.  To look through someones eyes and see their heart means that after falling in love together with this someone, you know what they see, because you have their heart, their love, inside of you, and when you look at that heart, you see yourself because you're the only person they love. Actually, scratch that. I get it now. I originally interpreted it to mean that you were looking at the world from their point of view, and that this person could see their own heart when they looked inside of you, but I just realized it could also mean that it's just YOU looking INSIDE that person using your own eyes to see that person's heart. After looking to see what's inside their heart, you see yourself looking into their eyes. This makes the answer a lot less complicated than I originally thought. Don't let the last part of the saying throw you off too much. Just imagine one of those trippy pictures where there is an infinite \"loop,\" if you will, of the same two images over and over the deeper you go. It's similar to that. The answer is this: True love is something that can only be created from the bond of a couple, and once it is created, it lasts forever. (Hence the infinite loop theory.) That's the deepest meaning I can think of to it anyway. Damn I'm good. -Update- Well I'll be damned. I felt a slight case of de jae vu as I answered this thing eariler, and just a few minutes ago, it hit me. I encountered this same saying before back in one of my English classes a good number of years back. I'd say it was my late junior high years or early highschool, but whatever. That's not important.  I remembered it because their was a huge debate over the actual meaning behind the saying itself. If I remember correctly, we were informed that a lot of older sayings, this one included, could have multiple meanings, because everyone interprets everything differently. Unfortunately, I can't rememeber any other ways you could interpret this particular saying, but I figured that you might want to know that. This is definitely one hell of a saying by the way.", 9452, "fe6f5b91b13167453d55847831a766c1aa", 0],
	92698 : ["Some points to consider if you are thinking of a reverse mortgage:  Get an estimate. Look at what the principle will be (the amount of equity financed, plus closing fees).  Look closely at the amortization schedule for the loan (should be provided, if not ask for one. You could also look up \"compound interest calculator\" online). You will see the power of compound interest working against your equity year over year, and how rapidly the balance increases. This is not to suggest you not get a reverse mortgage, rather that you understand the pitfalls of them. They can be a good tool for some, especially if you plan on staying in the home for the rest of your life and do not worry about your heirs receiving any equity when you're gone. If that is the case, the longer you stay in the home the better, as at some point the equity will be gone and you are allowed to remain as long as you keep up with property tax payments and insurance.  If you have family that you may care to leave the home to, talk to them about your needs first, they may be able to take over the house payments or offer some type of arrangement where they may be able to offer you the same benefits of a reverse mortgage without paying the high fees and mortgage insurance which is substantial. If you do decide to go with a reverse mortgage company you need to obtain at least three offers. The estimates for the fees will vary greatly. If they know you are comparing you will see the fees drop and credits offered. It's ok to play one against the other as whoever you ultimately go with will be coming out far ahead eventually.", 9453, "sTTqU7oKaa", 0],
	92699 : ["Basically all companies have to abide by the set standard fees that FHA mandates.  Basically, there is a 2% Mortgage Insurance Premium that FHA requires and the Origination fee is 2% or $2000 whichever is higher.  The other costs are typical loan costs such as appraisal, flood cert, title work etc. With your wife so close to being 62 I would advise you to wait until she is 62.  If she is not she has to come off of title for the home and can not be on the loan with you.  If something was to happen to you then she would have to refinance the loan or pay it back in full.  To have the added extra protection it is worth it to wait 2 years to do the loan. If you have any more questions feel free to contact me.  I am a loan officer specializing in reverse mortgages.

In my experience I had a wonderful boyfriend once and I  started getting angry at stupid things and use it as a way to relate to others. I did found myself flirting but I never cheated. Then I got in another relationship which the man was worst at times and i did loved him but I had this heated moments and wanted to have a man with great body and everything else great. Guess what BIG surprise he will never be mine because theres not true love just LUST just PHySICAL. Dont confuse love with a lost love. And by the way, this ex lover now gilfriend is a rude CHILD. You don't need this nor your wife or daughter. Don't be with this emotions because she is making you crazy. She is manipulating you. As she got into your life she might probably leave.

	92707 : ["Bankruptcy should be your last resort, and you can't just run up your bills and then bail...the reprocautions will last a LOOOOOONG time.  Here's what I'd do. 1 - Return all contracted rentals.  There isn't a contract out there that you can't find a way out of with minimal damage.  Bring the appliance, furniture, into the store and ask to speak with an associate.  Tell them, DON'T ask, that you need to return the appliance/furniture because you can't continue to afford payments.  Don't accept a \"better deal\"; pay them the balance for the month and wipe your hands clean.  99% of stores out there would rather cut their loses here then not have the merchandise AND not be receiving payments.  Trust me, they'll bow out if you're persistent enough. 2 - If you're in an apartment, get out.  If you have a mortgage then that's another story.  In that case you just need to accept the situation.  But if you're in an apartment, get out!  Go into the leasing office and explain to them that you no longer can afford payments and that this month will be your last month.  Don't sway when they try to force you to make the remaining payments.  They can't take what you don't have.  Look at it from their shoes, they'd rather you be out and have someone renting that will make payments then you be there unable to make any payments.  Don't accept no for an answer; explain to them that there is NO way you can make rent, they will release you from the lease. 3 - Call every credit card company you owe money to and explain to them your situation.  Two things are likely to happen (since they wan't their money back...remember that); one, they will lower your interest rate to help you make payments; and two, they will likely set up a payment plan for long term recovery of the debt.  If you're motivated enough you have a good chance of consolidating a lot of your credit card debt. 4 - Remove any and ALL unnecessary expenses.  Unless you need it to survive get rid of it, sell it, or return it. 5 - Get a second job.  Sorry, you're going to have to. 6 - Pay one debt off at a time, don't make minimum payments on every debt.  Pick the debt with the lowest remaining balance and attack, attack, attack.  When that balance is paid off move those monthly payments to the next debt (which already has a minimum payment being made).  By the time you reach your final debt you'll be amazed by how fast you can pay it off. I know what you're thinking, this seems horrible.  It is, trust me.  But it could be worse, you could final for bankruptcy.", 9446, "None", 1],
	92708 : ["I'm with Andy on this.  Get out of that apartment.  Cancel the insurance on your credit cards - they are a waste of money.  Yes, if something happens to you, they'll make the payments for you, but - honestly - when was the last time you needed it??? And how much have you paid into it so far???  If you'd have saved that amount (or used it to help pay your debts), you would be in a much better situation today.  The ONLY reason I would suggest to keep the insurance is if it would cover you if you lost your job - and only then if your job is in danger.  If you think it's fine now, but next year that changes, and you start to thinking you might get laid off, then you can call them and start the insurance up again.  But in the meantime, if the risk is minimal, then don't pay for the insurance. As for letting your cards run down to $0 to force the banks to stop charging interest - what do  you mean by that?  Do you mean to max your cards out so you don't have anything left available?  I hate to mention this, but... interest will still accrue on your count - plus over the limit fees, which are usually about $40 a month.  The only way to stop being charged finance charges is to pay the account off in full. As for your place, that rent sounds completely out of proportion to me, although who knows?  Perhaps you live in New York City or something, and need a place close to work to not have to buy a car or something - I'm not one to judge there.  The rented furniture, though, can be sent back - and, each month, instead of paying $600 for rental furniture, spend $600 in a consignment shop for several pieces of good furniture... furniture that you won't have to keep paying for.  Sure, it's used, but if you're renting furniture, that's been used by someone else before, too, most likely.   What I would suggest is to start with your card with the lowest balance - first, put the card somewhere you can't touch it - or even cut it up (although, for some cards, to register to pay online, or to change your address over the phone, etc, you have to have the code off the back of the card).  Figure out how much you can afford to pay to your cards each month, pay the minimums on the rest of your cards, and send the rest of what's left to that one card.  This gets it out of the way faster.   Some people would argue and say to pay off the highest interest card first, but if you kill off the smallest balance first, it is faster for you, and once it's gone, you've got one less card to even deal with.   From what I can tell though, you've got a seriously bad relationship with debt, and you really need to look at your spending.  Another thing that's a killer is late fees, and payment fees charged by having to do a payment over the phone, or online (some companies charge for that type of payment).  Make sure you're making your payments using a free method, and on time.  All those fees add up! When it comes to paying the banks back, they'll get their money one way or another - if you get a consolidation loan, it's still paying the banks back.  You can't blame the banks for charging the interest you agreed to when you signed up for the cards, and received because you carried such a high balance.  If you pay your cards off but still use them, and pay the balance each month, then you'll have NO interest to pay at all.   One helpful website for you to review is this -    It can give you instructions on how to handle your debt.  As for CCCS or Bankruptsy, I wouldn't suggest either one - not while you're still working.  And if you talk to a Bankruptsy lawyer, or a CCCS councelor, they will convince you that you need to do that - because, just like car salesmen sell you a car, bankruptsy lawyers sell you a bankruptsy, and CCCS councelors sell you debt plans.
