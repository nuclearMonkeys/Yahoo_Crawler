	136588 : ["I've answered several similar questions to this tonight, but I am reluctant to go into these questions you are asking because this suspiciously looks like a homework assignment for a debate class. You could browse through the answers here over the past day and find answers to the majority of your questions.

	136593 : ["The WWE has not been the same since they lost competition.  TNA no matter how you feel about it is not the same level as the WWE.  I wish it was so I had an alternative product to watch.  I don't want to see WWE has beens.   I also believe that Vince no longer respects the fan base or allows them to participate in the forming of a superstar.  They decide who is big and even if the crowd rejects the person they will just censor the audience with piped in cheers, etc.", 11322, "8q2tFbFDaa", 1],
	136594 : ["I agree, its starting to become very very predictable. The point of Ortons attack was to get some revenge on HHH as dumb as it was. It was just supposed to make the rivalry even more personal. Ric Flair getting beat up, as dumb as it was to not have anything else on it the entire night i think is setting up a Jericho v Rourke match, why else would Jericho keep mentioning him? I loved it,. very nice to see Edge not play the coward. the love triangle will end at Wrestlemania and (hopefully) the winner if its not Cena will say he was just using her. Tna is focusing only on MeM which is making me not want to watch it anymore, miss how they were hardcore and actually had most of the show about wrestling instead of MeM promos dude remember me?", 11322, "None", 1],

Our charts are so bad a**. : )", 11320, "None", 5],
	136612 : ["Bret Hart.  So what if he couldn't cut a promo or sounded bland as heck? Even Bret realized he couldn't talk like Dusty Rhodes or Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts. He wasn't trying to be like that. But he tried. He wasn't as bad as some wrestlers I can name.   I'm a fan of technical wrestling, so I might be a little biased. I think his proficiency in the ring was great. As much as I do love HBK, Bret didn't need ladder matches, flashy clothes or fancy flips to win the fans over.", 11326, "tWzIsIH0aa", -1],
