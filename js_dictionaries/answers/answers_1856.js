	98540 : ["I would suggest ceramides. What are Ceramides? Ceramides are naturally occurring lipids (or fatty materials) found in the hair fiber or naturally in the skin. According to Butler and Poucher, ceramides molecules that \"bind the cuticle cells to the cortex and Ceramides naturally exist within the hair fiber, sandwiched in a region between the cuticle and cortex called the cell membrane complex (CMC). Here along with the proteins in the CMC, they regulate the flow of materials in and out of the cortex. Because they essentially bind the cuticle cells to the cortical cells, ceramides help keep our hair from falling apart! Ceramides are also believed to play a role in the hair's transition from \"live cells\" within the follicle and beneath the skin's surface, to the dead, keratinized hair shafts that we see. Think of ceramides as hair glue. Without them, our cuticle layers would simply fall off and unhinge themselves, rather than gently weather and erode, from the constant damage they endure. Damaged hair has typically exhausted its natural supply of ceramides, and is often brittle, dry, and difficult to manage as a result. Many hair products contain synthetic, lab-created ceramides to help replace the ceramides naturally lost from the hair during regular washing, styling, and chemical treating. Ceramides are needed as a part of any basic moisture and protein conditioning plan to restore the hair's health. What Do Ceramides Do? Ceramides perform a \"barrier function\" and help reduce the hair's overall porosity. Ceramides bind to the hair fiber in damaged, vulnerable areas to help prevent natural moisture and protein loss that occurs when we manipulate our hair. Natural ceramides keep the hair fiber tight, and cuticles flat so that the hair shines and has low porosity. Heat users will find that ceramide-rich products greatly improve the condition and appearance of heat-abused hair. Those who dabble in hair color will also find that their colors deposit more evenly when the hair has been conditioned with ceramide-rich products prior to the service. Ceramides have also been shown to protect the hair against ultraviolet radiation from outside sun exposure. While ceramides do offer a protective effect in these situations, exposure to heat, hair coloring, and the sun do reduce the hair's ceramide stores. Therefore regular conditioning is needed to replace reduced ceramide levels in the hair. Can Ceramides Replace Proteins In My Regimen? Because synthetic ceramides and proteins seem to serve similar functions by binding to the hair cuticle in weak places, many often ask me if ceramides can replace the need for protein in a healthy hair regimen. Quick answer, no. Since synthetic ceramides fill up weak areas and reduce porosity while keeping the hair fiber soft and supple, ceramides do seem like the perfect answer to the whole \"protein hardening/overload\" problem. They also support even color deposition for those who are color-treated, and give heat abusers a buffer—much like well proteinated hair does, but don't toss out your protein just yet! Protein serves a very important role in hair care, and so far there aren't any direct suitable replacements for its rebuilding, porosity controlling, strengthening effects. Our hair is made up of protein and it is only logical to repair the hair with substances that are chemically similar. While ceramides can improve the appearance of hair and help protect the hair temporarily against damage, ceramides cannot provide the infrastructure reinforcement that proteins can. Ceramides can help your hair hold on to its protein and moisture for longer periods of time so that the need for regular conditioning sessions is somewhat reduced, but they cannot replace moisture or protein in a regimen. An example of how ceramides help maintain the hair's protein structure is in their ability to fight the effects of UV radiation from the sun. The sun naturally denatures the hair's proteins, and basically destroys them when the hair is exposed. This sun exposure and protein obliteration causes the porous, red puffy summer hair many of us had as children. Because ceramides can protect against sun damage, proteins are shielded from direct interaction with the sun-- temporarily. Now obviously, ceramides cannot protect the hair forever and prolonged periods of sun will ultimately break through any ceramide barrier given time—however, the protective effect is there. Do note that ceramides can and often do build up on the hair shaft, so regular clarifying may be needed between conditionings. Also note that ceramides can be found in wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, and walnut oil and add a teaspoon of either one of these oils to you shampoo and your conditioner. Heck, you can even put this in your hair mask. ***Moisturizing*** Now while ceramides will lock more moisturize into hair you still need moisture. Water on its own is NOT moisturising. This is because it can enter and leave as it pleases. Oil layers on hair can help moisturise hair by retarding or slowing down the loss of water. ***Style*** If your bored with you styles here are some links to help you with inspiration.", 9667, "81IlwKe9aa", -1],

Most of the topics that you brought up are based on what we called, Denominations.The word denomination is not found in the Bible. Jesus Christ never taught there should be divisions in the church with significant doctrinal differences. The original church was a single congregation of Christ's followers, distinct from the world. A denomination might hold fast to a man-made tradition that was handed down over centuries and ratified by the clergy. If the authorities believe that tradition is equal to the Scriptures, then the practice often becomes infallible. Divisions flourish when individuals are unable to differentiate between God's ordinances and man-made practices. Despite their differences, each believer had one thing in common -- faith in Christ. And we all are suppose to have the same mission, first is -(Once you have accepted Christ) Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.(Romans 12:2)(NIV) Secondly, Jesus, in the great commission, commanded us to “…Go ye therefore…” (Matthew 28:19)And we as Christians want to capture the spirit and intent of what He commanded us and want to “be about the Father's business.”Seek Sinners; Save Souls; and Strengthening Saints.”   We are to tell people cool and wonderful verses like,\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"(John 3:16) Say with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord.\" Believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead. Then you will be saved.(Romans 10:9) The problem is that some Christians don't really study the Bible like they should.The Word of God tells all Christians,\"To Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\"(2Timothy 2:15) (NIV) Which simply means study the Bible.(B_asic, I_nstruction,B_efore,L_eaving,E_arth) for yourself and form a relationship between you and God....so you can better understand His Word and what He wants you to do as a Christian.So that you as a Christian,can help someone get to heaven.

For example, whether or not they listen to Christian rock music or not probably says more about what they think about rock music than what they think about God, and even though they might disagree about when/if the rapture will happen, they would still want to be kind to the less fortunate and considerate of others in their day to day life.", 9662, "HgXM0xPxaa", 1],

	98574 : ["###I'm so glad you are actively participating in this question!  It's a refreshing change from the usual way YA is.:) Sorry if I came off a bit agresseive.  I am a bit quick to jump on the offensive because this lifestyle and dynamic is so misunderstood.  There's so much ZOMG IT'S ABUSE!!!! and misunderstanding of the sub's role.  When people label subs as weak, bullied or abused (you didn't do this, of course) it offends me and I always am quick to react when anything comes close.  Subs have to have a very strong constitution and I won't get involved in one who doesn't.  If I am at all worried they don't have solid boundaries and can and will say \"stop\" or \"no\", I won't get involved with them.  Any Dom who's a decent human being will feel the same way.   In a D/s relationship both partners are equals, and it probably ends up being more equal in the long run.  It's more equal because the ultimate control is in the submissives hands.  S/he can decide at any time they won't submit.  It might be on one issue, it might be a permanent relationship shift.  The Dominant has no real or actual control over the submissive, s/he only has the control the sub gives for as long as it's given.  They are often more equal than a traditional relationship because this is a dynamic that's acknowledged and discussed openly between the pair.  It's not a state of conflict, it's a state of harmony.  Both people are getting their needs met and their happiness relies on the happiness of the other. It's a well talked about, well planned relationship dynamic where both partners benefit equally.  Some people are just a bit (or a lot) more submissive or dominant than the general population and get a bit of a charge out of giving orders or being ordered. Male- dominant relationships aren't the norm in all parts of the world.  In my part, equal relationships are the norm.  We have very, very few gender roles here.  Men can stay home and watch the kids, cook, or do laundry.  Women can work in steel mills, race motorbikes, or get a pHd in physics.  Most of Europe is like this to a large degree, some countries more than others. As a female Dom, I don't fear a man's physical strength, it's just a dynamic that turns my crank.  And yes, I'm talking about out of the bedroom (not into giving or receiving pain and like purely anarchistic sex).   As for me personally, I'm naturally a Dom (with some mild switch tendencies) but I'm in an equal relationship now and it's fine with me.  You aren't a Dom if you don't have a willing sub, you are a manipulative, abusive piece of crap.   I'm very glad I've had my D/s background, because I have important relationship tools that I wouldn't otherwise have.  I know that communication is essential.  I know that checking in on how the other is doing is also essential.  I know how important it is to have a relationship where both partners get something equally out of it. As for what a D/s dynamic is for me and why I like that lifestyle, let me try to articulate.  It's often easier to say what it's not than is.  Fundamentally, it's just who I am and in my nature.  In a perfect relationship (even the one I'm in now), I like and prefer to be the primary breadwinner.  Mostly because I like taking care of people.  I like providing financially, it warms my heart like nothing else. My dominant streak could be seen as an extension of that trait.  I like being the problem solver, the \"decider\" (to use a Bush-ism), the one who makes the important decisions.  But only insofar as the other person is happy with the decisions.  I'm always careful to listen to my sub if I'm in that relationship dynamic so I'm not really making choices that they won't be happy with. And I do have a bit of a devilish streak about me.  From time to time (on non-serious issues and only with pre-discussed consent), I might decide something I know the sub dislikes.  For example, I might tell them to cook a meal that I know they don't particularly care for.  I get satisfaction knowing they are preparing and eating this meal just to make me happy and they get satisfaction because they know that this makes me happy.  So it's kind of an inverse of what I mentioned above in some ways. I also have this thing about hair.  I love when a sub allows me to dictate their haircuts and styles.  I think because people are so attatched to their hair, it is really cool when someone puts that kind of trust in me.  I'd never make them get a cut they would cry their eyes out over, would lower their self esteem, or anything like that.  It might be something that's very different from what they'd choose, but it will look good and suit them.   And as I mentioned my Dominant streak doesn't extend to the bedroom.  I'm certainly not into giving or recieving pain and I like sex to be a free-for-all, creative and a fun event.  So while I know a fair share about BDSM, I don't actually practice it.  Sex is a time for me to let my hair down and I hope it is for my partner as well. I hope that illustrates my views on my chosen (present relationship excluded) relationship dynamic a bit better.  Sorry it's a small novel, it's just not that easy (for me at least) to explain the dynamic to someone.  The short version of why my current relationship isn't D/s is quite a bit easier explain.  There's two reasons.  Firstly, I'm not 100% convinced my partner has the assertiveness to be a sub.  Secondly, I don't think he's all that into it.  We naturally lean toward me being the dominant partner just because of our personalities, he's more passive and the milder, quieter of the two of us.  We are nowhere near what I'd label a D/s relationship.  I constantly try to move that line back towards the center and check in often to make sure he's getting his needs met and he feels it's an equal partnership. @ Junie- Submissive doesn't equal subserivant and being submissive doesn't make one unequal. The examples you gave don't strictly equate to submissiveness.  Everyone does things, or should do things, for their partner.  That's just being a contributing partner in the relationship. @GiGi:  Interesting insight into my post.:)  I never thought about how it's kind of a masculine and feminine act at the same time.  And I'm so glad the bit about my devilish streak came out right.  I never want it to sound like I bully or coerce my sub.   The sex part is difficult to explain, that's why I decribed my sex life originally as anarchistic.  I like to have fun during sex.  I like to laugh.  I like acts that would be considered \"submissive\" (don't want to be too graphic on YA:P) even though it's not how I view said acts.  Now that I think about it (you have really made me think over the past couple days!!:) ), I think it's that I like the lack of inhibitions.  If I was steering the boat, the sub would always be trying to conform to the way I wanted to have sex (so long as they were happy with it too) and that's not exactly what I want in a sex life.  I think the other person has a lot to bring to the table and there's always something new they can bring to the table.  If I'm the one steering the boat, I fear I would miss out on so much of their creativity. As for the current relationship, that's a very valid point, and I think that my non D/s relationship is just sort of a \"perfect storm.\"  He doesn't feel the need to be in charge and is passive by nature, so I don't feel a real conflict being around him.  I'm also aware enough of my nature that I'm careful to keep everything on an even keel.  In some ways, perhaps you could label our relationship passive D/s.

(I am talkin' 70's here folks) then the Jerry Curl came into fashion and everyone was running around with ringlets dripping of goop.
