Most B vent will be sold with stand off's for mounting off the joists and studs, that will give you this clearance.  When penetrating through various floors the B vent will need to be secured via a collar plate, or metal plate that nails to the walls or floor with a one inch collar around it and then a clamp is clamped around the B vent and attached to the collar to hold the B vent in place and make sure it doesn't slip down at all.", 10446, "gKmom43baa", 0],

	115901 : ["Basically,  rendering means removing the fat from some kind of meat, using low-to-medium heat.  The idea  (usually)  is to liquefy the fat,  so it can be used for another application,  such as frying/browning.  The heat can't be too high,  because animal  fats have a much lower smoke point than most vegetable fats.  For example,  canola oil can be heated to 400 degrees  (for deep-frying)  without any problem.  If you tried to  heat beef or pork fat to that temperature,  you'd cause lots of smoke and stink up your house. Whatever kind of fat you're using,  cut it into small chunks---they don't have to be even.  You just want as much of the fat's  surface area as possible to be in contact with the hot pan.  Use low to medium-low heat,  and expect to be standing over the stove for a while---maybe 15 to 20 minutes.  The fat will render out as liquid,  and the remaining   (lean)  meat will gradually brown and shrivel.  If the lean meat burns,  your temperature is too high.  When you've rendered as much fat as necessary,  remove the cooked  lean meat with a slotted spoon,  then use the fat as directed in your recipe.", 10447, "ZSyyTjokaa", 0],

Early-to-early/mid 20th centry, smoking and drying meats was very common, which allowed them to sit around safely.  Other cuts of \"fresh\" meat were often buried in a wooden crate full of lard (pork fat) or suet (beef fat) to make an airtight seal and protect them.  The cook would reach in the hardened grease w/ a big hook and fish around for the hunk of meat they wanted to cook.  Meat was more of a seasoning too, and not present at every  meal; then again, sometimes it WAS the meal.  People ate with the seasons and based upon availability.", 10447, "AA10928232", 1],
