The No eviction when the coaches entered.(I think if Joe was going that week they would of still done the eviction, there really was no need to cancel it) Showing Dr Will's Segment, Frank's parents segment This week when Shane wanted to put up Frank/Boogie Shane said the DR asked him if he's sure he wants to do that The Question mark thing in the arcade room to scare Shane off his nominations This week there was some talk of Frank cheating in the veto competition. Frank even admitted it and i guess the DR said he would of won anyways.The Feeds were off for 7 hours after the Veto so the show edited alot Frank is Allison Grodner's new favorite this year I kinda hope Frank goes during the double eviction tomorrow since Production can't do anything about it. Kinda like how Jeff got evicted last year and they were wanting a Jeff win last season(Then it went to Jordan/Rachel) @Latina there has been alot of rigging , it has been going on since Season 8.Allison Grodner does what she wants.  Alot of past houseguest can tell you that. Frank would of been gone when the Coaches came into the game since he would of been evicted. If Frank wins he should thank Production", 8944, "46cYDB8Waa", 1],

But it's best to leave it in there till it is fully cooked. The exam was probably my least favorite part of pregnancy. I hated it worse than child birth lol. It's very uncomfortable. Feels like they are digging for gold. Luckily it doesn't last too long and then he should be able to tell you how close you are getting to labor. Good luck!", 8941, "aHqEDD9baa", 0],
	78364 : ["First of all, you should be getting your first cervix exam at this appointment or the next depending on your doctor. Always ask your doctor any questions you have, that is what they are there for. So ask him/her when your cervix exams will start. Also you can asked to be induced, but your doctor will most likely say no, unless you have had complications during pregnancy or something. The reason you should wait for labor to begin naturally is because number one, if you are induced now you are more at risk of having a C-section, and number two, if your baby is born now there is a chance his/hers lungs may not be fully developed. So it is healthiest for the both of you to wait until labor begins naturally.  Trust me, I know how you feel when you say you are ready to have the baby...but the thing to remember is, it doesn't matter if you are ready...it matter when the baby is ready. He/she will come when they are ready.  Your cervix will be effaced when it starts to thin, and it will be dilated when it starts to open up. Be on the look out for your mucus plug to come...although sometimes it comes out and you don't even notice. Cervix exams are pretty quick...they are a little uncomfortable but afterwords you'll be happy to know some results. If the doctor can fit one finger in your cervix you are 1 cent. and if he/she can fit 2 fingers your are 2 cent. and so on. When you get to 4 cent. then active labor will begin and your water will break, after this you will start having real contractions. Right now you are probably having some Braxton Hicks [practice] contractions and remember everytime you have one, they are helping your cervix thin and dilate. Somethings you can do to help labor come...walk, have sex, stretch...and try not to think about it. It will happen when its time.  Good Luck and Keep in Touch! -Samantha", 8941, "47jcyMbOaa", 0],

	78368 : ["Congratulations!  To answer your question - possibly, but not necessarily.  Braxton Hicks are your body's \"practice\" contractions and are preparing you for the real thing.  It is normal to have them at 36 weeks - even ones that hurt.  I suggest telling your doctor how they feel and see if there is reason for concern.  It will depend on other variables as well such as any special circumstances concerning your pregnancy thus far or health conditions being monitored during the pregnancy.  All in all, its pretty much a normal part of the stage of pregnancy you are in and it is soon time for the doctor to be checking you weekly for dialation & effacement.  That is when you'll know if these Braxton Hicks are doing you any real good right now or not as they can be productive in this way as well.  How exciting!!  Best wishes to you & your family!", 8942, "Qbfwy05Baa", 0],

	78370 : ["For the best answers, search on this site  Yes for many end of pregnancies they do get stronger and more frequent as labor is coming. Every baby is different though. I never had any BH with my first baby - went straight into full active labor. My second baby sounds a lot like yours though. I woke up one morning because of BH coming 5 min apart. They hurt, but not bad enough to be real labor. I got up, started walking around and they spread out to about 15 - 25 min apart. They slowly got stronger, but stayed far apart. I had bad discharge that day and called the doctor because of spotting. They told me it was normal as you dilate and real labor was likely coming soon. I had trouble going to sleep that night because of the BH. The next morning I woke up early and was in \"real labor\" so we went to the hospital and later that day my daughter was born. I would guess you are getting close (next couple days hopefully?)!! Congrats! Really the only thing to do is wait. Take a hot shower if they get too painful and know it can't be too much longer.

It can make for a longer and more painful birthing process and sometimes will result in a C-section. Effacement is how thinned out your cervix is. This is measured in percentages(50%, 70%, etc.) Once you reach 100% labor should be coming pretty quickly. Dilation is measured in centemeters and that is basically how \"open\" your cervix is. You shouldn't expect anything differently. Your doctor MAY start checking for dilation, but it's not a necessary procedure and really isn't needed until you start going into labor.", 8941, "pXSKSS3daa", 1],
