	20429 : ["In a rollover, what would you expect the front airbags to do?  The front airbags are to stop forward momentum of the human body.  In a rollover, you would have rotating lateral momentum forces acting on the human body.  In that case, the front airbags deploying would probably cause some cuts and bruising to the driver/front passenger without protecting the vehicle occupants at all.   As for WHY they didn't deploy...the airbag sensors are usually located in the front bumper or just inside the front grill on either side of the vehicle.  When the airbag sensor is crushed by something impacting the front of the vehicle, the airbag deploys.  It is POSSIBLE for front airbags to deploy in a rollover, if the front end is (coincidentally) damaged by a sudden crushing force.  But if a car is just rolling over, then even a damaged front end might not necessarily trigger the front airbags.  ", 3333, "rCZe4XUxaa", 0],

	20443 : ["Three things come to mind: 1. Trucks use air horns too. 2. Some one might have been playing a recording of a railroad too loud. 3. It might have been in a movie (see above). I happen to remember a comedian who used to play a recording of a train real load when he went through some town in Texas (if I remember right). The town thought there was a ghost train. The strangest possibility is that the sound is actually coming from a train in a tunnel several miles away. There is a house in WV that used to have train sounds coming in through the basement because of the underground caverns in the area. A lot of tunnels were removed in WV and railroads abandoned, so it may not have that problem now.", 3357, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 0],

	20449 : ["If a plane takes 1 hour for the trip and a train takes 5 hours, the railroad has to pay 5x as much in wages as the airline does. Plus airports have a lot more flights and passengers than a typical train station does, so infrastructure/overhead costs per passenger are much higher for a train.", 3359, "FSYDIIwWaa", 0],
	20450 : ["Less then 1% of US rail traffic is passenger traffic. Some 91 percent is bulk items and 9 percent is intermodular. In a MagLev every rail car has to be Maglev. This translates into rebuilding some where around 200,000 cars to operate MagLev. This is cost prohibitive. It would not decrease energy consumption, it would increase energy consumption. Add to it the cost of rebuilding 125,000 miles of track as well as an unknown number of miles of sidings and the cost staggers the imagination. So to summarize- it is not economically feasible. There is research on alternatives and there are also those who are proposing passenger only services that are \"non-rail\", such as hyper-loop.", 3360, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 0],

	20467 : ["There are very few rail lines in the US that carry passengers other then AMTRAK. The few others are tourist rail roads or some times a rail excursion by an existing railroad. Often, if not always, these are day trips. For example Cumbers and Toltec Scenic Railroad. Which used to run a train on an trip that went one way one day to a town and back the next. But not at night. It had an over night stop. Traveling by night by train kind of defeats the purpose of traveling by train.

	20487 : ["I have to agree with the question America should has built a cross country high speed rail as in European nations but  To answer your question trains are fairly expensive to build rail , pay workers , maintain and operate the trains and rails services of travel . Plane - Pros you usually get to a long distance destination a lot faster if your cool with being in the sky . Cons - Its crowded with  little leg room to walk around and to much check in time to get boarded on a plane . Bus -  Pros well its the easiest way to board and convient while usually the cheapest way to get anywhere and truly to me the bus is the best option for very short travel . Cons - Well there no room to move around and it takes many stops at times and of course its slow in long distances . Trains - Pros its the best option or would be for destinations for 200 - 500 miles ( if it was purely high speed rails ) and typically there more leg room with space and can walk around . Cons - It can be a bit pricey and take a long time to get somewhere in a very long distance ( traveling cross country ) and does take many stops as the bus , if something blocking the rail its gets delayed and its rarely an option to get around it but ....", 3359, "y9Y12soRaa", 0],
