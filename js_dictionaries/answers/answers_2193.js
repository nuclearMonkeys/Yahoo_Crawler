Have you ever asked yourself: Why did Jesus always refer to God as \"His Father\" as opposed to using the YHWH tetragrammaton? (which, by-the-way, has no place in the Greek NT) It's because when you bring the tetragrammaton into the NT, you obscure the identity of who Jesus Christ is. In the NT there is a change of covenants, and a fulfilling of OT promises. Now, instead of the blood of goats, and lambs, we approach to God by a new and living way. And that's why God puts such an emphasis on his Son for salvation. Now, they are called 'witnesses' for CHRIST. Mark 16:17;Acts 1:8. \"This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Nether is there salvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" Acts 4:11-12.

	115453 : ["This probably isn't super funny, but I guess you had to be there to see it. At my dance studio I'm kind of known as the 'bug killer' I guess. Whenever the younger dancers are freaking out about a mosquito, spider or whatever I kill it, mainly to get them to stop complaining. Well one day I came into the studio and there was this huge spider at the very top of the mirror. Nobody would kill it and they were all freaking out, so I went over to kill it only to realize I couldn't reach it, being the shortie that I am. So I asked the only boy in our class to kill it and instead of just killing it he picked me up so I could reach the spider all because he didn't want to touch it! I was cracking up because he couldn't handle a simple spider. To make matters a little funnier, he put me on the ground so quick (he wanted the spider as far away from him as possible) that I ended up dropping the tissue and it hit him right in the face. And then I ended up falling right into him while he was freaking out. It was slightly funny but slightly embarassing at the same time. Let me just say, a room full of screaming ballet girls, a freaked out boy, a very confused dance teacher who just came in when everyone started screaming and of course me (who was laughing hysterically) is defintally a sight to see.

So to try to get him to stop crying, my little brother, Jacob, and his friend, Kevin, put their arm around each other's shoulder, went up to Matthew (who was just starting to calm down) and said, \"YOU'RE MY BEEEST FRIEND!!\" in unison, and then Matthew started crying all over again. lol, you should've been there it was so funny. Oh, and my history teacher is pretty funny when it comes to animals. He's traveled to all different places American and he's been around a lot of animals. He's got a lot of funny stories about cows and geese. Oh, here's another one! One kid in my grade, Evan, was telling this story after Halloween. So he went to this guy's house, right?
