You had better understand what you are connecting, including proper sized wiring.  You said:  can I just connect the positive and negative as usual?  As usual??? I get the feeling that you do not understand about inverter usage, or electricity in general.  You need a technical advisor at your location.  Update:  The photo shows your strut tower.  Why have you shown us that?", 3440, "None", 1],
	21129 : ["The 5 kilowatt inverter can supply up to 5 kilowatts of power at 110 volts if you have 5 kilowatts of power at 12 volts to put in it. A car battery will turn it on; connect the positive wire to battery positive and negative wire to battery negative. If you plug in 5000 watts worth of appliances (stove, refrigerator, microwave oven, clothes dryer), the inverter will draw more than 400 ampers per hour from the battery, which will run flat in a few minutes. Your dinner will not get cooked, your ice will melt and your clothes will stay wet. You may be safe running a TV and radio on the inverter though. Your car does not have 5000 watts to give, but can give a couple 100 watts. Woman or not, know that power input gets power output and you cannot get more out than you put in.

	21135 : ["Because of the cost. An aircraft is a certified group of systems. No one is allowed to change anything in the way it operates unless willing to pay for a re-certification of all the impacted systems. A 25 year old 737 might be selling for less than $4 millions, while a new one is $120 millions. Now, who would want to pay for new systems and re-certify an aircraft that will be retired in a couple of years anyway? Boeing would not be interested since there is no money in there for them; the aircraft has been paid for a quarter of a century ago, and their obligation is to maintain the systems to the level they were at when the plane was new, and to incorporate the updates mandated by the certification authorities. (And for the record, floppy disks were commercialized only from 1971; 3 1/2 inch floppy disks are a 1980 technology) As for the military A320, it is up to the buyer to decide if they purchase a used airplane or a new one, but generally, they would go with a new airframe since their requirements for installation would differ (no needs to passengers seating and in flight entertainment) and that their specific equipment would have particular requirements in terms of wiring.", 3436, "aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa", 4],

	21137 : ["The simple answer is that there is no return on investment to do that. In order to \"modernize\" the controls on an old 737 you would need to do the following: 1. Spend money developing new flight controls and software. 2. Spend more money on testing and documentation to convince the FAA and other regulatory agencies to allow you to put the modified controls on a commercial aircraft. 3. Spend money buying the components and installing them on existing aircraft. This includes the parts & labor for installation, the fuel and pilot salaries for test flights, and also the money you lose because the airplane is in the hanger being worked on instead of in the air making money. 4. You have to re-train pilots to fly the new airplanes and probably train technicians to service and repair the new control systems. After spending all this money where's the payback? Modern controls don't make the airplane more fuel efficient, so you don't save money there. Modern controls won't extend the range or increase the weight capacity, so you don't increase the amount of money you can earn from ticket sales or cargo fees. Modern controls don't extend the life of the air frame, which is limited by pressure cycles, so you haven't deferred the cost of a replacement aircraft. There's simply no financial incentive from a business perspective to spend time and effort modernizing the controls.", 3436, "Jvx658HFaa", 4],
