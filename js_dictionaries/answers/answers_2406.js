You can easily see what women think of men by listening to them. unlike in the 70's or even 90's women today are brazen about their machinations. and they don't seem the least bit concerned about how they are perceived because a lot of guy's will actually laugh with them when they are ruining another man. so they think it's ok to be viscous towards men. the majority of women out there who are currently lying about the father of their child and the manner in which they will attack a mans finance in divorce is not an arbitration but alarming proof of women's hatred for men. @ Mariana: That is unfortunate but the kind of man you speak of doesn't exist anymore. Your talking about a different era. A totally different male. a lot of women today use those same excuses to do harm to men for reasons that are beyond the males control. for the record men have done a lot more good for women than they have done bad. it's not like women suffered like slaves. they weren't hung and slaughtered. they were given a home and clothes. All he is asking is why women are hostile for a slight that we have not contributed to. he's wondering why women aren't decent anymore. he's not asking for a spin back on men. he wants to know why women have become so viscous when you all have freedom and are living in a better world today. i think it's a very good question. and none of the female responses seem to be able to articulate a decent response without attacking him... that's very telling about what women have become. isn't it.", 10879, "7d56JJBMaa", 1],
	126121 : ["I disagree with you entirely.   The media have glossed over the accuracies of the case, that the children were left unattended several nights in a row, that some people heard a child crying, that Madeleine was known to be a sleepwalker, and in fact painted the McCanns as the quintessential parents.   I don't know whether they are directly involved with her mysterious disappearance, but if I hadn't been following the story regularly and was from another country visiting the UK, I would absolutely think they were wonderful caring parents who had done nothing at all questionable, that's how biased the reporting has been", 10880, "AA11103615", 0],

I'm sure you are probably a lovely, honest, decent human being, but unfortunately you were a \"stand-in\" while she was biding her time to see which one of the d!kheads she has dated would take her back. Some women just think that they deserve nothing better than to be treated like crap, especially those who have an extremely low self esteem. This lady seems to be one of them. They don't think they're worthy of a man whos gonna treat them right, and can't believe it when they find one. So they'd rather go back and be abused by the other f**kers. So let her.

	126144 : ["I think that men find looks more important then women!!! Look around you see very pretty girls with ugly guys all the time. She has fount someone who makes her feel good about her self. Never puts her down. He is all about her.  It isn't very often that you see a hunk with an ugly chick!! It would ruin there reputation with the guys. Most women really look at what is inside instead of outside. We look for someone who is gonna be the right one.Not just the next lay!! We look for someone who will treat us like a princess not just some slut. All though some women may enjoy this. Great if you can find a guy with good looks and who has a good personality.A plus But in reality guys that look good tend to be assholes and think of no one but them selves!! But the same can be said about pretty women as well. But I have seen decent looking guys with decent looking women who where total bitches!! And you can't understand for the life of you why he would stay with such a horrible person. He is too worried about looks and what other people may say if he dated someone nice and a little less attractive. Look at Tv now days. Everywhere you turn the station there are half naked women all over it. And these women look as if they never had a child or wrinkle a day in there life. Tv is all about the women's body and looks. That is why we have so many sick women out there. So many eating disorders. Because we are letting hollywood and the tv tell us what they think all women should look like. You don't see very many adds for men like this???? They don't say men have to be buff, that there skin has to be flawless and soft, that they all have to be a certain size to be reconized. Heavier men are accepted better in society than heavy women. There are more older male actors then female actors. They get more parts. Women believe men get better with age where most men believe we shouldn't be seen. In the movies they show more nude females then males. I mean there doesn't have to be a reason to show a naked woman. Where as with men there is usually a reason that they are. So In a man driven world you can see who truly judges on looks. Most men produce movies,TV adds, and so on and so forth. In the future I would love to see more women get control over these areas and exploit men they way they have exploited us. And see how they would feel if the roles were reversed. So to answer your question once again I believe that males judge more on looks than females!!!", 10879, "75db27ff062adf2cfdde04e32fb3c1ccaa", -1],

If, like you say, this would not be taking any business away from them, they should not have a problem with your plans.  This would be your preferred course of action if you would like to remain with your current employers. 2.  If this is out of the question, then I would recommend that you delay your side business until you have moved to a different job.  You indicate that you are considering moving on to another firm even now.

I am never bored, but when I need something to do I play a computer game (scrabble, mah jong or bridge for me), read a book or magazine, do crossword puzzles or sudoku, listen to music, watch a movie, write in a journal, play a board game, or answer questions here on yahoo answers.  Other options, depending on my mood might be to cook something, clean the house, go for a walk, work out, call a friend, send emails, visit someone, or even go shopping. Check out sites such as pogo.com and addictinggames.com for a variety of free games.  Some people like to spend time on facebook or myspace or youtube or runescape.  Writing in a journal is an interesting thing to do, especially when you go back weeks or months or even years later and read what you wrote.  You can even start an online journal at livejournal.com.   Look for a new hobby.  Find something that is of particular interest to you.  Possibly you might like to begin researching and compiling your family tree.  I am sure many members of your family would encourage you with a project such as that.  A couple of other things that come to mind that I have found interesting in the past, and they now occupy my grandchildren are learning to do origami (read the story about Sadako and the 1000 paper cranes, and maybe start a paper crane project of your own), and another is learning to tie different knots (most book stores will have a book on the different knots, and it is quite interesting, and also a very useful skill to have).
