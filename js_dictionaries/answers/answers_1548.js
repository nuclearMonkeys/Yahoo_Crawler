As another poster said, AL is low. And I'd know. I live here. Since being here, I've been called stupid by a man who couldn't count or spell numbers. I've also been denied cashing my savings bond at a bank because \"I wasn't dead yet\". I also knew a girl who didn't know what \"Italian\" meant. I also heard many times that New Jersey is somewhere in Germany. My mom got denied a job because she said she had a college degree, and the employer didn't know if that meant she graduated high school. I've been told that food choices don't cause diabetes (in this; one of the most diabetic states in the country), and that you really must eat 2 meals 3 times a day if you're pregnant, and that you will get pregnant if a woman kisses a man, and more! And they were adamant about it! The nurses even give you home remedies, and the vets pray for your pets rather than help them. There's a lot of mouth-breathing stuff going on around here. They even stood in a long line in 90+ degree weather and cut work just to eat a Chik-Fil-A sandwich; a sandwich they never cared about until they thought it hated gay people.

	83061 : ["That's an interesting question.  This month the unemployment rate in Vermont is 6.5%.  In Alabama it is 10.5% -- that's essentially the same as the national rate.  Vermont's income tax is pretty high for high incomes, though -- 9.5%.  Below $32K it is 3.6%.   In addition Vermont has a 6% sales tax.  Alabama's income tax is 5%, and sales tax is 4%.  The national Tax Foundation ranks Vermont very low in business friendly taxes -- 46th.   Alabama is in the upper third at 14th.    According to the linked website Alabama has a very low cost cost of living and housing cost:  93%  and 80%, respectively.  The percentage is in comparison to the national average of 100%. Vermont's is up among the most expensive states at 120% and 140%. Cost and keeping your money-wise, Alabama is the clear choice.   But you more easily can find a low-paying job in Vermont, although it is expensive to live there. --- Also -- Given the choice, I'd pick New Hampshire over both -- because NH is more business friendly and low tax.   ---  Fixed Alabama sales tax rate to 4%, I had it incorrectly as 6%.

	83062 : ["Vermont. Yes, it's more expensive, and it's very cold. Alabama's cheap, and very hot. Money's not everything if you have nowhere to spend it. I live in Alabama, and the money's not good, the jobs suck (but they are aplenty if the people will let you have them...think about that for a while...), the stores only cater to \"southeastern rural Americans\", the politics do the same, and in my almost 20 years of living here, if you're any kind of liberal or black or not originally from here, you're screwed.  I call it \"1960's, but with cell phones\". The crime is bad where I live (2nd worst in the state-proportionally worse than Detroit-and makes the worst city in Vermont look like Disneyland), a lot of backwards stuff happens: my family's been publicly humiliated, insulted, spat on, threatened, had our property destroyed, had our pets killed, I've been held back a year at school simply because they didn't want to hire another 2nd grade teacher, been kicked out of public places, been denied services, jobs, police assistance... My sister even had a gun pointed at her for racism reasons. It's bad. And there's nowhere you can go for help if you're not a \"southerner\". No real culture besides what you'd expect (bible-thumping, hunting, mudding, pickups, beers, NASCAR, football; you  name it. If that's not your bag: RUN!) The hospitals are terrible, as are the schools and the food. 100 ways to make the same damn chicken tender! I can go on and on. Nightmare. But at least it's warmer than Vermont. And all that 90+ degree heat (had heatstroke once, and my mom twice) and blistering sun and mosquitoes and gnats and fire ants and \"cow killers\" and wasps and slugs and snakes and opossums and stray dogs and cats and rats and spiders and PCB's and stray bullets are heaven on earth to SOME, I guess. I'll take the cold, thanks. And Vermont is COLD. And it's LIBERAL; true. Low crime, though. No murders. Plenty of culture. High quality of life. Great neighboring states (and Canada; while Alabama's the same as Georgia's the same as Mississippi's the same as Tennessee-kinda). Great schools. Great place to raise kids. It gets a lot of high ratings, there. And allows a mix of political opinions, where Alabama does NOT. Only the NEK part of Vermont is \"redneck\", and even they are pretty cool with others. None of them will kill your pets, at least. And you can get healthcare. Taxes and jobs are a mother, though, from what I hear. But I lived in Germany and NJ, and those were better than Alabama, trust me. I'll take Vermont, Massy Chew, or any of the NE states over the \"grim block of poverty\" SE.

America, like a small child, believes him because it wants to, because we 'like free stuff'. Of course this is the attitude of Republicans.  But I don't buy it. Since 1980, since the election of Ronald Reagan, Republicans have promised to put balancing the budget at the top of their priorities.  But of our $16 trillion debt, $12 trillion came from just these three Republican presidents.  Ronald Reagan TRIPLED the entire pre-existing national debt--in the name of balancing the budget!  Well into his second term, after doubling the debt, he was still insisting the economy would be stimulated enough by his tax cuts to pay off his debt.  GW Bush had only to sit on his hands that first year to balance the budget, and he would have gotten most of the credit for it.  But he simply could not wait to undo all of Clinton's good work, with an enormous tax break for millionaires that put us right back into deficit spending.  Bush doubled the debt once more, and that's not even counting two extremely expensive (and totally non-productive) wars, which he didn't even put on the budget! Clinton and Obama worked harder to curb deficits than the Republicans.  But the Republicans keep up their 'tax and spend' mantra long after the Democrats cleaned up their act. Also the Republicans make it a policy to disapprove of anything Obama does or says or wants, to react in fake outrage, even at their own ideas if Obama says he wants them.  They can't even come up with alternatives, because if Obama says he likes them, they then have to suddenly decide they're 'socialism'. Both parties love to spend money, even money we don't have, because their power comes from spending money.  They just want to spend it on different things!  The Republicans certainly had their chance, and I think everyone pretty much agrees they failed.", 9120, "55XWsWHsaa", 1],
