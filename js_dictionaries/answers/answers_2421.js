	126874 : ["lol... it doesn't Instead of inserting your own ideology into Christian beliefs why not open the bible and read and study it for yourself?

	126878 : ["I would not call the reasonable criticism of flawed ideas 'abuse'. Religion has meted out more than its share of both verbal and physical abuse towards adherents and non-believers. What non-believers have done in return pales in comparison.  Religion will eventually disappear, slowly slowly...it'll take quite a while...and it will be effected by people who continue to point out the inherent stupidity of religious doctrine and dogma.

	126882 : ["He can be forgiven but trusted again no. So I would have to say that he made the choice to no longer be a priest when he sexually abused children. most churches do back round checks and if there is such a history I don't think they can work with a parish legally due to the nature of the crime.

I'm really confused that there have been such huge monetary rewards to people after so many years.Do these monetary rewards really help these people or do they just establish their own networks for abusing others also?
