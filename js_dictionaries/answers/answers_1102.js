	60583 : ["Proving the necessary being-God (No Qur'anic or Biblical Qoutes just LOGIC and REASONING) Introduction •	Every matter and issue is compromised of two things: a subject and a predicate. A subject is the being and the predicate is what has been applied to the subject. For example: the chair is green - chair = subject, green = predicate.  •	To prove the predicate for the subject, the subject has this predicate either from essentially (from its own self) or externally (from something else). Take for example the following issue: the food is oily. The subject, food, must either be oily essentially (from its own self) or externally (from something else). Oil is essentially oil, the food is externally oily. Light is essentially bright, objects become externally bright. Something cannot be bright neither from itself or neither from something else.  •	The predicate for every subject is either impossible, possible, or necessary. 1+1 = 3 is impossible. 1+1=2 is necessary/definite. \"I am sitting under the tree\" is neither impossible or neither necessary - hence it is possible. I could be sitting under the tree or I cannot be. •	If a subject essentially is predicated, it is referred to as necessary. If a subject is externally predicated then it is referred to as possible. Example: The table can be oily or not, bright or dark , in other words, it is possible for it to be bright or dark, oily or not oily.  •	The existence of a certain predicate for a certain possible subject means that there must be a necessary subject. Example, if the table is oily, it is definite that there must be something that made it oily. We say the oil is the cause and the table the effect.  Existence as a whole From learning the above, lets consider the following scenario:  \"Existence of things\". Either existence is impossible, either possible or either neccessary. We know its not impossible because there is existence. So we are left with the following: 1.	Either everything must exist, ie every being is a necessary being and has their existence essentially.  2.	Or every being is a possible being where they get their existence from something else (externally). 3.	Or either existence is a mixture of necessary beings and possible beings. Let's consider again: 1.	We said necessary beings essentially exist. If everything essentially existed, then nobody should be needy of anything to exist because simply their existence is from their self. But we humans are very needy of other things to exist. And we got our existence from our parents at least, if it wasn't for them, it won't be us here and now. Hence we are being that need something need to exist and hence our existence is achieved externally. And we must conclude that the theory that everything is a necessary being is invalid.  2.	If everything was a possible being, it would mean everything needs something else externally to exist. You need your parents, your parents their parents, you grandparents need their parents and etc. We faces an infinite of chain of cause and effect. Where our parents are the cause and we are the effect. An infinite chain of cause and effect does not make sense. Its like this scenario: We are in a race, and everybody decides that they will not start the race until someone else starts and that person says the same thing to himself and will not start until the first person starts. What do you face is a race that will never be started. Same in here, if there is a infinite chain of cause and effect, then there should be no existence, you cannot have infinite chain of need. 3.	By falsifying the above scenarios it comes to stand the last must be correct. For if we exist, then there must be a stop in the chain of cause and effect to a being which has its existence from its own self and is not needy of anything - what we call GOD.  Conclusion: Therefore the conclusion comes to stand that there must be necessary being out there or we would have not existed.", 8084, "l3b3Q8XTaa", 0],

And the only one that holds any validity: God is designed to fit our preconceptions, and the holes in our knowledge. Why is it that these people can not conceive of an all powerful deity that would be able to make most of the universe habitable?   Heck, make 10% of the universe habitable, that would be a few million orders of magnitude more that what we really have. Why is it that in out universe we can not live in space?  Or build a space fountain out of sticky-back plastic and washing up bottles  (I wonder how may here will get that reference!)    Why is it that this universe is so poorly designed for us to live in? If a glass is filled half way with water, then the optimist view that it is half full is equally valid as the pessimist view of half empty. But when you have a thin film of water at the bottom of the glass,  anyone claiming that the glass is part full really needs to have their head examined.", 8087, "GHdscZ2Haa", 0],

	60623 : ["I am extremely suspicious of emotionally aroused states, and don't trust them as a basis for belief. I am also entirely aware of what I was taught, and what I believe now, and I don't see any \"conditioning\" involved. I concur that religion is often used as a tool to control people, for power and financial gain. That is another good reason for looking at it critically, and making reasoned decisions. I also concur that I have no proof of my beliefs. That is why they are beliefs; there is no point in believing in simple facts. But there is also an insufficiency of simple facts as a basis for making all the decisions required in normal life, so sometimes we have to go on belief in the unproven. There's also no proof that any of my beliefs are incorrect. There is, however, a purely mathematical proof that not everything that cannot be proven is false. As to evidence: I've got a lot of it. The Bible, for instance, IS evidence by the most common definition used for evidence in a court of law: it's the testimony of witnesses. You are free to evaluate the evidence, and reject parts of it as untrue, if you wish. So am I. But to say it doesn't exist just because you reject it is an outright lie.", 8084, "FY4cCjsOaa", 1],
	60624 : ["There is evidence for God. Admittedly, nothing that 100% proves His existence, but then, we can't 100% prove much of anything. People are put in jail based on less evidence than there is for God--eyewitness accounts that could possibly be made up or hallucinated, conjecture about motive, etc. When you get right down to it, a lot of what we \"know\" to be true could well be false. Hundreds of years ago, people \"knew\" the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around it. There is no proof that the Big Bang occurred, but I believe it did because that theory accounts for all the evidence we currently have. Similarly, there is no proof of God, but I believe in Him because it accounts for the evidence we have--the existence of the Bible, passages from Genesis that show a deeper understanding of the cosmos and medicine than the early Hebrews could have possibly possessed, the spread of Christianity like wildfire after the death of its founder, and so much more.", 8084, "Ri7Brfw0aa", 0],
