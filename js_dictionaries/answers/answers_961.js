	53563 : ["You're a little late asking this question or worrying about it. Most schools all over the country began re-opening on a full time basis over a week ago. Your child won't have to sit in front of a computer for 5 or more hours straight every day. He'll have to be on the computer only during the time that his online \"class\" for a particular subject is in session - whatever those hours might be for a child who is only in kindergarten. When his \"class\" isn't in session, he can go outside and play, or do whatever he wants to do. Kindergarten isn't compulsory. A child who is just beginning kindergarten is usually only about 4 years old, and sometimes younger. A child who is 5-1/2  to 6 years old isn't in Kindergarten - he's in First Grade at school. A child who is only in Kindergarten wouldn't be likely to spend more than one hour a day on remote learning over a computer. About all kindergarten teaches kids of that young age is  their A,B,C's and how to count to ten. Many places that call themselves \"kindergartens\" and charge you for you kid to attend aren't affiliated with the local school district - they're just a kind of baby-sitting service.", 7491, "gRZNp2fbaa", -1],
	53564 : ["Unless they live in total isolation, children begin hearing about sex at an early age. It is therefore important for you to start educating your children while they are still quite young. The key is to give children information that is appropriate to their age. For preschoolers: Focus on teaching the proper names of the sex organs, and emphasize that no one should touch these organs. “I started teaching my son when he was three years old,” says a mother in Mexico named Julia. “Just knowing that teachers, babysitters, or older children could hurt him concerned me very much. He needed to know how to protect himself from strangers.” TRY THIS: Train your child to respond firmly if anyone attempts to play with his or her sex organs. For example, you might teach your child to say: “Stop that! I'm going to tell on you!” Assure your child that telling is always appropriate—even if the person promises gifts or makes threats.  For primary-school children: Use these years as an opportunity to add to your child's knowledge gradually. “Test the waters before having a talk,” recommends a father named Peter. “See what they already know and whether they want to know more. Don't force the discussion. It will likely come naturally if you regularly spend time with your children.” TRY THIS: Have frequent, short discussions instead of one ‘big talk.' This way you will not overwhelm your children. Furthermore, as they grow up, they will have the information they need in accord with their maturity level.", 7477, "7O0rORBgaa", 0],

Put her in her  bed and if she gets up, March her back into bed, stating that she is to sleep in her own bed from now on. Do this 63 times if you have to. She will scream cry and have a fit to wear you down to try and get her own way.  . If she comes into your bed at night  repeat the process of bringing her  back to her room. You must show a stronger will than she has or she will win and manipulate you. Regardless of how exhausting this may be, you must stick with it and also tell your husband that this new bed time routine MUST be followed. Let your daughter know, in front of hubby, that you love her and that is why she needs to sleep in her own bed. She needs to see you and hubby united in this situation. This is your new bedtime routine EVERYNIGHT Until the bad habit is  broken.

They'll be afraid that he might do it again. Tell him ONE PUNCH ONLY. Do not beat on the girl. That way, it will look like he was pushed to it and he just lost his temper for a split second.
