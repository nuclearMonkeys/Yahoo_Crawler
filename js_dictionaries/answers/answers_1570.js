	84161 : ["Gore (or maybe someone else) could be the answer to an untenable situation but it would have to be handled exactly right.  I am not a Democrat so I do not know if the Party Establishment is ready to ditch the Clintons once and for all.  If Hillary does not win the nomination, the Clintons are done. If the Party is ready to jettison the Clinton machine, then expect a Gore/Obama ticket.  It would be hard for Clinton supporters not to vote for the 'Golden Boy' and hard for the Obama supporters to not support the first black Vice-President.   The Party will have an easy time selling this to the Obama supporters (He is only being delayed, not denied) by pointing out that he can use the experience to become even more likely to win in the future.    Nothing they do or say will soothe the Hillary supporters.  So, Gore has to speak directly to them about answering the call to rescue the party or driving home that a victory in '08 is the most important goal. Hillary will, of course, freak out.  But now that the press is willing to expose her lies she is no longer a force. The only power the Clintons ever had was the ability to lie about anything without ever being called on it by the press. Now,  she can bash away at Gore/Obama and all they have to do is wink, nod and insinuate that you cannot believe anything she says. *", 9156, "yvPA8FSsaa", 1],

	84165 : ["I'm suprised that in this, the 250th aniversary of his death, no one has so far mentioned Haydn (1732-1809). But perhaps I should not be surprised, he so often overlooked! Then we have the GOM of British music, Ralph Vaughan Williams, 1872-1958 Both were active virtually up to their deaths. I must also mention the 'weird' Sorabji - 1892-1988, Havergal Brian 1876-1972 and to show I'm not totally besotted with Brits, Alan Hovhaness 1911-2000. Malcolm Arnold lived until his mid 80s - 1921-2006, but completed his last works in 1988 Later, Good Lord, I forgot Richard Strauss, 1864-1949 who completed his last work, the magnificent Four Last Songs in 1948. Further edit:- I take the point about Haydn, but would add the following argument. One must consider average life expectancy at the time. In 1820 the average life expectancy for a male UK and USA was about 40 (figures are not available for the world). By 1950ish this had risen to 70. (  So perhaps we should look at it relatively. In other words Haydn was a very old man, even at the time of writing his last work, compared with the average - some 20 years older in fact, whilst Strauss was only about 10 years older than average!", 9159, "ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa", 5],
	84166 : ["Certainly all great and viable answers thus far.  Two 20th century composers come immediately to mind for me. Aaron Copland (1900 - 1990) - his final piece composed in 1982, contributed a huge catalog to American music. Igor Stravinsky (1882 - 1971) - again, another composer that composed through the end of his life with an enormous catalog.  Stravinsky even demonstrated drastic change through the different 20th century style periods. It is also important to note that both of these men were active conductors up until their death as well.  They may have not been contributing to their collections, but they were still improving upon and contributing to music as a whole by adding their influence in front of an ensemble.", 9159, "vhBZrwZsaa", 4],

It takes a few days to work and after you apply it let it stay in babies mouth for awhile then take a qtip and scrape the inside of it's mouth. you will get some of the white particles coming off and that really helps the medicine work. If Nystatin doesn't work there is a product called Genetian violet that is a natural cure that doctors often use as a last resort. Due to the fact your baby will have a purple mouth and any spit that comes out of babies mouth will stain clothes or any fabric. But it works very well.

	84195 : ["This is an interesting question, Del, and there have been some fascinating answers so far. Well, I'm going to dredge up a Baroque example for you (of course!) Claudio Monteverdi (1567 - 1643) lived to the age of 76 - a relatively \"ripe old age\" for this era.  Monteverdi composed two great operas in his twilight years: he produced \"I'incoronazione di Poppea\" in 1642 - the year before his death - at the age of 75. And a year earlier, he wrote \"Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria.\"  Composing two operas in two years would be a noteworthy achievement for any composer, regardless of age - but in Monteverdi's case, I think it's even more remarkable because he was suffering severe physical illness and black depression at the time, and just finding the energy to just get out of bed each morning must have been a major struggle in itself...

	84196 : ["Ok, he was only 65 when he died, but what about Bach? Compositions: BWV 1064 Concerto in D maj for Three Violins... Pauline Viardot: She wrote her opera Cendrillon in 1904, at the age of eighty four. She died five and a half years later. Handels Oratorio Jephtha, which he composed at age 67. Vivaldi (who died young at 63), his last piece was supposedly an oratorio for Pope Pius V (La vittoria navale predetta dal S Pontefice Pio V Ghisilieri) but his last (recorded) instrumental piece was his  Sonata for Violin, oboe, and  organ. However, Vivaldi spent the last years of his life in Vienna, supposedly to compose and produce opera. I guess it can be assumed that he DID compose operas, but there is no evidence of any opera he wrote in Vienna being performed during his life time so who knows? and a modern composer who was composing well into his eighties and even nineties is Havergal Brian.

Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868), with his Petite Messe Solonelle (1863, aged 71) which is anything but 'petite', and, quite explicitly, his 'Pechés de Vieillesse' miniatures for piano, as well as songs, his self-confessed 'Sins of Old Age' to which he continued to add, right into his final year... Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934) who, though almost silent in old age, re-emerged in 1930 (aged 73) with the Fifth Pomp & Circumstance March, and the year following produced the 'Nursery Suite' as a tribute to the late Queen Mother, then Duchess of York's two daughters, the eldest of whom is of course the present Queen Elizabeth II.", 9159, "URpGdtlEaa", 4],
