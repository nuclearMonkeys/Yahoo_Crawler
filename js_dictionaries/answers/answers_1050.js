	57982 : ["Why would any woman, feminist or not be against DNA proving someone's innocence?  It seems you have forgotten that we feminists also have fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, male friends who we love. The Innocence Project has exonerated many of murder as well as those convicted of rape, any case where DNA evidence can be used. As of November 2019, 367 people previously convicted of serious crimes in the United States had been exonerated by DNA testing since 1989 by the Innocence Project.  They are also studying what caused these miscarriages of justice and list those factors which contribute to wrongful convictions –eyewitness misidentification, misapplication of forensic science,  false confessions, unreliable jailhouse informant testimony, and inadequate defense. Surely the real question is why are so many Americans wrongly convicted and why are so many ot them are from ethnic minorities and what can be done to stop it, rather than use this as a way to bash women.", 8029, "AA12022384", 1],
	57983 : ["Despite what many people think, rape is not about sexual attraction. It is about asserting dominance over a smaller and weaker victim. For those who continue to believe that rape is about sexual attraction, then why do babies, children, old people, disabled people, and men get raped? Edit: Bill, I know that a sex act is committed during a rape but that's not the reason for rape. It is about asserting power and dominance over a smaller and weaker victim by degrading and humiliating that person.", 8030, "un0C52G8aa", -4],
	57984 : ["\"Does the fact that old/ugly/modestly dressed women get raped prove that all rapes are exclusively about power and not sexual attraction?\" No it doesn't do that at all.  Rape is primarily a crime of opportunity.  Does the fact that any woman who remains at home and gives no opportunity to a criminal rapist disprove the idea that rape is about power?  Yup!  It does. Did that old/ugly/modest woman that got raped have a rapist knock on her door specifically because he choose her due to some power issue?  Or did that same women provide some type of opportunity for a crime to be committed against her?  The answer is obvious. The whole notion that rape is only about power is a feminist construct that is used to weaponize rape against all men as a group rather than hold individual, criminal men accountable for their actions.  There is simply no good reason for anyone to go along with that divisive idea unless they agree with feminists that men are all just rapists, awaiting the opportunity to rape.   The Myth that Rape is About Power Men can be women's best allies.  Or they can be alienated with divisive \"feminist theories\" like this one. This reality has been completely lost with feminists over the years. .", 8030, "aSm9xSn3aa", 5],

	57989 : ["A man has several ways to prevent being falsely accused of rape. *Avoid casual sex * Avoid sex with strangers *Avoid hooking up with a new date while she is consuming alcohol *Get to know and trust your date before sleeping with her. *Realize that \"no\" or \"stop\" means just that ... even if what you were doing with her 30 seconds ago was consensual. She has the right to change her mind. *Signing or texting consent is useless because she can change her mind any second. Those people who will have casual sex or sex with strangers are high risk and problematic while being more susceptible to false rape accusations. Some of these precautions may be a buzz kill to those who choose to have casual sex. But not all rape accusations are among strangers. I guess if you are going to have sex you need to trust who you take off your pants with.", 8020, "9MJS6I6Laa", 3],
	57990 : ["Unfortunately you did not supply the source when you found this claim, so it is impossible to check it's credibility. What is a well documented fact is that many rapes are never reported; Now while I would never claim that some women make false allegations of rape, I doubt is comes close to the number of women and men who are raped and never report it.", 8020, "AA12022384", -1],
	57991 : ["Yes, the feminists have manipulated truth for a very long time to push their hate of men. We live in a feminized society, and the only answer is for more and more good people to wake up to the hate, hypocrisy and evil that feminism is. Look at all the double standards women call equality today - look at the level of contempt and total lack of respect women have for men that they call normal these days - It's all about a mothers rights, but no fathers rights.Women being treated like princesses in prison and men being treated like animals. Female prison guards humiliate and degrade men with strip searches, shower supervision etc, but female prisoners get privacy and respect from male prison guards.Men have to register for the draft and selective service, women don't. This is clear discrimination and shows women don't value mens lives the way they do their own.Bodily choice for women, but forced genital mutilation for boys, referring to women's rights to their bodies in terms of abortion, but boys being circumcised without choice.Female reporters and staff allowed in men's locker rooms, but privacy and respect for female athletes. This is the definition of feminist equality. Is this an example of the respect that feminists claim MEN don't have for the opposite sex?Its women getting everything in a divorce, and men being torn away from their childrenFemale sex offenders being slapped on the wrist, but male sex offenders being incarcerated the rest of their livesIts men being sentenced to more time for the same crime than women. This can be researched under the US government and shows that women don't get held accountable to the level that men do.Women having the right to use the men's room, but a man who walks in to the women's room is arrested for being disrespectful and perverted. Men use urinals, but that's still not enough for women to have basic respect for men's privacy.Its a feminized education system that cripples natural behavior of boys, makes being male a crime in school, then girls claiming they are smarter.Why is it when two people under the age of consent have sex, only the boy is charged with doing something wrong?Its women being allowed to drown five children and using the fact she is a woman to get away with it - Andrea YatesIts women being allowed to use domestic violence as an excuse to murder a sleeping husband, even though there is no evidence of domestic abuse - Mary WinklerIts the extensive abuse of restraining orders to vilify an innocent man and get leverage in a divorce. A restraining order against a man can be served even without his knowledge or an opportunity to defend himself.Its men being jailed for defending themselves against an abusive wife, but called a wimp if he takes the abuseIts women demanding respect from men, but never having to respect them in returnIts women having the choice between abortion, adoption, dropping an unwanted baby off at a hospital, raising the child with a father, or raising the child without a father, but the only choice men have is to agree.Its 3 innocent Duke Lacrosse players losing their lives because we don't ever think a woman could lie about rape - let alone prosecute her for doing so.Its women labeling men as abusive when the US government has shown women cause more child abuse than men.Its female rape being horrendous, but male rape being funny and made in to comedy movies. Rape is a legally accepted part of the justice system, but only against men.Its just about every TV show being allowed to humiliate and degrade men, but women complaining and calling it sexist if they were treated the same.It's more health care spending going towards women's health than men's. Breast cancer receives 7 times the funding of prostate cancer. There are three departments of women's health in the US government, but none for men. However, men live an average of 5 years less than women when the genders used to have the same life span.Its allowing women only clubs and banning men only clubsIt's doing everything we can to help girls in math and science, but letting boys fall further behind in everything else.It's defining equal pay for equal work as men playing five sets of tennis, but women only playing three. Maybe women claiming 3=5 is the reason for the above pointIts cutting men's sports in college in favor of women's sports that have no interestIts female murderers being mentally ill, but male murderers just being evilIts claiming men walk out on their family when its actually women who file 80% of divorcesIts men being portrayed as evil, stupid or buffoons on TV and all women being perfect or superior.Its women wanting equality for their gender, but men being called chauvinist pigs when they want equality for their genderIts fixing the education system when girls are failing, and blaming the boys when boys are failingIts women being allowed to level false accusation against an innocent man without consequence. Read Duke Lacrosse and many other examples. Feminism has installed this right to women through the courts.Its a man being a chauvinist, sexist pig when he doesn't respect women, but a women who doesn't respect men is an admirable, strong and independent woman.Women remove male role models from their sons' lives, then when their sons behave badly, the women blame \"patriarchy.\"Stereotyping girls as inferior to boys in any facet of life is \"misogyny\"; stereotyping boys as potential batterers and rapists is a public service announcement.Married men who have affairs are selfish pigs; married women who have affairs are seeking the fulfillment they are not getting in their marriages.Women insist their husbands assume the responsibilities of being a full parent, but as soon as a woman files for divorce, he is just an ATM.Its feminists not being able to provide one example of legal discrimination against women in the US today. Reverse the genders in ANY of the above and women would be screaming about the patriarchy and shrieking about how little respect men have for women.", 8020, "0598aff171be5b3a01a9295637d229edaa", 1],

	57994 : ["It is a term created by misandrists who suffer from a mental derangement recognized and described by mental professionals called p*n*s envy. men were expected to be the providers of discipline and women would be  the nurturing response. The scold of; \"wait till your dad gets home\" was the woman's way of always getting to be the nice parent the kids will run to.  Now the feminists are unwilling to be nurturers or to be bothered by being mothers at all, so they want to replace men in society and intend to do so with all of this nonsense we see today.", 8021, "2EddmzfAaa", 5],

	57996 : ["A patriarchy is a system of rule in which only men are allowed any say in governance which they use to their benefit.   Feminist Patriarchy Theory is the presumption that the U.S. is a patriarchy, that women have no say, that men rule snd use their power of rule to oppress women.   It is a victim mentality.   Importantly, feminists are that because women are oppressed by men, women are owed advantages to balance this oppression.   ", 8021, "None", 5],

	57998 : ["I don't have any hope for anything to change in the way I would like to see happen. There is no doubt in my mind that gender relations will continue to get worse in the same way they have been doing for longer than I have been alive. The elite will continue to push the narrative and desires of feminists, they will continue to work to undermine men and ignore men in all aspects of life, and all the while this is going on the government will continue on their quest to turn into China 2.0. When the government reaches it's goal of being China 2.0 reaches feminism will die much like it has in the past in the tyrannical regimes that followed it. They will likely exploit it though like what happened in the USSR.   What I would like to happen is so far gone at this point that I have no hope of ever seeing it in my lifetime. ", 8037, "15coUBsxaa", 0],

Nancy Grace and the other shock jockeys of her ilk owe the world an apology and, frankly, SHOULD owe the accused libel damages. Yeah, being an entitled a$$ is annoying to the rest of the world, but it isn't illegal, it doesn't mean you have committed a crime, and it doesn't mean agenda based groups (such as feminists) have the moral right to pillory you for crimes they wish you had committed so they could make their misguided point.", 8018, "8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa", -1],

And men should stop toying with women like it's a fun game, and women shouldn't be being nice to men leading them on to take advantage of them. We need to consider not messing around with members of the opposite gender unless we are in a serious relationship with them and then no rapes, or rape allegations would be made.  ", 8018, "YjP01XlEaa", 0],

The Pixies were responsible for opening to mind to music outside of the heavy metal, classic rock, and hair bands that I listened to when I was 12, way back in 1991.  I'm forever thankful that I heard them before Nirvana could have warped my impressionable mind.  Of course they broke up the next year and they never released another album.  Thankfully Frank Black did, and my love of the Pixies carried over to him.  Throughout the years his music matured as I did, and each album serves as a time capsule that helps me remember a certain period of my life.  There are too many favorites to mention, but here are a few lesser known tracks. Fields Of Marigold  The Swimmer  The Seus  How You Went So Far  Sing For Joy  Threshold Apprehension  So.
