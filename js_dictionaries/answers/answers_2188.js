	115196 : ["Wow, that's a lot of questions.  Yes, I see a double standard that I agree is fading away over the decades.  My impression is that it also decreases as we get older.  I hear my teenaged children voicing the words that reflect this double standard much more than middle-aged friends.  Different people find promiscuity undesirable for different reasons; mine is purely psychological.  I don't think it's emotionally healthy, didn't feel good to me when I tried it in my youth, and I think it's largely for people avoiding emotional intimacy.  It's certainly been my anecdotal observation that people I knew who were promiscuous beyond adolescent experimentation had serious relationship issues, sometimes diagnosed personality disorders.  I would include most of the people I have met who believe in open relationships.  Mostly, I don't find it \"unacceptable\", though as long as the person being promiscuous isn't someone sleeping with me. I don't see men preaching against promiscuity in a gender-specific fashion in the U.S., but I'm no anthropologist and don't know about elsewhere.  I actually don't hear the issue discussed much, to be fair.  As for the \"two to tango\", I see it this way.  I think men with this philosophy are content that some of the women they would condemn with those bad names are available for them, and don't feel hypocritical because they can condemn the women they sleep with.  If the promiscuous women have sex with a lot more men than vice-versa - and I have to say promiscuous is a hard word to type, not flowing off my fingertips - then the math says these men can have their fun and still have a world of largely monogamous women. I understand the biological issues mentioned above, but am not sure they are the basis for our values or whether the double standard comes from an imbalance in power.  I would speculate that if you compared societies in which women had more or less power, this double standard would be in force more where women had less power.", 10421, "None", 1],
	115197 : ["This double standard is wrong of course, but it's slowly eroding especially in the media and reversed in a nasty way. To be fair Double X, this is not the only double standard. How many movies are there where a woman gets cheated on and plots revenge with her friends? I sometimes spot articles in womens magazines where the writer promotes the idea that it's okay or at least excusable for women to cheat especially if emotionally neglected, not geeting what she needs and so on. I think the double standard you speak of persists as a holdover from the past. Men have more to risk from their partner being promiscuous because men can be cuckolded and women can't. Men who don't worry about wifey's whereabouts don't pass on their genes. A cuckold suffers the indignity of supporting the children of the guy who ****** his wife and even further humiliation in some modern societies when he is forced by family courts to continue payments. A man who gets cheated on can expect to be teased about it even by other men. If a woman gets cheated on she can expect sympathy, approval and support. How dare that jerk/dog/bastard, you go girl!!!

	115198 : ["I think this bias against women stems from women's need to cling and tie down men, long before men are actually ready or inspired to make a pledge or vow of commitment. Women have less brain power and are therefore genetically predisposed to being manipulative and cunning engineering. Also women are generally left holding the baby as it were, and should then exercise caution and self restraint to avoid this grave injustice upon an innocent child. Marital breakdowns are caused largely by male infidelity. Men will rarely exit a marriage unless there is a troll inciting and encouraging him to do so. In conclusion, therefore, women would appear to be the root cause of all evil and suffering. Promiscuity generally is unhealthy and immature. Life is an adventure and a learning experience. Socialising and strengthening the spirit rather than a habit of having physical relations with each person you meet.  Disease and many related ailments arise from promiscuity. Love is found by awakened spirits and free enlightened minds.

They are super Cheap (mine is an 82, but it functions fine and was registered/inspected when I bought it for $500 recently, plus the tires/gas/insurance etc cost is very low ), they are rugged, they have forgiving brakes/suspensions, tourquey motors, low gearing and progressive clutches. They are rugged and you wont likely damage much if you drop it. They are also light, which makes them ultra nimble as well as easy to handle around a parking lot. All good for a first timer. Plus you can go off road.  Compared to a sportbike they have a few draw backs. They are not as smooth at speed. They are not good for two up either. Of course a 250 ninja or a racerep dont exactly excel in these areas either. The sportbikes also generally PULL and PULL and PULL. A thumper is quick, but nothing like a liter bike. Sportbikes are actually a little harder to turn in than dual sports, but have much better traction and ultimate lean angles. So they can corner much faster. The biggest difference is brakes. DS usually dont have great brakes for hiway use, but then they are designed to be effective in the dirt.  With the 250s the differences wont be as profound. The KLX (even SF) isnt much of an Enduro, the Ninja isnt much of a race bike.  The supermoto style S is a good middle ground, but unless you are small, never want to travel two up, and don't plan on exceeding 55mph I would look to something a little stronger.

And yet even more independent research puts the number of false rape claims at between 27% to  60%: (this also shows that 1/3 of the time DNA proves the accused did not rape the accuser) The few feminist sponsored \"surveys\" trying to prove huge numbers of women have been raped but just don't report it have also been debunked: They even have started proving that using DNA evidence today on old cases where it wasn't available at the time of convictions that men convicted of rape are actually innocent (and the women who convicted them just let them rot in jail, and would have continued to let them rot in jail): And, now feminists are pushing for more \"rape shield laws\" to ensure that the defense can't present any evidence about the accuser (has she lied about rape before, did she have a grudge against the person she was accusing, has she told others that she was going to get back at the accused for some perceieved wrong, etc).

I'm sure you must have seen/heard about her. That's her pic :-  She always wanted to be a model but her parents weren't quite happy with this because she wasn't able to focus on her studies ever since she finished her high school. At one point she even had to quit her studies. Her parents even tried to marry her but despite all the challenges she stuck with modelling hoping one day she might get a chance. And finally her hard work paid off when she got a chance to participate in \"Pantaloons Femina Miss\" 2007 and luckily she came 2nd & won the title of Miss Universe. After this everybody supported her and then she decided to relocate in Mumbai. You're not gonna believe this but today she earns in Lakhs.

BTW - a person cannot be a rapist until such time as a PROPER conviction is made.... that's Law.... That fear of it happening, however, is a very solid plank in the current Reign of Terror against Men... under the Culture of Rape Accusation... in the same way as the 'Culture of Rape' was generated by Faux Feminists and adherents as a weapon against men - now they have gone one further and now we have an established Culture of Rape Accusation to similarly attack men.", 10420, "jCL8xsgtaa", -1],
