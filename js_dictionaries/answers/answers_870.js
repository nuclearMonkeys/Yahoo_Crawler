The ends are the oldest parts of the hair strand and the ends are always more fragile and two.in ones don't offer the same protection as a richer conditioner.Llastly, they don't clean as well as regular shampoo nor do they condition as well and a regular conditioner. If you use heat or if your hair is chemically treated them a two in one might not be enough.
