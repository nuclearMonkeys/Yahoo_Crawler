Buying up toxic debt and propping up untenable industries is less useful than spending that money on major public works and infrastructure would have been, The latter idea would have provided jobs and also left the country with some assets for the future in terms or roads and bridges and levees. Now all they have is a bigger debt and another year to wait for the insolvent companies to fold.

The influence of Eoin Morgan in the side should not be underestimated, his fearless approach to ODI cricket seems to have inspired England into playing better. * England enjoy South Africa's attack: England love playing pace on the ball, most English batsmen are more than comfortable playing the ball on the back-foot and working the pacemen away. South Africa's bowling attack is one-dimensional and England are capatilizing on it * England have a better team: No weaknesses in the side at the moment. Strauss and Trott is the best opening partnership England have had since Trescothick was in the side, Pietersen, Collingwood and Morgan are all strong ODI batsmen, Prior can hit the ball a long way as can Luke Wright. Then the wicket-taking option of Broad and Anderson coupled with the control of Bresnan and the capable spinning abilities of Graeme Swann South Africa's decline: * Wrong team selection: South Africa's batting line-up is looking weak, with Boucher batting at 6, South Africa are vunerable to a collapse.

Hence I would say they urgently need good bowlers.
