The ignorant pukes who don't study medical care are easily deceived and will say any moronic crap their neo-Nazi filth commentators on Fox or hate radio tell them to.   We're the ONLY civilized country in the world with no National Health care plan.    The scum of the neo-Nazi ultra-right are determined to stop ANY kind of health care reform, and are more than willing to fudge or hide statistics, or to lie.  Listen to the junkie dropout psychopath Limbaugh or the arrogant nitwit/liar Hannity and you'll see what we mean. The reason for the longer life span is simple:  prevention!   American \"private health insurance\" isn't interested in prevention, and most American M.D.'s  have no such agenda, they just suck patients dry for the last dollar.

	77537 : ["Hmmm - always a moving target this one so there's no single \"best\" answer to be had. That said, assuming you use a PC, try Avast (www.avast.com) it's free for personal use, is updated regularly and automatically and usually comes in at the top of comparative reviews. For spyware, I use Spyware Doctor - it's not too expensive and does a good job - albeit at the price of some occasional disk activity and CPU overhead. It should deal with most spyware / malware / trojans. As for spam - that really does depend. Who is your email service provider? The best solution is to ask them to implement spam blocking at their server (they can use techniques such as DNS lookups of known spam senders). Apart from that, you are left with trying to train one of the anti-spam filters that link to your email client. You need to see which of these will work with whatever email program you use and read reviews to decide which might work best for you. I have, of course, no relationship with the companies and products mentioned other than as a happy user. Hope this helps. George", 8894, "g4mnVVJiaa", -2],
