It's a lot stronger than Certain-Dri, in fact the first few times I used it it was pretty painful! But it worked like crazy. You'll have to get a prescription from your doctor for it, though. There are other new technologies like Botox injections in the underarm area, or even surgery, but those are obviously a lot more expensive and more serious.", 9487, "16a8a96b0e70c39de9ce4200db9e3e78aa", 0],

	93602 : ["Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the imaging of structures by virtue of their ability to concentrate specific molecules that have been labeled with a positron-emitting isotope usually positron-emitting isotope of fluorine, (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). Metabolically active cells, including malignant cells, utilize and import more glucose than other tissues and thus take up FDG more avidly. Any process within the body that needs more glucose will light up on a PET scan, so yes to cancers as well as other processes. False-negative results can occur with tumors that have low metabolic activity (eg, bronchioloalveolar tumors, carcinoids, and some well-differentiated adenocarcinomas), small lesions (a critical mass of metabolically active malignant cells is required for detection by PET), and uncontrolled hyperglycemia because the uptake of FDG is retarded by the hyperglycemia. False-positive results can occur in inflammatory conditions and granulomatous diseases as well as infections. All that being said, when you have a PET scan done, the areas on your body that light up are measured and compared against each other by quantiying how much of the FDG has been taken up.  The higher the amount the higher the number of SUVs (standard uptake value); and, I suppose, the \"hotter\" they are.   So, 10 SUVs is rather high.  Now, I am being perfectly honest with you.  SUVs above 2-3 are more consistent with a malignancy (though not always so), though as I states above, an active infection could also elevate the SUVs.  I would say that if you haven't spoken with your physician, now would be a good time.  The only way to diagnose the cause of your \"hot\" lymph nodes in your mediastinum would be a biopsy of the \"hot\" tissue unless your history and physical exam obviously point toward something else. Good luck to you, and let me know if you need anymore info. Physicians are here to serve you.  You pay their bills and make them rich.  You are their boss, in the end, no matter what they make think or how they may act.  Sometimes, you have to remind doctors about that fact.", 9486, "8c51ddb784a51516102fca17842540b2aa", 0],

Obama will work for senior citizens. Obama will work for those who call him racist, elitist and anti-American. The empathy you claim Obama lacks is the reason for the Obama movement. Obama returned to Chicago to work with churches as a community organizer after graduating as president of the Harvard Law Review. Obama has sponsored and passed his most significant legislation with republicans - the Lugar-Obama Nuclear Non-proliferation Act and the Coburn-Obama Transparency in Government Act. Obama has helped create and pass groundbreaking lobbying and ethics reforms in the Illinois and US Senate to help empower voters rather than lobbyists.  Obama has empathy for the poor and disadvantaged and finds things in common with those who he disagrees with. Obama does not take money from lobbyists and special interests while legislating to limit their control in congress.", 9482, "QSiV1t2Faa", -2],
