If God has 'heard' your prayers, that's usually an indication that He is about to act. So yes He hears (audibly) everything. As far as being saved, God chooses us and besides it being written, we know this if we feel Him 'tugging' at our hearts, if/when you feel that, and you confess that you are a sinner, then you may pray to receive Jesus. There's much more to this but it's hard to speak in this little box.", 9324, "None", 0],
	89277 : ["Let me say one thing about the whole God's children thing. Not everybody is God's children because not everyone has received Jesus into his heart. As far as God hearing your prayers, He cannot communicate with you on a level like a daughter to a dad because you are not related to Him. But, here is the wonderful news. Jesus was crucified for your sins and He did that so that you would have a chance to go to heaven. Forget about trying to do enough good works to get to heaven because you have to be perfect according to God's standards because He is completely sinless and He expects you to be that in order to get into heaven. Not you, me, or anyone else has kept the law (ten commandments) without messing up one time. All it takes is one time and that is it. The Bible says that if one tries to keep the entire law and yet messes one time, he is guilty of breaking the whole thing. I am saying that you must trust Jesus's sacrifice on the cross because He is your ONLY hope because He is perfect and that is the only way that you will get to heaven. But there is a warning that you must know about. if you reject Christ and choose to try to get to heaven by yourself, then you will end up in hell. I am not trying to be mean whatsoever, I am just telling you the truth because I truly care for your soul. To finally answer your question, all you have to do is (1) admit that you are a sinner and realize that you cannot do anything to get to heaven on your own, (2) ask Christ to forgive your sins, (3) and invite Him into your heart and you will be saved. One more thing and then I am done. The prayer will not save you. You have to mean in your heart and be genuine about this because He already knows your heart and He wants you to be completely honest with Him and as transparent as possible. Once again, i hope that i have successfully answered your question.", 9324, "AA11413747", 0],

They dupe all these oysters into following them and then proceed to shuck and devour the helpless creatures en masse.
