I lived in south-eastern Pennsylvania near Amish areas, in the 1950's and 1960's, and their cheeses, breads, and root beer were very tasty.  I suspect Amish root beer was made from sassafras roots, only because I know that sassafras grew in the woods behind my house .. .don't know if Smilax ornata vines (sarsaparilla) grew locally.  The leaves of sassafras trees are very distinctive, and as a child I loved how some of them looked like little mittens.", 6670, "None", 0],
