	125275 : ["Great Question. Now in my opinion a great feud consists of a couple of things. Now the first thing is I think that a great feud is when the wrestlers that are in the feud are able to display there talents. For instants having good or great matches would be an example of the wrestlers displaying or showing there talent. Another example of displaying there talent is improving on the mic or either getting better on the mic. I think that a wrestler in the feud needs to have somewhat decent mic skills but if he or she is working with a someone who has experience and is good then that superstar or superstars will improve on the mic and get better. See sometimes there needs to be an experience wrestler in the feud or someone who needs the basic fundamentals to make the feud good. The second thing is there matches needs too or have too be good in order to keep the fans anticipated for the match. For an example would be The Rock vs Stone Cold , ahh this was a very entertaining feud and will probably go down as one of the greatest if not the greatest of all time. But my biggest problem was with there rivalries and feuds were that the matches were boring in my opinion. When they entered the arena I was excited but when it came to actually wrestling I got bored and they weren't as exciting. So it is very important for a wrestles to have good or maybe even decent matches so that the fans will be entertained with there work in the ring too. I think alot of wrestlers become labeled as overrated or overpraise when they have good mic work or skills but there matches were average or nothing special, so having good matches is something that you must need, in my opinion. Another thing that a feud needs to be great or considered good is build up. Build up is probably one of the easiest elements that can be offered in a feud because all the wrestlers need is camera time. In order for people to get excited about the feud there needs to be great build up to there matches. I am talking about brawls, anticipating promos, attacks, cheap heat, all that good stuff. There needs to be a connection with the build up two, have the wrestlers do things that will keep we as wrestling fans hook to the tv, you have to be consistent. You cant have two wrestlers feuding for two weeks, a couple weeks later they don't get any camera time then they have a match at the pay per view. Most people will forget about it and probably wont care. The storyline has to be good, it revolves everything that happens between the two or more wrestlers, most storylines that involve a background or history has good and easier build up you can depend and use that for the wrestlers. The storyline needs to be creative and make since, which means that it needs to be something that people will actually want too see. And now a days it is almost impossible to please wrestling fans these days. BQ: I haven't got it. I heard it was OK personally it does not look all that good from what I have seen from the videos and the reviews. It seems like another video game by WWE, it lacks basic things like good graphics, creative, full roster, actual arenas and a few others.", 10839, "EUkUPuP6aa", 2],
	125276 : ["A great feud is where the rivalry and the intensity is so palatable because you beleive these guys loath each other to the Nth degree.

	125277 : ["Shane vs Kane Before I get into the \"dirty\" of the answer, I wanted to provide an amazing answer to a great feud. Many people will not remember this feud, and I know you started watching back in 2006, right? So, you may not have seen this feud, but you sure have heard of it, hopefully, if not, you are seriously missing out. Stone Cold and The Rock paled in comparison to this rivalry. It is usually the smaller rivalries who get no credit but who provide the best entertainment, and wrestling for that matter. Three examples of an amazing feud. Shance McMahon has to witness his own mother take a tombstone from a recently unmasked Kane. On the stage, with is made from solid steel. Of course, he just tucked her head underneath his crotch and to no affect, did the move hurt. However, it was portrayed to be one of the most compelling storylines in the history of the company. ...then, one night on RAW, Kane pours water on Shane. Handcuffs him to the steel post and to make sure there is no escape, puts the steel steps in front of him so that he is incapable of moving. He then takes out jumper cables and attatches them to Shane's manhood. So, this is just a storylines I presented so I could get to the real answer. What is a good definition of a great feud? Let me summarize it in a few short paragraphs. 1.)Personal-If it is just a random storyline put together at the last minute, it would have no point. Reasons why the Invasion in 2001, was such a success. It had that personal factor due to the rivalry between the promotions, who at the time, were going out of business excluding the Federation. It has to have that personal effect, without it, it would not have a \"shock value\" and without that, it would be a small storyline as we see amond the tag-team and diva's division as of late. They aren't giving personal storylines and when they are, they don't last long. 2.)Entertainment-I am one of those wrestling fans who perfer wrestling to sports entertainment, however, you do not need wrestling in a successful rivalry. Even with the Booker T and Kurt Angle rivalry back in 2005 in which Angle wanted Sharmell. It didn't involve that much wrestling to be successful, but it had the storyline, and the entertainment product, and personally, that's all that matters. So, in order to be successful, it has to be entertaining. This falls hand in hand with stables, they have to be entertaining to stay alive. Examples would be The Four Horseman, Evolution, and currently, NeXus. Great Feuds: 1.)Kane vs Matt Hardy 2.)Bruno Sammartino vs Buddy Rodgers 3.)Edge vs John Cena BQ:I don't like it. From what I heard. The only good things were the graphics. I have never got gotten a game. Ever since Shut Your Mouth in 2002, I've bought every single one, but I will not be getting this one, not by a long shot.

	125278 : ["I agree with this and to me it contains a lot of common sense (like breathing before the honeymoon). But I think that it also depends a lot on personal taste because some people like the look of matching bridesmaids and like the formality of assigned seating. Personally I agree with the matching bridesmaids one, if they match too much I get images of \"Attack of the Clones\". I had three totally different bridesmaids so I allowed them to pick out their own dress but gave them colour guidelines. I loved that they were different because it reflected who they were. We pretty much did everything else it mentioned, tossed petals instead of rice and only assigned tables and not specific chairs but we did do a garter and bouquet toss since both of us thought of it as a fun tradition. Yes it's a touch cheesy but I like some cheese :) But again, in the end it shouldn't be classed as \"the worst traditions\" because it's all a personal decision of the bride and groom.", 10840, "AleWgjvPaa", 4],

	125303 : ["Okay, let me start out by saying that I'm all for home schooling, just so you know that my answer isn't based on a pro-school bias (I hate the school system). That said, pulling her out of school does not solve her problem. Yes, she might not pull her hair as much when she's not in school, BUT, you cannot try to prevent all stressful situations in life just so she won't pull her hair. You didn't say how old she is (I'm assuming she's in high school, but I could be very wrong), but some day she might want to go to college. College is going to put similar stresses on her as high school (not exactly the same, but still... similar in many ways). You don't want to teach her that her trich is causing a problem to the point that she can't participate in normal life activities. You also don't want to teach her that her trich is a good way of getting out of activities she doesn't like. So, there are multiple reasons why I don't think pulling her out of school is the best plan at the moment.  Is she in therapy for it? Therapy can supposedly be helpful (supposedly because I've never been in therapy for trich). If her current therapist isn't working, then find a different one. It might take a few tries before you find one that works.  My trich isn't all that bad (it fluctuates though - the more anxious I am, the worse it gets). Most of the time, I can get myself to only pull hairs that are invisible to other people (obviously, I don't do this in public, but then and again, I rarely if ever pull any hairs in public). Or, I sometimes am capable of just pulling on my hair (just feeling the hair), rather than pulling it out. That sometimes works (and sometimes doesn't). Luckily the worst that I've done is pull my eyebrows out (something I only do when I'm under a LOT of stress).
