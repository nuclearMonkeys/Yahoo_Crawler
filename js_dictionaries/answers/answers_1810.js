	96234 : ["Everything you said is true. I'm a fan of great athletes and could recognize greatness. Kobe Bryant is the best in the NBA as of today. People still call Kobe a ball hog and over rated?! The last time I checked the statistics, he was #18 in assists and #2 in high scores. The Lakers are the #1 sell out team in the NBA, for both Home and Away games. Kobe Bryants jersey is the #1 seller in the NBA today. However, I don't blame people for hating him. With his skills, he is someone you'd love to hate. For those who compares MJ to KB, there are no comparisons. MJ had Scottie Pippen which is also an ALL-STAR and descent players who have confidence and shooting capabilities. Don't forget, MJ didn't like to pass the ball very well either throughout his career. KB on the other hand has recognized reality and knows he needs to play more of a team player. Kobe has ODOM which is a OK/GOOD player and a bunch of OK players that are new to the team. Lakers this year has at least 40% of the team injured, so KB is forced to play more mins and shoot more because of his capabilities. With enough said, do your HW and look up whats in the book and learn people.", 9580, "nlGpm0jeaa", 0],

I just joined a belly dancing class, and if my friends did not come with me I most likely wouldn't have joined.. I don't like going shopping alone (unless it's grocery shopping, then I find it calming). When I think about the reasons why I do this, it always leads back to the fact that I have such a large family that when I was growing up I was never doing anything alone, and if I were to start doing something alone, someone would join.. Maybe that's the same way you are? It could always be a lack of confidence (which I also have). It's almost as if you can't be yourself unless you're with someone you know, even in the slightest? Maybe next time you are out and about, worrying how you're doing things alone and you feel awkward, take that step. Reach out, even in the slightest. Push yourself to be the first person to start a conversation with a stranger, or be the weird, outgoing one in a group of people who don't know each other. You just have to look at it like you're all probably thinking the same thing, which is; GOD this is weird. Why not be the one to break the ice?

	96255 : ["Warm ups are very important before you begin heading straight into the serious workouts or running sessions. Warm ups can consist of 10 minutes of light jogging or short strides, which will help your legs heat up and become accustomed with running a bit. Warm muscles improve performance, which is why many athletes use compression shorts, Skins and wear base layers, to help keep them warm. Short strides, make your legs used to faster running, so it can accelerate and maintain a faster pace with ease.  It is important that you include rest days during the week, preferably one complete day of rest or possibly a day where you cross train such as cycling, swimming, etc. This helps your muscles repair and your legs restore glycogen stores and gives your whole body a rest. If you fail to do this you might find yourself fatigued and your times slower, because you're overtraining.  Try not to increase your mileage by more than 10% each week. Your body needs to adjust to these changes and it won't be as effective if you're constantly increasing your distances by too much. Don't lose hope! That is the key. It is the illusion that we can go no faster that holds us back. Remember that!  You will get better if you keep working at it, but you have to keep working hard at it! Try doing different types of drills each week like speed drills and tempo runs.  Hope this helps! :) And good luck with future races and training!", 9579, "O4SMUmYKaa", 3],

It irrigates your sinuses and if you use it like every other day, you will never have a cold or sinus infection again.  I haven't gotten sick since I started using mine 2 yrs ago, not even the flu...nothing.  There's another product on the market called Simply Saline that works the same way but can get expensive.

They might have gained many extra championships however he used to be too egocentric. Also, up till this season, he had plenty of situation regarding different men and women and that's what men and women imply by way of making others higher. He did a far higher task this 12 months and that's why he acquired MVP. He has consistently been a wonderful participant however that aspect used to be lacking, till now. He is hated for the reason that of those matters and for the reason that of what occurred with that woman. If he didn't rape her (which I feel he didn't) then at quality he's a womanizer and cheats on his spouse. Not well traits while you wish to place anybody on a pedestal.
