	86213 : ["Because Biden clearly has different views than the average Democrat, plus many years of expertise. Joe Biden was the most well round person for the position, He thinks for himself, and doesn't have to be told what to say or do, if you missed the debates, he spoke of the middle east instability like he was talking about his own backyard, because he knows and lives it everyday. Unlike Palin, Biden was picked to actually contribute to the Vice-President's seat. Palin, on the other hand, was picked to steal votes!", 9217, "sUiUJWiSaa", 1],

And unless your buried in a cave, since Obama has been in office, we are starting to see more attacks or attempted attacks.  Can you say car bomber in NYC?

	86216 : ["God's Word is very clear on this subject.  Forbidding people to marry is demonic and comes through \"hypocritical liars\" (God's Word, not mine).  Here's the whole passage: 1 Timothy 4:1-5: The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.  Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.  They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.  For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,  because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer. Also, another tidbit of biblical information--did you know that, according to God's Word, every Christian is actually a priest? 1 Peter 2:9-10: But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.  Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.", 9216, "AA10769372", 0],
	86217 : ["Priest should be able to be married. Marriage is not forbidden in the Bible. I think that it may be an accountability issue. Priests are held to a high and holy standard, which they should be, but they are human and subjected to temptations just like the rest of us. I think that priest should be carefully monitored and scrutinizes as they hold such a position of power.", 9216, "None", 0],
	86218 : ["I think that's all McCain got going for him...a war hero. John McCain has been exploiting his prisoner of war experience every chance he gets. He has used this story to justify everything from not knowing how many homes he has to his healthcare plan.  McCain and his campaign seem to have gone to the POW well too often.  I think McCain love war. ~:>", 9219, "None", 0],
	86219 : ["His being a POW is a substantial promoting element in his campaign-- human beings love their warfare heros. It shows recognize and love for the US and that resonates actually to many. It places McCain on an benefit, somewhat. on the different hand, Obama, who has in no way served an afternoon in his existence, refuses to positioned on a flag pin on his in shape and refuses to do the flag salute-- something that human beings, not all, won't savor. so as to serve the country, you may educate you like it. for the duration of an election, you may in no way emphasize this way of narrative as McCains, if it gets you votes and win the hearts and minds of human beings. this is only how this is.", 9219, "fT3K02Nsaa", 0],
	86220 : ["I guess Obamabots do wish McCain would not remind people of his experience as a POW. Obama does suffer greatly by comparision with his lovable and charming associates like a domestic terrorist and a G** D*** America pastor. McCain has EARNED the right to share his story. Obama is very, very busy trying to keep his story from coming to full light. He is talking about the issues---you just aren't listening very well.", 9219, "AA10602557", -1],
	86221 : ["It's just an example of the dishonesty of politicians. There wasn't anything wrong in voting for the war. There was a lot of intelligence out and most people did vote for it. Obama just used it against Hillary because so many people thought the war was a huge mistake. He capitalized on their ignorance.", 9217, "70ce28ddca2fb9f359700f7e854fcb03aa", 2],
	86222 : ["The White House willfully deceived and withheld information from our our people, government and the world and chose war when war was 100% avoidable. The rewrite's of history will say otherwise and state that our legislative branches were given the same information that the white house had, which is patently false. That is one of the reasons the dems are hopping mad about how the repugs and smear radio is trying to blame them. Peace Jim .", 9217, "None", 0],
	86223 : ["We can play the blame game all day.  It's not going to get us anywhere.  We are over there now and the only thing we can do is to make the best of a horrible situation.  Besides, Iraq is not the only issue facing this country and maybe Biden represented those issues well to Obama.", 9217, "bb06GQ5Paa", -1],
	86224 : ["Barak Obama's electoral victory expresses the need both of the rulers and the ruled to overcome an unbearable situation, inherited from the Bush Administrations years: deterioration of living conditions, growing unemployment, a ballooning consumer, corporate, and public debt, gigantic deficits, recession and a financial catastrophe - together with an equally catastrophic impasse in the international “war on terror” in the Middle East and Central/ South Asia. The new Obama Administration is an instrument at the hands of US imperialism to manage its crisis; its policies inescapably at some point will clash violently with the great expectations risen in the masses of workers and oppressed minorities mobilized for its victory", 9217, "rc4B8Vdaaa", -1],

	86230 : ["Then what about all the Married people who \"rape boys\" how does your great idea fix this?? Priest are married -to the Church. And you know the devil spends time tempting priests just so you can doubt the Church. Play into that at your own risk", 9216, "AA10829565", 0],
	86231 : ["I think it is a MISTAKE to assume that if someone gets married they would quit molesting and raping. Molestation and Rape are crimes that are about control and are violent, it is not an act from lack of love or marriage. If someone who is a rapist or molester gets married, then the spouse gets to deal with the possibility they might do this to them as well, or not know their spouse is exhibiting this behavior elsewhere. In any event, marriage is not a solution to a raping and molestation problem.", 9216, "AA10627756", 0],
	86232 : ["Yes, they should.  If they don't want to get married they should be able to have girlfriends.  There is absolutely no reason that they shouldn't.

	86233 : ["America loves war remember? War is the only issue.  I wonder which country the republicans will declare war on next if elected.  Of course it hurts the republicans because their sons come home in a box. They just haven't worked that out yet.", 9219, "None", -1],

	86236 : ["Joe Biden only opens his mouth to change feet, and stumbles over historical facts in his own career. Obama knew that, and was also aware that nobody would notice very much of Joe Biden through most of the campaign. Joe the plumber is taken more seriously than Joe Biden.", 9217, "TAYErNRkaa", -1],
	86237 : ["He chose a numnutts. ..who doesn't threaten his DEEP insecurities that he is not enough. He chose a goofy guy who people laugh at mostly--so that no one watching how f-ked up obama is making of it. Biden and Obama Voted FOR THE IRAQ WAR.

	86242 : ["I think a lot of the opinion about Obama's effect on the economy stems from the fact that we are still technically in a downward spiral.  Because of the way Bush treated us and catered to our needs, I think we're expecting the same sort of immediate gratification from Obama.  The problem is that the bills and such that he's so far passed are going to take a bit longer to have any effect on the common man.  The media is using this as an instrument against him, even though we don't actually know yet if the bills have failed.  What you said about them trying to spin the events of the past 8 years as Obama's doing is entirely true.  It gets them far better rating to talk down on a popular political figure than to praise him as he probably deserves. In the end, public opinion will hinge on what we see the man do.  There's a lot riding on his presidency, particularly with him being the first African-American president.  Our economy depends on his decisions, and I think he'll make the right ones as time goes on. Good to hear that you're concerned about this.", 9215, "None", -3],

Bush didn't have 9/11 until he was President for 9 months and that might not have happened if Clinton had taken care of business when he was President instead of getting bj's in the Oval Office.

	86251 : ["Because many of the Obama-bot's don't understand politics at all, and they just dumb enough to believe anything that Obama says.  There is no way any 'true republican' is going to vote for Obama.  Obama is tied to the elite radical left wing extremists, like Bill Ayers, who only want to cause chaos in America because it will serve their socialist, world view agendas. Republicans will never support the extreme left agenda. (And thank GOD they don't) Obama is Pro-Choice, and supports partial birth abortions; republicans will never sign on to that. Obama is anti-gun, voted to support the firearm confiscation act, the global poverty act, which also allows for firearms to be confiscated under a UN type umbrella, the NRA gave Obama an 'F rating'... republicans are never going to sign on to that. Obama wants to jack up income taxes, and also capital gains taxes, even though that will actually decrease tax revenue. Obama doesn't even understand the economy... republicans are never going to sign on to that. (at least Clinton is up front about the specifics of what she intends to do; Obama thinks he's above having to provide any specifics)  Not only does Obama want to make more Americans dependent on welfare in this country, but he sponsored the global poverty act, which essentially donates .7% of the US GDP to other countries, so they can prosper off American Welfare too! This is hundreds of billions of US dollars just going bye-bye.  Since I'm on this subject, it's important to mention, many democrats aren't going to sign onto Obama either! Just wait and see; there will either be a mass exodus of the democratic party base, or an abrupt change in DNC leadership if the left wing tries to abandon the mainstream democratic values, and hijack the party. (Some say the party has already been hijacked)  Obama is screwed; if he wins the nomination, it will be the result of a conscious decision by a corrupted DNC to forfeit the presidency to John McCain, knowing full well that Obama can't win the general election.", 9217, "c2izTBXiaa", 2],
