	62521 : ["The Weak Anthropic Principle This states the obvious fact that because we are here, conditions must be right for our existence. Those aspects of Cosmic Order that appear tuned to allow for our specific kind of life provide no reason to go beyond this proposition. Perhaps if these were different, then another kind of life would arise: values of the fundamental constants incompatible with the formation of carbon based macro-molecules would only rule out our form of life, not all life in general.  The Strong Anthropic Principle This is the proposal that because the Cosmos is special, in that almost any alternative would not give rise to stable \"hot spots\" (stars) that are absolutely necessary to provide the flux of energy on which life can feed and in which its order can persist, it requires further explanation. The suggestion is that the universe was carefully engineered to produce life. As Dr Miller says:  While scientific sceptics deny the strong anthropic principle, many theologians and religious scientists embrace it, as it points to a Creator who stimulates life and enables us to flourish. The uncovering of such a fertile universe, which is so clearly conducive to beauty, encourages process theologians, as it appears that the universe follows a very thin line between rigid order and incoherent chaos. Other religious thinkers remain wary of the whole argument, and following the \"contrast\" viewpoint, are loathe to incorporate any scientific evidence, which may be later reinterpreted, in their vision of God. As the \"many universe\" theories are not completely outside the realms of falsifiable evidence, it is perhaps right to be patient before hailing the fine-tuning as proof of God. Nevertheless, I for one do not cease to be amazed by the transcendent beauty inherent within the laws of nature. These will always speak to me of the Nature of God.", 8166, "c83nc6ZGaa", 0],

I agree with you about Fool on the Hill.  Even though they wrote most of the songs together, you can usually tell which one of them came up with it first.  John's songs were traditionally a little more \"edgy\", and Paul's were usually a little more romantic, a little more dreamy. George wrote some pretty great songs too, especially on the White Album.  \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is one of my favorite Beatles songs. I also agree about Sgt. Pepper's.
