Just put them in a shallow bowl in the bottom of the snakes tank and he will go to town on them. He just dunks himself into the bowl w/the fish and strikes until he catches one. He will repeat this until he's full. He can eat about 5-6 per week. You should only feed him once a week. In fact...that's all he will eat. Just once a week. So, you are only spending about $4 a month on food for your snake.  You can also feed him Nightcrawlers. it will usually eat 2 or 3. Some garter snakes will even eat frozen/thawed pinkie or furried depending on the size of the snake. My snake has eaten all of these things. But he still prefers the fish.", 8512, "bDqUBiwUaa", -7],

It's up to you to research different vets to see who charges for what. Edit They call it a consultation fee, but it's the fee for coming in. Yes, most vets will charge you this Every time you come in. Again, they can charge you what they want, there is no regulation on this.

They study reptiles, birds, monkeys and every mammal in the world. Don't expect them to be capable of giving you advice on dog diets, unless they specialise  in dogs and their nutritional requirements.

It could also be due to dry air, or dust, just like people. In any case, I would try the saline drops first, with such mild symptoms. You can get it at the drug store without a prescription, and then just put a drop or two in each eye 3-4 times a day. Hold the bottom lid out from the eye and drop the drops in there. Things should look better in a week or so. If the eyes get goopy, or very swollen or much worse, you should use the antibiotic drops or ointment, from the vet or feed store. If you do take one animal to the vet, tell the vet that you have other animals with the same symptoms and hopefully you will get enough meds for them all.

	69411 : ["Garter snakes eat mostly earthworms, slugs, amphibians and fish in the wild so these would be your best bet. However individually, these items are lacking in certain nutrients, so you will need to keep the diet varied.  Rodents contain all the nutrients snakes need. However, lots of people have trouble getting garters to eat mice. if you really want to try, you can scent the mouse with a food item that he already takes and see if that works, but do not feed it live mice. A live mouse could kill a snake in self defense. And pinkies don't cost 10 bucks a piece. If you decide to go that route, here is an example site that sells what you need:   Otherwise it will do well on a varied diet of fish, etc. a couple times a week because they grow up fast. Making sure that you don't feed gold fish, they cause vitamin deficiencies. You also need to make sure the prey item is no bigger than the widest part of the snakes body.  The boy or girl thing? That involves probing with special equipment in special places. You might want to just use your imagination.  Garter snakes can go for over 10 years if well cared for. Depending on what kind of garter, you're looking at somewhere around 3 or 4 feet.  Finally, it's extremely important you have the right enclosure. Without the right temps and humidity it will die. i wont get into it here. But these sites will:   ...in some states you might need a permit or have a fishing license to keep a native reptile. But i wouldn't worry about that. You just worry about getting that snake what it needs, and do lots of research.", 8512, "None", 0],

	69413 : ["Consultation fees can vary quite a lot between different clinics, but they should all have a notice board in reception which clearly displays their prices.  At the very least, costs should be discussed and agreed beforehand - it's one of the RCVS code of conduct guidelines for vets. Most vets do charge a higher fee for the initial consultation and then a lower price for any follow-up visits.  My vet does this, but he also has an open clinic 9 - 10am every day when consultations are free and he only charges for any medication or treatment provided.  Perhaps it's worth calling around to see if any vets in your area run a similar scheme. I appreciate it's not nice feeling you might have been paying more than necessary, but the vet is entitled to charge you for his time.  Whether it be a 2 minute visit or 30 minute one, he's still setting aside time to see your pet instead of another one.", 8513, "IuYekkPVaa", 1],
	69414 : ["It's an office visit fee plus medication.  They book your appt. and it takes a slot of time out of their schedule and it takes up the doctor's time.  You use an examination room.  So yes, they can and most do charge for an office visit. The only way you might save some money is ask if the licensed vet tech (not the receptionist) can give the injections instead of the doctor. Look at it this way, if you go to see a lawyer and he has some forms to fill out for you, you are going to be charged for the forms and for the lawyer's time.  Professionals are in business to make a living just like the rest of us.  If you don't like what the office visit fee is then ask for the vet tech and call other vets to ask what their office visit fee is.

	69425 : ["As a garter snake breeder, I can tell you that the absolute best food for newborn & young garters is earthworms. you're on the right path, but you're not feeding enough. Each snake should be able to easily eat 2-3 or more worms /feeding & should be fed every 3-5 days. Try to feed them separately in an empty container so you can be sure just how much each snake eats. Your slow feeder might be a bit shy about eating in front of it's litter mates or might be stressed by the competition for food. Stick with the worms as they are a complete, balanced meal, easy to get & cheap. You can offer an occasional minnow/small fish, but an all fish diet will harm your snake due to a severe vitamin deficiency, contrary to what some posters say about feeding fish to garter snakes. These snakes do best if kept in separate containers, but you can keep same sex snakes together if they are similar in size, but single is best. As the snakes reach 2-3yrs of age, you can start offering mice of the appropriate size. All of mine make the switch to mice without any fuss, but some folks seem to have trouble here. It's best to stick with the earthworm, small frogs, salamander, tadpole, occasional fish diet when they're really young as these items are most easily recognized as food items and your snake will usually eat them more quickly.", 8512, "None", 0],
	69426 : ["Garter snakes sometimes accept mice, but most likely you will find it easier to feed the snake feeder fish. PetCo sells frozen mice for $1-2 I believe. You cannot physically tell whether it is a male or female, and the only sure way of telling is to get a breeder or experienced person to probe the snake. Because snakes grow at different speeds according to how much they feed, its pretty impossible to know the snake's age unless you buy it from a breeder who knows. I'm not sure about garter snakes, but snakes in general usually live somewhere between 15 and 20 years if they do not get sick. I've always fed mine feeder fish and they grow fat and healthy. Depending on the size, you probably want to feed 4-8 minnow sized fish a week. Also make sure that it's a garter snake and not a ribbon snake. Ribbons are thinner than garters and have smaller heads. They can be kept with same methods, but they basically never accept mice. good luck", 8512, "iZcHb6Knaa", 0],
	69427 : ["Garter snakes usually feed on feeder fish but you can feed it FROZEN THAWED mice. Don't risk live. Besides, live mice are WAY more expensive than frozen mice and you risk them killing your snake. Its much more humane to feed frozen mice. Also, there is no way one frozen pinky costs $10. No way. They usually only cost you no more than one dollar. So, I'm not too sure I believe you there. And its really cruel to the mouse.  I only feed frozen thawed mice because I value the lives of my snakes. I do not want them harmed or killed. And I don't want the poor mice suffering. \"The key thing to remember is never to use live mice. (This alone may make some keepers feel more comfortable with the idea.) It's safer and more humane to use frozen mice, which you can buy at many pet stores or directly, in bulk, from rodent breeders\" That can be found on this Garter Snake care site.

I was at the local police station lately getting a headlight ticket taken care of when a girl came in claiming she'd been raped. She was obviously emotionally distraught and disheveled. The police officer led her into an office and came back out to get a rape kit and I overheard him tell another male police officer that he didn't believe her and it was just another waste of a rape kit.  My ex was a cop. When he was in the police academy, his teacher did a detailed survey of those in the class about what they'd done sexually to their girlfriends and wives. Ie, have you ever grabbed your girlfriend when she clearly told you \"no\" and other similar situational questions.  90% of the class had raped their girlfriends, friends or wives.  That is why rape is still a problem. Men do not understand what constitutes rape, nor do they care.  Rape is any coerced sex act that your partner makes clear she does not want to engage in. It is not okay to rape your girlfriend. Just because she has dated you doesn't mean she wants to have sex with you. If men were typically smaller then women and we could physically coerce them at will, they would perhaps understand the issue. I'm going to go ahead and bring this home to guys.
