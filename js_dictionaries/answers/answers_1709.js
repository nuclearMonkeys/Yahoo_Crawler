If a guy interviews you, flirt with him and give him the \"f*ck me\" eyes and you'll get the job for sure.   I bounced for a few years at my friend's club and did the hiring if he was too busy or away for some reason and that's all we really considered when hiring, lol, sorry its true.  If you're not one to look at, and I'm talking down right ugly in every way possible, I doubt any popular place you'd actually make a living at would hire you.  But from what I can tell in your avatar, you probably have a shot at most places, just don't act like a prude.  Approachable, good looking women sell more booze than nuns or fatties, its a proven fact of life, and we couldn't give a f*ck less where you've worked before or about your \"life objectives and goals\".

They want to see **** and azz and think they might have a chance.  That's what they'll come back for; its sometimes why they'll choose one place over another; and its one way a place can compete with other clubs.  They think they might have a shot at a young hot bartender but, in reality, they don't or at least shouldn't because gettin' with multiple customers is a good way to get your azz fired, at most clubs that is; its bad for business.

If the carpet is just slightly damaged, like a small burn, use some manicuring scissors to snip away the damaged fibers. Make sure that you feather out the side areas as you work, so that spot is not as noticeable.   To patch the carpet, the key is to use a pattern. Choose something that will cover the damaged area, like a small plate or block of wood. Use a sharp utility knife to slowly cut around the plate, then remove the damaged area.   Use that pattern to cut a perfect patch from a scrap of carpeting. (If you don't have any extra scraps, try looking inside a closet or under a large piece of furniture that you don't plan on moving).   Secure the patch back to the floor with some double sided carpet tape. Cut it to fill the hole, peel off the backing and put it in place. (Make sure that if there is any pattern or texture to the carpet that you match it up). Press your patch firmly into place.  ------------------------------------ End of copy I understand you must first find a piece of carpet from other than a corner of the closet or from under the couch as you will be moving and want your deposit back.   If you are on good grounds with building management or the maintenance crew you may be able to get some carpet from them.  You may also be able to find a carpet repair company near you.   Before you do anything, check your contract and the laws where you live.  Some cities require the carpets to be replaced after an apartment has been occupied after a certain number of years and this may be considered normal wear and tear.

Buy doublesided carpet repair tape from the hardware store and place the unstained circle piece where the stained one was, making sure the fibers lay in the same direction as the rest of the floor.

	91142 : ["I don't think things like this are necessarily a waste of time but warrant a little more explanation than is provided before specific conclusions are drawn.  From the standpoint of statistical analysis and 4 being neutral the conclusions appear valid, but the preponderance of uncertainty expressed in number 4 demonstrates the importance of further research before actions are taken specifically to mitigate the release of CO2 without multiple benefits.  In other words and for example, alternative energy is one way of mitigating AGW, but has the multiple benefits of helping to minimize our reliance on foreign oil imports, the volatile and speculative pricing that has such drastic economic effects, crippling military costs and many of the other environmental costs of using fossil fuels. I certainly think that is the key point and conclusion that can be drawn from this study and that is the position the opposition view can take with the most validity.  Ultimately, I think the anti-science and political ideology that is driving the debate right now and is so much in evidence here in this category of Y/A is more of a detriment to the opposition to action on the issue of AGW than of any real benefit and is nothing more than more of the same delaying strategy that is being practiced in partisan politics in the U.S. that is doing so much harm in regard to other key issues.  Rather than fighting tooth and nail against R&D we should all be embracing it as a very high priority-Category 4 should tell us all that very clearly.  Try to find out more about what is driving climate change and how, as well as developing new technologies...there is, of course, a demographic as well as voter sentiment shift in the electorate that is rejecting the obstructionist methods currently being employed with regards to other issues and that may be drifting into the climate change debate as well. I do think that whether we act or not there are clear dangers we have to be aware of, from unintended consequences to costly and life-threatening weather exremes that our activities MAY be influencing and failing to address those potential consequences by political paralysis makes it imperative for us to discuss those dangers instead of denying that they exist, and that is clearly where the use of the word 'dangerous' comes from.  Reuters 'main cause' statement I can't account for other than journalistic license, but could be arguably justified from the media's point of view and at best any criticism would result in an impasse, like virtually all the arguments here.  One would think people would get tired of all the impasses and start working toward a workable compromise, but in this country at least the endless power struggle between the right and left doesn't seem anywhere near a point where that is abating. EDIT: Well, maybe I didn't explain my thoughts on the term 'dangerous' well enough.  What I meant to say was that making ill-advised decisions when so much is still up in the air (so to speak) could be extremely dangerous, at least in terms of economics and geopolitics.  So either way there is a potential danger by failing to address the issue-the impasse is increasing that risk.  Whether Obama intended that nuance is his comment is open to debate but I will take the liberty of interpreting it that way since his comments are often very nuanced and that is all too rarely appreciated. I'd party with Dook, but then I'm a scotch man and have been known to spike the punch once or twice myself, although not with any of my own bodily fluids.  I dunno, give me a scotch or two and I'll talk to whomever will listen about constitutional law.  That may be why I don't get invited to many parties nowadays.  Or maybe it is the dancing naked thing.

For instance, members of congress are sometimes individually called \"the honorable congresswoman from ... \" or a similar use of honorable. I would think that Al Gore probably qualifies for a title like \"your honor.\" After all, assuming if you are meeting with Al Gore, and assuming you are not on a first name basis - you probably already have significant respect for him if you want to know the proper address.

The resume should list the bartending school where you obtained certification. You should also list any other experience you may have, especially any jobs working in the restaurant business, such as a waiter, server, host, etc. Since you have no experience \"working behind the bar\", you will likely have to start out as a bar back or working at non-peak hours such as day shifts.  Personally, I'd advise seeking out a restaurant with a full bar that is looking for a day time bartender.  Working lunch shifts at a restaurant are a great way to gain valuable bartending experience.  Most people don't drink during the day so it will be a low pressure environment and you will focus on getting comfortable in the well, getting fast with the gun and working the cash register.

So according to some on this site, you sit in a classroom and listen to years of communist/climate propaganda, then answer the questions  in a way to please your communist leaning professor then you can be a 'climate scientist' and are authorized to take part in polls as a 'climate scientist'. Would anyone here play a game with a stacked deck like that?  Consensus is not science. Anyone who tries to prove something by consensus is clutching at straws and is pure nuts.
