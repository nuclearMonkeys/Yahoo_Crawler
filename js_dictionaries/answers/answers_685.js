	38071 : ["It would be helpful to know what amp you have and what it s running.  Car info would be good too. Could be a few things, and not necessarily an inadequate alternator/battery. Any flaw in the wiring delivering current to the amp can cause a voltage drop and trigger the amp s protection. The most common problems are bad connections: battery terminal, in/out of fuse, into amp, any wire terminal along the way, poor ground location, poor preparation of the ground location, insufficient wire size. There s also the possibility that the amp s just being pushed beyond its limits -- typically due to improper wiring and resulting impedance being too low. You should eliminate all the other possibilities before you replace your battery or upgrade your alternator which may not be needed. If your battery is so bad it can t power your amplifier it s not likely it would have enough current to start your car on a cold day.  Same goes for the alt -- if it can t provide enough power for your amp it probably wouldn t be sustaining your battery either.", 5641, "QpsR2jOsaa", 0],
