	59534 : ["tell me.. u don't know anything bout religion.. rite ?? ram, krishn... were the incarnation of the almighty \"Vishnu\"...  in hindi incarnation means - Avtar. and tht means -  God took birth on earth as a human being to fight rising evil. in hindu mythology, there are 3 Gods who runs this universe -  Brahma (The creator - responsible for everything existing in universe) Vishnu (The Protector - responsible for the proper existance of  everything in any form in universe) Shiva (the Distroyer - responsible for distroying everything after they had their time. - as everything tht starts have a end.) so from time to time The Protector - bhagwaan Vishnu takes incarnation to save life as evil tries to finish them before their actual time. those who die (shri Ram, Krishan) are actually the human form of almighty Lord Vishnu.", 8046, "65494c81d3eab7257d8464453b22065aaa", 1],
	59535 : ["They're all good, It's the messengers that are sometimes bad. The texts for all of them were written by people, and have some human flaws in them as well. For example the bible thumpers beat people over the head with the King James Version of the Christian Bible, which was rewritten so King James so he could divorce his Queen without the permission of the Catholic Church.

	59548 : ["Once we find a better way we will be shipping off of Earth and Exploring the Universe.  It always gets better when we work together. Religiously means: doing something the same way over and over.  Some times someone finds a better way.  Which becomes the new repeated religiously function. Religion hasn't faded or gone secular anymore then it was back in the days people agreed that it was a great leaders book called the bible, who they read from and about.    A godly person, omnipotent and omnipresent wise one, or a Saint, or even a God is a form of recognition for good works.  When you speak of a Great Great Grand Parent who left a goodly amount of worldly knowledge to know; that is praise. One religion calls studying praying, another calls it cogitation; while yes, another calls it reading. I got an education and found out that religion is another scholars work at describing their better way of doing things.  Absolutely every book has good advice if you can understand it, and only bad if you can't, or  bad if you don't agree with their method of delivery. Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, Jesus Christ all were teachers in their times, and if you 'could not understand' one of their meanings of meaningful wisdom, one of the others would usually suit your language style and life style. Now-a-days we have thousands of more books with teaching instructions. Lessons on how someone, more recently, lived and how they agree with one author in the bible. The same as the same person might find interest in another authors modern version of it. Like the King James version, or the Latter Day Saints version, or the women Masonic temples version, or a local writer's words from a book they wrote which was this years book. What I am saying is that, someone who found various parts of several books and agreed with others of the greats great works of the past collective made another book.    We just keep doing the best we can to hand down what our experiences are to the youth who find they are interested in learning that method, yours or mine, or someone else's. Like I wrote at the beginning, \"Once we find a better way we will be shipping off of Earth and Exploring the Universe.  It always gets better when we work together, nice, though.\" Did you notice the change?", 8045, "a45f5e1aa80b644906385fe5813cdc98aa", 0],
	59549 : ["Religion has started no more wars than greed, power, fear, racial bias and intolerance, and atheism. All have contributed. Religion is really the basis of morality. Without it the only reason for moral standards would be the protection of society as a whole, but  based on a viewpoint of there being no God to accept any certain moral viewpoint of right and wrong personally.

	59569 : ["Well, because we appear to be in moral decline, I would argue that we need it more than ever. Without religion, where do we get our morals from, our sense of right and wrong. If we try to invent it for ourselves, like Philosophers believe that they can, how do we know whether it is right or wrong. I think that it is precisely because we try to live our lives without religious guidance, that we are suffering moral decay. The Government, TV media and teaching professions are under the control of left wingers, and it is well known that they don't believe in God or religion, so, that probably explains some of the things that are occurring in society because of the lack of a moral template.", 8045, "AA12216800", 3],
