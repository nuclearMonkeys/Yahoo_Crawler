	71975 : ["We have a lot of politically ignorant people here in the US.  On average, we are not as 'politically aware' as some other developed countries.  Historically the Republicans have exploited this problem by promising things they know are impossible and by fomenting anger and insurgency and selfishness and mean-spiritedness and intolerance--bringing out the very worst in Americans.  Donald Trump is a product of this campaign, which has been going on for decades. But though Trump is the most popular of Republican candidates, his following is not really that large.  He has 30% of Republicans, which themselves are 25-30% of Americans.  So we're really talking about maybe 10-12% of the population.  And those are the same 10% who have always been backwards.  They're the ones who believe Civil Rights is a communist plot to allow Blacks or Mexicans to take over, or that 9/11 was an inside job, or that we never went to the moon and the moon-walk sequences were filmed in a studio.   They're the ones who truly believe Obama was born in Kenya and is a Muslim.  Many more SAY they believe these things, because they've been taught that if you disagree with a person it's okay to make up malicious lies about him and repeat them over and over.  But I think a certain small percentage of them really don't know any better! In the last few elections the leaders of the Republican Party have chosen their nominee long before the primary election season even began.  We went into the primary season knowing who would eventually emerge victorious.  This has led a lot of Republican voters to be angry with their leadership, it's caused an 'insurgency' against the party establishment and 'establishment' candidates, like we get every time from them.  This has led to the rise of anti-establishment candidates, people with success in other areas but no govt. experience, and this is the main reason for Trump's ascendancy.  But I think the anger of the insurgency blinds them to what's really going on--that they are forcing a candidate on the party who has no chance of winning because he'd hated by 3x more people than those who love him.", 8652, "55XWsWHsaa", 9],
