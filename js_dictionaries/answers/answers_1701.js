	90717 : ["Sorry.  I just had a flash-back to when my fella told me about his ex wife, years ago, who he believed he shared a child with, only to find out 4 years later, that the child was not his (was actually a horrible, and traumatic event for him, and I think he's still effected to some degree, as he felt he'd lost a child).  But, he was a very young man at the time (18 through early 20's)...working 2 jobs to support the family he thought was his, only to find his world completely shattered.  They didn't have much, but he had purchased rose bushes for her, and planted them outside their home some time before this, and tended to them, watering them, pruning them, nurturing them.  Once he learned this was not his child (this came after a series of events--one that anyone hearing of them, would know just how bad, and how hurtful this ordeal was), he went out and poured many pounds of salt (that he purchased) all over the rose bushes.  Then, he left.   That gal had no earthly idea what she screwed herself out of.  A good man, willing to go to the end of the earth with her, and the child he believed they shared.  He would have been fine even, knowing this wasn't his baby, had he not have to find out on his own (first, after hearing her \"essentially\" brag in phone conversations about how she'd screwed him over, before looking into things himself, while she continued to lie to him).   I guess, that the issue with this being about a planting of something...a good deed that you did for this woman out of respect and appreciation for her, reminded me of this ordeal.  I would go back, if I were you, and fill in that hole.  But I would do it as a symbol of what has been lost here, and make an effort for yourself to move on from it.  She doesn't have appreciation for you, she doesn't recognize what you've done in appreciation of her, and I suspect this isn't the first time.  So \"fill in the hole\"...and use it as a symbolic gesture in yourself, to the end of this relationship.  Move on, and find someone who loves and appreciates you.   There are many good women left out there who would love a man who wants to help her with her flower garden.   Best wishes.", 9373, "pbEbILMlaa", 0],

	90720 : ["Watering your lawn helps.  Also, rotate where the dog can potty.   We have 5 dogs, and a relatively small lot.  We don't have brownspots because I make sure to \"rinse\" the lawn a couple times a week.   The grass loves it!", 9371, "None", 0],
	90721 : ["Basically your dog is fertilizing your grass to death, due to nitrogen in the urine. If too much nitrogen is applied to a lawn it causes it to burn, just as if you were to over fertilize it. That is why the grass around the edges is very long and darker than the yellow spot. Large breed as well as unaltered female dogs tend to cause more of this. Milano is a fixed female and she hasn't left any brown spots in 8+ years.", 9371, "8VJxfHqRaa", 0],

	90730 : ["Your girlfriend probably felt really guilty because she realized the tight situation her ex was bailed out of affected her just as much as it affected her ex.  Her ex also probably either told or insinuated that your girlfriend knew about the loan while she was married to this guy.  I can understand why she did what she did, simply because the loan was probably to save their home.  That benefited her as much as it did her ex. The only advice I would give to your girlfriend would be to do everything she can to get her name off the mortgage and deed if that isn't already done.  If her ex defaults it will come back to bite her in the a@@ if her name is attached to it in any way.", 9372, "nUHkUdqQaa", 0],

	90736 : ["The answer to that would be no.  Vitamin C will not change the pH of a dog's urine.  And if that were the case... dogs can make their own Vit. C, so why wouldn't they do it on their own to keep from getting \"beard stains?\" No.  Hope that helps.", 9371, "iHwRxpGVaa", 0],
	90737 : ["No - the brown stain is usually from too much nitrogen (the urea in urine) encouraging your dog to drink a lot of water will help. Turning the garden hose on the pee spot when the dog is done will help. Not supplying more N in the form of fertilizer will help...", 9371, "bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa", 0],

He did save her butt too, and it's not his fault his brother is a douche-bag. My sister was with her ex-boyfriend for like 8 years and when they broke up I gave him my TV for his new place because he pretty much had nothing.

	90757 : ["No one here can determine if she needs or doesn't need life insuarance.  She should definately meet with a local professional to help determine her needs and look at her options. I highly reccomend an \"independent agent\" that represents multiple insurance carriers and is open to discussing term, or permanent life insurance and doesn't have a strong bias towards one or the other.   First for some background info and help in determining the amount of coverage that is appropriate you can go to www.lifehappens.org, which is the \"Life Foundation's\" website that has plenty of non-biased information and a calculator to help determine the appropriate amount of coverage. To select a professional to work with I would online to NAIFA or FPA's website to search for a local independent professional. Please don't have her do this all online.

It's much easier to pick up waste on bark dust.  Just replace the bark dust when you begin to see the soil underneath and that's it.  It's cheap and effective and your lawn will be nice and green.
