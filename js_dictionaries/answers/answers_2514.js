Give him a more involving role and he'll do so much better for Smackdown. HHH: True, Although his mic skills are one of the best at the moment, he is WAY too overrrated.

	131535 : ["Some people have to learn things the hard way for them to wake up to reality and to finally see what's good and what's bad in the long run. Some people have to mature the hard way. The \"hard way\" is by overlooking red flags, making huge mistakes, and then regretting then later on, but hopefully learning from them. Now, the \"stupid way\" would be making the same mistakes again, even though you were already hard hit by those before. Even though your situation sounds bad, be aware that if you don't learn now, this could be the same but (even worse) with a kid in the middle of this mess!! now that mistake would surely ruin your life because there is no way to leave it in the past. Now, I don't know what to tell you. You obviously need to mature some more. What more proof do you want than the fact he ignored you after having sex with you?? What else do you need to know to realize that, without a doubt, this guy is crap and definitely not relationship material?? If you need more proof or if you stay obsessed with him, then I predict you will be someone that will end up learning things in what I call \"the stupid way.\" Your solution is getting smarter, more mature, and as far as love, realizing what is it that truly matters for you about a guy, about someone who has true relationship potential, someone who can be your husband in the future...... if it is just good looks, you might end up making more mistakes..... Other than this, the true best way to get over this and to truly regret it is to find someone else who likes you for you and who is different. There are people like that, but if you stay the way you are now (obsessing over the crap) you will overlook everybody else, be unavailable, and it simply won't happen. Be smart though, don't fall for someone who is way too similar to the other guy, don't repeat mistakes, fall for someone who is clearly responsible and has relationship potential. And definitely, have zero friendship with the guy that played with you, if you do talk to him as if nothing happened then you are proving to him that you are (let's see how to put this so that it doesn't sound bad) a dumb girl that he can play with if he wishes!!!

Maybe the legal side makes more of a difference than I realize, but what you have described to me sounds like a case of uneducated people fearing the unknown and passing that fear on to their children and grandchildren. It's sad. Honestly - I don't see why this whole gay/lesbian thing has to be such a big deal. People are attracted to who they are attracted to. People fall in love with those who have lifestyles that are compatible with their own. And I think that a happy, loving couple can do a much better job of raising kids than one who has been forced to choose between having a \"normal\" family or being with the one they love.  I do think that it would be nice for their to be words to differentiate traditional marriage from gay marriage and a word to cover marriages in general. This would be to make people happier from a religious point of view.

That being said, last night, one just happened to pick up the phone and  got treated to  a pre-recorded message concerning this issue, announcing it was from the Gay and Lesbian alliance in San Francisco. Extremely disgruntled, I am. Today, I will have to figure out how to explain this new concept,( politically-correct, of course,) to my child who answered the phone.  This, in my eyes, is something akin to the graphic anti-abortion trucks that park alongside busy streets FORCING our children to see issues that it should be their parents call when and how to expose them to. The phone call last night was proof positive to me that by MAKING THIS SUCH AN ISSUE, MY CHILDREN WILL BE EXPOSED TO IT,  by the very people that this prop claims to protect. The rights of either group are threatened by a vote cast either way. No, and homosexuals are \"protected\". Yes, and heterosexuals are \"protected\". See what I am saying here? Just depends on which \"group\" applies to the voter more. Simple props will not make discrimination go away. Tolerance is unfortunately taught in the home, or not taught, as the case may be. Yes, I am concerned about how Prop 8 will affect my children, to answer your question.

The laws of California already extended all rights of marriage to that of civil union. The argument against Prop 8 is that by calling one thing, which is very similar to but not exactly the same as another, by a different name, is hateful, discriminatory, etc, etc. Peoples actions determines the level of discrimination. I think that the idea of civil union is younger than that of marriage, and that those who find their relationships falling into this category are envious of the ultimate respect given to marriage, by virtue of the understood definition of the word. A respect and definition which has been earned over years of successes and catastrophic failures both. So wanting to take a shortcut to all of the reputation and respect that a marriage, for better or for worse has earned over countless thousands of years, those in civil unions, rather than living out their lives showing that there is no real difference use a judiciary to force the redefinition of a word, whose use and meaning far predates any court on the planet and whose redefinition in this manner was probably not intended by the California Constitution framers, in an attempt to force respect rather than earn it through lives of devoted love. While I support the rights and legal protections offered by marriage being extended to the civil union, I am not ready to re-define marriage to include civil union... yet. If the campaign brought out some of the worst intolerance in humanity it is tragic, but I would rather the government get out of the business of regulating marriage, then redefining it without regard for how people think of it. Besides if you are looking to the state to validate your relationship your looking in the wrong place. Relying on the State to create a lasting union through contracts and courts is like trying to build a bridge with paper.
