	118053 : ["I love mouse questions!!! Mice are super awsome and beat hamsters by far. I have had both and mice are AWSOME and waaaaay more fun than hamsters. If you can, get a female. Both genders are awsome pets, but males tend to scent mark and it can stink if you don't get good bedding. Don't use carefresh or wood shavings. Soft sorbent, corn cob, wood pellets, or newspaper pellets are best. Make sure you give your mouse a wheel, hideout house (wood or dried grass nest is best), and chew toys. I have never spent money on toys, I just give him toilet paper rolls and crumpled pieces of white printer paper. A food dish and water bottle are important (duh). Make sure you feed LAB BLOCKS. They seed/nut mix things are HORRIBLE for your mouse. I am guilty of feeding this to my mouse, but he is really weird and doesn't like lab blocks and actually eats all the parts, so he is alright. Most mice will pick out one thing like sun flower seeds and corn and only eat those. They will then get really fat and malnourished and can die. So stick to lab blocks. They also provide fun chewing activity for your mouse. Some fun things to give your pet is a hamster ball so they can run around your house without escaping. I like to feed my mouse treats. Some good treats are dried banana, small amounts of nuts (like half a peanut), crackers (saltines are my mouse's favorite), dried papaya. small pieces of carrot, apple, VERY small amounts of lettuce, once mine even ate half a frozen pizza roll thing (my sister gave it to him, but he loved it). Just don't give it chocolate, junk food, spinach, or onions. Mice are super easy to train if you get it young. I got my mice from petsmart and they were super friendly right off the bat. You just have to get it out every day for like 10 mins at first. You can make it longer after your mouse is fully trained. My mice have never totally been trianed to come out when I want to get them out, so some chasing is usually in order, but thats ok. My mice have never even tried to bite me, but they always try to take a chunk out of my sister (you can't blame them, she isn't nice to animals. All my pets hate her, its hilarious:) Good luck with your new pet and remember what I said. Buy a good book on mice or even critter USA the magazine as they have good articles on mice. Its always good to have some info easily accessible in case of an emergency.", 10523, "Czh1fbQgaa", 2],

Our budget, our country is out of control we have got to cut spending. It is sad that this right now appears to be nothing more than posturing for the next election for our elected officials, but I have great hope that it will open the American peoples eyes to the problems this country is facing.  This country will have debt at 105% of GDP if we dont start cutting. What happens with this shutdown could determine if the world goes into a depression or not. PS the 105% of GDP does not even take into account the unfunded liabilities in SS, medicad or government pension plans.  Make no doubt we are standing on the precipice right now, I just hope they can do what needs be done. (For the non-econ people that means we could take everything we have in this country and it still would not pay the debt) Truth is if the government does not make some serious progress the bondholders are going to start backing out, and the Federal Reserve cant just keep buying bonds with printed money forever.
