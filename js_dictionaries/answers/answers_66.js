The full name of our country is \"The United States of America\" and for short it's \"America\".  Just like Mexico is \"Estados Unidos Mexicanos\" and the short name is \"Mexico\".  A true American calls this country America.  Perhaps you are confused because you have foreign family members who don't understand. I find that to be true with my family members who are Spanish speaking because they don't refer to our country as \"America\" in Spanish.  But I always tell them that we speak English here and \"Estados Unidos\" in English is \"America\". Even if there were a single continent called \"America\" that doesn't matter.  \"America\" can refer to both a continent and a country just like \"Australia.\" And the last reason is that \"America\" is what most Americans call the United States.  We are Americans, our ethnicity is American, our food is American, etc etc.  So regardless of what others think, if people call the United States \"America\" then it's America.  And we are Americans.  There is no such word as \"United Statesian\" as there is in Spanish \"Estadounidense\". If you are in the UK and you say you're from America, they will know exactly what you mean.  They will not think you are from Mexico, Brazil or Canada.  Now, if you go to a non-English speaking country they might say United States in their language (Estados Unidos, Etats Unis) but they will still call you an American, Americano, Americain.", 543, "2SxbGzUnaa", 1],
