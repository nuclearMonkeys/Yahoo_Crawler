Deprived of Food, medical care, sanitation and other resources Fenched up with barbwire like dogs similar to the conditions Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto were placed in 1943 by the Polish occupiers. The Hamas reacted by the firing rockets (the only right they have) looking for a way out. Israel were looking for the fight back from Hamas so that Israel are made out to be the victims.

	133343 : ["Not shocked at all. Dear Member of the Roman Catholic Church, The Roman Catholic Church says it never changes; yet, it invents new doctrines which are contrary to the Bible, and has practiced rites and ceremonies taken bodily from paganism. Some scholar has found that 75% of the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Church are of pagan origin. The Sign of the Cross, the use of wax candles, incense and holy water, praying to angels and deceased saints, the false doctrine of purgatory (established by Pope Gregory I in the 6th century) and praying for the dead are all rooted in paganism and were adopted into the R.C. Church centuries after the death of Christ.  The Lord Jesus Christ clearly tells us that souls who have passed on go either to eternal paradise or to eternal torment (Matthew 25:46), so praying for the dead does not help them. The Papacy is of pagan origin and the title of “pope” which means “father” is given to the bishop of Rome who is the leader of the worldwide R.C. Church. In Matthew 23:9, the Lord Jesus Christ warns that giving the title of “father” to human spiritual teachers is a sin because we are to look only to our Heavenly Father for ultimate truth and power.  Jesus did not appoint Peter to the headship of the apostles and forbade any such notion. (Read Luke 22:24-26; Ephesians 1:22-23; Colossians 1:18; 1st Corinthians 3:11). There is no mention in Scripture or history that Peter ever was in Rome, much less that he was pope there for 25 years; Clement, 3rd bishop of Rome, remarks that \"there is no real 1st century evidence that Peter ever was in Rome.\" The kissing of the Pope's feet was adopted in the 8th century. It had been a pagan custom to kiss the feet of emperors. The Word of God forbids such practices. (Read Acts 10:25-26; Revelation 19:10; 22:9). Canonization of dead saints was first established by Pope John XV in 993. Every believer and follower of Christ is called saint in the Bible. (Read Romans 1:7; 1st Colossians 1:2). In the 11th century, Pope Hildebrand, Boniface VII was the first pope in centuries to rigorously enforce the Roman Church's ancient policy of celibacy of the priesthood. Jesus imposed no such rule, nor did any of the apostles. On the contrary, St. Peter was a married man, and St. Paul says that bishops were to have wife and children. (Read 1st Timothy 3:2, 5, and 12; Matthew 8:14-15). In the 13th century, the adoration of the wafer (Host) was decreed by Pope Honorius. So the Roman Church worships a God made by human hands. This is plain idolatry and absolutely contrary to the spirit of the Gospel. (Read John 4:24). A few years later, the Bible was forbidden to laymen and placed in the Index of forbidden books by the Council of Valencia. Jesus commanded that the Scriptures should be read by all. (Read John 5:39; 1st Timothy 3:15-17). In the 15th century the Roman Catholic Church forbade also the cup to the laity. The Bible commands us to celebrate the Lord's Supper with unleavened bread and the fruit of the vine. (Read Matthew 26:27; 1st Corinthians 11:26-29).  The Creed of Pope Pius IV was imposed as the official creed 1560 years after Christ and the apostles. True Christians retain the Holy Scriptures as their creed – which is 1500 years older than the creed of Roman Catholics. (Read Galatians 1:8). In the year 1870 after Christ, Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of PAPAL INFALLIBILITY. This is a blasphemy and the sign of the apostasy and of the antichrist predicted by St. Paul. (Read 2nd Thessalonians 2:2-12; Revelation 17:1-9; 13:5-8, 18). Many Bible scholars see the number of the beast (Rev. 13:18), 666 in the Roman letters of the Pope's title: \"VICARIVS FILII DEI.\" In the 19th century, the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary was proclaimed by Pope Pius IX. The Bible states that all men, with the sole exception of Christ, are sinners. Mary herself had need of a Savior. (Read Romans 3:23; 5:12; Psalm 51:5; Luke 1:30, 46, 47). In the year 1950 Pope Pius XII proclaimed the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Titles used for Isis (the pagan deity of darkness, witchcraft and chaos) by her devotees such as “Mother of God”, “Queen of Heaven” and “Ocean Star” were given to Mary, and Isis and Horus temples were converted to Mary and Jesus temples.  “The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?” (Jeremiah 7:18-19).  The Rosary was introduced by Peter the Hermit, in the year 1090. This has been copied from Hindus and Mohammedans. The counting of prayers is a pagan practice and is expressly condemned by Christ (Matthew 6:5-13). The entity who appeared to the visionaries in Medjugorje who claimed to be a protector and mediator between persons and God, and who requested Feast Days to be held in her honour and the daily chanting of the Rosary could never be Mary the humble and blessed servant of God who birthed our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;” (1Timothy 2:5). While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. (Matthew 12:46-50).  In the above verses we see that although Mary wanted to see Jesus, He didn't go to her right away but continued preaching. It is plain to see that the Lord Jesus Christ does the will of God and not the will of Mary. Also, God points out that He has several brothers, sisters and mothers – and these are blessed people who do God's will. So, are you part of God's family or are you incurring God's wrath through sinful beliefs and practices?  HERESIES are those doctrines and practices which are contrary to the Bible. They are also called \"human traditions\" or \"doctrines of men\". Both Peter and Paul predicted and warned that in the later times \"false teachers\" would rise within the Church and bring in \"damnable heresies\" and \"doctrines of devils\". (Read 2nd Peter 2:1-3, and 1st Timothy 3:2-5). Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, for they transgressed the commandments of God by keeping their traditions. “in vain,” He said, \"they worship me by keeping for doctrines the commandments of men.\" (Matthew 15:9). BRETHREN! The Word of God commands us to get out of Babylon, saying: \"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" (Revelation 18:4). All true Christians will remain faithful to the religion of Christ as taught in the Bible, and heed the warning of the Apostle Paul, who said: \"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\" (Galatians 1:8).

Here is another example Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, \"Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?\" Abu Sufyan replied, \"I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).\"  Heraclius said, \"Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.\" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was:  'What is his family status amongst you?'  I replied, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.'  Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'  I replied, 'No.'  He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'  I replied, 'No.'  Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'  I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'  He said, 'Are his followers increasing or decreasing?'  I replied, 'They are increasing.'  He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'  I replied, 'No.'  Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?'  I replied, 'No. '  Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'  I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that.  Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'  I replied, 'Yes.'  Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'  I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'  Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'  I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'  Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, \"I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.\"  \"I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do.

They are carrying Islam only for their showbiz purpose instead they should convey the inner beauty of Islam to the world. Now a days we are playing with fire instead of taking light from it to see our way to peaceful, happy, merciful and prosperous life.", 11177, "kPiY5l5zaa", 1],

What about the  British people, many of whom, were just on their way to work i guess,who got caught up in the 7/11 bombings in London. Also, all the Americans who lost their lives in 9/11.
