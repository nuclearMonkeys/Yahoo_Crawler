	81707 : ["There really *aren't* solid rules for creative writing. A few people have said that the only writing rules they firmly adhere to are grammar rules... but stream of consciousness, which is extremely effective, completely breaks grammar rules. Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf is a fantastic example of this. Where is the grammar in 99% of Mrs. Dalloway? I don't know! But it's a wonderful novel! Like crazy good! And then of course, poor grammar can be effective when the story is in the perspective of a character who doesn't have good grammar. The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros is an example. The other \"rules\" are mainly things that work more or less effectively. \"Show don't tell\" is something I've struggled with as a writer. I've always had a tendency to tell instead of show, so I've tried to make it my Rule for writing. But a lot of fiction does exactly the opposite. Thistles in Sweden by William Maxwell, anyone? Catalogue of the Exhibition by Steven Millhauser? Both of these pieces are genius and wonderful and both do a lot of telling rather than showing. But it works. There really aren't set rules. There are general rules that can be broken when the breaking will be effective and necessary to the storytelling. Stream of consciousness (and therefore breaking grammar) in Mrs. Dalloway works because you move in and out of several minds in the story. The telling works in Thistles in Sweden and Catalogue of the Exhibition because of the types of pieces they are- they showcase physical objects and relate the adjoining stories of the protagonists along with the showcasing. Breaking formal writing rules is absolutely fine for creative writing when it will be effective in conveying the story. Otherwise, its arbitrariness will end up taking away from the writing.", 9082, "245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa", 2],
	81708 : ["The one thing I do not like is when a character acts...out of character. I mean, yes, characters should surprise you and won't necessarily act in a cookie-cutter way all the way through. But when a character just does something that is totally unlike them and it doesn't fit, then it's just stupid to me and throws me out of the setting that I was enthralled in. I mean, it's cool when a character you thought you knew does something unexpected, but still the steps that lead to what they did should make sense.  For example, in my story, there's this mean girl. she's popular, beautiful, cunning, and uses snippy little comments against her competition (she's a snowboarder). However, the guy that she likes, when he says something to her, her defenses kind of fall. she turns into a pouty little fragile thing. but that would make sense; she loves him.  So what i'm talking about is when it doesn't make sense and a character does something very weird that just doesn't work. So yeah. I also don't like dull characters. Mary-Sue is a good word for it as a lot of others have said. But truly, those characters that hardly react to things and just have this and that happen to them with just the typical expected reactions are stupid. At least in twilight, Bella didn't always act in the same ways. she had anger, she punched a werewolf in the face. She did something when things faced her. Oh! Another thing I've seen twilight do that is a \"rule\" we're taught against (not to bash twilight for I was once obsessed) is that you're told not to say things like \"he looked mad\". but twilight does that. I remember a particular line where edward is described by \"he looked almost mad\". it's an awkward phrasing, but somehow Meyer made it work for her. so yeah. to each her own. i think though, it depends on the frequency of certain techniques used whether it will work or not work in a given story. also the personal twist one puts on it will affect it. like that beginning you shared; it wasn't typical. person wakes up, someone he expects to be there is gone. and then they speak of things you wouldn't know of unless you read on. Now some books start off with the awakening. they hit the alarm. sunlight streams in. it's all very typical. if one can read that first paragraph and it has its unique aspects that make it distinctive from any other waking-up beginning; it can be magic.  so really; all rules can be broken. it's the twist you apply on them that will dissolve the outlines of \"rule\", ultimately. in my opinion! :D", 9082, "b708cc10450052f2c947f645e3794683aa", 1],

The songs you are learning now are chosen to teach particular aspects of playing.  When I took guitar lessons I had to play \"boring\" songs too because I needed to learn notes on a particular string, or learn how to play chords on different fret positions.  Did your \"fun\" teacher ever teach you to read music? Guitar music isn't just chord charts you know.   In between lessons, as a break from regular practice, play something on the piano just for fun.  There are musician \"fake books\" where a simplified melody is played with the right hand, while the left plays the basic chords, with a lot of improvisation or \"faking\" by the pianist depending on how \"inspired\" they get.   Then go back to the other stuff. I'm more of a singer, but my high school choir teacher taught us basic music theory which I would learn for the tests then promptly forget.  Later on, I actually had to pay someone to teach me what I had ignored but discovered I needed to know in order to learn some very difficult music and to keep up with better trained musicians in the groups I was singing in. If you learn that \"boring stuff\" you will also pick up enough basics to be able to write down your own music if you ever decide to give THAT a try. Hang in there.

I've had patients who have needed life saving procedures and have refused it and there was nothing the doctor could do about it. You may be asked for a c-section if the labor is not progressing or if there is some risk to the baby by not having one, but it will be your choice. I would suggest having a support person there who knows your wishes and who can be an advocate for you if you are unable to do it yourself (due to pain, etc). Speak with your primary (main) doctor about your concerns about him/her not being there. You may also be able to meet the other doctors on staff and that may help ease your concerns. If you trust your primary doctor, speak with him/her about it, then trust that they will not put you or your baby at risk by allowing an unqualified doctor to deliver. Speaking about your other concerns with your doctor may help as well. He/she may be able to explain exactly what would be an indication for a c-section, IV, etc. As for the panic attack before heading to the hosptial.

When I was 10, I was out riding scooters and bikes with friends, playing with makeup, and I did have a computer and internet but it was strictly monitored.", 9083, "SgnTbKv0aa", 2],
	81754 : ["It really depends on the story! Like if Pride and Prejudice would have had a tragic ending, it wouldn't have fit the story and I would have hated it. But if Anna Karenina had a happy ending it wouldn't have fit either and I also wouldn't have liked the ending. BQ - Some of them, but certainly not all. BQ2 - I'm working on a series, I've finished the first book and I don't want any romance in that one. Maybe just a little tiny tiny bit, but since it's only the beginning I would probably want it to be more like infatuation than love so far, at least until farther on in the series. BQ3 - I do and I love it!! BQ4 - I can't answer this question fairly because I've only seen the first movie, but I do think that was as bad as the books. It just (in my opinion) has no real emotion and teaches teen girls that the most important thing in life is having a hot boyfriend and dropping EVERYTHING for him.", 9081, "H9e8eKtoaa", -1],
	81755 : ["I prefer books (yes, even romance) that ends realistically. I don't care if it's happy or sad, it's got to be plausible.  BQ: In popular literature, yes. In the hands of a skilled author, no. BQ2: No. I make it very obvious that's it's a crush, because that's what it's supposed to be.  BQ3: *Raises hand bashfully*. My younger sis (6) and brother (9) set it up. It's messy and completely horrible and gorgeous. I love them. Merry   - if a old fat man stuffs you into a bag, don't be alarmed. I just asked for you this   :D BQ4: No, I don't. Because I actually liked the soundtrack - it was something I could listen to while doing my homework. :D The Twilight movies are boring as hell, but you can't really listen to Rifftrax when reading books. Heheh. BQ5: It doesn't have to be definably happy or sad. It just has to be a book that portrays emotion well, and powerfully.  These are really awesome questions!  LuthienX", 9081, "rSbsj3tgaa", 0],
	81756 : ["Well, Dolly.........there are several reasons for it.  Primarily, when you see that............it's usually someone \"point gaming\"...and awarding the \"best Answer\" to their other alter ego on the boards.  The people with BA Ratio's above 30%......are point gaming of SOME kind.  (And yes, there are several ways to POINT game........some illegal, but some perfectly legally....although a tad dishonest. )  Technically speaking, they are not breaking any rule.......but they aren't exactly playing \"fair\" either.  Those people have alot of BA's, because their answer is the ONLY answer. ....and they either scoop up the BA, by virtue of being the ONLY answer, or thru voting.......in which case , there's still only ONE answer to vote for.  I've been here awhile and see some people with 70, 80 and 90% BA ratio's.......and I *NEVER* see them answer anything.  That's because they only answer 3 day old questions, right before they expire......and no one ever really SEES what they write.  They get BA's for answers like  \"Yes\" and \"Your Mum\"....... However some people play fair, and just have favorites.......... I have often been accused of being Mrs. H.........because I was giving her alot of BA's .  True, I like Mrs. H........but her answers were often witty and funny, compared to some of the other dreck other people posted.  I post political questions and get alot of rude answers from Birthers.  I'm not gonna pick any of those as best, so Mrs. H often won by sheer default.  But I leave my account open and I defy anyone to detect any \"patterns\".  The people with closed accounts  (and high BA's ratio's.....above 50% ) are surely point gaming and don't leave their accounts open to inspection.....because their cheating would be OBVIOUS....and you could figure out who their alter ego is.", 9082, "VYusr8gsaa", -1],
