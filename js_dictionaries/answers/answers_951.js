I always felt like my mom was neglecting me. when she was preoccupied with her new boo thang, she became meaner too (not on purpose). when we talked about it and she adjusted her behavior, things were able to feel better. but look out for your girlfriend too. she will easily and quickly feel like an outsider- especially if your family traditions differ around holidays. slowly introduce and combine family traditions so your daughter keeps her routine with you, but becomes familiar with things your girlfriend likes. for example, my parents alternate  es and summers (since I was 4) but when my moms boyfriend came in, we started doing thanksgiving with his family out of state and occasional dinners with his parents. if me and my mom didn't talk about the changes, I would oppose and hate going to his family gatherings out of spite, but we did and they feel like a second family to me. I do disagree with immediate counseling. you need to be her safe space unless she wants otherwise. adding another stranger into her life could continue the stress and cause her to keep things to herself even more", 7415, "None", 0],
	53026 : ["Maybe she has been upset or stressed about changes going on in her life (her parents divorcing, and you moving on to a new gf). Maybe she's been having trouble with your divorce and has been hiding her stress, but she snapped. Try to talk to her about it.", 7415, "5NPzdwt4aa", 0],
	53027 : ["I think reactions like hers are pretty common when kids have been working so hard for so long to keep things positive for mom and dad and \"be good\"... it's bottled and shoved down until what seems like something insignificant (like a candy apple) is too much. While she seems to be doing well and managing the changes in her life, it's still a good idea to give her space to express her feelings and develop coping skills to help her manage those feelings, rather than pretending everything is fine until she just cannot anymore. It might be a good idea to get her into counseling with a therapist who works with children to let her have that safe space to feel upset, angry, sad, confused, etc over the recent changes. ", 7415, "8HoGFOxraa", 4],

What a pity I have two sons One son had his homework finished lickity-split and got A''s and B's. He even was diagnosed with ADD and trust me, he was a handful to control and dicipline. Whereas, his brother struggled with school and homework took him hours on end to complete every day. He did not have ADD like his brother. And he never gave us any problems as he was happy go lucky and very obedient. I never compared them or called my child stupid  like you have. You cannot push your children to get A''s if it is not in their make-up. However, you can support good study habits, make sure try eat well and get the sleep they need. The only thing my children were allowed to plug-in in their bedrooms was a lamp. No electronics allowed in bedrooms. So, monitor and oversee homework. Oh  by the way, my good student child is now 34  living with his dad. My son who barely made the grade is self employed with three employees and renting a house to own.  He just renovated my house and did a fantastic job.
