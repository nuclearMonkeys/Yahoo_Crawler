I think the bench was highly overrated especially when you have a lot of young players and not enought veteran contribution. The bench basically was Lindsey Hunter, Maxiell, and Stuckey.

At one point after they destroyed the Lakers in five games this team was suppose to have dynasty and instead their a joke a disappointment. Of course Joe Dumars couldn't find that one missing piece that would have reignited the team. They were overconfident and Billups was injured for the first two games of the series.

	84137 : ["Hello Del_icio.Interesting question as usual for you. I'm missing 3 ancient composers.Beginning with the \"Youngster\": 1)GiuseppeTartini(1692-1770) was working until he died at age of 78. His late 70's,violin concerts are famous works.One of these,just for example is the A minor concert(Dounias,115).Tartini wrote in his last year of life all his sacred music works,especially his Stabat Mater. Unfortunately an underrated and less played work,to my opinion. 2)My next \"Youngster\"is Georg Phillip Telemann(1681-1767)who wrote music until he died at the age of 86.I can not list all of his late masterpieces from his 70's 80's.etc.That list would be too long.His last works before his death were his marcus passion and the Opera Don Quichotte at the marriage of Comacho.There are very long list's at wikipedia with all his late concerto's,suites,opera's,cantatas,oratorio's, sonatas and more.A lot of his works haven't still been listed,for the TWV and TVWV is still in process as you might know Del. 3)My oldest \" Youngster \" is the german composer Heinrich Sch√ºtz(1585-1672) who died at the age of 87.His last works at the end of his life were \"Schwanengesang\"(That's no joke! It's called it) SWV 482 - 494 and his German Magnificat.He wrote those works one year before his death. That's my \" Youngster's \" contribute to your question.I hope you enjoy my suggestions.All the best regards from Heidelberg/Germany to you. Namaste!Stefan K.feat.Dr.Nirokay. Edit: There came some to my mind that also reached a high age. Christian Sinding,a norwegian composer was 85 when he died.(1856 - 1941). Camille Saint-Saens,was 86 when he died(1835 - 1921). Jean Sibelius,was 91 when he died(1865 - 1957). Charles Marie Widor,was 93 when he died(1844 - 1937).", 9159, "wCZVG6ltaa", 7],
