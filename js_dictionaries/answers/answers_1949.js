If you find a beagle that's less than 13\" you've got a runt bred with runt bred with runt bred with runt and will end up with the most unhealthy dog ever! Beagles come in 2 sizes... 13\" and 15\". Beagles are hunting dogs. They howl or \"bay\" very loudly, and most are very vocal. In addition, require much more exercise than a regular walk. If your considering having a family soon, you may also want to consider the amount of time a beagle (or any dog) requires, and the how noisy beagles can be! Pocket beagles were bred in the 1300's and 1400's and were said to be about 9\" at the withers (shoulder). There is no such thing as a modern-day pocket beagle and in fact, the term \"pocket beagle\" has become synonomous with poor quality puppies bred for the pet market, and often sold to pet shops. Reputable (U.S.) breeders breed according to the Standard defined by the American Kennel Club, which includes two height varieties: not exceeding 13\" at the withers, and not exceeding 15\". The light bones, high ear sets and toyish heads that tend to go along with very small sized beagles are listed as faults.  In addition to not breeding according to the standard, the majority of \"pocket beagle\" breeders allow many of the common genetic defects (e.g., hip dysplasia and epilepsy) to be passed along. The result is often an unhealthy dog.", 9844, "AA10973353", 1],
