I on the other hand was ACTUALLY STANDING 3 city blocks north of the towers when they were hit, i was only 4 blocks away during the first and second collapse.  I saw no explosion from the lower floors,  Or upper floors Neither did i hear one the collapse was surprisingly abrupt and rapid for both towers case. The second tower fell a Little to the west and fell across the west side hi-way onto the winter garden.  The planes were to high to make out markings though they weren't carrying rockets that was just the landing gear pods. The commonly used statement that thermite residue was found is most likely not true as the insulation used to protect the wtc towers structure was 90 percent the same as thermite but lacked the Catalyst compound needed to explode. Now the steel beams did not need to melt as steel building is generally made to support half its own weight with out Colapseing so if the jet fuel burned at 500 degrees combined with the fact that 3 floors were damaged and the damage done by the initial shock wave which cracked off the buildings fireproofing, the bars would have weakened enough to collapse. Also the plane took out nearly all of the supports on the north side of both buildings and about a quarter of the west side. But it also caused damage to the buildings central elevator core, which was responsible for carrying most of the weight due to the buildings unique open floor plan. Now the pentagon is different its walls are several feet thich of reinforceD concrete as its built to withstand such attacks. So as about 70% of an air craft's mass is centered in its tubular fuselage only the fuselage would survive the intitial impact makeing a round hole. The wings would have sheared off leaving all of the fuel to explode outside causing little structural damage Now with the incident in pennsylvania the plane hit in an open field not a structure so most of the explosive power of the fuel would have been directed up leaving a very small crater. As the plane glided in when it hit do to it coming in at a low angle to the surface it would have ricochet off leaving almost no mark. Building 7 was right next to the north tower whose colapse caused horific struvtual damage to its south side as well as several fires that could not be put out. It was the worst day of my life and it left homeless for 8 months as my appartment was only 5 blocks away, but still its almost been 10 years since then come on, lets just get over it.

	135993 : ["----How to Make a Good Sandcastle For the basic structure, you'll need plastic containers in different sizes. For really big castles, you can even start with a garbage can, followed by smaller wastepaper baskets, buckets and yogurt or cottage cheese containers. Each container will form one storey of your castle, and its diameter should be smaller than the one below it. Cut off the bottom of each container to make a cylinder. (Make sure an adult does the cutting.) Step 1 Make a foundation. Pile up some sand with your shovel, and make a large crater on top. Fill the crater with water, and stomp it down until the sand is packed into a firm foundation. Pile on some more sand, and repeat until you have a firm, flat platform to support your first storey. Step 2 Fill the moulds. Take your largest bottomless container and place it upside down on your foundation. Fill it to the top with sand and water and pack it down as you go. Better yet, lift up your child and have him stomp around on top. The key here is to make the sand very wet, and to compress it as tightly as possible to remove all air spaces and pockets of dry sand. Once the first container is filled, stack the next largest one on top of it and repeat the process. Keep going until the smallest container is sitting on top. Once all the containers are stacked and full, and the standing water has drained away, remove the moulds one at a time from the top down. The larger containers can be difficult to remove, so be patient. Work your fingers under the rim, and lift a little at a time. Once the seal between the mould and the sand is broken, it should come off easily. Take care not to disturb the upper storeys while you remove the lower moulds. Step 3 Start carving. Start at the top and work your way down, so the sand you carve away doesn't land on finished sections. Turrets, windows, battlements, stairways — let your inner medieval architect go wild. Step 4 Final touches. Use shells, seaweed and beach glass to adorn your creation. Build little driftwood soldiers and erect candy wrapper flags. Use crab shells and clams as sentries, or as monsters lurking in the moat.", 11306, "BuhYQIPHaa", 0],

The heat caused them to soften a bit, and distort under the weight they were under.   Once one floor's beams started to fail, the floor collapsed onto the one below it.  This was a stress the beams were not designed to withstand, and so the floors pancaked all the way down. * There really aren't any clear videos of the plane hitting the pentagon but if you look in the official 911 report there are tons of photos from the scene. * No you didn't hear explosions and there were no explosives used at all in 9/11.   What you probably heard was the sound the beams were making as they were sheared off from the central support as the floors fell down one on top of the other.

The fact that some of the 'hijackers' are still alive:   the fact that no jets were scrambled in time; that no significant plane debris was found at the pentagon site (planes do not vaporize!); that the buildings seem to be demolished, especially building 7; that jet fuel cannot melt steel, even though molten steel was seen \"flowing like lava\"; that the first responders heard explosions in the basement and within the buildings before they collapsed etc... -WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein admitted that building 7 was pulled down by a controlled demolition:   (He changed his story the next day) -The technology to bring down buildings with thermite and thermate in nano capacity was developed in the 1980's. They liquidized it in the mid 90's so it could be painted on like a gel coating. The twin towers underwent 'maintenance' for a whole year and guys in white hazmats suits 'painted' the core columns. -Official version claims the towers collapsed due to 'pancake effect', meaning the floors came detached from steel girders and fell on top of each other, collapsing the tower. If that's the case, why weren't any of the (core column) steel girders left standing?  -Pictures show smoke coming from the basement seconds before the plane hits. People (including firefighters and employees) also heard explosions from below the towers, moments before the plane hit. PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND SOME SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THE BASEMENT. -Pictures show steel girders with diagonal cuts in the them. This is exactly how controlled demolitions bring down buildings:  -Designers of the WTC say they were built to withstand MULTIPLE impacts from such an aircraft. -Official version states the plane that hit the pentagon 'vaporised' which is why very little traces can be found. Yet they said they managed to find DNA to identify all of the victims on board. Furthermore the building didn't 'vaporise' in any way. What type of plane vaporises, leaving the building and human DNA relatively undamaged. -The passport of one of the hijackers in the aircraft was supposedly found in the rubble at the WTC. It's clearly impossible for any personal effects to survive the impact and explosion, therefore it must have been planted. -All CCTV footage from around the pentagon has been hidden and never released.

Born and brought up in Holywood, Northern Ireland, she says her background aided her career progression, because ‘coming from Northern Ireland gives you a lot of basic level-headedness and stands you in very good stead'. Margaret was educated at Girton College, Cambridge, before becoming a solicitor in private practice.  She was a partner at Herbert Smith, a top-tier legal firm; it was at this time she met Sir Alan Sugar while she was doing legal work for Amstrad's flotation on the Stock Exchange. After retiring in 1999, Margaret took up her current role on the Amstrad board as a non-executive Director. Although never officially employed by Sir Alan, they have worked together on projects for over 20 years. Former PR impresario Nick Hewer started off in public relations in the mid 1960s. Heading up his own PR company until its sale in 1998, Nick built an impressive client list which, for over 20 years, included the secretariat of His Highness the Aga Khan, based in Chantilly, France. Nick first came across Sir Alan when his PR company was chosen to represent Amstrad back in 1983. Soon taking care of Sir Alan's profile across all business and personal dealings, Nick became a trusted ally and firm friend to the tycoon, playing an integral part in the management structure at Amstrad. Friends throughout both careers, Sir Alan laid on a dinner at The Dorchester for Nick and 100 guests to celebrate his official retirement. Says Nick: ‘Sir Alan is a very generous friend. The best thing about working for him was there was always something going on - he has vibrancy about him'. Nick's career has taken him all over the world; in his retirement he still pursues his life long passion of world travel. He has a home in France where he indulges his other passion, for tractors.
