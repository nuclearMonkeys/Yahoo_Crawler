The weiredst thing to happen on one of my walks is when this big shaggy dog just broke it's chain and ran up to my dog, sniffing at her. I went to move in between Rock and the dog, because the dog started growling, and then it attacked Rock. Needless to say, Rock fought back, and I had to pull her out of the fight. She got really cut up, because she has such short fur, but the other dog had really long fur and Rock didn't do any damage. I actually had to carry Rock away, while the owner was calling the dog and shocking it- which is why shock collars DO NOT WORK.

	92370 : ["I've encountered deer like this before but only when in my car. One buck (with a huge rack!) actually knocked out a headlight on my truck with his antler. It was standing in the middle of the road and didn't move so I stopped my truck and honked the horn. He was the first and only deer that didn't run away from that. He turned and knocked out a headlight, looked straight at me and just walked off. I think he was reminding me that as a wild animal his kind was actually there before my kind. I'm glad you two are ok...deer can get pretty violent sometimes. But the strangest thing that ever happened was when I was living with my dad and I used to walk my dog Winston out in the fields. Winston would usually go wandering (we had over 100 acres) and always catch up with me right before I got back to the house. (If he wandered to a neighbors it was ok because everyone in the valley knew him, loved him and he never bothered anyone) I was in a hay field wearing my headphones at the time so I didn't hear him barking or anything but I did feel the ground vibrating so I looked up just in time to see a herd of deer running straight for me. I didn't have time to run out of the way or react in any way before they got past me (very closely!) and I see Winston running behind them. I called for him but his instincts had taken over and he wasn't about to stop. I watched him chase the herd into the woods and didn't know what to do so I just started walking back to the house. Winston caught up to me just like usual but this time he had the tail of a deer in his mouth. He was a wolf/husky mix so apparently those deer brought out the hunter in him. I'm sure many people will say he should have been leashed, we should never have had him because of his wolf heritage...blah blah blah. They didn't know Winston and they didn't know what a great dog he was and how he changed our entire valley's perception of what a wolf/dog can be when raised properly.

	92375 : ["Alialogg, alimony is wrong. If my company fired me, why should I demand payments for the next 5 years to keep my standard of living? When a business splits up, since when was one with a higher book value required to makes payments for a period of time to the other entity to \"level the playing field\"? A marriage is a business deal, it is a contract, and a bad one at that for men. Not only do men the vast majority of the time come into a marriage with the greater amount of assets and larger paychecks, they get to see half of that transferred to her name. Then the courts have the audacity to make him pay her further monthly? That is not reasonable, and that is why men shouldn't get into a marriage. It is a BAD BUSINESS DEAL. As for women that are helpless after a marriage ends? Whose fault was that to enter a marriage with no skill set or ability to provide on your own? Who put themselves in that situation? Just like men who have sex with women then find out they have a child, they should have warn a condom. Women like you have no problem with that statement. However, you'll have a problem with me saying to a lady who can't provide for herself \"you should have gotten an education.\" Both cases one party put their lives/livelihood in the other party's hands. Bad idea on both ends.  Custody time is divided equally? LMAO... Hardly. Child support/custody laws are borderline unconstitutional. Women are able to take off and leave the state with the child and the father is told to F-off. The woman is almost always awarded primary custody of the child. The real question is, why are you brainwashed by the ridiculous things that women say to uphold these genderly-biased laws? EDIT: Every one of my questions has empirical data to back up what I say unless otherwise stated (I have had a question or two where I explicitly state this is off my observation and not data). I CHALLENGE you to find any question of mine where I don't back up my statements with facts or give a preliminary statement stating that the question is based off of observation. As for your rebuttal. If a company lays you off with a severance package, you don't get your weekly check for nearly as long as alimony lasts (in many cases alimony lasts for life). It is either a one time, lump sum payment or a few months of pay at most. You base your argument off of incorrect \"facts\"/statements. In other words, you are WRONG. Next, the assets being divided up being only assets accumulated while in the marriage is not 100% correct. It varies state by state. In many states, the assets brought into a marriage by a particular party are subject to reallocation. Which is criminal in my book. As for women getting money from the man working his career and the woman staying at home, the woman shouldn't get alimony based on this at all. She is getting half of the assets that the enterprise created together (and in many cases she gets the \"good will\" (look it up in an accounting book) that the man brought into the marriage along with that). From 401Ks, IRAs, Houses, Cars, Real Estate, etc... Why should she be entitled to further monthly payments? That is all she deserves. Go get a goddamn job.If your job doesn't pay as much as your husband's does, then you should have gotten a better education to provide for yourself. If you felt you would be further in your career but gave that up, get a settlement in writing upfront stating that you will sacrifice career advancement to take care of the children. An after-the-fact settlement in a genderly biased court is nonsense.  Finally, your claim of women making less than men in the same job is horsesh*t. Women don't put in the same amount of hours as their male counterparts in these jobs and there are substantial studies that have shown this. Women are more likely to take off personal time for their \"womanly issues\"/time of the month, more likely to take sick time, more likely to leave work early to pick up their children, take more time off after they have children, work from home, etc... Their male counterparts are slaves to their job, don't get nearly the flexibility as these women so needless to say they deserve to get paid more. If the average man's work week is 45 hours/week and the average woman's is 38.5 hours/week in the same job, the man deserves more money, bottom line. QED.", 9443, "None", 0],

The Bible has some amazing facts.

There are more original documents and copies of them found than any other historical event in history.  Hundreds of them.  Their accuracy can be easily compared and proved. In the early days, the scribes spent their entire lives writing a copy...and if even one error was made, they threw it out and started all over again.  They were carefully hand copies letter by letter, and they had such an awe of a Holy God that they would never tolerate one mistake.  This protected the documents themselves. The New Testament also had guidelines that protected the letters written by eye witnesses of Jesus Christ...most who died horrible and painful deaths.  Would you die that way to protect a lie? I wouldn't.  yet they all died because of their faith and Jesus Who they had met personally. Paul was the only one who saw Jesus in a vision, which changed his life.  And his writings are also included.   Christians believe that God inspired each writer what He wanted recorded.  So God wrote them through these men who listened and followed Him.  And because of what Jesus Himself had to say about God's Word, they also beleive it is living and powerful as a 'two edged sword\"..Christians are told to use God's Word as their weapon against evil.  And Jesus Himself used it against Satan. It is God's guidebook for us in following Him.", 9443, "qxX5Y66Maa", 0],
	92394 : ["The text is inspired, not dictated.  Men wrote it all.  The miracle (and it is a miracle) is that God speaks through their human words.  In that sense it is the word of God.  But God did not wrench them out of their history and culture.  They were men of their times.  The text reflects this-- you guys go on and on about it.  The mistake you make is thinking this somehow proves that God isn't the ultimate source of the text.  You seem to have the same attitude that you lampoon in your mythical black woman. And it's just as wrong headed for you as it is for her.", 9443, "Z6j6Zq9waa", 0],
