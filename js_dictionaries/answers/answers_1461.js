EDIT: this is to the person above me, I am not going to trust someone and blindly follow them. i am going to use my head and think and find out what is the best and is scaring people gets there eyes open then it is well worth scarring the **** out of people. but hell if you want to close your eyes and hope for the best then that is your choice.", 8958, "None", 2],

	78717 : ["Florence is a superb city to invest your holyday; see more with hotelbye . Florence's museums, palaces, and churches house a number of the greatest creative treasures in the world. The most popular and important memorial in Florence are: the Cathedral, the Baptistery, the Uffizi, the Bargello and the Accademia. Churches like:   Maria Novella and   Croce are veritable art galleries. In Florence you may also begin to see the huge and various art selection stored in the Pitti Palace. The Palazzo Pitti (The Pitti Palace) is just a large 15th century palace found on the quieter south bank of the Arno River. The palace was long time the home of Florence's rulers till 1919, when it had been handed to the Italian state, which developed the palace in to a memorial complex. In spite of its metamorphosis, from regal house to a state-owned public developing, the palace however keeps the air and environment of a personal selection in a grand house.", 8952, "None", 0],

	78721 : ["Progressives revel in considering themselves as \"good\", \"fair\", \"compassionate\", and \"enlightened\". There is a great deal of self-aggrandizing emotional capital in defending the rights of the most vile humans on Earth. Note that liberals don't oppose the murder of viable babies inches and seconds from birth since it is a \"no brainer\" that these innocents are precious.   Using the liberal's \"logic\" #1: What benefit is gained to my psyche opposing an act that the \"common folk\" oppose -- the liberal wants to make him/herself believe that they are morally \"better\" than everyone else -- not just equal. Using the liberal \"logic\" #2: \"if I defend  beasts like those that killed 3000 innocent Americans on 9/11, then I most be a real swell and civilized chap\" Of course, many innocents have to die to salve the immoral conscious of liberals. Note the following quote from C.S. Lewis: \"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\"", 8958, "1f83e4c8d55fd54426106e9a593218beaa", 1],

He's the fabled grudge-bearing punisher of America for all the evil we have done in the world of his mind. * * *  Nice CS Lewis quote.  But still ... the reality seems to me to be that  that many power-libs and definitely much of Team Obama operate not from altruistic motives but rather from grudges and self-hatreds.", 8958, "odBWpML6aa", 1],

	78724 : ["First off you get a gold star for being one of the few people (if not the only person) who has asked a Mike Vick question who has recognized that he has *not* been reinstated. I do not think Vick will be reinstated next season.  I think he will receive a one year suspension and will be allowed to play again for the 2010 season.  I just do not see how NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell can let him go unpunished by the league.  However, if Vick only gets a partial suspension I will not boycott the season.  I am an animal lover and I think what Vick did was despicable; but, I also believe that Vick has learned from his mistake and he will remain on the straight and narrow.  I personally believe that people like Pacman Jones, Plaxico Buress and Ricky Williams are much more despicable than Vick because even after being caught they have continued to break the law, team and league policies.  In my opinion if the NFL is going to allow a three time looser like Ricky Williams to play (after a one year suspension) then Goodell has to allow Vick to play again -- it would be extremely hypocritical to do otherwise.  However, to allow Vick to play immediately upon his release from prison would be equally as hypocritical.  A one year suspension seems just right to me.", 8957, "a6EndAPiaa", 1],
	78725 : ["Well, if he paid his debt to society, then let the man play.  Leonard Little of the Rams caused a DUI death.  He's still playing.  Yes, Vick did some very heinous crimes against those poor animals.  He electrocuted some, hung some, shot some.  He's a cruel sonovabiyyyyatch, but still, God forgives him, so why shouldn't we?  We must forgive others before God will forgive us.  It's WORD!   The main thing for Mike to do is to give up any, and all, relations with his homies from the hood.  People can be a bad influence on you.  He was a gifted NFL player a few years ago.  That was then.  This is now.  He's gotta clean up the wreckage of his past, and get on with a good life.  There are the two things for mike to avoid.  Avoid the abuse of any dogs, and don't hang with the homies.  Mike Vick will rebound.  The protests will be strong but later will die down.  He said he turned his life over to Jesus.  That's a step in the right direction!", 8957, "lz8Y1ihzaa", 1],
	78726 : ["Why would you boycott?  I mean seriosuly?  Do what you want, but its not like its going to make a difference to the NFL if you do. Vick committed a crime, he did his time, its over and done with, give him a second chance.  Ray Lewis killed a man.  Look at others like Chris Henry, Pacman Jones, etc.  You have plenty of people who have done wrong and have gotten 2nd (or more in Pacman's case) chances, so why are you out to make an example out of Vick, but you're ok with the others?", 8957, "None", 1],

	78745 : ["Life is nothing but making judgments about things, people and events based on their probabilities. Everything is not created equal. Everything cannot be 100% likely or 0% likely. Everything has it's own probabilities. Some things are more likely to be true than other things. 1. That Obama attended a Christian church for years means that the probability of his being Christian is higher than the probability of his not being Christian. Also, the probability that the Constitution states that there will be no religious test for any federal office is 100%. 2. Since terrorists have carried out a lot of bombings and caused airliners to blow up, the probability that terrorists also caused 9-11 is also high - especially in light of Feb. 2001's Hart-Rudman Senate Report on US Security that specifically warned of hijacked airliners being flown into buildings. 3. That other threatened nations like Israel have had strict airport security for decades and haven't had an airliner hijacked or blow up tells us that stricter airport security does the job we need done. So the choice was between what? Letting hijackers and bombers board or stricter security? No contest. This is called \"common sense\". 4. Obama was running against Angry Old Geezer and The Gal who couldn't even attract the GOP-leaning Libertarian voters. After the travesty of the Bush years, the probability that Americans would want a change - especially after the financial turmoil of September 2008 - was very high. But if it makes you feel better to continue to believe that when given a choice between McCain/Palin and Obama, the majority of us chose Obama because he's black and not because McCain/Palin was a joke, then go ahead and believe it.", 8958, "H0QBp4kIaa", 0],

He will not be able to recondition himself and learn a new system by the time the season starts, its just too unrealistic for him to do that this year.
