I will list some free places to help you locate the scholarship. First, the college's financial aid office and website has a list of private scholarships offered from outside organizations and companies. Sometimes a college major's website will list scholarships, too. Second, the public library has a book listing scholarships with some not even listed on the web. Third, your high school guidance office has a list of local scholarships for current high school students can apply for consideration. Finally, I recommend joining several free membership scholarship search websites. There are scholarships for a variety of things including ethnicity, clubs, hobbies, and even wearing duct tape to the high school prom. Most are updated on a regular basis. Most offer a customized search based on information entered onto a form on the website. Good luck!", 10120, "442312848e57d97bbab416d6b696499daa", 0],

	109940 : ["Yes, this a new mom issue - I remember the first time I really let my baby cry - I stood in the kitchen and gripped the counter until my knuckles were white. It was all I could do to keep from running to her. I didn't follow CIO until my daughter was over 18 months old (because she wasn't sleeping through the night yet!). That said, I think you did the RIGHT thing, leaving baby for a minute, and giving yourself a moment. Yes, you may have felt horrible, but it's at that moment of breaking-point that people make stupid decisions (and sleep deprived ones) and hurt their children. So it was actually a smart choice.  Your baby won't remember having to cry it out, or even just a few minutes of crying. You will get used to the crying - the first year is hard, but it does get easier. I don't say this to be callous, but sometimes you're in the bathroom and the baby cries, and you HAVE to wait. And you're not a bad mom for that.  Eventually you may have to let baby CIO for a bit, but if you don't want to do that, it's fine. You're not hurting baby to leave her safely, for a few minutes to cry. You sound like a really good mom, by the way.", 10116, "gLrDZKKhaa", 4],
	109941 : ["Let's look at this logically, because mothers always feel guilty, even when they've done nothing wrong. 1) You left the room to compose yourself, which means that your baby was already crying, so holding her and attempting to soothe her wasn't helping.  2) Was your little girl crying because she was sick, hurting, in need of a diaper change, or hungry? No. 3) Would a horrible mother have actually FELT like a horrible mother for letting her baby cry for 5 minutes? No. Quit beating up on yourself and accept the fact that you are human - not a Stepford wife or a robot - but a flawed, flesh and blood real live human being. You love your baby with your whole heart and would never hurt her, but if you don't know where to turn when nothing consoles her, you might lay her down in her crib and walk away for five minutes.", 10116, "KGWHW1ghaa", 4],
	109942 : ["Compressing with Winrar would be the best choice but you said it doesn't work. It would not be possible to compress 250 MB to a small enough size to send it through email. As far as I know, email such as Yahoo mail only allows you to upload up to 10 MB and the max you can expect to upload through email anywhere else would be like 20 MB max, maybe Gmail? Unless you pay for your email, then you might be able to upload more as an attachment. Since you have photos, you can try changing the picture formats into .jpg. I would just change all the picture formats to .jpg and then compress the file as a whole. Since you are at 250MB, I think the best you can do is to compress it down to maybe like 50-100MB max. Or your other option would be to resize the pictures but that will make the pictures look more blurry so bad idea. If you really want to send it to somebody, send it through AIM or MSN Messenger or something. And if you want to keep the file yourself, save it on a disk.

	109963 : ["You have to get used and you do get used. Always remember, a baby, it's not like a 6-year old crying - they rarely are in pain. It's more of a \"Hey, hey, HEYYYY!\" If they sound desperate to you, and you'd do everything just to make that horrible sound end, remember - we are the ultimate descendants of the children who cried the loudest, and the mothers who stood them the least and gave them what they wanted. But the babies are still the same, while parents know better now :-) I chill out in my own manner - I swear like a trooper. I'm opposed to letting the baby cry as a matter of principle, but if she's hungry and I still have to prepare the bottle chances are she'll entertain the neighbours with a Tantrum in C minor while I make the formula. I go to her, tell her 'you're hungry, I've got it, etc.' and then set off for the kitchen. In the meanwhile, she does cry, but never to the point of wailing - the only time she did was when she recovered from a colic with a rabid appetite and I didn't recognise it. She went ballistic, and would still spit the bottle from time to time during feeding to cry some more, just from the indignation. You should always go and see why a baby is crying, but picking her up is another matter. My baby is now 6 1/2 and sometimes she 'wakes up' from playing and just wants to make sure we're still around. With children this small it's OK, they have no other interest than full belly - empty diaper - warm place. But keep your cool, you'll need it later when they need other things and can resist for longer. When it's dinner it can take 5 minutes to make meal for the baby, but once she's taken to the kitchen and secured in the high chair she knows food's coming and won't say a peep. Swinging a baby's crib or a lullaby can do wonders - but if she learns that being picked up is the be-all end-all response from Mummy, when she's denied it later she'll feel something's wrong - and cry. You need to be more varied in your responses.", 10116, "KpZa54Aiaa", 1],
	109964 : ["Don't worry, you're doing the best you can! I don't think it's possible to go without occasionally leaving a baby to cry, however much we would like to avoid it. I'm pregnant with my second and know that there will be times when my toddler and new baby will both need attention and I will have to choose between them. For example, if I'm in the middle of a major pooey nappy change with my toddler there's no way I'll be able to walk away from that to the new baby straight away!!  I don't believe in letting a little baby cry it out either. I think a baby that young only cries because they actually need something, not just to get attention. However - if your daughter had been upset for that long before (with you comforting her) then by the end she would have definately been overtired, probably by then just crying because she was already tired and crying, plus she would have been picking up the stress you felt, and it's quite likely that what she really *needed* was to be put down and left to settle for a minute without the stimulation of patting and rocking, your stress etc. I'll make it clear - I'm not suggesting just putting her down every time and leaving her to cry. It's just that I found it took a while to get in tune with my son's signs (and now I butt in and tell my sister-in-law that her baby is too tired when she doesn't think he is - but he goes right down to sleep if she puts him down and then she asks me how I knew!!). At that age they are changing all the time too. It sounds to me like you did the right thing. If you couldn't find a reason for such a long cry and it happens again, take her in to the doctor. It could be an ear infection or something hurting her. Edit: I'll just add that as he got older I learnt to hear the difference between his crying and the brief grizzling he would do before falling asleep. Real crying - I would always pick him up. A little grizzle - I would leave for a minute and he'd usually quickly fall asleep.", 10116, "bbbc56f2900226ddebfb35c47e8e1d38aa", 1],
