If you're more inclined to the comedic side of things I would look for something less well known so that you could really infuse yourself into it and make it your own. Unfortunately I can't really give you any specific references in comedy as I don't see as much of that. What it really comes down to though is what kind a person you are. I mean even though it's acting and you're pretending to be a number of people you're not everyone connects more deeply to some material of others so the best advice I can give you is also the most cliched: just perform something that feel passionate about and it will alway show in your performance.", 8035, "k4acAhbEaa", 0],

My personal favorites are \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"The Glass Menagerie\"  In \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", Blanche DuBois's character has the most and longest monologues.  They are all great.  In \"The Glass Menagerie\",  the play is told by the character, Tom Wingfield, son of the aging southern belle mother, Amanda Wingfield, and brother of the painfully shy Laura Wingfield.  These are also great monologues. Another great work loaded with outstanding monologues is \"A Long Day's  Journey into Night\" by Eugene O'Neil. These plays can be bought in book or movie form.
