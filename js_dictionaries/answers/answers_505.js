So really the best self defense weapons is either not be there or course but if are in a fight or flight situation then the best choice is a hand pistol with proper training but if you need to use melee weapons a short baseball bat , a good knive , rolled up magazine , a short pot ( blunt weapon ) and another weapon to get a is buckler ( medieval small shield is effective for defense and offensive uses .", 4397, "y9Y12soRaa", 1],

	28284 : ["Really hard to diagnose all of your issues. You say factory ammo cycles fine but reloads do not. Looking at that from our side says there`s a problem with the reloads...not necessarily with the powder loads but what changes were made in the case dimensions upon firing.  I have seen cannelures in the wrong place cause stovepiping even in virgin factory ammo. That groove around the case is obviously smaller in diameter than the case diameter at that point. If that cannelure diameter happens to be located at the front lip of the magazine when fully loaded it can cause the round to flip up just enough to catch the slide and interfere with the ejection and stop the slide with either the spent case or often the unfired round.  Also, your own cases that you fired in your gun should resize without problems but cases fired in another gun may cause problems.  There`s often more issues other than sizing spent cases than seen with the unaided eye. The factory loads fired for the first time will have tool marks in the chamber transferred to the case. After many rounds the brass will eventually wear the steel to a smoother surface and problems ejecting will fade away. Tool marks in a chamber act like tiny fingerprints as far as the grip on the case.  I would advise anyone to not do anything to void a warranty, but, myself that has never made a warranty claim and never plan to...I would polish the chamber. That`s just me and my philosophy to do my own repairs. Once a firearm is in my hands...it`s mine until either traded or sold. Before jumping to conclusions always try different magazines and vary the number of rounds loaded especially in the higher than 10 capacity in a handgun. ", 4396, "ggaHVSjaaa", 3],
	28285 : ["We will run out of oxygen before the planet reaches a temperature that kills off animal life. The some total of global warming can be found in energy consumption by humans. In 2020 the world consumed in excess of 619 quadrillion Btu's. A Btu is the amount of energy it takes to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. It does not matter if that BTU came from oil or was wind generated. If we shift the source of the power, it is still power that our biosphere is not able to cope with. The O2 depletion rate (.1%) of a century ago has almost doubled. Right now it is said to be 20.9%. Some where around 16% humans can no longer function. So some where around a 4% drop in atmospheric O2 will kill us off. But humans can survive in temperatures of 110 degrees. The global mean temperature is such that at the rate of change in temperature and oxygen- the threshold of death will be reached by oxygen depravation first. Now if science is right about evolution- we don't need to worry. Humans will evolve to cope with the change. But if science is wrong on that concept then technology nor science can solve our problem.
