MJ made EVERYONE get better on his team and other team his skills were so high everybody wanted to be HIM and the most famout shot is mj turnaround jumper fadeaway and i did see MJ play in 1996 when i was 8 and i never forgot his skills. He wasnt a ball hog hed pass when they were open unlike kobe and lebron who only pass when they cant take it in or drive a good player mite be kobe even maybe lebron but Great is those befor jordan and jordan", 9580, "K7UZ0ZvMaa", -1],

You can cry and whine, lie, and try to forget and rewrite history all you want, but Jordan was not celebrated for being a great winner in the first years of his NBA career.  He was very much known as a ballhog, a guy who could score but couldn't deliver victories, up until he had the Scottie Pippens and others around him.

	96190 : ["Any woman who tells you their feet have never hurt after wearing heels is a liar. I have not personally seen any adverse effects other than a few blisters where the shoe rubbed parts of my foot the wrong way, but the long-term effects of heels are proven facts unrelated to genetics. Wearing heels can be very bad for not only your feet and toes but it can also cause knee problems and back problems. There are over 800,000 foot surgeries each year to correct bunions, hammer toes, and trapped nerves, and 90% of these surgeries are done on women, and can be linked back to wearing high heels. Granted the occasional wearing of heels will not do as much damage as the woman who wears them to work every day, but the potential is still there.", 9576, "5L3M7Oiraa", 0],
	96191 : ["Just a point, a lot of guys find flats sexier...but to answer your question, the real reason of wearing hijab is about modesty, and to fight against the exploitation of a woman's beauty (i.e. using the image of a woman's beauty and sexuality to sell goods or make them seem as inferior like in some music videos). Hijab is a lot about the girl's comfort in the society and their attachment with God's will. What guys want to stare at is their own business, a woman cannot control that. There is nothing wrong with being modest and stylish at the same time. In some countries, wearing high heels signifies that a woman is passing and many muslim men lower their gaze out of respect when they hear the sound of a woman passing.", 9576, "None", 0],

It is a good idea to stretch before running, but do so after warming up by running for a  couple of laps. Do ballistic stretching before running and static stretching after. If you are cramping and it is from stretching you are stretching too much. That is you are stretching too far. Do not over stretch.

He was in the top 10 in FGA 12 TIMES. The only times he wasn't among the leaders in that category was when he was injured or retired. \"Jakoqui\" is correct in saying that Jordan was known as a ballhog in the first part of his career. That was one of the knocks against him, and what separated him from Bird & Magic.  Doug Collins wanted to use Jordan as a point guard but Jordan wouldn't pass the ball. He was always looking to shoot first. Eventually, Phil Jackson was able to convince Jordan to involve other people in the Bulls offense and they started winning championships. It's kind of hard for anyone to get in a rhythm when your standing around watching Michael  Jordan shoot.  Jordan was a slasher/driver in the first part of his career. After he returned from his first retirement, he took more jumpshots, and taking advantage of the shortened 3-point line.  I won't argue with your statement of \"when you're the best player you should take the most shots\".

Diet will need to be looked at, more protein, lots of fresh foods. Bananas are great, likewise kiwi fruit - try a smoothie! There is more to diet than that - you'll have to see what works. Experiment with eating around an hour AFTER running as your body can then process foods again. Pain in the shins might be caused by poor footwear (not necessarily branded!), wrong running style or extremely hard surface - like the concrete and tarmac in most towns and cities.
