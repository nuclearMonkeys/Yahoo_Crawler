Trash talking happens in every sport he of all people should know this. Any athlete here knows this. Plus the true greats let there playing do the talking.

I think it also sheds light on the mindset of radical Islam.  Without even knowing the full content and context of the speech, it was automatically assumed that the Pope was condemning Islam.

I agree i think its being better produced, sounding more clean, getting faster, and certainly getting heavier/darker. I guess it could depend on your opinion on what is heavy.

Turn oven onto warm (approximately 170 degrees).  2. Line a cookie sheet with the pretzels.  3. I used a cookie sheet with sides so that they would not slide off.  4. Unwrap a Hershey Kiss and place it in the center of each pretzel and continue doing that until every pretzel has a Hershey Kiss sitting on top of it.  5. Place cookie sheet in oven.  6. Check them every few minutes until the Hershey Kiss gets glossy.  7. This takes about 5 minutes.  8. In the meantime put the M&M's in a bowl.  9. When the Hershey Kiss is sufficently melted (it will still look like a kiss, but will be shiny) take the cookie sheet out of the oven.  10. Take one M&M and place it on top of the Hershey Kiss and give it a little\"squish\".  11. This pushes the chocolate into the pretzel and adheres all three pieces together.  12. Do this until each pretzel/kiss is topped with a M&M.  13. I placed the whole cookie sheet in the refrigerator until they firmed up.  14. I've also used the Hershey Hugs instead of the Hershey Kisses.  15. The Hershey Hugs will melt FASTER than the Hershey Kisses, so watch carefully!  16. I've also used plain M&M's instead of the peanut butter ones as well. Good luck!", 10616, "WujnVwy8aa", 0],

It wasn't even the Popes very own words or concept. He replaced into repeating what Paleolous II supposedly mentioned. . What's with the hypersensitive reaction besides? The Muslims can dance in the streets; shout and yell; develop their fists all they choose to yet i do no longer think the Pope owes Muslims an apology for something. some have contended the terrorists are a sort of radical Islam and a small minority of the religion. they say the huge majority of Muslims are a non violent people. i'm commencing as much as ask your self approximately those claims once I see the reported hundreds of thousands in the streets protesting what the Pope repeated. 2 confronted or what?

There is as much if not more potential for Christians around the world to be breeding the coming of a real Armageddon, and Bush and his religious supporters are in the process of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy if they continue to escalate war in the Middle East. The pope's remarks came not to disparage Islam, but to do the exact opposite. He was trying to say it is unjust that remarks such as those once made by a Byzantine emporer that Islam is \"evil and inhuman\" are not fair. When you have a handful of people who have a radical world view based on a religious order, to say the CAUSE of the radicalism is the religion itself is a vast overgeneralization. The Catholic Church may not be the most tolerant of other religions, but the pope meant no harm. The political mileau is such that to state anything in public against a whole religious group will be easily misconstrued. People like Bush are even encouraging this by using terminology like \"Islamofascist,\" which carries with it the hidden asumption that Islam commonly breeds fascists, but there is no evidence of such commonality.
