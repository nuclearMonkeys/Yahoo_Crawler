	111838 : ["If Joe was fighting today he'd either be at Cruiserweight or have gained weight up to about 220-225 lbs. Wladimir had a style that allowed him to outjab and outbox the smaller Frazier. Though he'd never knock Smokin' Joe out he would probably 9/10 times win a UD. Then again who knows! Any man with two fists who knows how to punch should never be underestimated. A lot of fighters seem to give in and just try to \"survive\" when fighting the Klitschkos. Joe wouldn't give in, he'd be pressuring and non-stop punching for the full 12 rounds.

	111840 : ["I am Joshua Mbngo Dmbungo TONGUE-CLICK Jnr. Jnr. Yes. Frazier could become unstuck when taking blows from the likes of Foreman, but I don't believe Wlad can hit anything like Foreman, also I don't believe he could land clean on Frazier very easily. Frazier's crude bob and weave is akin to Whittaker compared with Wlad's opposition and he would find his way in. Even if he couldn't get in immediately, Wlad certainly couldn't take Frazier out early because he grinds bums down over a period of time. If you don't take Frazier out quick then you're in for a hell of a night. Look at the pace Frazier could fight at for fourteen rounds against Ali in the first fight AND THEN still have enough to deck Ali in the fifteenth. The pace he fought at is far greater than Wlad being safety first for however long it takes. Frazier wouldn't get caught too often and Joe Frazier would never ever quit coming. Frazier didn't know how to quit. Wlad can't handle pressure too well anyway, but JOE FRAZIER home brand pressure fighting? He breaks down Wlad as the fight goes on with his horrendous body attack. I also cannot see Wlad taking a left to the chin from Frazier without either being sparked or hurt too badly to recover and fight back. The Smokin Joe that beat Ali beats Wlad all day every day in my opinion. It might take some time, but it will happen. TONGUE-CLICK!", 10197, "yCj6R2HHaa", 1],

	111862 : ["Certainly not.  In fact, there could be a strong debate that the opposite might be absurd.  Think about it a bit.  We LOVE Joe Frazier.  Those of us who are old enough to remember, or even know someone who is, tend to think of the fighters of the 70s as \"godlike\".  Each of them, including the great ALI, had his share of flaws.  Wladimir's losses to Purity, Brewster and Sanders would give anyone reason to believe that Frazier would destroy him.  However, all of them had something that Frazier didn't.  They had at least marginal boxing ability and size.   Mentioning the names of Wladimir's conquerors, in the same breath as Frazier, might bring one up on charges.  Still, let's look at the reality.  Frazier, at best, MIGHT have beaten Klitschko.  But, I dare say that's a strong MAYBE.   Some people like to think that all fighters reach their prime at the same time and that their prime years last the same time.  That's not true.  Frazier's prime, because of his style and quality of opposition, was relatively short.  He was at his absolute best, vs ALI in 71, but he was never the same after that fight.   Most people place Frazier above Tyson but even that is debatable.  Tyson is faster and more powerful but he lacks Frazier's stamina.  He would have a much better chance of blasting Wladimir out of there, than Frazier would.  Frazier was indeed destructive but he did not have the KO power of Tyson, Foreman, Liston and others.  He was certainly relentless but his style would not work very well against Wladimir.   Now, Frazier COULD beat Wladimir.  What he would have to do is to stay low and force Wladimir to punch.  This would take him a few rounds because he would also have to avoid return fire, no easy feat.  Wladimir is the most \"correct\" boxer since Joe Louis.  It is not to say whom he would beat but, take ALI for example.  Great as he was, it was his \"UNorthodox\" style, not any correct boxing, that made him great.  IF, and that is a big if, Frazier gets to the middle rounds, Wladimir's stamina would be taxed.  However, the truth is that Frazier would not take those punches too well.  Even though he COULD win, it's not likely that he would, because of the way he fights.  HIs goal is to apply so much pressure that his oppoent caves in.  But he would take a lot of solid punches in the process.   ALthough ALI is faster, Wladimir wouldn't have too much more trouble, hitting Frazier, than ALI did.  It's because Frazier knows only one way of fighting.  The most important Wladimir has going for him is his conditioning and the fact that he's a gym rat.  Though Frazier was in supreme shape as well, He'd be fighing a man with near Foreman-like power.  Wladimir lacks ALI's speed or Foreman's power but he has enough to compensate and the punches that will land, would do more damage than ALI's punches did.   Wladimir throws every punch correctly.  Most of Frazier's opponents didn't do that.  He'd take too much punishment and his aggression would work against him.   In one fight, it could go either way.  I lean towards Wladimir to stop the much smaller Frazier in the later rounds.  However, should Frazier win the first, he would surely lose the next two.  He would not improve his style.  Wladimir would learn from the mistakes.  It's what he does best.", 10197, "8fa17d06395754a44604a2b42063588daa", 1],
