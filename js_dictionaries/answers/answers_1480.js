Most men just want to show up instead of getting involved with all the details.  My hubby is most men, he helped me pick a date and the chruch the rest was up to me.

Deep down I would think that she knows all of this already and is ata impass where she doesnt know what to do, help her figure things out. She is only 29, there is still time for her to find someone that WANTS her because she is who she is, not just because she is convienient.

Right now,it's sounds as though it's putting a lot of stress on him. I'm sure he wants a nice wedding one day too but right now she has to be more realistic and have a good one on one talk with him and decide what they are going to do.

I used to be an event planner for many, many years and these always helped my couples. The best thing to do is network with couples who were recently married. Ask to see letters of recommendation from past clients. When selecting your cake, taste samples, view their photo book. If you don't like any of the designs see what they can do special for you. Keep in mind, do things the way you want them do be done. One of the most elegant weddings I had the honor of being a part of was so simple but it was one of the most beautiful ceremonies and receptions I had ever attended. Last tip for you....Don't spend alot of money on your wedding save that money for the down payment on your house instead. Trust me in the end you'll be happy you did. Wedding Budget Worksheet The first thing a couple should do is try to work out a budget for their Wedding. Your costs can vary greatly depending on which aspects of the wedding are more important to you. Also, you may be fortunate enough to have a kind relative or friend provide free services that will further affect the budget.

She would be as scary to Republicans as Cheney is to Democrats. It shouldn't happen, for the sake of the country. The best combination would be Barack Obama as President, and Bill Richardson as Vice President. Barack Obama can communicate, and would make an awesome figure head. He is popular, and would bring some fresh ideas to a system that needs them.

	79680 : ["First, pick your date or at least a time of year. Then, look in the phone book under \"wedding.\" A lot of reception sites, caterers, bakers, florists will be listed there. Otherwise, look up the individual entries of \"banquets\", \"caterers\", \"florists\", etc.  Then, call the places and book appointments. Start with the ceremony location and reception site, depending on which one is more important to you (if, for example, you already know where you want the ceremony to be, start there so you can ensure your date). Compare the services of each one, keeping in mind that not everything is equal. Location, appearance, packages, etc. will all vary, and you will have to decide what is most important for you. Then arrange food, photography/videography, dj, transportation, florists, and cake in that order. Florists and bakers can do more than one wedding a day, but photographers can't so they need to be booked first. Once you have the vendors, then focus on the details like programs, favors, centerpieces, etc. The vendor search can be a little overwhelming at first because it's a lot of phone and leg work, but once you get the hang of it you can overlap planning the details with planning the big stuff. The Knot has a lot of wedding planning ideas. They also have a handy checklist that you can customize to feature the things you want to include in your wedding. There is no reason why you need a wedding planner, and they often get you to spend more than you otherwise would want to. If you want any more detail, contact me directly.

(And much science historically has had various biases that weren't even recognized at all, but which could now be called \"anti-feminist\".) Sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology are good candidates for \"anti-feminist research\", though I wouldn't presume that all such researchers have that agenda. Freud apologists in Psychology also include among them  those with an openly (and not so openly) anti-feminist agenda. And various researches on IQ, alleged differences in learning and thinking, et al, often funded by conservative Institutes and Foundations, may also qualify. But seldom does such research declare its agenda openly. EDIT One might also add research purporting to prove the harm done by single-mothers, by divorce, by day-care, et al.

	79690 : ["Nearly every city has a wedding planning guide of some sort.  If you're in a smaller town, you might just call the local tourism/visitors bureau.  They'll have directories of hotels and other special event venues.  That's the best place to start, because once you have a place and a date, the rest is easy! If you need guidance beyond that, ask friends in the area for ideas.  You might think about hiring a coordinator just to help with day-of execution of the event (so you'd pay a set fee instead of a percentage) and that could include some up-front consulting which could help you find a great venue. My wife and I did all the planning ourselves, but had a coordinator help us on the wedding day, allowing us to enjoy the event as guests and not as hosts.  After a few frustrating weeks, she (the coordinator) did find us a great location, and everything was MUCH simpler after that. If you don't want to do that, you can also ask other wedding-related vendors that you're looking into (photographers, DJs, bands, bakeries, etc.) for their suggestions.  They've probably worked at ALL of them in the area, so are a wealth of relatively unbiased knowledge. The next step (as you're finalizing a date) is to make sure that you can get any of the other 'non-negotiable' services for that day.  Like the officiant.  If you have someone specific in mind, make sure he or she is available that day. There are lots of bands, DJs, cake bakers, photographers, videographers, etc., etc. that can be booked later in the process.  (Unless you must have a specific one... check with them at the front end, too!)

It seems that if a woman has the natural desire to stay home and raise her children they look at you like you are lazy and stupid or brainwashed by a male dominated society.   A woman who is a homemaker has a very important job and that is raising children to become good adults and members of society.  I actually have two degrees, and made very good money for myself when I was single.  However, when I had a baby, I felt the natural urge to be home with my baby....to take care of her and teach her.
