I started knitting the sweater anyway, and after knitting a few rows, I had my mom critique it, and she showed me something that I was doing wrong.  So I ripped the rows out and started all over again.  I'll never forget the look of joy on my Dad's face when he opened my gift and saw I that I had made him the sweater in his favorite shade of blue. ", 6694, "PM7KcE4caa", 2],

Make sure to thread the machine with the pressure foot UP.    Make sure to pull the bobbing thread up and leave a tail behind the needle. Do the same with the top thread. Hang on to these tails for the first few stitches.  Another problem may be it needs a tune up. You will need to learn how to oil this machine.  I have sewn on a treadle sewing machine, but mine had dog feeds. The machine had “teeth” under the needle that fed the fabric through. I found sewing with an even speed and stopping tricky.  I would actually turn the hand wheel by hand to start off the first few stitches.

I assume the issues you've having are the results of the same problems electric machines can have. When the fabric ruffles or gathers, it's a thread tension issue, usually too much bobbin tension. When the thread tangles, often it's because you failed to hold the ends as you started stitching, or the bobbin is not installed correctly.
