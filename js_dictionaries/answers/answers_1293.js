Her primary function was to preside over reproduction, ensuring the survival of the community. She was also the patroness of smithcraft and the mechanical arts and was married to Hephaestus, the most famous craftsman of all. However, she do not hate beautiful people- that's Hera, Zeus' wife. Cupid or Eros is Aphrodites godling son (he was married to Psyche). She makes people love her because that's her job- to make love and inspire others to do the same. Does she control her powers? Aphrodite has no significant power; whenever she wants somebody to fall in-love with somebody, she asks her son Cupid (that is Eros) to do it, and pierce hearts with his bow and arrow. Her beauty is doubtless true but wether shes the most beautiful among the Olympian gods is a big question. Remember how the Trojan War started? Three goddesses were left vying for beauty- Aphrodite, Athena and Hera. At that time, Paris, the Trojan prince was the best judge of beauty in the world. Hera offerred him riches, Athena wisdom and valor in arms and Aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman in the world. Being a prince and taught by the best of scholars, Paris has no longer a need for riches and wisdom so he proclaimed Aphrodite as the most beautiful goddess to which she helped him abduct Helen of Troy for his own. interesting! for further readings:", 8541, "None", 1],

Is your Public Defender any smarter than you are, or do you just not know you're supposed to talk to him/her and ask questions? Given you're recounting of the incident, I have a strong suspicion you're leaving 90% of the facts surrounding the \"who, what, when, where, why and how\" out of your story telling.  \"Long story short\": <---Your words. This tells me you're intentionally leaving key components of what actually took place out of the story in order to manipulate the facts.Theres a lot to this story you don't want people to know. Why is it I get the impression you were being actively pursued subsequent to committing a crime?  Why is it I have the impression the officer knew for fact you were within the residence and were refusing to exit the house? Obviously YOU had a reason why you didn't want to come out initially. Why is it I get the impression you knew other officers were staging around the exterior of the house, so you decided it might be best to go meet the officer at the front door after all? With your time element of remaining in the house, who knows what you could have been doing, or who else inside the house was involved? Given the circumstance, of course the rest of the crew is coming in. Yet you want to blame the cops for your unwillingness to cooperate? Officer met you at the door with what you claim was a stance assuming a fighting position. Could it be you've a previous history of being combative or resistive?   So the officers enter and you got rat packed (yes...as in hood rat), in the process. According to you...you did absolutely nothing wrong. Glasses don't normally get broken unless something caused it. If you do anything to prevent the cuffs from being applied to you, that's resisting. If you failed to obey orders, that's resisting.  If you strike an officer,even unintentionally during any course of actions being taken against you it's battery! Never told you you were arrested?  I'm quite certain you were not only informed you were under arrest at the time, but knew they were coming for you even before they arrived. It's amazing what people don't hear when they're panicking. Once you were taken in for booking, you were informed of all charges. Pure, plain and simple.
