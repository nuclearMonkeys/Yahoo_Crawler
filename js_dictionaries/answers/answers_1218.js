In Gnosticism the serpent represents wisdom for this world and all that is in it that are conscious are in that belief system the creation of the false God..the demiurge. Humanity was created to become a slave race to this God and the spirit of Sophia who emanated the abortion who created the world in the form of the serpent opened the eyes of Adam and Eve who represent the human condition and for that we have the myth of original sin and the subsequent death of all who are brought here by the carnal act...you and I and everyone else. You have to understand that the compilers of the bible were not that clever for in Genesis we hear this omniscient and omnipotent God say..the man and woman have become like US....who exactly is this God speaking too? This question has troubled theologians since it was understood and literal orthodox Christianity had to create a system were to question the bible makes the questioner a heretic. Look at some of the comments left for you to decipher.once again you are being judged and the whole point of Christianity is to not judge.

Which is a shame, our forces are disintegrating before our noses.  As for the USA, they also had a cut of 100k did they not ?, regardless of budgets they will always need service men with good experience, you mention you have a good performance, that will help when it comes to selecting who is best/worth while retaining in cuts. In the meantime just keep on top of your game, and don't let the cuts worry you TOO much. They will be in favor of keeping you  until retirement as long as you maintain a good reputation and do your job both professionally and confidently.  I'm constantly worried for my job, compared to the states, my country has a small armed forces and a cut of 3000 is devastating, especially when there is no jobs anywhere else.

Squeeze your thumb and fingers together and hold.  Relax your body.
