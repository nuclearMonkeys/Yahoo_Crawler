You may feel more sensitive to people's remarks due to your depression. Take one step at a time. The first step would be to see a counselor. If you can't afford one call a helpline. Sounds like you need to break free from your family but you'll need to get a small job first. With the Covid pandemic it might be difficult to get a job or make much progress but keep patience and courage, things will get better once you're financially independent.

	36765 : ["It's more paranoia than schizo. Sometimes when people are extremely nervous/anxious/stressed they start hearing/seeing things that become distorted. Ex: people who are scared of the dark and believe in ghosts could easily mistake a coat rack to be a ghost....or a pipe creak to be a ghost. Stress does all bad things to the body. You were paranoid because you knew you weren't supposed to be there so you got anxious. This is common for most people. Don't think you're going crazy. Stress just messes up the body in various ways. ", 5494, "DP354Sgqaa", 3],

But being selfish and spreading yourself between them is how you destroy lives and **** up families. You're infatuated. Deal with your issues. I have OCD too but I would never blame that for turning impulses into actions. If you sleep with your husband's brother it's not about OCD. it's about your character. Are you prepared to allow your husband to sleep with one of your family members or closest friends? If you found out he did would you be okay with that? If the answer is no then you know straight up that what you are obsessing over is ******* wrong. And if it is something you would be okay with then talk to your HUSBAND and find out how HE feels about you BOTH sleeping with others. Then work out the rules you guys agree on surrounding the whole thing and don't act upon anything until you have come to full understanding and agreements between you both. And verify that you have reached the conclusion prior to doing anything as well. But if he does not agree. DO NOT CHEAT! Don't **** up another person for some pleasure its not worth the damage you will cause. If you are not satisfied with not sleeping around and he doesn't agree to the pair of you sleeping with others then get a divorce. Do things the right way. Honor your vowels.", 5488, "None", 0],
	36769 : ["This depends on a lot. Is the guy you're interested in able to keep it discreet?  You have to know 100% that he's not a rat, Most people have sex outside of a marriage, and become overwhelmed with guilt, then they talk and make matters catastrophically worse.  Does he feel the same way about you? Don't let most of these people fool you, they get angry and throw all kinds of hate your way, when they know that they have felt the same way you do.  Sex and living out normal fantasy isn't a disgusting thing.  Prudes are hiding the most dirty, sexual thoughts ever.  Prudes get angry at people when they're doing or did the exact same thing, or even worse.  They just wish they were as open as you are.    Look. We all have these feelings and it's not bad, it's natural.  If It happens, it happens. The less people that know about it, the better.  Think, we could die at any moment. Make the most of your life. If it's any consolation, I had sex with my gf's cousin in the heat of the moment about 7 years ago, and it was awesome.  We both agreed to keep it secret, and are pretty comfortable with it.  Every once in a great while, we'll hook up for sex.  It doesn't mean that I don't love my gf, because I do.  But sex with her is \"making love.\"  Sex with her cousin is just something that feels good, and relieves stress.  Sometimes we have dinner with her cousin and her bf, it it's perfectly fine.  No one knows anything.  If you hook up with him, Afterwards, around people, just act normal, no long eye contact, but don't avoid eye contact either.  Just act like he's your sister or brother of something when you're around others.  Remember, what you're husband don't know, won't hurt him.  it's not for everyone, you have to find that out for yourself.  Think about Mormon's. One man has multiple wives.  So, ??? Btw, I can't stand prudes. They the worst people ever. Never take advice from a prude.  They have lots of skeleton's in their closet, and are very untrustworthy. ", 5488, "S19ftKPsaa", -2],

	36778 : ["The thought of suicide ought to make someone cry because of the amount of pain and sadness that suicide needlessly creates for those who have to deal with the aftermath. But whether it makes someone cry isn't really an important question - it's more important to focus on the underlying problems and how to address them. It seems to me like one of your problems may be too much self-pity and unproductive self-judgement. Instead of focusing so much on what you don't like about yourself, focus more on what your duties are and what God has created you to be. And if there are sins that you actually need to judge yourself for, then confess them, seek God's forgiveness and then put them behind you. But don't beat yourself up over things that aren't even sins but merely your own lack of talent or ability in some particular aspect of life, because those sorts of things are your character, not your fault.", 5495, "4XhuU7DWaa", 0],

When I first read your post I assumed that your MIL wanted to throw you a second shower, which really is a nice thing for her to do. She's excited about becoming a grandmother and wants to share the event in a more private setting. But rereading your post it seems that she isn't attending the shower at your mothers house ( the main shower) and that's just an odd thing for her to do.  If I were you I'd let it go. Reacting is only going to cause her to fuel the situation. Your husband is not going to take sides. Even though I'm sure he wants to side with you, he is not going to upset his mother ( men are cowards- they disappoint us all the time, get use to it)  I would send out an invitation to MIL, if she shows , she shows.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether.
