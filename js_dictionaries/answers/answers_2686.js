	140179 : ["about 30% of what you said is actually true. Most of it isnt.  The real deal:  what led to the sale of TNA 1. The Jarretts lost their finacial backer and couldnt afford to put on any shows.  2. Dixie Carter already become part owner of a multi million dollar company that had TNA as a client.  3. Jeff went to Dixie to tell her the bad news and that if they couldnt find a new backer they would have to shut down TNA.  4. Dixie went to her father Robert Carter who owns the company Panda Energy and asked for his help. She laid out a business plan and it was Robert Carter who decided that the wreslting industry needed to major companies. That every Pepsi needed a Coke, every Burger King needs a McDonalds. Competition breeds success.  5. Robert Carter bought 70% of TNA and made his daughter the President and CEO of TNA Wrestling aka TNA Entertainment  6. Part of the deal was that since Dixie lacked \"wrestling experience\" that TNA would retain Jeff Jarrett as Vice -President and head of creative. He was allowed to keep his 30% ownership. However, as majority owners the Carters do have the right to buy him out and time they wish or send him home and make him a silent partner.  7. Robert Carter led by his daughter Dixie saved TNA from going under. Robert Carter also sent some of his top executives from Panda Energy (a very successful company mind you) to TNA to help Dixie run the day to day operations.  8. Robert Carter then gave TNA 6 million dollars to bring the product \"up to date\" and improve production costs. At that point TNA was operating at a loss. Less than a year later TNA not only started making a profit but they also paid back the 6 million dollars plus interest to Robert Carter and Panda Energy, thus removing TNA from the Panda Energy Umbrella. TNA now was officially on it's own. Although, Robert Carter is still the owner and is a extremly rich man, he has not had to put any more money into TNA since that first year. TNA has continued to grow so much and so fast and is running on profit.  9. Dixie Carter is not a gold digger. She is a successful business woman. Who has successfully owned and operated two large companies in the entertainment industry. She is the daughter of mega rich parents. She was rich before her dad bought TNA.  10. The McMahons are not one of the wealthiest familys in the United States. As a matter of fact Vince McMahon hasnt even been a Billionaire since 2001. Back in 2001 the WWE/Vince worth 1 billion dollars. However today Vince who actually only owns 60% of the WWE is worth less than 300 million. The WWE alone is worth 460 million. A dramitic drop from the 1 billion dollar mark. Also, the WWE has been steadily losing millions a year, about 60 million a year to be exact. But they scew numbers and move the Wrestlemania earnings to one quarter or another to help blur that fact. Simple truth is numbers dont lie and the WWE has been in a free fall for sometime now and they dont seem to be able to get out of it.  Also, I wouldnt get to over on Vince McMahon being raised in the business. For one Vince wasnt around the business until after he left the trailer park he lived in (YES, Vince McMahon used to live in a trailer park until he was about 19 years old). Vince was not rich but his real father was wealthy.  Jarrett / Angle - Jeff Jarrett had a affair with Karen Angle while she was still married to Kurt. Kurt openly talked about this on the howard stern show when he said that his wife would tell him she was going out with some of the knockouts and would instead go meet a TNA employee/talent and they were having a affair. He then confirmed later that it was Jeff Jarrett but since he was the VP of TNA at the time he was worried Jarrett would try and bury him. Kurt is now divorced and Jeff and Karen are still together. Does this have anything to do with TNA? HELL YES IT DOES. Your boss, should respect his workers enough NOT to have a affair with their wifes. You should feel comfortible to be able to bring your wife and kids to the show and not have Jarrett try and hook up with her. Jarretts actions had a negative impact on TNA and there for he should be kicked to the curb.  If it's Jeff Jarrett or Kurt Angle - I pick Angle everytime.  Besides that, It was Jeff Jarrett that released Petey Williams, Sonjay Dutt, Senshi, Jimmy Rave, Jerry Lynn and Austin Ayres. It was Jarrett that let Gail Kim go. Jarrett who fired Rudy Charles and Shane Sewell as refs. Jarret who fired Scott D'Amore.  Jarrett has been butting heads with Dixie Carter for over a year now.  The talent in TNA arent complaining about Jarrett being removed from power. That alone speaks volumes.  Also, I have to say the last month of Impacts thathave been created by Dixie's new creative team and her final tweek and approval has been much better than the Jarrett led IMPACTS.  Dixie Carter is living proof that you dont have to have the last name McMahon to be successful in the wrestling industry.", 11449, "AA10043476", 2],
