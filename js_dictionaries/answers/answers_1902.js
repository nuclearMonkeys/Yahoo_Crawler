I quit months before Age of Conan came out, hyped that up, I even bought a new laptop for it. In the end, graphics and non-end game content was great. But, the dealbreaker for me was the terrible community. It was nothing like wow. as for Warhammer online, i predict it won't do as well.

	100848 : ["Well here's a few guidlines.  Instead of eating 3 large meals a day, break it up into lets say 6 or 7. That way it's like you are always snacking.   Eat only REAL food nonna that boxed shiit  or outside shiit the best shiit to eat is some homecooked meal w/o the presence of anything white (no white bread, white pasta, potato, etc) & snack on nuts, veggies, & fruit. Raw veggies are greaaaatt. Stock up on ur favorites & have thm alongside your small meals to help bulk it up & bulk up the nutrients as well.  I generally eat 3 smalll meals & snack on other smalll meals thruout the day. That way i feel satisfied & it makes me eat less chips & cheese puffs & snacks that are salty that taste like food ya kno. Soup is great great but NEVER eat it out of a can. I used to eat canned chili all the time so imma hypocrite but if you do eat the canned or outside soups kno that amount msg, fat, & salt they probably contain is in mass amounts.  Also, get moving. You dont havta have a gym membership or do excersize however if you do get into the habit it will be real healthy. When i say get movin i mean walk walk walk & again, dont be afraid of walking. What i normally do is either walk to somewhere i wanna go if it's walking distance, or ill park somewhere that does not open a car door straight into the place youre going. If theres a hill. park on top of it, if theres anoverflow lot, park in it, if there's a shady stop like hella days away from the store, go for it! Dont be afraid to park farther & walk a lil. :)  If you are like me & must much all the time or have food or something ...sip on tea. Tea is a great alternative to like drinking juice or soda or eating food. Plus it's really enjoyable. I loveeeee a cupppa tea :) mmmm You should love your body. Ten pounds is nothing. i gained like 15/20 since i moved here like 4 months ago but i still love my body. i actually feel more healthy than i did before because i excersize now. I will be honest tho i have never even payed attention to my body till i lost some noticable amount of weight by accident a while ago & like ever since moving ive been kinna like obsessing over being skinny like i was...like not obsessing but for me its really weird that i think about the desire to be thin now cause honestly i have never even cared at all. Like seriously iim not even exaggerating i loved the way i looked. Even tho i hadda tummy i loved my body & thought it a great gift that i can eat w/e the eff i want & not be fat. Like chubby maybe but not fat. Like i still consider it a blessing cause i eat soo much & i am still like normal wieght idk what my problem is tho...they say when you get a taste of something then you crave it ya kno. Like i wanna be skinny cause i think clothes fit better that way but i dont hate my body the way it is i still love it for all it does for me & how beautiful it is. ... i weight about 125-130 depending on the day. it's not bad at all.  The true beauty in your body has not yet been discovered by you you see. That's the issue with many people. You have to really just take off all your clothes & stand in fronna a mirror & observe your body...every curve, ever bone, every part thats meaty or love handle or w/e you have. You must see how artful it is, how beautiful...How cool it is to be a women & have a body that is ment to accomplish so much. You have to love it & therefore nurish it with real foods like veggies & give it the daily movin it needs. Not to fill it with toxins & packaged drugs & spike it with sugar & crap ya kno.  Once you look in the mirror at you naked body see the beatiful parts Only, you focus on those. Like for example i really like my bones the ones on the side like the hips or w/e.... & like the other bones right under the neck...so i focus on those. Like my hip bones used to stick out kinna & now they dont anymore but what i like to do is lay down on the ground & play with them cause they still stick out when i lay down. Feel your body & it will talk to you & tell you what it needs, then work towards that. If you love your body then so will your boyfriend. If you are unconfident & doubt your body then it may make him doubt it as well...not because it's flawed, but because you are not appreciating it...but no worries, im sure he loves you the way you are. thats why he's with you & not some other chick :) Ive got some love handles to work on, so imma go do some crunches now...hehehe   Night", 9760, "cCWa3a1Vaa", 6],
	100849 : ["Chloe, I am very empathetic toward your situation. Here's what I would do and am kinda doing myself but I will try and keep this idea simple and cheap: 1. This is a 3 front war----a) less calories in b) more calories out c) change your brain.      a. Check what you eat sometimes we fall into very casually bad habits and a minor change can make a big difference.I simply stopped buying high calories snacks at the store so they are never laying around. I buy healthy snacks.Also contrary to what your Mother told you you should not feel compelled to \"Eat everything on your plate\". This is like the worst advice ever.      b. I have found going to the gym (there are a lot of inexpensive ones and don't get a long term contract one) is PRIMARILY MOTIVATIONAL. Tell your boy friend you are going to start going to the gym to get in shape. He will be impressed. Also when you go to the gym and see all these people working out, you kind of get into it and it is fun and slowly your energy will start to increase.       c. Tell your brain, you are now a workout person, turn of the TV and computer, get off the couch and GO. The first time is the hardest, then it becomes easier and a good habit.Take it nice and EZ at first and don't hurt yourself over doing it initially. In 90 days you will be a new person, feel great, be full of energy and have a second boy friend. You can never have too many, you know !!!!!", 9760, "72f802b5a9052f334cc57c6950295e3caa", 2],

	100852 : ["This question is awfully hard to answer without lifestyle details, however, it definitly seems that you have a pretty bad case of insomnia. While Im not an insomniac, my friend used to be and he would just not sleep for a couple days and then just collapse. The norm of what you can do is take sleeping pills, avoid caffiene consumption, and try incest in your pillow or something like that. If you have a stressful lifestyle then you should pickup meditation to get rid of it and allow sleep. A visit of the family practitioner is also something you should do. Now what my friend did was he searched up the internet after being on pills for awhile and found \"brainwave technology\" soundtracks, now I dont know if it was something about him that built well with this but the result was that he essentially \"cured\" insomnia.  But anyways, my advice is  1. Do simple lifestyle changes (no caffiene, no eating past 6, maybe a warm bath, get relaxed, etc.) 2. Try meditation or yoga if you're stressful 3. See a Doctor 4. Try \"brainwave technology\" , I only know that it worked for my friend, but I also belive it has a 60 day guarantee.", 9757, "Rj2WnCdraa", 0],

Hello, just wanted to let you know of a miracle pill that puts you to sleep, available over the counter, is actually very very beneficial for your health, the health of your brain and is only 3 bucks!! I had trouble falling asleep for years. I would lay in bed, and think and think and think for hours before I could fall asleep. It was literally driving me crazy!!  I had tried every over the counter sleeping pill on the market and nothing helped. I turned to Nyquil and that did the trick. I had been drinking Nyquil almost every night to go to sleep until I stumbled upon this miracle sanity saving nutritional supplement named MELATONIN. And you can buy it at any GNC health food store. I advocate GNC because the melatonin they use goes through 85 different quality checks before its bottled. Buy the sublingual melatonin. The kind that dissolves underneath your tongue tastes like cherries and it's good for you!! If you have any questions before you buy it the sales associate at GNC should be able to answer any questions you have. It comes in 1 mg, I take 2 right before bed. The only side effects are weird dreams for the first two nights if any at all. Should be taken at regular bedtimes in the evening.  God Bless P.S. after you try it and it works don't forget to tell others about it. You could be saving someone else's Sanity", 9757, "5rsN7VsUaa", 0],
