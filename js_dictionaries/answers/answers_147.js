I just had a zoom assessment where ALL of the assessors were white men and white women, while about half of the candidates(including myself) were non-white. There was an equal number of assessors to candidates ratio. By 'giving minorities a chance at interviews' they can say \"look we are following government guidelines but none of the minority candidates were suitable so we had to give the roles to the white candidates\", I can see that is the case by the fact that ALL of the employees involved in the assessment were white.

	7357 : ["How is this discrimination to open the hiring pool? Are white men so bad at everything they have to be protected from all others not them or in their delicate little group? Wow.

	7358 : ["Miscarried = aborted = killed by contraceptives = kids who are now burning in hell because they're not baptized; Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayer to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save these babies (who were aborted, or miscarried, or killed contraceptives) from hell; basically, the prayer asks John the Baptist to baptize them and greatmartyr Barbara to give them body and blood of Jesus; if you pray this prayer diligently every day, then aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons; painted nails = aborted kids in this family; these kids need to be rescued from hell. Contraceptives = abortion; using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids. Miscarriages happen because of high heels (as weight pushes down and baby falls out); cesarean happens because of pants as hips are too tight (second generation cesarean will be infertile). Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chipped using IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Aborted kids burn in hell. Stop being selfish. Deliver the kid at home because doctors chip kids in hospitals (usually in the forehead). Ultrasound is evil (baby's DNA is scraped from foot and sent to the BEAST Computer) because it makes the baby demon possessed. Basically, avoid doctors. Deliver at home.", 1189, "None", -1],

Remember there's shipping costs involved then.  You need to give us more information,  it's impossible to quote you anything.  I did a print run of 200 at Office Depot, of my comics, 40 pages,  softcover,  double sided and printed in black and white.   I did the stapling.  Anything over 50 sets and they gave me a discount.   It came to $1.48 per unit, my retail price was $5.  Usually the more copies you get,  the lower the price per unit.", 1190, "IRaIxWJKaa", 4],

	7367 : ["In the US \"rape laws\" are not sexist against men but in some places policies on how to handle sexual assault are. Know the difference.

	7368 : ["\"How are rape laws sexist against men...?\" Rape laws in general work on the gynocentric principle where female sexuality is given a much higher value than men's sexuality, which is feared, denigrated and criminalized at much lower thresholds. This might be fine if we didn't claim to live in a society that was based on equality.  And we do very often make some strange rulings and impositions under the name of equality.  But when it comes to rape and most other feminist sensitive issues, equality goes out the window as if there is no such thing. .", 1187, "aSm9xSn3aa", 3],

A lot of Biden administration policies violate the civil rights Act. The left won't admit this. But they also expect equality of outcome. Any inequality in outcome is due to racism and sexism. They will continue to discriminate against white men (and also white women) until the outcomes are equal.  If Whites are underrepresented in a field, that's considered “progress”.

	7384 : ["It really depends on the script.   The writing style can be unrealistic and thus one is constantly reminded that they are acting out a fantasy. Most actors have the experience of actually living the the story when they are in a show that is realistic and has emotional depth.  For the most part we still know we are acting.   If we are lucky we have transcendental moments when everything works together to take us out of the \"play\" and allows us to \"live the moment.\"    Those times are a gift and we take joy in being able to experience them as the pinnacle of why we got into acting in the first place.", 1194, "f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa", 6],

	7386 : ["You get an agent once you have demonstrated that you have the talent, training, experience and temperament to book professional, paying jobs.  It's not like you're guaranteed an agent after some set number of years of training. Legitimate agents are paid a percentage of what an actor makes.  (Never pay an agent up front.). Which means you can't just hire an agent, it's more like they choose you.  And since they only make money if an actor books a professional paying job, they are very picky about who they take on as clients.  And they can be picky because there are a lot more people wanting to be actors then there are roles.  It is show business.  People are in it to make money, not make your dreams come true. The best way to get an agent it through networking.  If you can impress a respected instructor or some other industry professional, they may be willing to refer you to an agent.  That's why quality classes are helpful - they are one way to start to network in addition to improving your skills.  But getting an agent is just one part of attempting a professional.  Agents submit you for jobs and negotiate contracts but they do not run your career.  That's up to you.  You need to understand things like the casting process, legal issues (contracts, unions, taxes); marketing (head shot, resume, show reel, website, social media), networking and the like.  Attempting a professional acting career is like starting and running a business where you are the product being marketed and sold. So make sure you understand the business end of the industry.  Scams and rip offs prey on people who mistakenly think people are just “discovered” and given an acting career.", 1195, "4dIdBbOhaa", 2],
