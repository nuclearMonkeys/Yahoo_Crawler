	108560 : ["To make it quick, you don't remove the hook if the fish swallowed it. This means if the hook is in it's throat, just cut the line and release the fish, The hook will be naturally disgorged by the fish or will dissolve on it's own within days.  No harm to the fish.  If the hook is deep in it's mouth but not the throat, you can use a simple hook dislodger and then release the fish. If the hook is obviously stuck around the gill area, this will be a 50/50 situation and it's just best to cut the line and release the fish with as little handling as possible. This is true with all applications of \" J' hooks. Maybe you'd like to try circle hooks, they catch most fish by the jaw. No need to set the hook, just keep a tight line and reel 'em in, the fish hooks itself.  You also mentioned \"sunny's.\"  I'm not sure if they make circle hooks that small but you may want to use, \" J\" hooks with long shanks. This will help you to remove the hook easier . Another thing is to keep your eyes on the line. To prevent a fish from swallowing a hook is to know when to set the hook. When you feel pressure on the line, 3-5  seconds after the bobber/float goes under or when the line starts moving on it's own. You'll get a feel for it the more you fish, it's all about practice because practice makes perfect. ; ) ~good luck catchin'.", 10060, "BK1GjPT6aa", 1],
	108561 : ["The above answers are all great advice. I would also recommend this tool. What you have is a tool with a small ball at one end and a big ball at another end. Which ball you used is depending on the size of the fish.Along the shaft there's a cut out for the line to be inserted to. Here is how to use this tool. 1.Insert the ball into the mouth of the fish. 2. Grab the line and insert it into the slit of the shaft. 3. Using the line as a guide push the tool towards the hook while keeping the line taught,. 4. Push down on the tool and pull up lightly on the line.  If you do it right the hook will be pushed out of the fish and will enter an empty cavity in the ball. Keep the line and hook in the tool while you pull it out of the fish. When you get good at doing this it will benefit both you and the fish. It takes a few tries to but is well worth it. Good Luck", 10060, "FJ1DpE3baa", 0],

If your mate or partner or wife, bf, whatever does not want to sit down and talk to you, it can be a sign that he/she is choosing to ignore the problem instead of addressing it.  You don't want to force the issue, though.  Try taking some time out for yourselves, almost schedule it if you need to with that partner.  You cannot be the pillar of strength in the relationship if you  aren't getting the support that you need from your partner, and you cannot be emotionally strong for both of you either.  Being strong for you is his job, and you for him is yours.  Sometimes, even sitting down and writing a hand-written letter works too.  (My ex-wife ignored me completely, and chose to be with many other men.)  I tried sitting down and talking to her, but she told me that she was lonlier with me than if she was alone.  If talking to him/her does not work, than it may be time to count your losses and try to get out while you have the strength and sanity to do so.  I had to cut my losses and opt for a divorce while I was still strong enough to do so.  A girlfriend that I had was the same way, and finally I had to sit down with her and talk through it, and try to sort things out.  She became very beligerent and blameful, and I knew that it was at an end.  Be stong for yourself, and for your kids.  I wish you the best of luck in this trying time.

	108571 : ["Your hip is one of the major joints of your body where your thigh bone meets your pelvis bone. The hips are also known as ball-and-socket joints and that's because the ball-like top of your thigh bone moves within a cup-like space in your pelvis. In fact, in the hip joint, the head of the thigh bone swivels in a socket made up of pelvic bones, called the acetabulum. While there can be many reasons of hip pain as it can arise from the joint itself. There are several structures as well that surrounds the hip that can also be the source of pain. When they are healthy, they are considered as one of the strong parts of body, but playing sports, running or falling at times lead to serious hip or bone injuries. Trauma is more often the major cause of pain in hip bones, but at the same time there are also many source of inflammation that may cause pain in the hip area as well. If we talk in terms of hip bone problems then there is several bone disease as well, such as: Avascular Necrosis - It basically involves the loss of bone caused by insufficient blood supply, injury, and may lead to breakdown of the hip joint. Bursitis - In this condition, the bursa, which is basically a closed fluid-filled sac and functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body, becomes inflamed. And, this in turn results in the stiffness and pain around the hip joint. Arthritis - It is the most common cause of the breakdown of hip tissue. One of the major kinds of arthritis that commonly affect the hip is osteoarthritis. It is basically referred to as \"wear and tear\" arthritis. It is one of the types of arthritis that normally involves the cartilage that cushions the bones of the hip wearing away, which results in rubbing of bones together and ultimately causes the hip pain and stiffness. There are several ways of treating these hip bone problems. The treatment of bursitis largely depends on whether it involves any infection or not. If it is noninfectious then it can be treated with ice compresses, and antiinflammatory along with pain medications. Adding to this, the hip bursitis can also be treated by stretching exercises. Sometimes physical-therapy programs can also be helpful. Anti-Inflammatory medication is another treatment procedure that can help you in decreasing the hip pain and swelling at areas of inflammation. However, if the oral medications are not sufficient then the injection of cortisone can also be considered. The hip bone, is also called the coxal bone, and is one of the key bones that are primarily required for easy mobility. Unlike any other part of the body, it too can be liable to a number of problems that may make any simplest activity more agonizing, but with proper treatment and exercise one can easily overcome from it. Bone Injuries Bone Health Information Guide about symptoms, causes and treatment of various bone injuries for protection of your physical health from various bone diseases. Arthritis Treatments and Exercise Arthritis Treatment Arthritis is a swollen and inflammatory condition of the joints. This can cause swelling, pain and stiffness of joints and may affect other body parts like bones and muscles.
