Ron Paul supporters, such as yourself, are the only ones complaining because you want your guy to get excessive attention so he has a chance at winning.  That's fine for you and I would have no problem with him getting media attention, but why should conservatives complain over him not getting excessive attention as opposed to any of the other candidates not getting excessive attention?

The thing is...Ron Paul, while he has some hardcore supporters, has beliefs that this country just won't go for. We like Social Security, for example - and he wants to end it.  Most of us think it's not okay for a business that's open to the public to put a “Whites Only” sign in the window, and we believe that there should be a law against it.  We have that now - Paul doesn't agree. Oh, and Jon Stewart covered the lame coverage Ron Paul gets, too. Hm...now that I'm thinking about it, it feels like Fox News covers him the LEAST.

	82771 : ["Nope, we're just questioning the veracity of the scientific methods used to collect the data that supposedly proves global warming is happening, and we're also questioning the accuracy of the data.  Don't sit there on your high-horse and say \"Global warming is happening, and anyone who doesn't believe it is an idiot.\"  That's the exact strategy employed by liberals -- instead of saying it's happening and supporting that assertion using tried and tested scientific methods that produce verifiable scientific results, the liberals play holier-than-thou and engage in puerile name-calling with anyone who disputes their position. Here's a classic example of what I'm talking about:  In 2000, one of the studies released that supposedly proved that global warming was happening showed an average temperature increase of 2.2 degrees over the last 20 years from 1,000 \"randomly selected\" locations all over the world.  Upon closer examination of the study, researchers found some interesting facts:  (1) The 1,000 randomly selected locations consisted of over 950 cities where the population was 100,000 people or more and no rural areas whatsoever.  (2) All 950 cities had experienced a population growth of at least 5% over the last 20 years -- some experienced a growth of over 100%.  (3) The temperature measurements were taken from the \"centers\" of these cities.  Now, let's employ some logic here.  We're talking primarily about urban areas that have grown over the last two decades when this study was taken, and when a city grows you add more people who produce what? (HEAT) and you add more vehicles with combustion engines that produce what? (HEAT) and you add more roads and buildings made of cement and concrete that absorb and hold what? (HEAT).  Are you starting to see why the naysayers are claiming that the so-called \"evidence\" trotted out by proponents of global warming is fundamentally flawed at best? Do yourself a favor and read Michael Crichton's \"State of Fear.\"  Not only will it open your eyes to the lies of environmentalism and the lengths to which environmentalists will go to \"prove\" their outlandish claims, it's also chock-full of studies and data that you can look up and confirm for yourself that DISPROVE the theory of global warming.", 9110, "ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa", 0],

The media is no longer in the business of reporting the news...they have been commisioned by those who own our mainstream politicians LIKE SLAVES to tell us what they want us to know, and that isn't much. Had Dr. Paul won the straw poll (he trailed winner Bachmann by 200 points, and led 3rd place Pawlenty by 2000), we would instead be hearing today how the straw poll isn't that significant. The mainstream media is as much an enemy to our republic today as a private bank which prints our money and controls our economy, with no official ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE having any say in the matter. WHAT DOES THIS DO? It SHOULD be letting us know WITHOUT A DOUBT now that the system is truly BROKEN. It SHOULD be making us suspicious of an Iowa Straw Poll result where the winner is considered one of the \"Three Front-Runners\"...a group that includes two candidates who finished with less than 1500 votes COMBINED, and at the same time DOESN'T INCLUDE the candidate who came in second trailing the winner by 200 votes.

	82798 : ["My guess is that the media would prefer to associate the Tea Party as a fundamentalist christian movement than a general movement towards limited government within the Republican Party, and has essentially succeeded at this point. It is easy to stir up fear among the majority of the democratic base and parts of the republican as well by showing video of Rick Perry leading are prayer group, or Michelle Bachmann's religious quotes, and then call them the top tier candidates. Ron Paul's stances on limiting government authority are not accompanied by heavy handed religious sentiment which makes him harder to demonize. As a result the media just doesn't cover anything he does. This results in a spiral where people who would like his message don't know about him and then support the 'top-tier' candidates.

	82802 : ["No, it really isn't important. The USA is virtually alone in the world with this requirement. The reason the requirement exists at all is because of the fears of the founding fathers. Go back to the 1780s. The USA was small and adrift amid a sea of larger predatory nations like France, Britain, Spain and others. The founders were afraid that a nation would infiltrate spies into America, and with superior financing, blackmail, bribery etc, position one of their own to take over the presidency. That's why they put the provision into the Constitution. You might say that's foolish, but remember, the president was (and still is) chosen by the Electoral College -- not by the people. So by controlling a handful of people such a scheme could have worked. The reason it's no longer a problem is that the presidency is no longer decided by a handful of electors. Moreover, there is such a long series of gauntlets to be run, first in the primaries and then in the general election, and the additional fact of a press corps that digs into every aspect of a candidate's life, it's impossible to conceive of a \"sleeper agent\" from another country taking over the presidency by stealth. It's actually an insult to naturalized Americans to say that they can't be trusted, if for no other reason, than that they are often far more patriotic and caring about America than natural born citizens (who take their country and its liberties for granted).
