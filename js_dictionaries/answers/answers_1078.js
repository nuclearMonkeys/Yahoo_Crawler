She might be thinking about you and thinks that you should not do what you are thinking to do, and the dead fish is a signal to you that, whatever you are thinking to do, do not do it.", 8246, "391fb23dafd355005ac7c816295c4b03aa", 0],
	59384 : ["The pool represents the Holy Spirit, your way to be surrounded by the presence of God, and an eternity in heaven. In the coming days it will be hard to be a Christian b/c there will be persecution. So finding your way to salvation through Christ will require a leap and a jump. These will be the days where it says: Matthew 24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. 10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. The dead fish represents lukewarm Christians. Jesus Christ cannot stand fake and lukewarm Christians. He died for all of them, but they are just Christians in pretense, so while they are a fish, they are dead. As it is written: Revelation 3:16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. Jesus has unimaginable things prepared in heaven, but it requires full surrender. That fish was supposed to be in the pool, but it is dying and rotting outside. The net are the distractions of this world. That includes, yes, the web, and of course the TV, social media, activities, selfish ambitions and everything else that keeps people from spending quality time with their Lord. So a dead fish in a net makes perfect sense. I hope and pray you will jump into the pool. Repent of your sins every day and ask Jesus into your heart every day. The only way you will go to heaven is if you are in that pool. That is the interpretation of your dream.", 8246, "VmpHIzM0aa", -2],

	59391 : ["1) What do you like about the R&S section of Yahoo Answers (if anything)? What is that draws you in here? My Ans: Gives me a chance to share the love and the word of God with others. I can use notes and studies that I have done throughout the years to respond to a lot of the questions especially about the summaries of the bible itself.  2) What is your age range?: a) 13-19; b) 20s; c) 30s; d) 40s; e) 50s; f) 60s; g) 70s; h) 80s My Ans: late 50s 3) What is your gender? a) male; b) female; c) transsexual/transgendered (probably no one here is; but we live in a diverse world)  My Ans: female 4) Are you a atheist, agnostic, pantheist, or theist (if so, are you a Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, etc.)? My Ans: I am a Christian. 5) Where do you base your morals/ethics from? (ie. society?; religion?; faith?; parents?; moral philosophy?; etc.) My Ans: religion, faith, and society. 6) Does talking about religion (yours or another religion) bore you or excite you? My Ans: it excites me because I love the Lord 7) What is your highest level of education and what did you study?  My Ans: General studies like English, History and Business Mgt  (Community College) and then I went to Bible College.  8) Do you think science is compatible with religion? Do they blend together in a compatible way? Or are do you believe that they operate as \"Nonoverlapping Magisteria\"? Or are they directly opposed and say different things and conflict with each other? Or what do you think? My Ans: Science can and has proved many of the events in the bible but not all. They can  blend together in a compatible way, however religion relies on prophecy, revelation and faith while science relies on observable, repeatable experiences. Therefore making some issues still debatable today especially about the universe, creation and health issues.  9) Do you know the basics about evolution (1st - 2nd year undergrad basics)? If the answer is yes, please BRIEFLY answer 1,2 or all 3 of the multiple choice questions(you don't have to go into full details - just say something that is pertinent to the question and shows some knowledge)? a) Do you know the difference between evolutionary psychology and evolutionary biology? If so, what is it? (not a arrogant question; I just want to see what knowledge base or what is going on the minds of the people here; this question also functions as a lie detector, if you will) Ans:  There is no difference between evolutionary psychology and sociobiology. Evolutionary psychology applies the same thinking to psychology. b) Is there a difference between sociobiology and evolutionary biology? If so, what is it? My Ans: Yes there are fundamental differences. Sociobiology is a synthesis of scientific disciplines which attempts to explain social behavior in animal species by considering the Darwinian advantages specific behaviors may have. Evolutionary biology is a sub-field of biology concerned with the origin of species from a common descent and descent of species, as well as their change, multiplication and diversity over time.  c) What is the difference between sympatric evolution and asymmetric evolution? My Ans: Deals with gene duplication that has different outcome. Asymmetric evolution (one copy evolves faster than the other) is usually seen as a signature of neo-functionalization. However Sympatric speciation does not require large-scale geographic distance to reduce gene flow between parts of a population.  10) Do people pick on you (mock/insult/etc.) because of your faith/religion/lack of religion? And/or do you pick on people because of their faith/religion/lack of religion? My Ans: No I try to avoid that whenever possible. I have not had any problems so far. I pick and choose what questions I want to answer.  11) Which country are you from? My Ans: USA", 8051, "None", 7],

If he appears again rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ, and call on the name of Jesus Christ. Satan wants your soul in hell and he uses these tactics to distract people away from the truth.

	59408 : ["I went to YouTube and I watched the videos from Mario Martinez, Mary Baxter and Bill Wiese. These people were in fact in hell for a short period of time for different reason, until the Lord brought them out and told them to warn the world. The experiences and the observations of these three people are very similar, although they went to different parts of hell and saw some different things.  Hell is shaped like a human being if you look at it from above and it keeps growing. It is located somewhere in the center of this earth. When people die they seem to fall through a black tunnel of sorts and as they descend they start hearing the screams of millions as flames become visible. There is no way out of there, and there are no second chances. I could not sleep without the lights on after seeing their testimonies. You can see it on their faces, they still feel horror just talking about it. Yes, I became a Christian and I read the Bible. I don't want to go there, and I wish with all of my heart that nobody goes there. This topic is not funny. The horror and terror in that place cannot be fathomed. If you have relatives, loved ones and friends that did not repent of their sins and receive Christ, they are on a train headed there. Your life on earth right now and right here is probably the only hope they have that someone will warn them. Show them those videos, and lead them to repentance.

Job 12:25 They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards. Psalm 105:28 He sent darkness and made the land dark— for had they not rebelled against his words? Isaiah 8:22 Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness. Jeremiah 13:16 Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings the darkness, before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it to utter darkness and change it to deep gloom. Did you happen to see the news talking about the plague of locusts that swept through East Africa recently? Google it. This is one of the plagues of Moses. ALL the plagues are coming back as God is warning people to repent because His judgments are coming, and one of those plagues that is coming is the \"three days of darkness\". Exodus 10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days. That darkness is unlike anything people are expecting. It is like going deep into a tourist cave looking at formations and the lights go off. We are talking pitch black. The Lord says it will be so strong that people will \"feel the darkness\". I have seen many prophesies saying that about that time the Lord will take people home, especially the kids. They will be here now, and then just gone. Why? To protect them. Because in that darkness hordes of demons will be doing their thing to people. They have been kept for that hour. I have seen many prophesies about this. Try going to YouTube and look for \"dream three days of darkness\". You had a prophetic dream, which means a dream that will happen and come true in the future. I can tell you what I have seen as instructions: 1) Repent of your sins constantly. Get right with Jesus. Walk in righteousness, for that plague of darkness is also touched in Matthew 24 and Revelation 6 and it is a manifestation of God's judgment.2) Stay in the house. Never open the door to anyone. 3) Cover your windows with blankets. Never look outside. 4) Have flashlights and candles ready. This darkness will pass after three days, but the world will not be the same anymore. Yes, many people will mock and make fun. They do not know God. They will be in panic when that happens. Repent of your sins. Satan did not repent of his sins and was judged. Any person that does not repent of his/her sins will follow Satan into the lake of fire. (read the Bible).
