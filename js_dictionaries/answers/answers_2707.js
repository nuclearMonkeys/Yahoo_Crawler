Given your location in the world, we know it will be N and W.  Then, we just have to look for a time when shifting the coordinates will convert Q and Z to N and W.  This occurs if you shift each letter back three places. That is, D -> A, E -> B, etc. DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ This same concept can be applied to the numbers: 4567890123 1234567890 Decrypting gives: N 46 30.819 W 87 24.766 For the second part, it sounds like you should read up on the pigpen cypher before you find stage #2. :) Happy caching!", 11498, "Km8hU4lgaa", 0],
	141207 : ["Yeah the zones haven't been consistent.... b/c of this innings are extended, pitchers are forced to throw down the pipe like you said, but also batters are off balance when the zone is inconsistent.   I also really miss when there used to be two different K zones fr the two different leagues... interleague has screwed this all up.  The AL used to be a fastball league with its smaller K zone and the NL used to be a breaking ball league with its larger K zone.  It used to be that a pitcher would get strikes called later in the game if he had been throwing good all game... he would expand teh zone... but this doesn't seem to be happening this year...  it seems that the zones have been very inconsistently called.", 11495, "frDcAqyWaa", 1],

MLB needs to step up and enforce a consistent strike zone guideline for umpires to stick to and call.", 11495, "GwawzO5Faa", 1],
	141209 : ["For the most part it has been crazy. I think what is happening is that guys are getting so good they are starting to make the zone tighter and tighter to make them earn that big paycheck they get every year. The thing that makes a good pitcher good is making a batter swing at a pitch regardless of ball or strike though. The argument could go both ways.", 11495, "5lMKA50Caa", 1],

I think we might figure out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll tootsie pop before we figure this one out. I work with online transgender support groups. I see people post pictures of romanian super models, yet have no idea what HRT is. The fact people feel the need to lie about it is beyond me. We live through it, most of us spend years researching it. We go through HRT, RLT, all the proper medical procedures, study and understand the HBSOC, and yet some feel were to stupid to know when someone is telling us a fabricated story. Even worse, get mad when we call them out on it. Just don't try to dig to deep into the mind of in idiot. Some peoples actions defy logic and when you try to make sense of idiotic behavior you tend to lose your mind.

Peculiarly, my name was picked out for me as John, because the amniocentesis said I was a boy - well, they aren't infallible.  People are weird, and will over-compensate, when they give a girl a 'boy's' name.  Silly to me, let the girl be herself!  No matter what, some kids will get stuck on a color, lol, and it's all over.  I recall when Barbie things came in blue - imagine that!! Sheesh, today, I can dress to the hilt in nylons and sexy black dress, and the guys will go ga-ga - and I simply feel Powerful over them.  But when I dress in jeans and a t-shirt, I'm on the same level, and still treated as one of the guys while we work on sports cars years later, with respect while we overhaul their engines, etc. Sexism is dying - people need to let the last tendrils of it go. just like the apron strings in the kitchen.  My big brother cooks a mean bbq, and that sounds great to me this coming weekend!  Oh, he went to a French chef's school, and can cook just about anything.

What you describe was a popular social belief during the 70's when the women's liberation started rolling.  However science did not support of those ideas.  In fact its been proved that maleness and femaleness is hardwired in the brain.   There are cases where a baby boy had his penis burned while circumcising.  \"Don't worry\" the doctors all believed that the baby should just be raised as a girl and he/she would never know the difference.  No True.  Although the parents did everything possible to raise him as a girl, the child still believed \"she\" was a \"he\".
