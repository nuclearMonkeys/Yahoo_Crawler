	136723 : ["Hell in a Cell - a cheap way of getting people actually interested in the match itself. As I've heard and you've mentioned, the crowd did chant boring towards HHH and Taker. This little feud hasn't appealed widely enough to warrant a further match. It's a drag on and people have noticed that.  With Michaels, it wasn't a drag on. They realized it was fresh for the 2 years they done it. This year, this 3rd time, it's all unlogical excuses as to why each one wanted / didn't want this match happening. Attitude Era was a timeframe that was only supposed to last 4 years, why drag that reason out for this match? HHH didn't want to face Taker because it would end an era that ended 11 years ago. The implication of not wanting to face Taker because he wasn't who he was anymore, doesn't make any sense whatsoever. With age comes experience and with experience, you bring out better matches with what you have. If anything, I believe the match will be great. The best match of HHH vs. Taker ever? Hell no, we've seen it before, there's nothing that's gonna be any different to the previous matches It'll have some elements of WM17 and last year, it'll be very similar to past matches because you can't teach an old dog new tricks as the saying goes.  BQ - To kill something that can't be killed at his frontline, it'll take something to put him away. I can see HHH hitting him with everything he has but I see some climatic ending where HHH loses, I don't think he'll win, and Taker doesn't walk on his own, similar to last year. It will have some sort of hinting of a retirement where you actually think 'Is Taker really done? Has he retired? Is this all one big joke?' I can see WWE booking it that way, to be honest", 11328, "None", 1],
	136724 : ["I think good and bad. I mean i rather have someone else face Taker(Like Kane) but since that's not gonna happen, im happy with the match being a Hell in a Cell Match but the match would be better if HBK was guest referee cause you wouldnt know if HBK would betray HHH due to a jealous thought of HHH actually beating Taker and that he couldnt or he could help his long time friend and maybe screw  Taker over or he could just call it clean. BQ: I dont think he will end the streak. To be honest, I would rather have someone like Kane end the streak but at this moment, Undertaker should stay undefeated and maybe retire undefeated.", 11328, "oU1tovubaa", 2],

	136728 : ["I think it's a very bad, bad decision. 1. Like I said, Triple H's ego is unmatched in history. It's official now that Triple H is worse than Hulk Hogan. And it will be even worse if he decided to end The Undertaker's Streak. I'm sick Triple H books himself in this match just to feed his ego, he even ignores WWE Fans who have said they don't want to see this match. 2. HIAC match would only be great if it were in Attitude Era/Ruthless Agression Era. Since we're now stuck in PG Era or whatever you call, where the show is dedicated for family/kids, HIAC match would be nowhere as good.  HIAC match is great not for technical/mat wrestling match. HIAC is great because for its violence and sadistic to end some of the most intense feud in WWE History. But, now HIAC is no longer the match it once was. But, with PG Era, look, HIAC matches from past 3 years (since 2009). HIAC is just another match for World Titles to be defended. HIAC matches can't be good without blood, brutality, and violence. PG Era would prevent Taker-Triple H HIAC WM 28 from being a great HIAC match. 3. The Undertaker vs HHH 3 is unlikely to top their previous two matches. Yeah, I'm sure Triple H and The Undertaker would be better in wrestling or brawling matches. Like I said, PG Era would prevent Taker-Triple H match at WM 28 being a great match. I think The Undertaker and Triple H would pull off a very good match, but definitely not as classic as their previous two matches. 4. The rivalry isn't big enough to be contested 3 times at WM. Not just that, facing the same man again just cheapen the credibility of The Streak. Screw you Triple H. 5. This match will forever be overshadowed by the dream match : John Cena vs The Rock at WM 28. BQ : I don't think so. If he does, than he's the worst man ever with the biggest ego. I think this is WWE's way of booking The Undertaker for his one final run. I don't think The Undertaker would just leave again after WM 28 and returns during Road to WM 29. I think The Undertaker will do one final run, maybe wrestling this summer. The Undertaker has been portrayed as a washed up has been, an old man who's getting weaker and weaker since 2010. I think this will be WWE's way to re-establish The Undertaker as The Phenom he once was. I believe The Undertaker would truly kick Triple H's @ss this time, destroys him. Later, he would return this year, wrestling during summer and build-up for his retirement angle @WM 29.", 11328, "kXrohLMjaa", 1],

	136738 : ["Firstly, although I know what you're talking about, it seems as if you're trying to say (based on the question) that Mark Henry was supposed to win. But, I also read that report. Undertaker, after such an amazing match with Kurt, felt a 5 star WrestleMania match could not be delivered with wrestlers from the current roster so he wanted The Streak to end on basically what was a definite legendary match.  BQ) Absolutely not, if he was going to end The Streak but then continue to wrestle in a rival company, TNA, that would be spitting on the offer. He won the accomplishment of ending the Streak and he could've taken that accomplishment over to TNA, where he often claimed he'll \"never work for Vince again\". BQ2: I don't believe so at all. Any new talent that could end the Streak is to at risk of being fired, suspended, or quitting for TNA (or any other promotion). They can't be trusted, they could do a Brock Lesnar - get hugely pushed and leave for a failed dream at NFL. Nobody should break Taker's streak, and that's that. Currently 19 years have been put into this Streak. All those video packages, all the matches, all the feuds, all the reason was because of and for the Streak. Without it, WrestleMania literally becomes another PPV. BQ3: I actually believe it is The Undertaker. Kurt Angle said in an interview that Undertaker is the most respected by the wrestlers, that for his size he's so capable, etc, and here is the link: And even Ric Flair talks about Undertaker, how HE was honoured to have Undertaker ask for a match: BQ4: I would have a Kurt Angle and Rob Van Dam feud, Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe feud (that was good several years ago) and probably an Angle and Hogan feud. Hogan hates to be out performed in the ring and when he is you can visually see the humiliation in his eyes.
