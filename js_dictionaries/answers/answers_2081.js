	109819 : ["The Old Testament was primarily written in Hebrew, and is still being used by people of the Jewish Faith.  As well the New Testament was written in Aramaic and Greek.  All of these languages are still known today, and there are still pieces of the original manuscripts available.  So people who translated the Bible knew these languages.  As well when switching from different versions such as the New World Version and New King James Version, these are just slight variations in the English language.  Basically modernizing the English used.  I hope I helped you a little.  I would like to leave you with one thing to think about... Historical Finds have ALWAYS proven the Bible to be accurate.

	109823 : ["Not too many oldies questions on here so this is a nice breath of fresh/oldies air. 1. I like hearing that version of Young Blood. I'm wondering if it's the original? The only version I'm familiar with is the one Leon Russel did for the Bangaladesh concert. I'll rate that a 9 since I love hearing original or older versions of songs. 2. That's a great song also and I'll rate Willie & the Handjive a 9. First time I heard that was from the movie Grease with John Travolta and that Australian chick, (memory getting feeble). 3. Jim Dandy isn't too bad but never really thought of it as an oldie? I'd rate that a 7 just because it was real popular by Black Oak Arkansas and they over-played it on the radio to the point where I was glad when they finally stopped. 4. Honey Hush, now that's what I'm talking about. I don't think I've ever heard that song and if I didn't get anything else out of your question that song makes it all worth while to stop by and check it out. I'm giving that a solid 10 because I love hearing new music. It reminds me of what I imagine is the birth of the rock and roll sound. Before guitars dominated rock and it seems to border on blues and a big band sound. I love hearing guitar rock but sometimes it just gets old real fast so hearing a sax take the solo with a rumbling piano holding the rhythm was awesome to hear. 5. Love both Bo & Throrogoods version of that song so I'm rating that a 9. 6. Love both of those versions too but Screamin' Jay Hawkins can't be beat for his cool video. Rate it a 10! 7. This is an awesome song and it really got me into The Who - Live At Leeds album. Rate it an 8. 8. First time I heard that version of the song. Pretty good! I like the CCR version with the extended jam better but it is nice to hear it in the original format. Rate it an 8. 9. My favorite version of I'm A Man was done by Muddy Waters titled Mannish Boy. Bo Diddley and others did an okay job but noone can hold a candle to Muddy Waters. I'm rating Bo's version a 6 because it just sounds real sterile and cleaned up where I like the rough raw version by Muddy. 10. I only know of Elmore James version of Dust My Broom and think it's great, rate it a 9. Elmore is like an electric version of another favorite musician of mine, Robert Johnson. Great question and songs Mike, thanks.", 10113, "None", 3],

	109833 : ["This is an excellent point.  Today, the only way to determine if the Bible is the word of God or not is if God Himself, through a living prophet, revealed it as such.  With so many uninspired scribes and intentionally dishonest monks having the Bible pass through their hands it is understandable that some parts have become corrupted over the ages.  Wouldn't it be helpful if a SECOND volume of holy scripture appeared, providing a second witness--if you will--to the truths that ARE preserved in the Bible.  A second witness that has not gone through dozens and dozens of translations by uninspired hands?   Well, what do you know?  Such a volume DOES exist.  The Book of Mormon IS a second witness for Jesus Christ and it DOES clarify doctrines that have been corrupted and changed through the intervention of uninspired men.  Your question establishes the need for the Book of Mormon better than any question I've seen on this site in recent memory. Thank you.", 10117, "AA10278896", 0],
	109834 : ["Because, when it was first written, there were no printing presses, so scribes(or people who copied it down word for word while someone was dictating it) would sit in a room while one person read the original copy aloud and they copied what they heard.  Now, we keep finding all of these copies still, and they are traslated all the time, and they still match up with all of the other translations, allowing some errors due to human error in hand copying long ago.  All of the different versions you see today are just the same thing but slightly reworded so that we can understand it better.

	109839 : ["Good afternoon Mike :) I love a bit of classic 1950s.  I know both 'Honey Hush' and 'Dust My Broom' from their Fleetwood Mac covers, though they renamed the first as 'Hi Ho Silver' and only called it 'Honey Hush' live, and used the 'Dust My Broom' intro on 3 or 4 different songs!
