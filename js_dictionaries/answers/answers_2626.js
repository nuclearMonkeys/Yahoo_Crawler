Private loans are generally credit-based, meaning that your interest rate will be set depending on your (or your co-signer's) credit history. Having a cosigner with good credit will generally lower your interest rate. Most lenders have options to defer payment while you're enrolled at least half time, but if at all possible, try to pay at least the interest while you're in school. It's a good idea to speak with the financial aid office at your school for advice on choosing a loan and a lender. Good luck!", 11341, "None", 0],

Here's a good page of resources that might be able to answer your questions in better detail: The company I represent,   allows you to fill out one loan application which is then reviewed by up to six different lenders. Since you probably don't have time to research a bunch of different banks and are new to the loan process, it might be an efficient way to hit six targets at once. The idea is that the lenders compete for your business, so you're more likely to get a better rate. Just an option to keep in mind. Good luck to you!", 11341, "None", 0],

Mickie James vs Melina was so good too, but it's the gimmick that sent it over the top. Of course a Falls Count Everywhere match is going to be entertaining; they always are.
