	99537 : ["I am afraid you are right, you are undoubtedly addicted. Last year warnings about addiction were finally added to the patient leaflets of over the counter packs of pain killers containing codeine. I have been fighting at local practice and at NHS Trust level about the mass prescribing of codeine based analgesics for more than 15 years without any real success. I have already vented my spleen in a number of earlier questions involving this drug. Nearly 80% of all paracetamol containing pain killers are now prescribed as ' Co ', codeine containing, formulations. There are also massive over the counter sales. This is despite many evidence based papers in learned journals, especially the BMJ. These papers all point out that though adding codeine to paracetamol does increase its analgesic potency by a modest 5%, its risks outweigh its benefits. It is addictive, produces severe constipation, headache ( called codeine headache and well recognised by neurologists) and abdominal pain. Ironically it is often used to treat the last two problems! There is an interesting geographical distribution of prescribing and over the counter purchase of codeine, I believe this demonstrates how its use is governed solely by prescribing habits, rather than clinical need. Prescribing is lowest in England and Wales, (though still huge), Higher in Scotland, Higher in the West than the East and highest in UK in Lanarkshire. (where I practice). To stand any chance you must go and talk to your GP about your problem and get help from him ideally in conjunction with the local community addiction team. This is not your fault, it is the effect of poor prescribing, this addiction to prescription drugs is a far larger problem numerically than that of street drugs and is, I am ashamed to say purely a consequence of how the medical profession prescribes. Most sleeping pill and tranquiler abusers have also been produced in this way, but they have a slightly higher profile than those with your problem. I apologise for using your unfortunate question to get on to one of my many soap boxes, but the medical profession as a whole, rather than your GP, who is just following current practice,which I believe is wrong, are to blame, and they owe it to you to help you out of it.", 9705, "Rk46lIBwaa", 3],

In bipolar disorder a person has mood swings from depression to mania which have to last 7 days each to be diagnosed but generally last weeks or months at a time. I developed bipolar when I was 15 and diagnosed at 18, when I was depressed I would sleep constantly, cry, self harm, wouldn't leave bed for days, didn't eat, wash, dress, constantly felt suicidal, hopeless and worthless, withdrew myself from family and friends and stopped going to school. This lasted for 6 months. Then I switched into mania when I was constantly full of energy and felt like I was on top of the world I was so happy, didn't sleep for days and if I did I would sleep up to 3 hours only, went out every night abusing alcohol and drugs, got into meaningless relationship, had sex with strangers, spent every penny I had and even stole from my mum, shop lifted, racing thoughts, aggressive and irritable, psychotic when I would hallucinate and be delusional to the point I stabbed myself and almost my boyfriend, I was constantly doing one thing to the next and I nearly failed college. This lasted for 4 months. Bipolar disorder is something that is very severe and effects your everyday life. I ended up being hospitalised because I was psychotic, hallucinating and delusional.

	99580 : ["That is not Bipolar at all. Bipolar moods are much more severe and they last for many weeks or months. Sounds to me like you are unhappy about moving and it is causing you stress.  Everyone has moods like those of Bipolar Disorder....... because everyone has mood swings, momentary loss of judgment, likes to go shopping, likes sex, feels down sometimes, gets angry now and then and is hyper on occasion. The difference is that all of these symptoms in Bipolar are so intense that they interfere with your ability to function. Think of a pole (biPOLEr) with 0 at the center (0 being normal) and 10 at one end (manic) and -10 at the other (deep depression). Most people have swings but stay within 3 to -3. I have fairly severe Bipolar 1 but since my psychosis is mild I go from -9 to 9.... Also depression that comes and goes is not bipolar but just recurring depression, you have to have mania for it to be Bipolar..... you have to go to both ends of the pole.   Rapidly changing emotions or becoming angry or sad easily is not all there is to Bipolar. That is just having emotions. People with Bipolar Disorder do not just change emotions quickly, they go through periods of depression followed by periods of mania or elevated mood. Mood affects everything about you.... your energy level, self esteem, sleep patterns, appetite, sexuality, emotional response, judgment, etc..... not just your emotions. And while rapid cycling is possible, it is rare. The average person with Bipolar only cycles two or three times a year and the moods last for weeks or months. It is considered rapid cycling if they cycle 4 or more times in a year.   While everyone with Bipolar has a different set of symptoms and a different severity of symptoms, this is what Bipolar is like for me:   Depression - too tired to get out of bed, shower, even to brush my teeth. Cry all the time, sleep 16 hours a day. Feelings of self loathing and guilt that drive me to think of suicide but I'm to tired to even think about how to go about killing myself. It makes you feel small and worthless and completely insignificant. It makes you think about how big the world is and how meaningless you are in it..... and it refuses to let you have any good thoughts or see any good things.... when you look in the mirror all you see is pain, you don't even see yourself, you don't taste your favorite foods anymore, see that flowers are blooming, whether or not the sun is out, you become so inward that you hardly even notice your surroundings..... You don't even feel love for people anymore.... positive thoughts are just not possible...... it is a deep dark hole with no way out and no light for hope.... and most of all it makes you feel sooooo alone. And even if there were someone who cared about you they would be better off if you killed yourself....... because all you will ever be is a burden....... this can last from a couple of weeks to a couple of years.   Mania - Way too happy! PARTY GIRL! love drink and drugs. Talk really fast and pressured because my thoughts are going faster than my mouth can keep up with. Hypersexual - like I sleep with strangers and guys I just met on the internet or I masturbate 10 times a day. I once became bisexual because there were twice as many people to sleep with. down load porn and spend tons of money on sex toys. Spending sprees..... I once spent my mortgage money on african violets, yep, $1500 on African violets (then I got depressed and let them all die). Quit my job because I wanted my vacation pay for lottery tickets and I was so convinced I would win that I started shopping and writing bad checks because I'd be rich as soon as the numbers were drawn. Decided that I could replace the furnace in my home by myself... I mean how hard can it be..... Only sleep 2 or maybe 3 hours a night for months on end and never feel tired. In the end I was unemployed, $30,000 in debt, and had almost lost my home, which needed a new furnace because I had removed the old one.. or parts of it anyway. This can last for months.   I also have mixed states when I am depressed and manic at the same time which are truly the worst... By body and mind are depressed but there is this undercurrent of energy running all the time..... I'm highly emotional but the emotions tend to be negative (guilt and anger) I have intrusive thoughts and urges to mutilate myself (like wanting to stick my hands in the garbage disposal or cooking them on the BBQ), and I also have psychotic episodes where I hallucinate.
