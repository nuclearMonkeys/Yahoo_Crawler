However, there are times when the dailyshit pushes the attentiveness out of the way, learning to recognize that you are not on your game is essential - snap out of it or turn around.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 326, "None", 0],

	2029 : ["You would rather have me answer on cancer treatment, which is not a one size fits all answer? Let's go through my answers to you: 1. You want people to wear makes.  ME - I want people to social distance AND wear masks and when they do wear masks, I want them to be EFFECTIVE.  Not sucky little cotton things that you easily smell the stale cologne of the guy down the aisle at the store.  If you can smell the cologne, obviously the mask isn't doing one bit of good. You are the COVIDIOT who doesn't think quality of masks matter! 2. Social Distancing is ALWAYS the most important component of reducing covid.  If you are more than 6ft away, it's almost impossible to get covid. You are the COVIDIOT that thinks masks are the most important component in the fight against covid. 3. You don't think we should be honest about the vaccines and allow people to make legitimate decisions on whether the risk of the vaccine is greater than the risk of covid. That's perfect? Was your brother in the hospital on Friday due to vaccine complications?  MINE WAS Did he knowingly take the vaccine because he thought it was better than the consequences = YES.  That was his choice.  He is a fancy VP of a large company and knows how to think and reason. However, unfortunately, there are many people in this country that do not have the skills that he does.  And we should not distribute false information to them. The vaccines are not approved by the FDA.  They have EAU, the same as HCQ. The vaccines do have serious complications, as you can see by my brother.  You need to determine if the complication are more risky for you than the illness.  Be mindful that the CDC currently states that up to 45% of people are asymptomatic. Obviously, we are never going to get herd immunity with the mRNA vaccines revaccination is going to be needed on-going (based on current options). 4. We do not get covid from inanimate objects.  The CDC make that very clear last week. 5. We get covid from CLOSE CONTACT = within 6ft for more than 15minutes in a 24 hour period, as listed on the CDC website. ** as a result, approximate 70% of covid transmission occurs in the household where you don't wear masks or social distance.  Not hard to figure out when you use common sense. 6. 95% of covid transmission occurs indoors.  That's why protests, Sturgis, Presidential election celebrations, and Kurt Cameron sing-a-longs are not super spreaders.  7.  Sufficient levels of vitamin D likely reduce your chance of a covid information and complications.  If you don't agree with me, let Harvard know.  It's on their website as preventative options for covid.  If you don't think this is accurate information, then you need to discuss this information with your doctor and learn how covid really works. ", 313, "cK28Kl0Uaa", 0],
	2030 : ["Cause Trump supporters do their own research and know when the government is trying to exceed the control limit on civilians. There's a point in time when we need to stand up for our civil rights. Texas has had a drastic decrease in covid cases ever since the drop of mask mandates. Oh and the vaccine..... yeah no.
