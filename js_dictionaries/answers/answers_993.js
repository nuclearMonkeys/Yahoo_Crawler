	55144 : ["It's nearly 50/50 where genes are concerned, while body parts vary. Genes are biological codes that determine the traits your body has. Some genes may remain dormant (not used) while other genes actually affect your biological characteristics (These genes are \"expressed genes\"). Like someone mentioned earlier, we get our mitochondria from our mothers, so it can be said that we inherit more \"material\" from our mothers.  Mainly, we get 23 chromosomes from our mothers, and 23 chromosomes from our fathers, making 46 chromosomes in total. These chromosomes pair up. So, we inherit 50% of our genes from our mothers, and 50% of our genes from our fathers. But the percentage of \"expressed genes\" from either parent can vary. Just for example, your mother has brown eyes, black hair, and small lips, while your father has blue eyes, brown hair, and big lips. You can inherit the genes for all the characteristics but may end up with: brown eyes, brown hair, and small lips or brown eyes, black hair, and small lips or blue eyes, black hair, big lips or any combination. I may have rambled too much, but to answer your question, we can't tell you which parts you got from your father because \"gene expression\" is not the same for every person. ", 7693, "oK6YVcF7aa", 0],

	55153 : ["Dreams happen during a sleep-state of high brain activity called \"REM sleep\".  During this time the brain is highly active & the body is immobilized (probably to prevent damage to self or others).  It is believed the brain is reorganizing itself during this state, passing on memory as brain-cells age & must be replaced within the whole brain.  Dreams are believed to be random firings of those brain-cells that the mind will later try and put a coherent story to.  If the story is pleasant its called a \"dream\", if the story is unpleasant, its called a \"nightmare\".   there are many people who believe dreams have more significance than merely randomness; dream interpretation. Dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. Judaeo-Christians sought the dream-state in order to receive divine revelation, and differentiated between good dreams (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). In Islam it is said that dream interpretation is the only way that Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last prophet, Muhammad.  Native American tribes used \"vision quest\" rituals as a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding dream was received.  Acts 2:16-17:  \"No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 'In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people.
