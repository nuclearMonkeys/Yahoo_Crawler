Carl's only hope of getting out of the godforsaken \"Bricks\" and have a future with his dream girl, Sarah Don, is to enter college - which is [or seems] unlikely. When a night of partying with his hoodlum friends goes tragically awry, Carl's and Sarah's lives are thrown upside down. With their lives in danger and to protect the girl he loves, Carl has a choice to make: live or die. === All of us have those two choices. Live or die. Run or hide. Fight or surrender. So \"live or die\" does not pack the punch that \"win or die\" could pack.  Naturally Carl chose to live. But how did he win? I have cut the wordiness a bit. It still is a poor blurb, IMO (and I am including my attempt at it); but blurbs need to be concise and to bite the reader. Perhaps my edit will help your imagination. === My questions  about the story: I presume Carl lived on campus at Braxton High. How did a street youth cope with the lifestyle of a prestigious school? How did he deal with a different class of people? With different clothes and manners? How could he afford to go? Who picked him out and gave him his chance? Why couldn't he enter a college? Why did he have to go back to his 'hood? You don't need to type an answer here; but they may be questions that readers will ask that need to be addressed through the story.", 2431, "AA11768465", 1],

Pens. (Even if you own a cellphone or a tablet or a laptop, you will need to jot down something.)

There's no definitive criteria for how to rank any of these militaries because you don't set any standard for what each was like when it entered the war or for what each was like at its height or at the end of the war. You might as well be ranking your favourite fecking Pokémon. The only realistic way this could be done would be to calculate how each would have held up against the other. Obviously the United Kingdom and the United States didn't go toe to toe with one another, but Britain's performance in the Second World War would have been drastically different had it not been for the tremendous amount of aid the Americans provided and the contributions of foreigners who enlisted on the British side. Had the UK and the US gone to war with one another in 1939, the Americans would have been off to a slow start, but would have eventually been victorious. Would the end have come in 1945, sooner, later, who knows? But the yanks would have most certainly trounced the British. The Soviets were the real powerhouse, but that was because of American aid and because the Allies relieved the USSR by opening a real second front. Would the USSR have survived without aid? Probably not, or at least not in any form resembling the USSR that came out of the war. The USSR might have been reduced to some rinky dink central Asian power out beyond the Urals. Unless you're going to specify how this ranking system is supposed to work, you're just spouting nonsense. Congratulations on thumbing through a Time Life picture book of World War II.
