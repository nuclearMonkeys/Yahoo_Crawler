	61575 : ["What is \"better\"? Each variety of music has its own separate function. Celtic and for that matter most folk or regional music has the purpose of portraying local and regional history, legend and colour. It celebrates the identity of the group that it associates with.It is also the source of melody frequently used by classical music (Dvorak's Slavonic Dances for example). It is simple for the most part, but that is its strength... it doesn't take a virtuoso to perform it and its continuation is ensured by people such as yourself, who cherish, enjoy and promote it. So no, there is absolutely nothing wrong with playing simple music. Not all classical music is complex, take the hackneyed Canon in D by Pachelbel - a relatively straightforward piece, which may be why it is so universally popular. Some music is intended for simple amusement, dancing and social interaction. Classical music just aspires to something more... a crystallization of human emotion and a legacy of the human condition. Sometimes it does not start out that way, but sort of becomes refined by time and ultimately becomes idiomatic and iconic of the milieu in which it was created, in that process becoming what we loosely term classical music. It has become, by the working of the human soul and history, art music - a reflection of the beings that created it and as such, the highest level of the artform that is music, one of man's noblest of contrivances.", 8129, "rNqF4gIVaa", 4],

	61577 : ["Not racist but another part of comic relief. In my opinion there was way to much comic relief in that movie lets list them shall we? 1.Sam Witwicky, Usually a spaz adding humor 2.The friend he meets in college pretty much another version of Sam comic releif 3.The Twin cars which could count as four but there is a big list here.  4. The Parents mainly the mother another form of comic relief.  5. The Remote control car another form of comic relief. Who also utilized the humping gesture another form of comic relief.  6 Sector 7 agent an another form of comic relief. (But was linked to the first movie. 7. The set of balls on the Devastator Machine. Another form of COmic relief.  8. Two dogs that hump each other. Pointless comic relief.  9. Character in meat parlor with messed up teeth... Yet more comic relief.  I think Micheal Bay likes to add too much humor in an action flick this was on the lines of Embarrassing when watching this movie. In Transformers 1 they where teetering on the line of too much but this movie just went over the top.  Plus the lack of sector 7 and explaining why the decpticons kept using the leader of sector 7 with the mustache as there human hologram in everything they used. I thought they were going to elaborate on that.  There was a lot more story development that could of went into this movie especially explaining the new decepticons and auto bots but noooo. Pointless humor was at every turn to the point it was like it was all hacked up and thrown in out of order. Not to mention the 9 I listed are the character meant to be comic relief.  The music they used in the first one which really gave the movie its sense of thrill was absent I remember when the Special Forces guys are under attack in the first movie the music set up was great.  Plus they left the scorpion sand creature alive only to have a 30 second cameo in which it is destroyed?  No no too much comedy and too little story.
