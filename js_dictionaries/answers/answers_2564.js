Banning coal exports would probably reduce our so called carbon footprint to the point where we wouldn't need a carbon tax.  Although I do have to wonder why we would have to stop burning coal in this country.  What coal burning power stations we have here work under extremely strict emissions controls.   Unless you consider water vapour as pollution.  Oh that's right, carbon-dioxide is now pollution.   Everyone hold your breath for 11 minutes to so we can reduce our carbon loading by 1 million tonnes. edit: Firstly - the hold your breath comment was a joke - loosen up people. Secondly,  yes it is true that brown coal is not exported or imported in Australia.  I was thinking of some other variety of coal that has ships queued up outside Newcastle Harbour (NSW) 24/7.  Apparently Australia has 90% of the worlds brown coal reserves and they are all located in the Latrobe Valley.  They feed three power stations in Victoria that are nearby.   But honestly I have to seriously question the integrity of any carbon tax/ emissions trading scheme that thinks shipping millions of tonnes of regular coal to developing countries, all over Asia, has less of an impact than a few power stations in Victoria.  If this government was even remotely serious about climate change then they would ban coal exports across the board no matter what the impact on the economy.   This only proves to me that the carbon tax is just another tax raising scam with no benefit to anyone anyone but pork-barrelling MPs. As for the question,  I seriously doubt anyone in Australia will publicly back nuclear power stations after the drama in Japan in recent history.   With a major continental plate fault line running through New Zealand, do we really want to put our country in jeopardy should a freak Tsunami take out a nuclear power station here?

	134066 : ["From the website  <<Yeshu - A Talmudic Tale A story about a man named Yeshu can be found in the Talmud. There is debate whether this Yeshu in the Talmud is the same Jesus who later became a Christian divinity. According to the Talmud, Yeshu was the son of a Jewish woman named Miriam who was betrothed to a carpenter. \"Betrothed\" means she was legally married to him, but she was not yet living with him or having sexual relations with him. The story says that Miriam was either raped by or voluntarily slept with Pandeira, a Greek or Roman soldier. Miriam than gave birth to Yeshu, who was considered a \"mamzer\" (bastard), a product of an adulterous relationship. The Talmud describes Yeshu as a heretic who dabbled in sorcery and lead the people astray. Later, the Sanhedrin (the Jewish \"Supreme Court\") ordered Yeshu stoned to death and his dead body was hung from a tree until nightfall after his death, in accordance with the ancient Jewish punishment for heretics. While some believe there is no connection between the Talmudic Yeshu and the Christian Jesus, others believe there is a connection. The main inconsistency between the Talmudic and Christian story is that during the time that Jesus was killed, the Romans ruled and the Sanhedrin did not have the power to impose the death penalty. Thus, some Jews believe that today's popular Christian ideas about Jesus are based on a melding of the Talmudic story of Yeshu and the historian Josephus' writing about Jesus, which included his execution by the Romans.>> P.S. Josephus's mentions about Jesus as a messiah are considered forgeries: see   and   among many other unbiased references.", 11204, "d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa", 4],
