	115003 : ["To answer this question properly it is first necessary to consider some of the contributions made by Einstein to the then nascent theory of quanta exchange and then consider these in the light of his classical approach to theoretical unification. I will not explore the EPR experiments in depth but will attempt to review Einstein's philosophical approach to the formalisation of physical theory.     Einstein published two papers, related to quantum theory, during his Annus Mirabilis (1905). His May 1905 paper \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\") delineated a stochastic model of Brownian motion. This paper was Einstein's first in the field of statistical mechanics. The second paper, titled \"Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt\" (\"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\"), used the concept of the quantisation of light 'photons' to account for the then puzzling photoelectric effect. By 1921, when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize and his work on photo electricity was mentioned by name in the award citation, some physicists accepted that the equation E = hf +  Ø was correct and light quanta were possible. However, Einstein's other two papers of 1905, where classical - cause and effect -  theories (Special Relativity and Matter and energy equivalence ). Although it is interesting to note, that the bulk of papers published by Einstein (1) between 1901 and 1912 were either on photons, electromagnetism and or statistical mechanics.   Even after publishing the ‘classical' General Theory of Relativity in 1915, Einstein continued to author paper in the early fields of quantum theory and quantum mechanics. In 1924, he published the paper ' Quantentheorie des einatomigen idealen Gases' (Quantum Theory of the Monatomic Ideal Gas), which extended the ideas of Bose and predicted the ‘Bose condensate'. The following year, a paper titled 'Quantentheorie des einatomigen idealen Gases. 2. Abhandlung' (Quantum Theory of the Monatomic Ideal Gas, Part II),  extended the ideas and formalism of what we now call Bose-Einstein statistics. Throughout the period 1905 until the end of his life, Einstein published classical papers in increasing number. By classical papers, I am referring to cause and effect theories such as that found within General Relativity, where the presence of mass-energy creates space-time curvature and, thus, gravity.  It is reported that Einstein did not believe in a 'God' or ‘Gods' but  '.. in 1929, Einstein told Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein \"I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.\"...(2)'  Thus, to some extent Einstein sought the equations that governed the world and perhaps felt that they were/are classical in nature. This, then, brings me to the crux of my argument! Einstein perhaps (???) sought a formal cause for the way the universe is and behaves!! '... In the 1920s, quantum mechanics developed into a more complete theory. Einstein was unhappy with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory developed by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. In this interpretation, quantum phenomena are inherently probabilistic, with definite states resulting only upon interaction with classical systems. A public debate between Einstein and Bohr followed, lasting on and off for many years (including during the Solvay Conferences). Einstein formulated thought experiments against the Copenhagen interpretation, which were all rebutted by Bohr. In a 1926 letter to Max Born, Einstein wrote: \"I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice.\" ...(2)' '...Einstein was never satisfied by what he perceived to be quantum theory's intrinsically incomplete description of nature, and in 1935 he further explored the issue in collaboration with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, noting that the theory seems to require non-local interactions; this is known as the EPR paradox. The EPR experiment has since been performed, with results confirming quantum theory's predictions. Repercussions of the Einstein–Bohr debate have found their way into philosophical discourse. ..(2)'. It is this 'spooky action at a distance' that so 'spooked' Einstein.  '...Einstein maintained that quantum mechanics is physically incomplete and logically unsatisfactory. In \"The Meaning of Relativity,\" Einstein wrote, \"One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous field. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers (quantum numbers). This does not seem to be in accordance with a continuum theory and must lead to an attempt to find a purely algebraic theory for the representation of reality. But nobody knows how to find the basis for such a theory.\" If time, space, and energy are secondary features derived from a substrate below the Planck scale, then Einstein's hypothetical algebraic system might resolve the EPR paradox (although Bell's theorem would still be valid). Edward Fredkin in the Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis has suggested an informational basis for Einstein's hypothetical algebraic system. If physical reality is totally finite, then the Copenhagen interpretation might be an approximation to an information processing system below the Planck scale. ...(3)' It now, seems that 'quantum mechanics simply contradicts Einstein's philosophical postulate that any acceptable physical theory should fulfil \"local realism\".' Thus, Einstein contributed to the early probabilistic quantum theory but sought a ‘classical' cause and effect theory to soothe his unwillingness to accept the deeper philosophical ramifications. During the later years of his life, Einstein sought in vain for a unified field theory of gravity and electromagnetism and ironically, he had quantised the electromagnetic exchange process!  However, Einstein did contribute to the development of quantum theory and after many arguments; he accepted some of  Schrodinger and Heisenberg's assertions. However, modern experimental evidence from the EPR experiments suggest that 'Einstein's concept of realism is too restrictive'!", 10405, "vSkqJ813aa", 1],
