Since that time I've come to a conclusion, that many of the people on this site, as well as the world that exist outside of it, do not look into any legislation that they claim they support. They only support the party's that they have identified themselves with. Their support for legislation, which they have no idea about, has been based off of an unyielding allegiance to two separate but yet identical political parties. It is like a religion, their preachers are the politicians and as long as they hold a (D) or an (R) they will follow them blindly and support them unconditionally. All day the vast majority of these special needs children here on YA throw insults and baseless arguments at each other. They back up their claims with articles of subjective interpretations and no empirical evidence.
