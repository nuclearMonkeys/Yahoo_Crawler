Lots of times we would have fried bologna, hot dogs, bacon or fatback with those vegetables On the weekends maybe pork chops or a beef roast & cookie, ice cream etc. In the summer months we'd have ice cream cones, watermelon, fresh sliced peaches, strawberry shortcake, angel food cake with assorted fresh berries and lemon whip cream.

	101440 : ["Hi Elizabeth  I am sorry to hear your not well love! I say myself go back to the hospital ASAP If you lay down  and keep ur feet and legs up it wont cause them to swell as bad go down  You could try raising the foot of your bed on a couple of bricks, or if that's not possible, stuffing a fat pillow under the foot end of the mattress. Wearing support hosiery during the day might help, but it's quite uncomforable at first, it takes a bit of getting used to. And not the sort they sell in the shops, even their firmest hold is less than light support stockings (or knee highs) prescribed by your doctor. You can ask him for three pairs a year (you may only get two, but try!) they last quite well if you handwash them carefully.  Remeber to drink lost of fluids.....drinking more will flush your system! It is really important to not cut back on your fluids!  Good night to you princess  and I will be praying for you to get better soon bless you xoxo", 9785, "None", 2],

It sounds like something is shutting down (in your system)and that could be from all kinds of different types of elements like stress.

	101455 : ["im a high school freshman too, and i had the same problem. i guess i was just shy, and being in a new school with new people is really hard. You don't want to be a loser, but you never know what people will think of you, right? If you're cute, it will definitely help people to come up and talk to you, so you have an advantage right there. ust continue getting to know them and decide if you like them or not. I know this sounds really stupid, but the best thing you can do is to be yourself (and then you'll find your social skills). People LOVE other people who are comfortable in their own skin. And you said you wanted to be in a clique? Well if you just be yourself, and are really friendly, you'll have your OWN! Join clubs at school or something if you want to get ot, or go to the movies at the mall (those are ALWAYS fun). It sounds like you're a bit anti-social, but you just have to make plans (when you know you can) before you can talk yourself out of it. You can't be so afraid of what people will think of you, just get out there and do things! Good luck!!!", 9776, "xCqGkvruaa", 0],
	101456 : ["I think that the problem could be that you are trying to hard!  Stop focusing on wanting to be in a certain group or click, and just live your life.  The rest will fall into place. You are right, people will say to just find someone you have something in common with, but don't go out there looking for them!  If you like sports, try out for your high school team.  That's how you meet new people.  If you don't make the team, then join a rec team outside of school.  Figure out what your interests are, and do them.   You say that you just don't get out there and do stuff, well, if you don't make a change then you need to stop complaining!  You have to start taking risks--if you staying home all weekend then how is anyone going to ask you to do anything.  For all they know, you are out having a great time! I know that high school can be a tough time, but it's just four years of your life--this is the time to prepare yourself for the real world (yes, there is a world outside of high school.)  What a waste it would be to just sit around and do nothing to better your life.  I know that there are cliques all over high school, and having been in certain ones, I can tell you that although many look like they are perfect, but they all have issues.  The girls who were considered the most \"popular\" in my high school class is now a bunch of overweight girls who are still looking for someone to love them.  Granted they were acquaintances of mine in social settings, but my true friends are not even people I went to high school with (after senior year, no one in high school sticks together--I promise.) So, I want to say to just remember that there is a whole world of people out there who would love to meet you and have the same interests as you--they just may not go to the same school as you.  Just keep bettering yourself with skills and activities that make you happy and you will have no regrets. Good luck!!!", 9776, "0m3PdVLEaa", 0],

	101459 : ["There's truly not much point in asking us to answer these questions, because there is huge variability. You won't get a useful statistical sample from Yahoo Answers -- and in any case a statistical average is meaningless because you'd get some specific job with it's own characteristics.  I worked for a British-based company for 5 years, so I have some idea what it's like there at least for that company; and I've not only worked at several companies here in the US, but I used to be a financial advisor, and so was exposed to a lot of different companies' benefits packages. First,  the typical American is materially much better off than the comparable British person. Basically it's a case of, incomes are comparable based on exchange rate, but costs in the UK tend to be 60% higher or so. It's actually more or less the case that things costs about the same in currency units (something is $10 here, 10 pounds in the UK), but of course the UK pound is more costly by about 60%. (That's certainly not a universal fact among different countries, but it's a coincidence that prevails with UK and US).   Benefits vary wildly among different jobs and employers. It's common that Americans get less vacation time that many other countries. On the other hand, in both my current and previous jobs I'd get about 28 days of vacation (including national holidays), so that's pretty good. My current job formally offers 1 week of bereavement leave that doesn't count against you. A smaller company is apt to be more flexible and do things on a case by case basis. Though lots of Americans are famously uninsured, if you ARE among the large majority of people with health insurance, the care you actually get is generally far superior to what's available in the UK or most other places -- most countries have more government control and rationing of healthcare, which means resource are often more limited and often governments deliberately seek to limit care and the demand for care. (I recall Germany forbids advertising drugs on TV -- they'll have some rationalization for that, but the truth is the government literally does not want people to be aware of what drugs are available for their problems, because then people might want it and the government will have to pay for it...) In terms of company culture like whether you can leave before 6 pm ... again, no point asking, there are 10 million different answers for 10 million different employers. There is surely more variability in the US than anywhere. No doubt some places people are treated like robots, and other companies where people come in when they want and bring their dogs.  I live in the Dallas area, where the job market is very strong. Tons of job openings. Not the same case in most other areas though.", 9780, "lWqOTYvWaa", 0],
	101460 : ["I couldn't agree with you more!  I can't help but believe that THOSE types are usually teenagers!  I say \"teenagers\" but more specifically, teenage BOYS!  Teenage boys are typically adolescent in nature, considerably less mature than their female counterparts, and do NOT possess fully developed brains, thus causing irrationality and hormonal dysfunction! They CANNOT get away with trashing others in school because they will be caught & punished.  So, trashing online is a safe way for them to feel \"macho\" or \"tough\" or even \"smart\" as well as anonymous! THEIR logic is that if you make a grammatical error in your question, that grammar error DISQUALIFIES & DISCREDITS your entire question ALTOGETHER!  But in actuality, it's THEIR IGNORANCE that discredits them! You see, in THIS type of forum THEY (these adolescent boys) NOW get to JUDGE & criticize your work, without fear of retribution!
