	26874 : ["You can't.  Flat panel TV manufacturers stopped supplying screens as spare parts over twenty years ago.  When you buy a new TV you're effectively buying the display panel (overwhelmingly the single most expensive part) on a bulk order discount, AND with all the other bits needed to make it a complete TV bundled in free of charge. Spare screens when they were available simply didn't make economic sense: they were supplied in far lower numbers so did not benefit from the same bulk discount, and still needed a substantial protective frame and package for supply and storage purposes. It was actually just as expensive to purchase a new display screen on its own. If stockists were lucky, those screens suited more than one model of TV. If they were VERY lucky, they actually managed to sell their imported stock of spare screens before the models they were specific to had been made obsolete. Only premium and secondary brands ever supplied spare screens; budget brands like Vizio (had they existed back then) simply replaced broken TVs if they were still under warranty and didn't ever stock major spare parts. Leading brands quickly followed that same idea as it was vastly cheaper than having repair and maintenance depots and warehouses filled with spare parts which might never get used. The TV rental company I worked for quickly learned to abandon screen replacements very shortly after we first started supplying flat panel TVs in the early/mid 1990s, and even when they were doing them simply cannibalised them from models returned after rental which had too much cosmetic damage to the casing to be worth renting out again. The economics made even less sense with larger screen sizes.  That was all back when there weren't new and improved models coming out every few months.  So if your 50” TV (I'm sure you didn't mean 50' as you typed) has a damaged screen then all you can do is to live with the damage if the TV still works, or send the TV for recycling. If the remote control is in good condition then they're usually worth selling on sites like eBay. People are always losing or breaking remotes and original new ones are very expensive or even impossible to buy.", 4219, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],
