AND you should apply for a secured credit card to get things rolling for you.  These cards you just get the amount that you send them for your credit limit.  So if you send them $500, that's your credit limit.  But they still report to the credit agencies.  So you'll be working on your credit.  Also, look into getting a card for like Old Navy or some other department store.  You'll start off with a small limit, but as you build up your credit that will change.  It'll take some time.  If you in the need of a car that could help too.  Make sure the car is in YOUR name.  You can still have a cosigner, but it'll be better if you don't.", 10612, "AA10178658", 0],

This is where you deposit money with the Bank and the Bank issues a credit card up to the limit that you have deposited.  Thereafter you use the card and pay bills at the end of the month.  This way you create your own credit history. After about 6 months you can apply for a normal (unsecured) credit card.  Normally because of your credit history they approve a card for the limit you had with the secured card.  After receiving the card you must request the bank that issued the secured card to cancel the card and refund the money due to you on your deposit. Thereafter when you creates about 10 months history you can request the bank that issued the new card to increase your credit limit.", 10612, "AA10644766", 0],

I actually love Death Metals incoherant vocals, I introduced you to Devourment, now I'll show you Obituary, John Tardy even admitted himself before that he has no lyrics to some songs, just random growls haha! sexy stuff there!!! Dissection have very understandable vocals too, a great BM band (rip Jon). As for Bathory, well I know you love your Viking Metal so I'll give you an album from their Viking era. Hammerheart is their best V/era and I think the best song off it is Valhalla, love the drum sound, sounds like Thor himself beating drums in a great hall: read the lyrics, makes you want to fight.

Something that really makes you feel uncomfortable. I prefer it when I can understand the lyrics, but that often is impossible, but it's fine when you just have to guess. My least favourite, for the record, is the high pitched singing of power metal bands. I just think it sounds stupid. I love clean vocals when done properly, just not in that way.

Everyone seemed to enjoy the book Blood and Chocolate and since I'm a lover of werewolves I decided to check it out after seeing the commercial for the movie--a dumb reason to check out a book, sue me. Anyways, I read it and it was all one big hormone, constantly throbbing and hungry for attention. The writing was horrendous and the characters even more distasteful. There was no plot until the ending and even then I had no idea what the hell I was reading. All the main character cared about was sex and while I get wolves are animals and mating and all sorts of that, sex is not part of their diet all of the time. It was completely annoying because she was stuck-up, condescending and absolutely irksome. I still til this day don't know what everyone likes about the book or how they could even get through it. I took a few hours to read it and just twenty pages from the ending I put it down. Everyone seems to complain about Stephenie Meyer, but honestly I would rather read her books a million times then finish reading Blood and Chocolate.", 10601, "None", 0],

First of all, check with your bank and see if you can apply for this type of credit card through them. If necessary, get a credit card that is secured by the funds you have on deposit. If you have a long-term relationship with this bank, they may be more willing to take a chance on you. You can also get a couple of store credit cards just to build up a track record, but in the long-term, you do not want to have too many of these on your credit report.  You do not want to make too many applications at one time, because these will show up adversely on your credit report. There is someone out there who will be willing to extend you credit.
