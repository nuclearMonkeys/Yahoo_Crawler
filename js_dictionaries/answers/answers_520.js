Of course, it's not same as it once was, because part of the problem is that more people are going to casinos, as well as, playing the lottery instead of going to the track. However, those of us who are die hard fans of Thoroughbred horse racing will remain high horse enthusiasts.

SO lightning is LOUDER than most gunfire. Now on the other hand, I have been close to our large Tanks firing. While on a quail hunt, we were walking back to a 34 foot motor home for lunch while the Tanks were firing right across the Tank Trail from the motor home..

It was a massive bolt. It blew bark off the tree from halfway down all the way to the ground. It smoked the tv, fridge, and actually blew the glass part of the bulbs out of the lights. My neighbors dog never came home, and my ears rang for a few days like I was at a rock concert. No joking, I slammed my eyes shut, but I can remember seeing thru my eyelids when that lightning flashed. I really thought that \"Its all over now\". This happened just north of Houston Texas, about 40 years ago.
