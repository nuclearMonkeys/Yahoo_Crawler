	98634 : ["This is one of the most thought provoking questions i've come across on here. What I have found in my studies of religion is that there is false religion.  From my studies I have learnt that there is one true God - Jehovah.  And many religions do not acknowledge him, despite the evidence that proves that he is the only true God.  From that, there springs many false teachings and misinterpretations of scriptures.  Some people worship Jesus as god, whereas studies show that Jesus is God's son.  Some people unwittingly worship Satan as a god, because they pray to the god of this world and they do not realise that Satan is the ruler of this world.  Because he is the ruler, he encourages all the false teachings as possible to distract people from learning the truth. The below source is entitled \"how to find the true religion\".  And also \"Identifying the only true God.\" I hope they help. And as for Bible translations, they are all pretty much the same, one bible may use the word \"forever\", whereas another Bible will use \"everlasting life.\"   I'm happy to study in any Bible.", 9662, "Whmj4sEFaa", -1],

But yeah, people seem to \"interpret\" the bible differently. I think if you just read it, research, and compare, you'll discover what's real and what's not. As far as \"trinity\" goes...no. There are some people who believe that there are 3 different entities...God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but that's not true. These 3 are the same entity, the same God.  So no, we don't believe in different Gods.", 9662, "tgfaH1d3aa", -1],

I never criticize his parenting.  I also enjoy fixing his meals.  I know by some standards, this might be seen as submissive or \"unequal\", but I never really see it that way.

	98642 : ["Its been several hours since you posted this, so I'm sure by now some one has mentioned that the New Testament was written in Greek.  The word for brother, adelphos, is rooted in the word meaning from the same womb.  When it is used in a spiritual sense or to show a mutual bond, one can tell by the context.  Some people suggest that the brothers and sisters of Jesus, mentioned in the bible, were actually cousins, but there is a Greek word for cousins, anepsios. Matthew 1:25 calls Jesus uion prototokon, first born.  If he was the only son born of Mary, it could have been written uion monogene. In John 19, when Jesus tells the disciple whom he loved about Mary, it says he took her into his own from that hour.  The word household, as in His own household is italicized because it is not in the text.  Could it mean into his own family or care, or heart?  John, the apostle whom Jesus loved, was from Galilee, and the crucifixion took place in Jerusalem. Forty days later, in the upper room, in Acts 1 Mary is said to be there with Jesus' brothers, so it would seem that the beloved disciple's care of her was no longer needed.", 9668, "2DHAvC9haa", 1],

The historian can make assumptions about a typical family in that region and time, but not surprisingly, there isn't much reliable concrete information about this particular first century Nazarene peasant woman and her husband. Whether we accept the premise, as Christians do, that Jesus was born to a virgin (why not--it's  !) or not, I don't think it's in debate that Mary and Joseph had typical normal marriage post-Jesus. I don't think devout Christians or non-Christians have a particular interest, either way, in establishing whether or not Mary and Joseph managed to have sex and bear other children. If there's a Catholic discomfort over the notion that Mary *ever* shed her virgin status, I sympathize, but can't relate or support the theory.", 9668, "4LQwz9bbaa", 0],

	98650 : ["Most water intoxication is caused by hyponatremia, an overdilution of sodium in the blood plasma, which in turn causes an osmotic shift of water from extracellular fluid (outside of cells) to intracellular fluid (within cells). The cells swell as a result of changes in osmotic pressure and may cease to function. When this occurs in the cells of the central nervous system and brain, water intoxication is the result. Additionally, many other cells in the body may undergo cytolysis, wherein cell membranes that are unable to stand abnormal osmotic pressures rupture, killing the cells. Initial symptoms typically include light-headedness, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, headache and/or malaise. Plasma sodium levels below 100 mmol/L (2.3g/L) frequently result in cerebral edema, seizures, coma, and death within a few hours of drinking the excess water. As with alcohol poisoning, the progression from mild to severe symptoms may occur rapidly as the water continues to enter the body from the intestines or intravenously.
