	59984 : ["What a great question. I'm going to make a cup of tea and watch this one. *sip* I'm not in the groups you ask about, but I want to know what a Christian is since I've been assured I'm not one by those that say they are. I believe the point is to Love, and since God is Love you're part of God, the more you Love the more aware you are of God.  You don't need to know Jesus to do this Melchezidek, the King of Salem, did it long before Jesus was around (That's in the Bible, Book of Hebrews). Like Jesus and Melchezidek I am on my way to becoming a High Priestess in the order of Melchezidek (That means the eternal godlike qualities not an organization) just as we all should be. So no I'm not a Christian but I love all those who choose to be less than God has offered.", 8060, "qZnlpfRBaa", 0],
	59985 : ["we believe in the ABCs of salvation (easy to remember) A=Admit you are a sinner B=Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ (Lord means in control, Jesus was the one who was the chosen one of God) C=Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. But where some of the fundamentalists will disagree with me, is that this is only accepting the invitation. Because you make a Decision for Christ. In other words, you make a decision to turn away from  your existing lifestyle (those things that separate you from God) and let God take control of your life. It's more than just a prayer. It's about turning your heart, life, and soul over to Jesus Christ as your Lord and Personal Savior.", 8060, "fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa", 1],
	59986 : ["Christian is only a label used for people who profess Christ.

	59987 : ["Yes.  Zen is considered to be a school of Buddhism.  It is based on the concept of 'mindfulness', in particular the teachings of the Satipatthana Sutta.

	59994 : ["i honestly hated the ending.  but it's because those dumb fckers didn't follow the manga, they made the anime on their own... so they fcked it up big time.  but i would suggest u to read the manga, it's not finished yet... but the story is completely different to that of the anime. also they are making now \"Fullmetal alchemist: brother hood\", i haven't started seeing it, because 1) i was really disappointed with the ending of the anime, 2) it started on april, so i don't think it's that far...  but anyways, i have been told that the brotherhood does supposedly follow the manga story line which is way better... so u might want to reconsider watching that one... here's the link to the manga: and here's the link to the brotherhood anime: check it out, hope u'll enjoy it better than that fcked up retarded ending", 8066, "None", -2],

I would have to say though, some of the Wiccans I have met seem to be stuck on Harm None (and a few didn't even get that far). I would have to disagree though, because the overall majority don't exhibit this kind of behaviour. Edit: ? Damn, the majority of the people giving out thumbs must diagree with me and think Wiccans are fluffballs.

	60002 : ["Voltaire meant that it's impossible for a rational person to believe in something for which there is no raitional evidence. He knew that religion was based upon Faith, a peculiar type of knowledge that doesn't require rational justification. Voltaire's reliance upon rationalism is the quintessence of Enlightenment thinking. He was also saying that without God, or a God-type of creator/being, life has no intrinsic meaning. It may have any type of meaning that we give it but that's just arbitrary meaning. Only a creating God can give life intrinsic meaning. This is because it's impossible to create something without a purpose, even if you're trying to create something that has no purpose (it's purpose becomes, having no purpose). Thus, it's impossible (for a rational person) to believe in God and yet, life is absurd without God.", 8061, "None", 0],

	60014 : ["First of all, why are you using Yahoo to ask these questions about Islam? Do you really think all the information you are going to get here is 100% accurate and say that's your \"evidence\" to why Islam is a bad religion? I know this is your opinion on Islam, but try to have some respect. And by the way, those people out there that you are referring to who are terrorists and do bad things are only considered Muslims. That's who they say they are, but Muslims were never taught to kill Anti-Muslims. If you haven't researched already, Islam means Peace. Why do you have to be so interfering in other religions and not care about what YOU have done in life? Change yourself before you try to change others. And who are you to hate on other people and say \"Get a mind of your own,\" when your Yahoo username is \"Islam is bad\"? Is that what your whole point in life is now? To hate on Islam? You shouldn't think only about the bad Muslims out there who are only considered to be Muslims, and just ignore the other entire batch who are a whole lot more religious, hard-working, and peaceful than you ever were. Please try to be respectful of other religions and get your facts straight.", 8059, "None", 1],

If anything, they seem to be among the most intelligent and well-educated group of people I've ever encountered, including atheists.
