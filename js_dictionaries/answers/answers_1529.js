She's probably tired and blames you for not helping her just cause she saw you there doing nothing, or something else, believe me, that's happened to me before, and I've also done that to my little sister when I'm really tired fixing my room and she's playing with her toys, just try helping her every once in a while so she can't say you don't, and when she tell you to do something but you don't feel like it, tell her that your still 2 young to have so many responsabilities, you already have school and you also have to enjoy your life.

	82127 : ["Hi! Well, I am quite familiar with the situation you find yourself in now. High school was indeed an awkward and pretty bad time for me, mainly due to reasons similar to yours. Shyness, awkwardness, etc. The friends I had weren't really my friends, but my school was quite small in terms of students, so options were quite limited. I cannot give you a step-by-step set of instructions outlining your course of action, but I can share what happened in my life. High school didn't really get much better, but I found two friends that I got along with really well. It did get better, but wasn't great. I stayed in the school's hostel, so forced interactions with others did seem to help me crawl out of my shell. Taking part in the school play was a smart decision and I would recommend it. Apply for events where you HAVE to mix with others. You need to get out of your comfort zone and engage with others. The time I really started changing was only after school when I went to university. I didn't know anyone and the first day was horrible, but everyone felt the same way, so we all just mixed immediately. The group thing in schools makes this mixing difficult, and the loner will always exist, but it changes outside of school. Don't try to act like someone else to fit in- people pick up on that. Not good. Be yourself! You sound like a perfectly decent kid, trapped in an awkward situation. But it does blow over. I promise. Stay positive and smile! That sounds lame, but people are always attracted to it. Good luck!ning your course of action, but I can share what happened in my life.

	82147 : ["I am a bra fitting specialist for a lingerie company in Canada. Often times in shorter women they have a problem fitting properly into a full cupped bra because their torsos are shorter than someone who is like 5'7 (which is considered the average height, and the height in which most full cupped bras are designed for). I would suggest trying a demi-cupped bra or a balconette style. This cut across the breast giving the majority of the support to the underside of the breast, which is where the bulk of the volume is. You may find that it allows you to fill out the bra better and get the support you need according to your body style. I myself am 5'5 and am a 30 e-f depending on the style of the bra and I find I can only fill out a balconette style bra because I am very tiny (only 100lbs).  It also seems that you aren't confident that you are wearing the proper size. I will tell you how to size yourself. Take a measuring tape (a soft one) and measure around your back to the front of your abdomen underneath your breasts. Take this number and add five inches to it - this is your bandwidth. So if you measure 31 inches around you indeed are a 36 bandwidth. Then measure around your back to the front of the largest part of your breasts (usually over the nipple). Take this number and subract your bandwidth from it, each inch being a cup size. So if your measurement is 41 then you are a DD. Your bra should always be on the middle hook and the straps should be tight enough so that they don't fall off your shoulders. You want your bra a bit snug so that they are supporting your breasts and the bra isn't just sitting there, you should only be able to fit one finger underneath your bra or strap. I hope this information helps you in your quest for finding a proper fitting bra.", 9095, "UXH2Zl6Maa", 0],
