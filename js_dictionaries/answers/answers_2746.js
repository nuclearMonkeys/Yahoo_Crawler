But it's AMAZINGLY TACKY to mention tipping to you. If that happened to me I would've told him I was planning on tipping but he just talked me out of it.  Normally yes, you should tip them. I'd say for a 1 bedroom, something like $10 for each person is good. If you're not sure, you can always ask the company their tipping policy when you schedule them. I also offer them a cold drink only because that's how I was raised -- someone's in your house, you offer them a drink. But so what if it was raining. That's part of the job.

	143191 : ["What she did is workplace sexual harassment. Period. I think his telling you - and being defensive about it - was his way of handling his discomfort over the situation.  His reaction is understandable. Just about everybody feels uncomfortable being in a sexual situation they didn't ask for. Most of us men don't have a way to handle it though - we're supposed to be in control sexually. We're not used to the idea that sex is out of our control. He needed to deal with this. He didn't want to keep silent. But he also didn't have a vocabulary to express what sexual objectification feels like. And I think he certainly didn't want to admit to himself that he was not in control of a highly sexualized situation. And honestly, I bet this was especially hard for him because (speaking as a guy) that was about the hottest thing a woman can do. Think about it: we're breeders. Deep down, it's what we do best. A young woman is highlighting her breasts, saying she's ovulating and describing how much she enjoys the idea of inviting a man besides her mate to impregnate her? Holy crap! He's got a couple million years of selected genes screaming \"GO GO GO!\" You may think that him saying \"NO NO NO!\" instead was easy and obvious. Trust me, it was not. Or at least not in the way you think. Yes, it's easy to be sensible and choose mate, job and dignity over a quicky. What's hard about it for a guy is saying \"No,\" and still feeling like a virile, strong and in-control man. The fact that he didn't do her right then and there, and the fact that he's looking for a way to acknowledge both his emotional vulnerability and - in a backhanded sort of way - how powerful an experience this was for him is a testament to his trust in you. Cut him some slack. Don't under value his trust. Acknowledge his discomfort and his desire. Help him talk it through. Maybe you can even learn from it: he's given you quite a scenario to play with next time you want to spice things up a bit! Maybe not immediately. But if he can get to the point where he can play with this scene instead of feeling that it makes him uncomfortable, well, that would be healing of a sort. Besides, wouldn't you like to have a man who can be vulnerable, trusting and honest while still feeling virile, strong and in-control with you? Have fun!", 11570, "Ae39FL04aa", 2],

We met at a beauty supply store near the restaurant and she said, Oh it will be so rude if I don't go say hi to your husband. As soon as he saw us and what she was wearing he would not look at her. He told me it made him uncomfortable and he was going to insist she cover up. So while I was doing her hair I got flashed by her boobies several times. I told her my husband wants you to cover up. You know what she said to me???? He will have to tell me himself! What else could I do but worry that she was going to seduce him into sex at work.
