Or trying to shave a few minutes off their time trying to get somewhere instead of checking to see if that stranded person on the side of the road could use some help. The selfishness of this country is pathetic. The materialistic view of people nowadays is one of the reasons why this country is looked down upon by so many others. I hope one day enough people wll see that these kinds of things are unnecessary and show a little more compassion for their fellow human being. Sadly, it wont be in my lifetime.

	75293 : ["Besides being a world class science fiction author, Isaac Asimov was wrote numerous non-fiction science books.  It seems to me, that quote exactly addresses the stem cell research controversy.  Imagine the pain of being forced to live your life with a horrible disease or disorder, with no hope of a cure, because a gang of self-righteous Christian do-gooders decided fifty cells in a petri dish were more important than a living human being.  ...a perfect example of morality preventing what's right.", 8807, "86PUxs1jaa", 1],
	75294 : ["It's not a copout to say that only God knows because only God knows. Atheists are always saying they don't think it's a Christian's place to tell them they are going to Hell and I agree with that.

I trust God to do right. Add--Okay, Kris, then I'll say *I* don't know. The Bible says that God looks upon the heart, and we are each accountable to God for doing and believing right as much as has been revealed to us to do and believe right. So even though he didn't know the Abrahamic God, he would, in his own religious traditions, had some awareness of God. In that tradition, was he just? faithful? honest? Was his heart pure?  I can't know that. But that's how I believe--based on reading the Scripture--that God deals with those who never had the opportunity to know the full message of the gospel. To me that's a more correct Christian stance than consigning everybody to hell.", 8803, "QyB4ZDR4aa", -1],

I'd think he was more or less of a man if he wasn't interested in making love at all....then I'd wonder what's going on. It would not be an insult to me. It just means there is a medical issue tied to the reason behind it. If a man wants to take it, I'm all for it. However....the only worry I would have is what I've heard about from so many people.... it makes men hornier and want it more and they end up more apt to stray. I think that's the only thing that would make me cautious if my DBF started using it because I obviously wouldn't want to lose him.  Good Luck!", 8806, "1f2ab14ef5ed92e673a1f5db9d7d9463aa", 0],

If my partner couldn't get it up & he didn't want to take anything for it then I'd be miserable & unhappy with him. If he took some action & took viagra then I'd be happy that he was making sure that we could have a good sex life. Therefore, in a way, he would be looking after me. That is manly and appealing to me. If he makes a big deal out of taking it then it could potentially be a turn off. If he just took it matter of factly & didn't make a big deal about it then my mind would be thinking of making love not that little blue pill.", 8806, "None", 0],
