Do what you know is the right thing to do as a parent and role model.  If she resists you, it will be difficult but in the long run she will likely come to appreciate your efforts. I married my husband who had full custody of his 16-year-old son and the teen was a handful.  He wasn't openly rebellious, but calm and mild mannered.  He had his teachers and other family members fooled into always believing that his father and I browbeat him to get him through high school.  I was a public school teacher, so I was an easy target for the boy.  I had also seen all the tricks that kids his age pull, and soon the boy realized that he may be fooling his father, he certainly wasn't fooling me. Fortunately, his father and I were on the same page regarding every aspect of the teen's upbringing.  We put up a united front when it came to rewards and punishment.  I ended up quitting my job just to \"babysit\" the teen, help him with his homework, and whatever else was needed.  The ex-wife was no help either.  She wanted to be viewed as the fun parent in the boy's life, so soliciting her help was a waste of time. Honestly, the thing that kept me going through all of the lies and humiliation was knowing that when the boy turned 18, I'd have my husband all to myself.  We still loved him and tried to help him get established in a career, but when he became an adult he went to live with his mother who indulged him in all kinds of vices. A few years ago, it cost my husband and me about $10,000 to help dig my stepson out of trouble and get him on a more positive path.  Fortunately, he was at the point where he was beginning to see his life from a more objective perspective and everyone he'd fooled for years realized that they'd been hoodwinked.  They apologized to my husband and me for not believing us. Now the \"boy\" is 24 years old, married and has come to his senses. He has a wonderful relationship with his father and me.  He jokes about the trials he put us through when he was a teenager, but he respects us and appreciates our efforts to help. I strongly suggest that you and your boyfriend periodically discuss your fears, expectations strengths and weaknesses when it comes to raising children.  Watch TV shows like Super Nanny and discuss family situations you see depicted in the movies.  What was the root cause of the trouble?  What solutions worked?  What would each of you done differently?  Was the punishment too soft?  Too  harsh?  Decide in advance to stick together and just who will do what when a problem arises and how situations will be handled.  This is key. I can't help you with having other children, as my husband and I didn't have children together.  I can say, however, that because there will be such a vast age difference between his daughter and the children you expect to have that I think you'll get to feel a sense of a strong, loving family.  You might even solicit the help of his daughter in raising them.  She'll be a different--more mature, less selfish person by then.  It is very wise of you to be giving this so much thought.  I think you're going to be a great mom!  Good luck!", 9445, "i6Ix28IPaa", 1],

	92628 : ["You need to move and fast.  You are paying 85% of your income in rent and that is ridiculous!  You should never pay more than 25% of your income for housing.  That means that you should find a place for no more than $650 per month.  If you are stuck in a lease, get 3 roommates today.  If this is a home mortgage, SELL THE HOUSE!!!  While you are waiting for the house to sell, start renting rooms.   You cannot \"force the bank to stop charging interest\".  They will charge interest on the debt for as long as you owe the debt.  They don't need a \"favor\" from you, they need you to pay what you owe on time.  Having to pay late fees is a choice.  A late fee means that you chose to not pay your bill on time. Declaring bankruptcy for approximately $30,000 is just plain silly.  You need to either get your expenses down ( the rent) and get your income up.  You need to stop buying things that you cannot afford. A bankruptcy will trash your credit for about 10 years.  Not a good thing unless it teaches you to stop buying stuff on credit. Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. Or they negotiate your debt down after telling you not to pay for awhile adding another hit to your credit score. Student loans are the only debt that can garnish your wages for non payment without taking you to court first. Just list them out on a piece of paper or a spreadsheet and follow the plan. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you. A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want. B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you: 1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an \"emergency fund\" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make. 2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on. 3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example: To start : Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment Debt #1: paid off Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment Debt #3: minimum payment Debt #1: paid off Debt #2: paid off Debt #3:Minimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment. That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have. 4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty. 5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for \"fun\" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life. 5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire. 5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for y", 9446, "xoqQbHi1aa", 1],
