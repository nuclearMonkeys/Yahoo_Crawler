	110921 : ["Both fermentation and respiration begin with monosaccharides, although this can vary from molecules such as glucose, galactose, fructose, etc..., it is typically glucose (hence the first pathway in metabolism being glycolysis). Cellular respiration produces a significantly larger amount of energy, typically fermentation serves to regenerate intermediate electron carriers so that glycolysis can run continuously.  Cellular respiration involves the kreb's cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and TCA) and the electron transport chain to occur.   Alcoholic fermentation begins with pyruvate converts it into acetaldehyde and subsequently converts that into ethanol Commercial applications include use fermenting microbes to produce ethanol for alcoholic beverages, for example wine and beer Yes, anaerobic happens in the body during intense exercise where the body's need for energy exceeds the oxygen supply.  In this case, pyruvate is converted into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase in order to regenerate NAD+ and thus allowing glycolysis to run continually.  The buildup of lactate (although ebbed by the Cori cycle), results in soreness of muscles", 10159, "None", 0],

They get an amazing running back in Edge, but they can't use him. oops, they forgot to get a line, which also screwed Matt Lienart over, which screwed over Boldin and Fitzgerald.

Clinton Portis was a great back until he got injured which blew the team out of playoff contention. And last but not least, the Eagles still suck, but they got farther along than Dallas. They have a QB who can't play a full year, a running back that is twice as good as any receiver they got, and they lost Stallworth. And finally i get to your answer.
