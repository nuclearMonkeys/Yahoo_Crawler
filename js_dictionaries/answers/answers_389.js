	21184 : ["For radio controlled aeroplanes pretty much the only purposes of carrying cargo are for things like “sweet bombers” which drop sweets or small parachute loads for display purposes, or for carrying cameras. “Sweet bombers” are now obsolete because displays never allow flying over spectators any more. Flying models and spectators are now clearly separated by a crowd line which only display staff and model flyers may be in front of, and a flight line beyond which nobody is usually allowed during flying operations. But even if they were, both “sweet bombers” and parachute droppers cannot release a load from a hinged nose, especially if the nose is also carrying the propulsion system. Camera carriers also wouldn't normally use a hinged nose. If it's a decent quality video or dSLR/mirrorless camera then those are quite heavy  and must be mounted at the aeroplane C.O.G. So the access hatch for those will typically be through the side or the belly of the model. Those kinds of cameras also need to be wrapped in bulky but lightweight foam to try and save them when the model crashes. No real cargo aeroplane would ever be designed as you suggest, so it would be utterly pointless for it to occur on an RC model. The only RC models I've ever seen even remotely resembling your idea are military target drones. When shot down, the nose which contains the expensive bits will often be designed to detach completely and descend by parachute after cutting the fuel or the electricity to the engine/motor. EDIT: If you cannot work out how to construct a simple hinged side hatch or bottom hatch then you really have a total lack of the skills necessary to build a custom-design from scratch.  Also wooden ribs are for wings, not fuselages, so have nothing to do with the hatch. But additionally *NOBODY* would cover their model with CF! It's just far too heavy and in a crash it's very brittle.  I suggest that instead of this impossible fantasy-model you start by building and flying a few kits instead. They will allow you to develop the skills you need and to become familiar with materials and techniques, and after quite a few of those and the inevitable repairs they will need, you might be able to consider designing and building something from scratch.  Don't start with RC. Instead start with the open-frame balsa models built from strips of balsa wood over a model plan, and then covered with either lightweight tissue and dope (traditional, still excellent performance, and *cheap*) or with modern iron-on textiles (can be expensive). Some of those models may be gliders, other will be rubber powered.  Don't choose models of real aeroplanes to begin with: they tend to be far more complicated. Look online for modern copies of the old British KeilKraft models. They had some excellent to build designs suitable for beginners. Such as the Ace, Joker (rubber powered) and the Cadet (glider launched by hand or tow-line). The Senator was a larger and more complex glider best suited to those who had successfully built a couple of simple models already. There are loads of books (remember those!) which give comprehensive advice about how to build those models. YouTube videos are OK but simply do not go into enough depth; they do show individual tips and techniques pretty well though.", 3437, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],

A fighter jet does not need to worry about pieces from another plane getting sucked into its engines unless the other plane is VERY poorly maintained.

A plane doesn't need to worry about metal getting sucked into its engines just by tailing a plane like you mentioned, or during any other normal non-fighting situations. If the plane is shooting down another aircraft, then the plane will likely be at a distance where getting shrapnel sucked in isn't a problem.

	21194 : ["They are not invisible even to radar. What they have is a reduced radar cross section, which means that are shaped such that few of the incoming radar energy bounces back toward the emitter.

When a plane stalls, fuel usage increases because you need to increase the power to regain speed, and the time to your destination increases due to the time the plane spent being stalled and needing to regain speed. The reason why your plane was dipping down was probably because of air pressure changes. Also, pilots do whatever they can to save fuel, such as not cruising at maximum speed, flying at 30,000 - 40,000 feet where the air is so thin, and two engine planes taxiing with only one engine turned on (not sure what four engine planes do).
