Lines of people with cameras. Tim, there is a good chance that we are seeing people who are alive and well with true intelligent hauntings, but residual maybe some kind of natural recording by nature. We invented vision before sound so maybe nature is the same. In theory, nature can record sound. A bird sits on a bush and sings. The vibration travels into the branch to the tip. If the breeze blows the bush, the end of the branch may drag through damp clay. Once dry, maybe in a thousand years, you could drag a stylus through that groove and hear the bird song. Granted, there will be no hi-fi there but there you go. Maybe nature can somehow do the same with vision, showing a replay of some event. The events that have been seen to repeat are often mundane things, an old woman picking flowers maybe. They are not always reenactments of famous battles or executions. Maybe some sort of mirror effect that reflects time. I can only give buts and maybe's but it sure shows that we don't know everything.", 2047, "FFMhfwYzaa", -1],

	12238 : ["\"Where will all these man hating feminists go when answers shuts down?\" They won't go anywhere.  Man hating feminists exist, and will continue to exist right out in public as that specific hate remains politically correct.  Even a larger proportion of the public agrees with their hatred of men and especially White men now.  It's sad tbh. Feminists are actually surprised when they received push back for their hatred of men.  That's what's so funny about all of this.  We've shown all of this feminist misandry to be what it is for years here, and right to the bitter end, even self-proclaimed feminists remain unapologetic for their hateful, misandrist sisters that they support. We have made no strides towards respect between the sexes, primary because too many self-proclaimed feminists continue to make excuses for extremist feminism as pushed by the most prominent feminists in the movement.  The dynamic between ideologically aligned feminists, and random unaligned men will remain the same, and even worsen in the coming years as the new paradigm is for us to remain divided by not speaking to each other.  The offence culture of the Left is going to guarantee that we never speak to each other any longer because any criticism of their ideology is deemed \"hate speech\" and thus there is no diversity of opinion that enters their world.  This Yahoo forum was at least good for bringing us together where we had to get along and be exposed to alternate opinions, even if it made us uncomfortable. .", 2052, "aSm9xSn3aa", 3],
