Generally, NCO, lead the troops through the process of getting the task done (the task which is determined by the commissioned officer). Officers (commissioned) do not enlist, they get \"commissioned\".  The only time this is different is when a solider goes through training to end his/her enlistment and become commissioned.  Officers usually are more involved in determining what needs to be done (then the NCO's take over and see it gets done).   As far as office work, that depends on the job of the soldier.

Commissioned officers normally have been college educated and serve as the \"white collar\" portion of the military.  They carry more responsibilities than the NCO's, except for the senior NCOs. The NCO is the one who handles the troops more-so on a daily basis.  The officers give the idea of what must be done and the NCO is the one who makes it happen.
