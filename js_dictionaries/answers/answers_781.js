Those who poo poo vinyl and claim digital is better simply have never heard good analog playback and spew specification numbers to tell you, see the numbers tell you its better.  As if higher dynamic range numbers tell you its going to give you superior sound. Much more to better sound then some numbers. Those are the same people who think and buy speakers and equipment by specifications.  That is simply because they don't trust their own ears.  ", 6275, "xOTjA3Woaa", 0],

You can look up the last indigenous sovereign state in the land of Israel prior to modern Israel - the (post-Biblical) Jewish Hasmonean Kingdom of Judah; capital Jerusalem. The name: \"Palestinians\" aka \"Palestinian people, the\", originates from about 1964, when the \"Palestinian\" Arabs changed their name to suit their unverifiable territorial claims.  - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “When was the “Palestinian people” actually created? Simply using the Google Ngram Viewer* provides the answer. Ngram is a database that charts the frequency that a given phrase appears in books published between the years 1500 to 2008.

Compared with the \"Palestinian\" Arabs who breached the Accords, Israel has kept to the Accords, so that consequently there is no evidence Israel would remove the \"Palestinian\" Arab squatters. The “Palestinian Arabs” dropped the name “Arab” because they do not want you to understand they mostly originate from Foreign-Arab-Migrant-Workers who came to the land of Israel just prior to, and during the British Mandate, to take advantage of higher wages through Jewish returnee-exiles:  - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “[...] most Arabs in British Mandate Palestine were migrant workers and descendants of the 1832-1947 wave of Arab/Muslim immigration from Egypt, the Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, Libya, North Africa, Bosnia, India, Afghanistan, etc. While the British Mandate encouraged Arab immigration, it blocked Jewish immigration.” Extract source: - - - - End of extract - - - - Research (2014) on 1,000 “Palestinian” Arab surnames ranked them (numbered them) in order of the highest instances of each surname found in the Palestine region. It also then identified the country(ies) having the highest incidence of those surnames; whether of “Palestine” or other countries. I examined the first 100 of those ranked “Palestinian” Arab surnames (from the total of 1,000 ranked surnames), which makes a 10% sample. Of the sample first 100 ranked “Palestinian” Arab surnames: 16 surnames had the highest incidence in the Palestine region. The remaining 84 “Palestinian” Arab surnames had the highest incidence in countries other than the Palestine region, as follows: 35 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Egypt. 11 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Iraq. 9 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Yemen. 7 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Syria. 6 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Jordan. 6 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Pakistan. 3 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Nigeria. 2 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Sudan. 2 ranked surnames had highest incidence in India. 1 ranked surname had highest incidence in Tanzania. 1 ranked surname had highest incidence in Saudia Arabia. 1 ranked surname had highest incidence in Bangladesh.

My extract source document: “Country Origin of Palestinian Arab Surnames.pdf” - information source “forebears.io”: Why did the “Palestinian” Arabs decide to falsely-claim they are native to the land of Israel?  The purpose of League of Nations Mandates such as the one awarded to Great Britain, was to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people:  - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “Two governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a “sacred trust of civilisation” to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.”  Extract source:  - - - - End of extract - - - - The \"Palestinian\" Arabs attached to the land of Israel - Really?
