So we can throw them into the Font, for Baptism. And reinter into the Grave, afterwards.  Heard this one in the Mission Field.   What a joke ! How dumb can you be ?????

As for speaking to you abruptly, she must be bored, lonely, feeling unattached to her guy etc etc, and needs some innocuous chit speaking to a chum she hasn't been in touch with for an prolonged time (or merely want trouble-free interest). And, some women overthink issues, so she probable blocked you and do up all those strange preparations on a similar time as thinking \"i wish you do no longer fall in love with me interior the technique\". So it sort of feels she's taking precautions(and attempting to make her existence much less boring). besides, in case you think of she's no longer nicely worth some time, merely forget approximately approximately her. it must be merely me yet i've got faith this female is merely... messing around. maximum women do rather. xD sturdy success!", 9317, "iQdU0uFzaa", 0],

I've pretty much heard it all. The best advice I ever got was not to listen to it.  I personally can't help it since it's my job - so I try to ignore it.  In my experience it is easier to ignore the criticism, since the critics obviously aren't going to listen to you anyway.  But -here's the way it works - when your critics wonder why you are so consistently joyful, why you do good things, and why you appear to be a good person, they are going to come to you and start asking questions.  Then you know that they have opened their ears and you can begin to answer real questions.  Unfortunately you can't win them all.", 9315, "5hfI0AJGaa", 13],

You need to tell her that you understand how she feels, but that you do want to be with her and if she says she cant do that, then its not worth torturing yourself for the next year or longer, who knows, she might meet someone else between now and then and then you are SOL. So, if she says she cant be with you then u need to ask her to not text/call u like she does. Otherwise, you are going to become her \"back burner\", the guy she runs to when her other bfs break up with her or hurt her, if she wont commit to you now, it wont change. You'll be her safe guy she knows will be there, but she wont ever commit fully to you, girls do this a lot. We feel like we need a safety net, but its really not fair to the guy.  So bottom line... tell her u need an answer now, if the answer is yes..great, if its no.. then u cant call/text her till u get over it, only time will help.", 9318, "m23fseoOaa", 0],

If you want to be with her, make it happen. and if she just keeps telling you no then i don't think she is very into you, at 17 girls are focused on high school boys, maybe if you offer to take her to lunch during school, then other guys will see that shes being pursued by an older guy. you seem like a great guy, so if she says no then she doesn't deserve you.

Well i didn't read all but i did read your problum don't pressure a girl to ask you out! by even bringing it up look, stay confident, chill, be a gentlemen, see other people, and just kick back and relax!! keep texting, don't be fake, and just be patient, she will come around get used to the idea that she's not yours for now, she probably will see other people int this process but wait for the reward  if you love her remember love conqers all. ask to hang out with her treat her to a movie? goto a park  get private during that process let her talk and don't maajor flirt flirt if she does only  or it will just seem like you just wanna use her if she complains about her self don't over do it with the compliments just say  your not ugly at all. in a casual way. and yeah yeah you get it. you seem sweet  don't let anyone change that (Not even her)", 9318, "b5c5747f9eb1e0f7b3376487fb54ec60aa", 0],

Another problem could be that she is younger than you and she may be a little immature (im not makin accusations im just thinking). If it hurts you to talk to her then don't talk to her for a while and i don't me a month i mean until she either makes up her mind or decides to be friends. You should tell her how you feel and how much it hurts you to talk to her and how it depresses you and tell her you don't want to talk for a while.
