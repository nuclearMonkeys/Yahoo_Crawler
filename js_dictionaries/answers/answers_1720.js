I had a pretty tough childhood but I'm sure most of us have been there. I use to just hate everything and everybody, didn't want anyone close to me what so ever, I would put walls up everywhere and I got the additude that I just didn't care so just **** everything right but I was so miserable and I meant a man that I have been with for 7 years, I kinda let him go but kinda considering... anyways I tried everything so that he wouldn't like me but nothing worked and he still goes through somethings because of my outlook on things sometimes and it is so hard to get out of that world of misery man I know I was like that for at least 15 years. I got sick of myself, I couldn't stand myself. I had to figure out what was really bothering me and it took sometime but once I knew I took just baby steps to just keep my head up about things and it took along time to be positive about things and I'm telling you I just started really smilin again this year and when I started it made my face hurt i haven't smiled in so long lol. Listen you need to sit and think about what's really going on, even write down somethings just brain storm and it could be alot of things but just take a little tiny thing to start with and try and make it better. You need to feel good about yourself regardless of what others think of you. When you start to love yourself you will notice a heavy load lift of your shoulders. It's very hard to get started with this but you can do it, don't keep people out of your life because you hurt, and it hurts to let people near your heart trust me I know, it took me along time but I still don't let my guard down until I know I can trust ya know. You have to let go of the past, thats the only way you will move forward. Your a great person so come on lift your head up and look at the world. Who cares what others think, you live for you so what ever you want to do in life go for it and just try and like your self and soon enough you will love yourself. I know that you'll be okay but you do need support, I had a few friends there for me but I did most of if on my own. I just had to get back to being me and once I did wow what a feeling, it's awesome. Well sorry so long but I hope you got something of help, take care.", 9407, "None", 3],

	91717 : ["global warming affects both seasons, it makes the weather more extreme. so thats hotter summers and colder winters, its actually likely that an ice age comes next due to the global warming because the earth's climate goes in cycles, these extreme temperatures are actually more signs than just hotter weather overall.", 9401, "nDnMjc2Uaa", 0],
	91718 : ["Well, I'm no scientist but I've heard different reasons why global warming could actually cause colder weather in some parts of the world; the first is that warmer temperatures cause more evaporation, which results in more precipitation and hence snow.  However, due to greater weather extremes and air movement as a result of temperature changes in some places, the location(s) of that precipitation is less predictable and/or consistent.  Therefore we would likely see extended periods of drought in some areas and more snowfall/cold weather concentrate in other areas-sometimes in unexpected locations where the weather has been more moderate in the past. The second thing that I heard is that as the ice cap melts, the changes in sea temperature will affect and slow ocean currents, which will eventually bring lower air temperatures across much of Europe.  As the current slows (and stops?) the temperatures there actually cool and winters could become quite severe where they have been relatively mild in the past.  Think alpine skiing in Ireland. However, while temperature and weather extremes result in colder weather in some locations, average GLOBAL temperature increases. It surprises me how so many people seem to be making decisions about whether or not mankind-caused global warming is occurring based on their local weather conditions and then act as if they are experts qualified to lecture and educate other people about whether or not it is actually happening.  I mean...when did lay people become scientists, pundits become weathermen and politicians become climatologists?  All I am commenting on here is what I have read and/or heard about changing weather patterns due to global warming, I'm no expert.  And so far it certainly seems to be benefitting me; I live out in the country in the northern midwest-crop yields and growing season are increasing here and decreasing elsewhere...it's been so long since I had to really clear snow in the winter I traded off my large tractor mounted snowblower four years ago and haven't missed it since...heating days in the winter are declining-yesterday it was 66 degrees here.  Something dramatic, long-term and unusual is happening and I think it is greedy and ignorant to dismiss the influence that human activity may be having on the weather worldwide based on what is occurring locally.  Judging from what is happening here in my area, I should actually be devoting all my efforts to putting MORE greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, not less.  But that would be as foolish and short-sighted as poo-pooing global warming just because it snowed last week someplace else.  It's hard to grasp the whole picture, though.", 9401, "RX2Q95Lgaa", 1],

Plus, that many cats can pose a health problem. Try finding the humane society online, and e-mail them about what to do... if you don't do something, the group will keep growing, and the neighbor still lacking any responsibility. The worst thing I can think of is a wild cat, because we have some in our neighborhood... they kill birds and anything else small they can get... it's sad for any animal to live that way. My advice is to contact a rescue place -- or animal control as a last resort. at this point those cats aren't pets, not in such a large group. they're dangerous.

	91732 : ["Depression has its roots in anger. This requires therapy to deal with and sometimes a psychiatrist may prescribe antidepressants. A big question here: do you think you might hurt yourself or hurt anyone else? If the answer is yes, then you should call your local hospital ER IMMEDIATELY because you need help asap. If the answer is no, then you need to find a good counselor and seek therapy.  If you are under 18 you need to talk to your parents, school counselor, religious leader or another adult who can help you. If you are over 18, you can still speak to these people but you can also get some help yourself. Still, when you feel really in that \"I don't care\" frame of  mind, it can be hard to do ANYTHING so getting some help finding someone is still a good idea.  Everyone goes through periods of depression in their lives but at different levels. Some are because of circumstances (divorce, death of someone close to you, financial problems, school difficulties, etc.) and that usually is fixed with some therapy teaching you how to handle the bumps in life. Other depression can come from a biological reason - a chemical imbalance in the brain where not enough seratonin (the chemical that makes you feel good) is produced. That is why antidepressants help because they stabilize your seratonin levels. They are NOT happy pills contrary to what others say. You still feel the same emotions but you can now handle them in a normal fashion.  Not all antidepressants work the same for each person. You may find undesirable side effects or that they just don't work. You may need to take several before finding one that really helps you out. And they take several weeks to start to work so you need some patience.  There is nothing embarrassing about getting some help. It isn't any different than having an illness like diabetes or cancer. Mental issues are serious and need care just like physical ones. Go ask someone for help immediately. And, like I said, if you are at ALL thinking suicidal or harmful thoughts towards yourself or others, you need to get help right away! Good luck and hope you feel better soon. It may take awhile but you CAN feel better again. You  just need to ask for some help.", 9407, "q53i8O0Daa", 1],
	91733 : ["What are you doing that's hurting other people?  What kind of stupid mistakes are you making?  I think I understand where you're coming from.  I felt the same way once but I don't know if my situation was different because I'm not sure what you're doing.  If you provide that info, I might have a more specific answer for you. Well for now I'll just take a shot in the dark:  You've lost something.  It's something that gave you purpose, pride, identity, direction or stability (maybe even a lot of somethings).  It could be a job, a goal, a person, or even yourself.  Maybe you've tried to call out for help.  Maybe while you did, no one heard you.  So you feel like, what's the point?  Why does it matter anymore?  Obviously if it doesn't matter to anyone else, why should it matter to me?  You feel lost and trapped.  Maybe you don't like yourself.  Maybe you hate yourself.  It's hurtful but you're sick of hurting.  Then it becomes a defense mechanism to just not care anymore.  What will happen, will happen.  It doesn't matter because whatever happens, it can't be worse than where you are now.  Maybe sometimes in your numbness you'll find your conscience when you hurt someone else, which also brings you a little hurt yourself.  It confuses you because you're numb to protect yourself but your conscience tells you it's wrong because you're hurting somebody. You should find something, just one thing that will help you find good....good in the world, in life, in others and in yourself.  Get rid of everything that you know is destructive...right this second.  Eventually you'll be able to care again because all of the things left in your life will be worth caring about.", 9407, "uyKV00Dfaa", 0],
