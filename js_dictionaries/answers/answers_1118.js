Personally I like using a pencil,much easier and almost just as nice,and you can use it all around your eye(emo eyes) and with liquid it looks real weird.It costs less too.

	61386 : ["I prefer to use the liquid liner. Maybelline has a fabulous one; I forget the name of it but the bottle is cone shaped and silver with a black top. There are two kinds, the type with the felt tip and the type with the brush. Read the bottle carefully. I prefer the felt tip because it doesn't move around as much as the brush does. At first I wasn't too good at applying it, but after a few weeks I really got the hang of it and now I could put it on in a moving vehicle if I needed to. I have found it to look harsher than a pencil liner, so what I usually do is let the liquid liner dry and then use an angular makeup brush with black eyeshadow on it to go over the eyeliner. It has the look of a pencil but with the staying power and ease of the liquid. If you prefer pencils, I reccommend sharpening it and then using a lighter to melt the tip for a second. Literally, a second. If you leave it too long the tip will be too mushy; if you don't do it long enough it won't be mushy enough. (You can only learn with practice) You also don't want to leave it too long because it will be too hot on your eye. Test it on the back of your hand before touching it to the sensitive skin above your eyes. When you light the pencil eyeliner, the color comes out a lot richer and has the appearance of a liquid. I also think a liquid is more convenient because you don't need to sharpen it. I always misplace my sharpener.", 8119, "ysL9DoORaa", 1],

But in some cases it's also a better idea to work only with the numerators of the fractions (if they have the same denominator). Also, remember that when dividing fractions you are actually multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the other one. Example: 2/9 divided by 5/8 ==> 2/9 / (5/8) divided (/) by 5/8 ==> times (x) 8/5 (reciprocal of 5/8) 2/9 / (5/8) = 2/9 x 8/5 = (2 x 8) / (9 x 5) = 16 / 45 NOTE: If the fraction can be simplified, do it. In this case 16 and 45 can't be simplified but they can be presented as a decimal (16/45 = 0.35). Hope this helped and good luck! :)", 8124, "nB2hu16uaa", 0],
	61430 : ["What do you mean by \"do\" your eyebrows? There are a couple different methods to taking care of them. One is waxing, which can be painful depending upon your skin's sensititivity, not to mention--one slip-up and half of your eyebrow can be gone. I've gotten mine waxed a lot, but lately I've preferred just tweezing. As for knowing how much to tweeze, hold a pencil up the side of your nose, and where the pencil meets your forehead is how long your eyebrows should stretch to. Then hold the pencil from the corner of your eye towards your hairline, and that's the other boundary for your brow. Not to mention, there are templates you can get to make sure you don't over-tweeze, and magazines you can read that feature articles about shaping your eyebrows. But the main problem here is that you would be doing these things against your mother's word. Try talking to her calmly, saying that you won't over-do the tweezing, and not do anything drastic.
