Assange agreed to be the \"fall guy\" when they began leaking the US Cables and the video of the killing of news cameraman in Afganistan that had been covered up and lied about by the US military. google \"Collateral Murder\". He fully expected that the organization would function better if one person was available to speak for the organization against the charges he expected would be leveled against wikileaks. I'm not sure he expected such a long effort to get him extradited to the US although he did expect that he might be assassinated or tortured if he ended up in US hands. (just like they are doing to Bradley Manning)..  wikileaks continues to get and to publish releases from a variety of sources. The most recent involves warrant-less spying on US citizens using a network of cameras all over the country, facial recognition software and vast computer databases.  It's assumed that the effort to get him extradited is all part of the cover up waged by companies hired by shadow government organizations. One such company HBGary, was caught planning to place fake stories and attribute them to wikileaks in an effort to discredit them. They were setting up networks of \"bots\" to place stories and comments online to push up ratings of comments in social media sites that were against wikileaks to further push public opinion.  Currently wikileaks websites are under attack by similar groups that claim to be independent, but are actually driven by these private \"computer security\" companies which are actually just \"conservative think tanks\" and manipulators of the news media.", 9479, "None", 0],

	93308 : ["You do have the right to free speech.  As far as I know no one has been thrown in jail lately for voicing their beliefs.  The only time I know of is if someone got violent at a rally or something or if they were disturbing the general peace.  I agree with you on the gay marriage thing.  I don't believe there should be any restrictions on them, but unfortunately not everything is as black and white as we'd like it to be.  There are forces at work that most Americans aren't aware of such.  Money is changing hands and votes are being bought.  For example.  One of the reasons why the Republican party is so opposed to gay marriages is because they get a great deal of money in campaign contributions from the religious right wing, which in case you don't know is basically the really hardcore religious fanatics.  Although what is sad is the biggest contributions to these party members are by some of the most dishonest people out there.  Some of these people are pastors and because they're pastors people believe them when they say it's God's will that gays should not marry.  We are supposed to be free this is true, but it's our own fault really.  I may have this quote wrong as far as who said it, but I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said \"Government is too big and too important to be left to the politicians.\"  We, the people , are not nearly as involved as we should be in the working and goings on of our governement.  This may be due to laziness or just plain fear of reprisals.  The people should not fear their government.  The government should fear it's people.", 9469, "AA11466460", 0],

In some part of the world, you can jailed for something like this. As far as I know, no one has been thrown into jail for voicing their opinions.  They were jailed for their actions, such as doing it in places such things are prohibited, or directly inciting violence.
