Ernestine Wade played small roles in films like Critic's Choice in 1963 and Bernardine, usually playing the maid. She supplemented her income by playing the organ for funerals and as an office worker. She was heard as the voice of Veronica's Aunt in the ABC Saturday Superstar Movie presentation of Willie Mays and The Say-Hey Kid in 1972 and seen in guest roles on Family Affair in 1966, That's My Mama in 1974 and many others. She died in April 1983. Amanda Randolph (Sapphire's Mama) worked steadily as an actor after the show ended. She appeared occasionally in B-movies like Bomba and the Jungle Girl, She's Working Her Way Through College (both from 1952) and A Man Called Peter in 1955. On radio she took over the role of Aunt Jemima in the mid-fifties; on TV, she assumed the role of the maid Louise on Make Room for Daddy from 1955 to 1964. Amanda Randolph died in August 1967 of a stroke.  Lillian Randolph (Madame Queen) was seen in minor roles in films like Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte in 1964 and The Onion Field in 1979. On television, she was a regular on The Great Gildersleeve in 1955, Tom and Jerry in 1965, The Bill Cosby Show in 1969 (as Rose Kincaid, Bill's mom), Tenafly in 1973 and as Sister Sara in the mini-series Roots in 1977. She died in September 1980 of cancer.  Tim Moore (Kingfish) was rarely on TV outside of appearances on the Jack Parr Tonight show, but he would attend TV and radio conventions as a representative of CBS for several years after Amos 'n' Andy left the air. He talked of reviving the character on TV, but nothing came of it; he also had a nightclub act for a while. Moore made headlines (\"Police Hook Kingfish for Beef Over Roast\") and was arrested in 1958 when he fired a gun at a gathering of some of his freeloading in-laws. \"I'm the old Kingfish,\" Moore told cops at the scene. \"You should have seen the in-laws scatter when I fired that gun!\" Tim Moore died soon after in December 1958 of tuberculosis. Spencer Williams (Andy) rarely acted on TV again; like Tim Moore, he had come out of retirement to do the show. He composed the filmography for St. Louis Blues in 1958 but mostly led a quiet life in West LA before passing away in July 1965 from kidney disease.  Alvin Childress (Amos) appeared in bit parts on a number of series including Perry Mason, Sanford and Son, Good Times and many others. He died in April 1986 from Parkinson's disease & diabetes .  Jester Hairston (aristocratic Henry Van Porter) had a film, radio and TV career that spanned six decades - he's most well-known to modern audiences for his role on Amen as Rolly Forbes from 1986 until 1991. He was seen in films like In the Heat of the Night in 1967, Lady Sings the Blues in 1972, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka in 1988 and Being John Malkovich in 1999. An esteemed Choral Director as well as actor, he died in January 2000 of natural causes. Johnny Lee (Algonquin J. Calhoun) voiced Br'er Rabbit in Song of the South in 1946, later turning up in small roles in motion pictures, including North to Alaska in 1960. Sadly, the roles Lee played were mostly as cooks, janitors and the 'Colored Man.' He died in December 1965 of a heart attack. Nick (aka Nicodemus) Stewart (Lightnin') and his wife, Edna converted an old garage into the first Ebony Showcase Theatre using cast-off materials from the old CBS building which was being demolished. They supported the Ebony Showcase Theater with money made from his acting career - he voiced Brer Bear in Disney's Song of the South and the Splash Mountain ride at the Disney theme parks. He had small roles in It's A Mad Mad Mad World and Silver Streak. In 1995, Stewart was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Science's ARCHIVE OF AMERICAN TELEVISION for his lifetime of work. He lost a bitter fight with the City of Los Angeles over his theater, which was demolished before his very eyes, shortly before his death in December 18, 2000 of natural causes. He was the last surviving Amos 'n' Andy cast member.  R.I.P. to you all, you are missed.", 9591, "fxuPCUyLaa", 3],
