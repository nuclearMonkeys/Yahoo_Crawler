Although, in relationship to say a John Kerry, who has more wealth than Obama, Obama is just a guy with money, not a particularly wealthy guy. Obama does not relate with the working folks.  He worked for a law firm that represented slum-lords and he never had the decency to quit that firm and work for a more humane law firm. Obama entered the election campaign late when The Establishment realized that Hillary Clinton really was going to run, and The Establishment wanted Obama to run to take votes away from the real Democrats Kucinich, Dodd, Biden and Edwards.  And then when Obama entered the election race, he talked like a Repugnican all through 2007 up until the Iowa Caucus, and now he talks \"like a Democrat\".  He still talks like a Repugnant Party member every now and then, if you pay attention! AND... Obama very prejudiciously practices sexist discrimination against Hillary Clinton, and it is not by only occasional faux-pas naivete by Obama!  Every time Obama puts his hand on Clinton's shoulder, every time there is a camera recording it and Obama shakes her hand like he is dancing with her and she is his meek female dancing partner, every time he entices her to react in good humor the photo-op shows Obama skillfully poses her with him looking DOWN on her so she has to look up at him as if she is in awe of him, as if she was in a romantic situation (he was coached recently in a hurry by The Establishment in exactly the same way as George Bush was coached by Karl Rove and company for two years to be president back in 1998-1999!!!!)

I don't look down on Catholics, nor do I think other religions are better than yours.  BUT! I always did find in my experience that Catholics are more quick to point fingers at the \"wrongs\" of other religions than let's say Pentecostals (I'm just using their religion as a point to make, that's it) do.
