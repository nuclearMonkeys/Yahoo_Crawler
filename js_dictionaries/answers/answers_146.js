	7308 : ["Most mammals have light skin that is covered by fur, and biologists believe that EARLY HUMAN ANCESTORS started out this way also. Dark skin probably evolved after humans lost their body fur, because the naked skin was vulnerable to the strong UV radiation. We all came from pale skinned Africans. Lucy had pale skin under her body hair. So did H.Erectus, Denisovans and Neanderthals. We all came from pale skinned Africans. So humanity literally wouldn't exist without white skinned people.

Peking man and Java man were members of H. erectus, not Neanderthals. So-called Homo heidelbergensis may simply be H. erectus with a slightly larger brain.  Adam and Eve are the mythical ancestor of modern humans, H. sapiens. H. sapiens evolved in Africa 200,000 years ago, long after the ancestors of Neanderthals had left Africa.  H. sapiens did not leave Africa until 60,000 years ago,  Modern humans evolved in Africa from H. erectus, so indeed all modern humans were originally Africans. Non-Africans evolved from a small group of Africans, closely related to the San Bushmen, that left Africa 60,000 years ago. So, if you are European or Asian, then you are more closely related to the San Bushmen than you are to West Africans.

So SEX is given far too much weighting and can then be used as a weapon by women against men.  Simply because it isn't possible for a man to claim he has been raped by a woman.  So the penalties are one way only.  ie extremely sexist, archaic, outmoded and no longer valid.", 1187, "Y1NTL6p2aa", 1],
