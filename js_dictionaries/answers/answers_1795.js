	95477 : ["I think it is a mid life crisis.  Money problems and being able to communicate are the biggest causes of unhappy marriages. Why  is this coming up after the third child?  In Canada we have to go through counselling and finalize a separation agreement before we can start divorce proceedings.  AND Dads aren't allowed to walk out on their children without some money going towards their support until they are 18 years of age. Men often get stressed out at this age - 35 years - when they realize that they are working on a mortgage, making payments and trying to keep it all together and it isn't fun all the time.  It is hard to get regular sex which is why many of us got together,  when there are kids in the house and all the issues of babies, nappies and food on the table and laundry, work, the yard, the chores, etc.   Then at the age of 50 men start to lighten up and realize that life is short and they will be retired in 15 more years and maybe even dead.  At 50 men will sometimes start a new life or get new interests like a new car or boat or travel - the big trick is to get women to the same place - after going through menopause - so that you can have a good life together full of fun and companionship as well as taking care of family responsibilities. He made need some time and space.  Is it possible that he should change careers - go back to school - and follow his career dreams?  My husband finally became a marine engineer at 35 years of age.  We really started having fun when he was 50 and our mortgage was paid off and he passed away at 64 from cancer - I sure miss him.  Give your husband some time and space and stay positive and not nag him to death.  If you have to sell the family home you should get half the money from the sale to put towards your own house.  You both need some marriage and divorce counselling.  Good luck.   I survived my first husband's leaving me with 2 kids in the woods and with only 11 cents to my name when I was 21 years old.  My next husband was a wonderful man with whom I spent 23 happy years, albeit a few snags here and there when I changed jobs and careers and my kids left home, but all in all a really happy relationship full of fun and talk and beer and chocolate - he used to bring me flowers and I always had beer and chocolate in the fridge for him.", 9550, "kl8kLg8naa", 2],

You don't want to do that and have to move on top of getting a new direction. Go for a legal separation. This will determine how much support you get and how the bills will be paid. It will also determine visitation. He sprung this on you out of the blue you need time to adjust and get a plan for what goes on in your future.  If you have lived in the home for a decent amount of time you both have vested equity. If you can work and pay some of the mortgage and both your names are on the papers you may be able to stay there. Consider getting a border to help with the costs.

But it was written Caius!  and pronounced Gaius. 2- the nomen, which in this case is Julius, because Caesar was from the Julii family.  So it was a family name. 3- the cognomen, is almost like a surname, a nickname.  In this case Caesar. So it is Caius Julius Caesar (pronounced Gaius Julius Caesar) who was the same and only Julius Caesar, the one who conquered the Gauls and wrote the Commentarii de bello Gallico, or Comments about the Gallic war. Historians therefore can choose between Julius Caesar, Caesar, and Gaius Julius Caesar, and even Caius Julius Caesar.

Gaius, Caesar's first name, was largely unimportant, and would not be spoken unless he was being announced.

	95518 : ["Giants will have a better record than the bears. eli manning is better than jay cutler will ever be. Bradshaw and Jacobs is more dynamic than Forte, who's still fussing over his contract. manningham/nicks is better than knox/hester. If osi decides to actually play, their pass rush is going to be great. i have a feeling pierre-paul or however you spell his name is going to breakout this year with at least 7 sacks. Tuck, Kiwanuka, pierre-paul and osi is a QB nightmare. Prince is like a CB version of stafford. if he's able to stay healthy, that should help their secondary with rollie, phillips, webster and rose. plus, if the giants face the bears, i wonder how badly they'll destroy jay cutler like last time. Not signing kevin boss was a wtf move too. When asked about plaxico, eli was iffy/ehh about it. when asked about boss, you can clearly hear in his voice and his words that eli manning wanted boss back and the giants didn't even do that. though, eli manning's epicness will overcome the loss of boss", 9549, "Ve20gOI7aa", 1],

He was a good WR, and the Giants had a good duo with him and Nicks. They must know something we don't. But nonetheless, they still have a good O, I agree people just hate Eli because he didn't want to go to the Chargers when they drafted him. He is a good QB, people say he had a terrible year in 2010, he actually threw for 4,000 yds, and 31 TD's. And Giants D is also as good or better than the Bears. I think Osi will end up signing though. He's crying over money the same way Lance Briggs(ironically for the Bears) was crying over wanting a new contract, even after Urlacher TOOK A FREAKING PAY CUT to keep him there. Both are selfish, both good, and as Briggs ended up signing, so will Umenyiora.", 9549, "Bun1UZdgaa", 0],

Obviously a QB comparison doesn't matter, but I think the Bears are highly overrated, while the Giants may not be great, but they have more talent.", 9549, "DmaKycXraa", -2],
	95521 : ["Start Thomas and Smith. Thomas isn't listed on the Dolphin's injury list so he should be a go against the SD Chargers. The Dolphins have a good history against the Chargers (4-1 in the last decade) and Chargers defense are susceptible to the run. Thomas should get you 8-10. As he always has been, Steve Smith is the main man in Carolina and his amazing onfield chemistry with Cam Newton makes him a must start each week. Carolina faces a tough and stingy Chicago Bears defense but if the Panther offensive coordinators pay attention to how the Saints and Packers were able to dismantle the Bears defense and orchestrate a similar game plan, Newton should be able to get the ball into Smith's hands during the game.  As for a replacement RB, Kendall Hunter is the hot topic in most leagues nowadays. With Gore being out due to his sprained ankle, Kendall Hunter has the opportunity to make a name for himself against an Eagle's defense who has given up gallops of 47, 61 and 37 and are currently ranked 30th in rush defense. Also, with the QB crisis in Indy, Joseph Addai is gonna be relied heavy upon in the following weeks until this QB situation is resolved. So while Carter relieves Addai of carries, there's a very slim chance that he gets more than 6-10 carries per week.  Good luck!", 9550, "nLRLwJ7daa", 0],
