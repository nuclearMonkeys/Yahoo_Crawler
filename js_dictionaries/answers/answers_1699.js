Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.\" As a Christian I have to say that I am very glad that you are respecting my sister's choice in abstention :) And I'm sure it will pay off one day if you get married to her :) I know it cannot be easy on your position to have to wait now, especially when their is most likely temptations involved like with sleeping with just bottoms on.

Microwaving only adds heat and cooks the product, you won't get any beneficial side effects like caramelization like you would if you grilled or fried it. etc. Microwaves are typically used for reheating already cooked foods, like leftovers, frozen dinners, frozen veggies, and sometimes things like hot chocolate, tea, coffee. Veggies can be \"steamed\" by microwaving them in a bowl with a small amount of water. Many times microwaves will include directions on the inside of the door.

You've been in this relationship for five years and neither of you want's to burden each other with there problems ? To me that's a huge red flag honey and it tells me there might be a lack of communication here. If your feeling this bad all the time  then perhaps its time to break up and move on. Ok, well one sided communication in a relationship will always cause stress honey. You may not want to stress him any more than he is. But the problem with that is the issues that are causing the stress never get dealt with. Its like a blister you don't treat, it just keeps coming back and is more painful.", 9368, "None", 0],

And it's been fun picking the favors so far. :) Here are the matchbooks I ordered, which were a good price:  I got the ivory, but they also sell assorted colors: I wanted match boxes because I thought they were a little nicer, but they're more expensive, and since I'm doing so much already, I went for the less expensive ones.

I felt stupid, betrayed, angry and very foolish especially with the ones that i took back. Now infidelity is unforgiveable there will be no more second chances. My experience has been that no matter how good of a woman/man you are, no matter how good you look, if someone wants to cheat, they are going to do it.  Life is too short, there are too many diseases, and I refuse to let someone touch, kiss, or make love to me if he has been with someone else.

It is the most horrible feeling i have ever felt and i wouldnt wish it on anyone. Read all the answers in this site to ppl who ask if they should. All the married ppl try to persuade others not to do this, and to leave thier current partners first then go and do what you want. I totally agree. If all my old g/f had left me first then did what they wanted i wouldnt have given a sh*t. But the other way hurts to many ppl, just to get off on someone else.

People always say, \"Do you have a pen I can borrow for a second?\"  Everyone uses pens.   Only smokers use matches, and I cannot stand to be around the smell of cigarette smoke.  It makes me sick.
