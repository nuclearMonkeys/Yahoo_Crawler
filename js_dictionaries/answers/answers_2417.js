	126677 : ["It sounds like you have found a way to live in a far away city; you may not be living with a lot of \"things\" other than your self but, you will be making a living.  A whole person includes their outer shell and their inner soul....My advice is to go. What you indicate, but don't fully verbalize, is that you have a known support system in your mother's house.  It is not great but, it will keep a roof over your head, food in your belly, and probably clothes on your back.  On the other hand, if you move lock, stock, and barrel to a \"city far away\", you will not have a support system in place when you get there.  A support system does include living essentials (like food and shelter) but, it also includes companionship, encouragement, guidance, etc...  Further, whether your mother's house is all that bad or not, we'll assume that it is for this discussion, you are certainly sorting through a number of feelings, emotions, behaviors of others, behaviours of your self, patterns, interpersonal dynamics, and more.  Having a healthy support system sure would be beneficial upon your move. Now, before your move, you might want to check into domestic violence groups, the YWomenCA (YWCA), and even Al-A-Non groups in the area you are moving to.  Attempt to make contact and see what they offer in terms of free groups meetings, counseling, and more.  If you belong to a church, attempt to make contact with a church of a similar faith in the new area.  Or, you might even want to check out churches in the new area on-line to see what types of activities they support.  Also, check into the food banks, clothing banks, and other social services in the new area- it helps to know about them before you need them.  Some where in this mix, you're going to need to find a place to live too.   With respect to your mother......It sounds like she believes that she has the answer(s) for you.  It sounds as if she may even be frightened for you if you reach beyond the path(s) she views as workable.  -  I will say that moving lock, stock, and barrel into a strange city with no support system and no one to know if you're alive or dead can be risky if you do not do your homework ahead of time.  Honestly examine how naive you may be and how you can establish some type of a support system and/or network before and/or as you move. -  But, my guess is that while she may not support you financially nor emotionally in this move, she will not fully cut you off either.  Try to call her once a week or so once you move; if needed, call at bad times so that your call has to go to the answering machine or voice mail.  Do not fall into the trap that many fall into when you do call by lieing and sugar coating how things are going.  Do give her names of the people you know./meet and the places you go to; that is unless you think she is going to follow you in some way.  My guess is that should you decide to come back home, the door would be somewhat open to you; the price will be to acknowledge that you need to come back home and under her wing.   If your mother and/or mother's household depends upon you financially...giving her some warning would be nice.  But, it sounds like you have already given her some warning.", 10907, "iBitNRZuaa", 0],

	126687 : ["First of all, I have never heard that question asked, anywhere. Maybe I just don't care enough to look, but I'll give you my opinion. Personally, I believe that it's a saga rather than a series. Or, actually, I don't know what I believe. I've just always heard it referred to as a saga: in the news, on (official) websites, the publishing company, everything. I suppose I have heard of people saying it was a series, but I never thought that there was much difference in the two. So let's try to look at this formally. Here are the definitions of 'series' and 'saga' from Dictionary.com: Series -- A succession of usually continuously numbered issues or volumes of a publication, published with related authors or subjects and similar formats. Saga -- 1. a medieval Icelandic or Norse prose narrative of achievements and events in the history of a personage, family, etc.  2. any narrative or legend of heroic exploits.  3. Also called saga novel. a form of the novel in which the members or generations of a family or social group are chronicled in a long and leisurely narrative.  I'm guessing that the second definition would make the most sense for a saga. I suppose it is a narrative, but there's not much heroic deeds in the book, as far as I'm concerned, unless you consider letting yourself be ripped apart by a mutant baby as heroic. None of the definitions for 'saga' seem to make a good description for Twilight and the rest of the books (since I don't want to say saga or series). The definition for 'series' sounds a lot better though. It makes more sense that saga, because notice how, in the definiton of 'saga', it also mentions the word 'legends'. Personally, I don't think Twilight would be considered a legend. It's just a narrative. So, in some ways, I suppose it is a saga. Officially named, I think the books are a saga, but saga does sound better than series, which is why I think it was named as such. You don't hear about a lot of 'series'. Rather, you might hear about 'cycles', 'trilogies', 'quartets', and, of course, as this debate is about, 'sagas'. They even occasionally call it an 'omnibus'. I think that publishing companies/authors choose to name it this way because of the more attractiveness of the title. It sounds better than just series, and not to mention, seems less bland. So technically, going by definition, it makes more sense if the Twilight books were a series, and not a saga. But officially named, it is a saga, so I'm probably going to continue to say it is.", 10913, "ZyZWvbnwaa", -1],
	126688 : ["I looked at this question and the answers and I saw that someone did a thumbs down for everyone who said they liked the twilight saga or series. I think it is childish how twilight haters and lovers do that. I don't hate twilight and I don't love it but I am an ex-fan. I get excited when stuff about twilight comes out but I don't think the characters are real. To answer your question, look in a dictionary.   sa⋅ga  /ˈsɑgə/  Show Spelled Pronunciation [sah-guh]  Show IPA  Use saga in a Sentence –noun 1. a medieval Icelandic or Norse prose narrative of achievements and events in the history of a personage, family, etc.  2. any narrative or legend of heroic exploits.  3.

A series would be, for example, Nancy Drew. On wikipedia, the definition of a book series is..... There are some book series that aren't really proper series, but more of a single work so large that it must be published over two or more books. Therefore, twilight, new moon, eclipse, and breaking dawn are a series. Twilight could have been one book and leave off the rest. So, it is the twilight series. I call it the twilight saga and it says the twilight saga: new moon, but I guess everyone has a different opinion. I, now on, will call it the twilight series.", 10913, "xghcoDbmaa", 1],
