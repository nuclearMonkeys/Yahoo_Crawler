Luther's break away being one. We do NOT worship Mary. when we say the \"Hail Mary\" we say PRAY for us sinners. Now let's see where in the Holy Bible does it say praying for a friend is  a sin? Now as for the Saints. WE DO believe Saints and the Pope have sinned. Mary has NOT! Now who are you going to follow?? Jesus Christ or Luther and his men? \"Faith without works is dead\"-Book of James.", 8421, "None", 3],

	67453 : ["I don't think this is a question about personal beliefs or non-beliefs, so, I won't go there. There are, & have been many gods. Many gods reflect many cultures & times. Their disparity \"seems\" to indicate that all gods are created by humans. Depending on one's faith, God can be good, or wrathful or both.  The history of belief is fascinating, & a rich tapestry. There have been many \"books\" about gods. Are these the words of God, (which god), & just might it be presumptuous to assume anyone could know who any of these gods ARE? If they exist/existed, is it wise to project on them, human concepts? I believe most people would prefer, & find comfort in believing in a GOOD GOD.  If one believes in God, nothing is \"required.\" I would say no to the first question. If one believes in a creator, one could not believe in other than the creator created everything. What could be excluded? Where would \"it\" have come FROM? Yes to your second question. (Gosh it's nice to have you back ))))))", 8421, "AA10710540", 3],
	67454 : ["It seems to me that the God a person believes in says a lot more about the person than it does about God. Some people seem to believe in a cranky, vengeful, petulant God. Others believe in a Big Parent in the Sky God. Some deny that there is any God at all.  Some say God is Love. No, I don't think believing in a God requires that it be a good God, although many people insist that all that is good is God, and that all that is evil is a Devil or a Satan. I think if one specifies that the God is a Creator, then yes, it follows that everything would be the creation of the Creator. I like dreaming's answer. I think of \"God\" as \"That Which Is.\"  I am only a tiny drop in the vast Ocean. I do not claim to know the shape of the shoreline :-))", 8421, "AA10335392", 1],

	67463 : ["Yes, in fact in Yahoo Answers! a nurse was engaged to a doctor, cheated with a male stripper at her bachelorette party.  She was drinking and claimed she gave in to peer pressure from her cheering party-goers.  Some of her fellow co-workers ratted her out as it was occurring.  She got dumped and he refused to take her back.  And this guy was the man of her dreams:  male model looks, money, and a great friend.  He made her return the expensive car he bought for her.  In her Yahoo queston she was moaning on what she should do to get him back.   I think bachelorette parties are STUUUUPID.  It is just a bunch of women trying to act like men.  Is this a double standard?  YEP.....it is.  But people that ignore cultural double-standards do so at their own peril.  Let guys act like idiots at their male bonding party.  If they cross the line, then they should pay the price.  Your friend should have a feminine get together....", 8426, "z3iAde8Kaa", 1],
	67464 : ["Bachelorette parties are trashy, or I should say, can be trashy when strippers are involved.   Do people read the answers some people give on here?  You have one group that says it's perfectly normal to have one last fling before the wedding night.  It is?  So you are allowed to act like a tramp and it's perfectly ok?  No repercussions?  Then you have others that say men look silly in g-strings (which I agree with) but say they go for laughs.  Well then why go?  Sounds like a grand waste of money to me!  Then you have some that say it's great to go and get All horny so when you go home you can have great sex with your partner.  Why would that make the partner feel good?  You went out and got all turned on and excited by someone other than the person you supposedly love and are now just using them to get off?  The whole idea of strippers for men and women at their respective bachelor/bachelorette parties is a terrible one.  Be excited and get turned on by the man/woman you are marrying.  You have to grow up one of these days.", 8426, "AA11414379", 2],

	67472 : ["It doesn't make sense to talk about whether God is \"good\" since that presupposes a standard to which God is beholden or that encompases God and nothing can do that, by definition. As for whether believing in a creator requires believing that everything is his creation, the answer is obviously, no. I create things, so, I'm a creator. I didn't create everything. Q.E.D.", 8421, "None", 2],
	67473 : ["First part: Believing the Bible and believing the truth about God requires you to believe He is good. Second part: I would say that everything in this world BEGAN with the Creator.  That is NOT to say that everything is still exactly as the Creator intended.  In fact, I think that scripture clearly indicates that most things in this world are no longer as He made them to be.", 8421, "AA11096891", 2],
	67474 : ["That is a very good question. You may want to check out \"dysteism\".  Most Neo-Christians believe in a benevolent god who is \"fair\" and \"just\". They see him (and Jesus) as a big mushy   Claus who would let you eat Chocolate all day if it was not for \"The Big Plan\". In both the Original Testament and the New testament the god of Abrahamic never claims to be nice he claims to be right. There is talk about Divine justice and godly justice but not just plain justice. The Zoroastrians (a religion that heavily influenced Judaism) believed that their was a semi-neutral creator that was not directly involved in human lives, and 2 balance and opposing aspects of Good and Chaos that acted directly on man. The Good god was NOT the creator. In Judaism (from which Christianity gets most of its background) God created everything including evil, suffering, and Lucifer (the Adversary). He is not entirely benevolent and realizes that some people will suffer, and some good people will not get to go to heaven. Jesus may have said \"love thy neighbor as thy self\" but he never said that god was good either.", 8421, "None", 1],

	67479 : ["I don't think that race has anything to do with it. The reason why people focus more on O.J. Simpson than they do on Phil Spector or Robert Blake is because the O.J. Simpson case got MUCH more publicity than the other two cases ever did. Think about it! Back in 1994, the O.J. Simpson trial was broadcast for several weeks on TV. People were watching it like it was a soap opera! However, the trials of Robert Blake and Phil Spector weren't aired on TV, because people didn't find them as fascinating. (I guess for some reason, people are more fascinated by football stars than by has-been actors and record producers.)", 8427, "AA11166769", 0],
