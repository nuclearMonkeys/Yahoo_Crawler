	125970 : ["I am not a Catholic anymore but here is my two cents. It is up to God to judge these men. They will be judged just like everyone else upon their death. Being a priest gives them no more absolution than anyone else for their sins. It is hypocritical that the Catholic church would shield criminals from having inappropriate relations with children. The hierarchy of the church (this includes the pope and cardinals) also sinned in my eyes although I am not God. As for them keeping their place in the church, they have so far. Some of these cases have gone back twenty years where the church leader knew of abuse and kept these priests in their positions. Is there any reason to believe that they will not keep their current positions? The disciplinary action so far has been very lenient compared to the damage to their flock that they have caused. Most have been able to \"get help\" and continue preaching. Some have been defrocked. I personally believe that excommunication and prison is the proper punishment.

I converted to Catholicism, in answer to God's call.  <<Is it true that Catholics have 2 types of sin & one is considered unforgivable...grave sin?>> Yes and no. There are two type of sin, mortal and venial. Both are forgivable. though. Mortal sin, however, can endanger your soul since it is more serious and needs to be confessed. <<This includes not being present at Mass once a week?>> You are obligated to attend Mass weekly. To miss Mass without a serious reason, is a mortal sin. if you are sick, or cannot get there through no fault of your own, that is not a sin. But if you choose to miss Mass in order to do something else, or because you are to busy, or just don't care, then you are in mortal sin. <<And, if one does skip any weeks, they are considered as falling away from grace...which means automatically going to hell? >> No the Catholic Church does not teach that anyone is automatically going to hell. The Church has never declared anyone to be in hell, not Hitler, or Judas. This is because that is not her call. Only God knows the true heart of a person at the time of their death. We are not privy to the exchange between God and a possibly repentant soul. The Church only identifies mortal sins that indulged in, can lead a person away from God and that can ultimately lead to hell. << but I am stumped by the thought of being doomed by the church if I am a member?>> You will not be doomed by the Church. The Church expects that you love God above all things. Jesus is there for us, in the Eucharist, offering his Body and Blood as a perpetual sacrifice before the Father. We are asked to be there, with him, one hour a week. Certainly, if you love him, you will be there. This is where the Church is coming from. It isn't about rules and if you break them you'll be doomed. It's about love and forgiveness. God through his Church ALWAYS offers forgiveness.

	125972 : ["It essentially meant that they would die to the truth. Meaning that they would no longer see the true nature of things, themselves included. When the bible speaks of partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil you are reading what is called a metaphor. Knowledge of good and evil is a metaphoric reference to judgment. When you judge something you attempt to determine if it is acceptable or not. In effect you are deciding if it is good or evil from your point of view. Once we were just like the animals and recognized that everything in the garden that God had given us was good. At some point we started to judge some thing as being better than others are. This set up a situation where something's were more appealing to us than others. We started wishing for these things and were no longer happy with some of the other things in the garden.  This is what is referred to as the fall of man, or separation from God. Some references actually call this the detour into insanity. This self-induced separation from the knowledge of the perfection of god's gifts to us was never shared by the animals. They were too smart to fall for this silly idea and were not fooled by the ideas of good and evil. For this reason they exist along side of us still experiencing the perfection of the garden. While we have excluded ourselves with our ideas of judgment. This is a truly fascinating subject that has many interesting facets.

Those who do not identify them and actively help them are destroyed. How to identify them? By means of what the Bible really teaches. (Matthew 12:50) For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.” Notice first that they 'DO THE WILL OF JESUS' FATHER'. (Romans 8:29)\" . . .because those whom he gave his first recognition he also foreordained to be patterned after the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. . .\" There is a particular group God foreordained to be Christ's brothers. (Romans 8:17) \"If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together.\" They are heirs with Christ and share in what Christ does once they are resurrected to heavenly life. (Hebrews 2:10-12) \"For it was fitting for the one for whose sake all things are and through whom all things are, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Chief Agent of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  For both he who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified all [stem] from one, and for this cause he is not ashamed to call them “brothers,”  as he says: “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of [the] congregation I will praise you with song.” (Hebrews 3:1-2) \"Consequently, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest whom we confess—Jesus.  He was faithful to the One that made him such, as Moses was also in all the house of that One.\" (Hebrews 3:6)\" . . .We are the house of that One, if we make fast our hold on our freeness of speech and our boasting over the hope firm to the end.\" (Galatians 3:29)\" . . .Moreover, if YOU belong to Christ, YOU are really Abraham's seed, heirs with reference to a promise.\" (Galatians 4:28) \". . .Now we, brothers, are children belonging to the promise the same as Isaac was.\" (Galatians 4:26) \". . .But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.\" These brothers of Christ are the ones of the group who are resurrected to heavenly life and reign as kings and priests with Christ over the earth.

Yes, I saw the souls of those executed with the ax for the witness they bore to Jesus and for speaking about God, and those who had worshiped neither the wild beast nor its image and who had not received the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand.

	125989 : ["You are referring to mortal and venial sins, which can in fact be found in the Bible. Check 1 John 5:16-17.  Mortal sins are the more serious of the two. For a sin to be mortal, it must meet three conditions: 1) The object of the sin is a grave matter 2) The sin is committed with full knowledge 3) The sin is committed with deliberate consent Mortal sin results in a complete loss of charity and privation of sanctifying grace. One who is in a state of unrepentant mortal sin cannot receive the Eucharist until he/she has gone to Confession. Venial sins are less serious and usually involve betrayal of the moral law. Venial sins weaken the charity within us. The teachings on mortal and venial sins can be found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, paragraphs 1854-1864. Here is a link to these paragraphs in the Catechism:  You also brought up missing Mass. When done intentionally, this is a grave sin. Here is what the Catechism says on this issue: 2180 The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord more precisely: \"On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to participate in the Mass.\"117 \"The precept of participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which is celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the holy day or on the evening of the preceding day.\"118  2181 The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by their own pastor.119 Those who deliberately fail in this obligation commit a grave sin.  2182 Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday Eucharist is a testimony of belonging and of being faithful to Christ and to his Church. The faithful give witness by this to their communion in faith and charity. Together they testify to God's holiness and their hope of salvation. They strengthen one another under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  2183 \"If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause participation in the celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is specially recommended that the faithful take part in the Liturgy of the Word if it is celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place according to the prescriptions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in prayer for an appropriate amount of time personally or in a family or, as occasion offers, in groups of families.\"120  Footnotes: 117 CIC, can. 1247. 118 CIC, can. 1248 § 1. 119 Cf.

Their ears are hard of hearing,       And their eyes they have closed,       Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,       Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn,       So that I should[a]heal them.' 16 But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear; 17 for assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.\" True believers hear the Word of the Lord and follow in His footsteps.

There is a reward for each isn't there?  But since they are not the same group, it is not the same reward. Obviously it is very vital that we identify Jesus' brothers.  Are they just \"our fellowman?\"  No obviously not, because then even those not doing good to his brothers would be included in the group known as his \"brothers\".   Are they all who call themselves Christians then?  Well then these others would be given a reward for doing good for Christians even though they themselves never called Jesus \"Lord?\"  That doesn't make sense since Jesus has them calling him \"Lord\" when they speak to him. So obviously both groups are Christian, the \"brothers\" and those doing good to him.  Surely they both call him \"Lord\". This would negate the idea that they are Jews as someone said here.  Especially in light of the passage where Jesus told the Jews of Jerusalem that \"your house is abandoned to you\".  That they needed to say \"blessed is he who comes in Jehovah's name\" in order to receive any further blessings.  They rejected and killed Jesus, so surely THOSE Jews wouldn't be part of his \"brothers\".  If they were ever his brothers by the manner of the flesh, they disowned him. So what someone wrote here about the Jews during their \"Great Tribulation\" can't be true.  Assuming he was talking about 70 CE when Jerusalem experienced the first fulfillment of great tribulation.  At that time all of Jesus' brothers had obeyed his voice and had fled to the mountains so as not to be victims of that terrible time experienced by those who rejected Jesus and his admonishions. Jesus himself tells us that his \"mother and his brothers\" are those doing the will of his Father. (Matthew 12:49,50) Of course it goes even farther than this.  All True Christians do the will of his Father, and yet there are two groups mentioned.  So one group must refer to the group he calls \"Little flock\" (Luke 12:32) and one group must refer to those he calls \"other sheep\" (John 10:16)...  The Little Flock has a closer relationship with Jesus, so this must be the group known as his \"brothers\" and the \"other sheep\" must be those who call him Lord, who do good to his \"brothers\". These two groups, the \"brothers\" correspond to the small group mentioned in Revelation 14:3 who \"sing a new song\" that only they are able to master, and those who \"do good\" to the group mentioned at Revelation 7:9 Of course, that second group (the one at Rev :9) refers only to those of the \"other sheep\" who are alive at the time of the great tribulation.

That is why I do not agree with Catholics, and I do not mean to offend, but tell me in the Bible were it says you will go to hell for not going to mass a couple of times. It says it no where. You ask your priest and see what he has to say. If it is not in the Bible it is wrong; that is man's answer not God's. Listen you do not have to go to a priest to confess your sins. What you have done wrong is between you and God. Did you know God sent his only Son for this so we do not have to go to priests to have our sins erased? You just need to ask for forgiveness. It also does not say in the Bible you need a pope. There are more than two types of sins anyway. The unforgivable sin is were you believe in Christ at one time, but you turn utterly away from God and want nothing to do with him. It also takes blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. I also do not believe in treating Mary like an idol. I think it is an honor to be blessed by having Christ as a son, however she did not die for my sins!  Stefani", 10854, "mZcdC90Uaa", -2],
