You are very lucky to see the world, the sky, the seas, the forest, your love ones, everything.  There are people who cannot see these (blind ones) but still like to live.  You are blessed to be one of the living things in the universe.  You have all the opportunity to explore life to the fullest.  Will your death excuse you from being a part of this world?  You already exists and you cannot change that anymore.  The least you can do now is to PRAY and ask God's forgiveness for everything you do.  I wish you all the best in life.

	113543 : ["These kids sound like normal kids to me. I have three children and they have all done the same thing, and just to let you know it makes you feel like the worst mom in the world when other people insist that they know your children better than you do. Kids like to see just how far they can get with mom before she flips. The best thing to do is not to treat her like she needs your advice.

	113544 : ["Yes, tell her exactly what is happening and let the kids know that when their parents are there that they will still behave they're self. You have to be the adult and not let them run all over you. That is what they are doing it. If she does not like it let her take them home.

	113545 : ["I'm way past 12 and I think they are total torture devices. You'd be surprised at how many women refuse to wear one when they are home.  Something I did learn over the years is that it is very important to get one that fits properly and that the ones with a soft cotton lining are much more comfortable. Most of the ones in department stores have this lining that can be very irritating to the skin if you are at all sensitive to it. She may not break out in a rash or get red but it could still be driving her nuts. I suggest that you take her to a store which has someone who can measure her and help her find the right size and fit. Look for a good one with a cotton lining and without the underwires. It may cost a lot but in the long run it will be cheaper than buying all kinds of cheap ones that she won't wear. Once she gets used to wearing one she may be able to shop in the department stores and find some there that are just as comfortable. She will know better what to look for.", 10352, "30c33d4217ac359a28b8ed9ce7cc1085aa", 2],
	113546 : ["I would suggest a sports bra first. That's all I wore for the first year or two. Kids that young wouldn't feel right wearing a 'real' bra. Like most of the others said, if she still won't do a sports bra, you just need to talk to her about it and compromise. Hope that helps=)", 10352, "lpR9XLYbaa", 1],
	113547 : ["so what? what do you seriously think is going to happen if she doesn't wear a bra? she obviously has an opinion on the situation - HAVE YOU TRIED ASKING HER WHY?? she may have a valid reason (even if it's that she needs to be refitted because she is uncomfortable. Kids are people too and they have every right to make decisions - your job is to guide your daughter not order her around. learn ths now and the next few years will be a whole lot easier. Best book on parenting I ever read says \"pick your battles  - will this matter tommorrow in a significant way?\" ie - will your child be dead or seriously injured? if the answer is no- then you need to realise that mistakes are the best way to learn.", 10352, "ci24b3UIaa", 10],
