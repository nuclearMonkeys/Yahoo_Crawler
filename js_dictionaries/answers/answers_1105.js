Life came about because of the planet, not the other way around. To say otherwise takes a high degree of hubris. b.) I fail to see how this proves God. c.) Argument from incredulity. d.) The fact that evolution doesn't handle the origin of life doesn't hurt it IN ANY WAY. It describes the origin of SPECIES, not the origin of life, and the fact that people still use this argument is sad. 2. Again, argument from incredulity. 3. The universe is \"orderly\"? Have you ever seen pictures of galaxies colliding? One day, it'll happen to our own universe, and it'll be FAR from orderly. And science doesn't deal with the \"why\": It deals with the \"what\" and the \"how.\" 4. For now, evolution is the best explanation science can come up with. That is no reason to assume a designer, because that is again an argument from incredulity. 5. Round and round the circular logic goes...

	60742 : ["I'm not sure I would describe myself as \"very religious\" so I'm not sure your question is aimed at me. However, if you are indeed \"honestly curious\" then I think there is a huge misunderstanding that has developed in fundamentalist religion and in the atheistic response to it. The author Karen Armstrong gives a history and etymology of the word belief : \"It's only since the 18th century, and that in the West, that faith has been acquainted with believing, accepting certain propositions, certain ideas, certain theological opinions. The word 'belief' in English originally comes from the Middle English word 'beleven', which means to love. And 'credo', the Latin for 'I believe', comes from the Latin 'cor do', (meaning) 'I give my heart.' \" She describes how prior to this, religion was essentially about a way of life, that certain practices can change a person and make them see the world in a different way. \"Believing\" meant essentially committing yourself to this practice. So if you honestly went out every morning resolving to \"love your neighbour\" or \"love your enemy\" then the world might be a very different place. And your previous small troubles might be dissolved in something greater. From this it would be impossible to kill or hate in the name of belief. The misunderstanding that has developed is that belief has come to mean that you have to accept certain conclusions in advance, about God etc. You don't. Primarily, religious folk needs to practice first, preach second. It is the practice that tranforms a persons immediate view of the world so that they might see life as something sacred, not as meaningless.

Lightning once pointed to the existence of a lightning god, we have since figured that one out.  I refuse to give up. a. I think you're putting the cart in front of the horse here.  The earth is perfect for life as we know it because life formed here to fit it's accommodations.  If the earth were the only planet in the universe or even the solar system this might carry some weight, but with the millions of planets believed to exist in the universe odds are one will fit. b.

	60748 : ["\"1. The complexity of our planet points to a deliberate Designer who not only created our universe, but sustains it today.\" No, it doesn't. In fact, the reason life is around on this planet at all is because it survives a constant trial by fire. The Earth has not always been such a great place to live, whether you're an itsy-bitsy one-celled organism or a complex human. Evolution explains how such complexity can arise without direct intervention by anything other than natural forces. \"2. The universe had a start - what caused it?\" First off, the Big Bang is not an \"explosion.\" It is an expansion of space and matter to fill that expanding space. Second, all natural phenomenon have NATURAL causes. There is nothing to suggest that there can be SUPERNATURAL causes for anything natural. If there was a \"beginning,\" as you posit, would not the so-called laws of causality begin to break down since there is no \"time before time\" in which a cause could appear? \"3. The universe operates by uniform laws of nature. Why does it?\" I'll admit I don't have the foggiest clue what the answer to this question is. What makes you think- perhaps even think you KNOW- that a God is the answer? I don't assume, which is why I'm not religious. \"4. The DNA code informs, programs a cell's behavior. One has to ask....how did this information program wind up in each human cell?\" Particles exert forces on one another. They will take arrangements that result in the greatest possible stability under favorable conditions. Given the natural order of the universe you seem to be so fond of, is this not surprising? Is it not conceivable that DNA was formed through a natural process? \"5. We know God exists because he pursues us. He is constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him. Ask yourself: What is it about atheists that we would spend so much time, attention, and energy refuting something that we don't believe even exists?\" Why? Because believers are always asking us WHY we don't believe. They're constantly seeking to have others believe as they do. And I can see that very often, as with some of the arguments in this question, the way they spread their beliefs is through faulty thinking, misinformation, manipulation, or outright deception. I have a problem with that. \"6. Unlike any other revelation of God, Jesus Christ is the clearest, most specific picture of God revealing himself to us.\" Where is the logic? 1. Nobody else said they were God. 2. Jesus said he was God. 3. Therefore, Jesus is God. Does that make any sense to you? At all?", 8087, "GX52cUooaa", 9],

	60757 : ["Firstly I will just say, \"lack of proof\" and \"proof that something does not exist\", are two completely different things, many people seem to claim that there is proof that God does not exist? Which proof? There is zilch, not a single shred. People can use the big bang theory or evolution as proof there is no God, in the same way that a creationist can use the world as evidence that there is a God, neither of them prove anything, at all. It may be rational in the scientific sense to claim the existence of God as irrelevant or unworkable, but to state non existence of God does require utilization of faith. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying people should believe in God, or fairies, or whatnot, what I am saying is that the claim that no God(s) is not a rational one (objectively speaking), there is only one way in which one can know this \"fact\", and that is if that person has obtained all possible knowledge, and we know very very little. In fact it has been proven that we never will (David Hilbert and Kurt Godel). The fact however that there is a lack of evidence, is not proof that God does not exist. I will give you an example, two thousand years ago people had no understanding at all of an atom, electron etc, to them it did not exist, but I think we can both agree that both did still exist, despite the fact that nobody had any evidence to suggest them. Well, the truth is I can't show you any hard facts that will make you believe. If such evidence existed then God might as well have come down and personally showed his existence to us, for the two would have the same effects, and very significant repercussions. You have to try and see it from our perspective, I can only talk for myself, but most stories are very similar. what makes me believe in God really comes down to personal experience, while research and education do play a role, it is my experience that first founded my belief. If you felt and experienced what you thought was God, if he answered your prayers, and made all these positive changes in your life, would you deny them? If a series of coincidences,evidently more then self fulfilled prophecy, reinforcing these conclusions occurred. Would you cling to your old belief, cling to what some people have stated and believe that it was all a coincidence, and perhaps momentary psychotic break downs'? Either way is an application of faith. I believe in God because I believe that I have experienced him, not just spiritually but with my physical senses, I believe in God because I have witnessed changes in people through Christianity you would not believe, I believe in God because the bible has so much to teach us, lessons that in their rejection, have had a significant and negative impact on Western civilization. Christian or not, the bible is full of wisdom. Philosophy strengthens my beliefs, fulfilled biblical prophecies, certain aspects about human nature and science, look there is plenty yadidadada. I think faith in God is often misinterpreted, it is not faith in his existence that I must maintain, it is faith in his will, trust in him that I apply my faith. I freely do admit, my experiences are the foundation of my belief. Kind of like, you could hear descriptions about natures beauty until the cows come home, but never will you grasp any comprehension of their meaning until you witness it for yourself. Considering the fact that you are contemplating the concept of God, the idea of trying to believe in God probably seems impossible to you. Kind of like trying to walk through a brick wall right? the constraints of your \"rational\" mind render this notion unattainable. Believe it or not many Christians felt the exact same way before converting, it is weird, because from that transition into transcendence you know something external of self must occur, because it is impossible to just believe, like an on/off switch. I have found that for many people, first finding God required a leap of faith, some can relate, others not. Here is a testimony of my journey to finding God, it may serve as some insight into the journey that many others have trodden in search of the truth. It was at this point that I realized God existed, but I could not come to terms with this excess pain that we deal with in reality. Which in turn lead me to rebel. Since then I have learnt a lot about the nature of God, and these trials that we are often faced with during our lifetime. All this I could have learnt given the practice of an open mind, and an effort to look deeper into what we take at face value. I am out of word count sorry lol", 8084, "None", 2],

We have no problem with student-lead IN school prayer groups if they wish to get together and do so.  What we have a problem with is MANDATORY prayer for students in public schools.)  Those are the least of my worries when it comes to theists.  Believe me, if that was the only problem theists caused, then we'd have no problem with theists. And yes, our lives really are \"disrupted\" by theists on a daily basis.  It's about MUCH more than \"prayer groups\". 1)Theists consistently try to push their religious dogma into our laws, schools, and government.  2)Theists tell people who are dying of AIDS and starvation that using condoms is wrong because \"God\" might want to give them a baby, and they shouldn't interfere with \"God's will\". They promote ignorance of how pregnancy happens, how to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancy, and teach our children to fear and be ashamed of their bodies and their sexuality. 3) School boards all across this country still have to spend time, money and resources that are ALREADY in short supply on the fight to have evolution taught in the schools, and keep unsubstantiated religious claims OUT. 4) In Africa, fundamentalist Christians are torturing and executing CHILDREN for witchcraft. (Source available) 5) Theists are trying to tell our children that the Earth is 6000 years old, despite the fact that not only is there NO evidence to back up that claim, but ALL evidence points AGAINST it. This gives our children the impression that scientific facts can be ignored or denied and replaced with whatever information you want if you don't LIKE what the evidence *actually* tells you.  6) People will actually fly airplanes into buildings full of people or blow themselves up in public places because they believe they will be rewarded in a magical afterlife for doing so. 7) In a lot of areas in the U.S., if a person is daring enough to actually admit publicly that they are an atheist, they can FULLY expect to be harassed, discriminated against, and even lose their jobs, have their property damaged, and be physically assaulted. 8) In the 1950's, theists changed our nations motto from \"E Pluribus Unum\" to \"In God We Trust\", started printing it on our money, and also added \"Under God\" to our pledge. We recently had a Presidential candidate who said he wanted to change our constitution to better reflect HIS religious beliefs, to the cheers of theists all over the country. The state of Texas is in the process of editing history books to remove information that they doesn't gel as closely with their religious beliefs as they would like, replacing information about people like THOMAS JEFFERSON(!)  with information about religious figures like John Calvin. (And yet, we constantly hear theists say that ATHEISTS are trying to \"change\" everything, and that we're trying to \"take God out of everything\".)  9) Theists hold up stem-cell research, a scientific breakthrough that could save the lives and alleviate the suffering of MILLIONS of people, because they believe that a blob of 150 cells (that is the number of cells in the three-day-old zygotes used in stem cell research) has a \"soul\". They're not against it because they're under the impression that a blob of 150 cells is \"suffering\", has any sort of consciousness or feels pain, they're against it because they think it's \"sacred\". 10) There's a HUGE double-standard in this country of the federal government being barred from funding certain things because religious people don't like them, but forcing US to accept that our tax dollars support religious-based programs that we oppose. 11) Religion-based genital mutilations. 12) Religion-based \"moral killings\" 13) Religion-based subjucation of women. 14) People allow their children to DIE from easily cureable illnesses because they'd rather rely on prayer than take them to a doctor. 15) There are *so many* religious leaders that use people's trust and faith in religion to steal, cheat, lie, manipulate the political process, and take sexual advantage of their followers. 16) People use their religious literature as an excuse to deny other people their rights. 17) Blue laws are still in place all over the U.S. 18) There are states that STILL have laws in place stating that an atheist can't run for office, despite the U.S. Constitution expressly saying that no religious test shall be given as a requirement for political office.

No scientist aims to \"prove\" anything because he knows it is impossible.  All science can do is compile evidence in favor of a hypothesis. Secondly, have you ever considered the reverse?  That evidence against intelligent design does not equate to evidence for evolution?  And, have you ever considered the possibility that the system for gathering all of the \"evidence\" supporting evolution could be flawed? There are reasons to suspect that carbon dating could give wrong dates... anywhere from 100 to 100,000,000 years off.

	60771 : ["It's a good question to ask for positive evidence FOR, but I think one thing you have to notice is that if evolution is false, then you have no explanation for the abundance of life on the planet EXCEPT for creation.  (Although what form that creation took could vary.)  In other words creationism would win just because there were no competing theories.  That's why people say that Darwin made it possible for someone to be an \"intellectually fulfilled atheist\" - because before him atheists could not explain where the life on the planet came from. I should point out too that there are many different \"creationisms\" with varying beliefs about exactly when, and how active, God was.  There are some people out there who think God created by doing nothing but starting the Big Bang.  Nevertheless because God is outside of time he was able to set the initial conditions of our universe just right so that billions of years down the line, human life just as it is today would evolve. Other people accept evolution for the most part, but say God intervened several times during our evolution.  In particular, he gave the human animal consciousness and a soul some time many thousands of years ago.  Others (the intelligent design movement) think he intervened many, many times to produce biochemical systems that, because of their irreducible complexity, could not have naturally evolved.  (You might also read Behe's book 'Darwin's Black Box.'  He goes through several biochemical systems and argues that they could not be the result of evolution - these would qualify as positive evidence for one type of creation.)", 8086, "W3XZEWz0aa", -1],

Complexity & Design Most mutations are fatal The number of mutations required to go from primordial ooze to man microbiology and mathematics say that to make the first protein (before cells), even if 100 trillion x 100 billion x 100 billion x 100 billion of all 20 of the amino acids necessary to produce proteins were all trying to make this one collagen protein at a rate of one billion times per second, it would still take 101229 years to do it.  If evolution was true, the more complex a plant or animal, the further along the evolutionary path it would be, and the more chromosomes it would have. Instead, while a penicillium has only 2 chromosomes, and a house fly has 12, a piece of lettuce has18. And while a frog has 26, an onion has 32. Also, human beings have 46 chromosomes, but a piece of tobacco has 48, a one cell amoeba has 50, and a fern has 480.", 8086, "pfNnuD5saa", -2],

To answer your question, a big NO, because no atheist would dislike theists (unless the latter is a criminal, a child molester, or has a bad habit like smoking indoors) in general. Surely there are people that we don't like for other reasons, like character, habit, etc. Don't generalize. You don't hate all dogs just because one chihuahua bit you. do you? It is not the scripture that \"some\" atheists despise. It is the religion. Some attack scripture because to most Christians (as is the case of our discussion), it is the basis of their faith. Which means that scripture, by default, is the best way to attack religion. It is very important to note that those atheists (me included) do this out of compassion, not to individuals, but to humanity as a whole.
