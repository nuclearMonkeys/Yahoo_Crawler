You will not find one with mainstream artists, but there are many that will have music the artists posts to be legally downloaded for free (  has some for free, but I really like   ). Just because you may not have ever heard of most of these artists doesn't mean they are bad. There are a lot of very good \"undiscovered\" artists out there that are happy to have you download their music for free to get their name out there more. Once you find the site, it's just a matter of saving the music on the hard drive of the computer and importing it into iTunes. Then you connect the iPod to the computer and it copies the music to the iPod. iTunes also has some free music you can download, but not very much. They only have about 3 or 4 songs a week they make available for free. Of course, there are also a lot places you can illegally download music for free. Programs such as Limewire and Vuze will do this for you. The police are not going to come bashing in your door for it, but there have been people sued by the RIAA for it.", 10135, "AA10118655", -1],

The likeliest answer is some substance in the family of designer drugs loosely called \"bath salts.\"  Since this stuff is produced with absolutely no safety testing or purity standards, there is no way for users to know what they're ingesting until the effects hit them.  A user wanting to repeat a pleasurable trip could buy the same product, take the exact same quantity, and consume it via the same method as before and have a completely different experience.   This is probably what happened to Eugene Rivers although since he didn't survive,  we'll never know for sure.  No doubt Miami PD and Florida State Police are trying to  find the pusher but if the guy has half a brain, he's already flushed his merchandise and left the state.

If you overloaded with malware and there is no One Care remedy, you might try a going back to a earlier System Restore state, before the popups occurred. You can't delete IE, don't try it. Windows depends upon it.

Check your FF> Tools> 'Add-on's'> \"Extensions\" & \"Plug-in's\" boxes, and uninstall/disable .NET framework, Windows Presentation Foundation, Shockwave, Silverlight. These hacks re-enable the JavaScript exploit avenue. The Silverlight (and maybe more) will try to re-install after some MS updates, so these procedures must be constantly monitored & redone when necessary. This very powerful 'language' (JavaScript) can get a computer to do nearly anything, and I suspect it's being leveraged to invoke iE and display those unwanted items.

	110296 : ["Firefox is much better. BUT ... *** Please do not try to delete Internet Explorer. *** Much as I hate to say it, IE is an integral part of Windows. If you need web support from Microsoft, you will need IE. IE is the engine that fetches your critical updates -- you never see IE open during the update process, but it is needed for the updates to occur. Without IE, your Windows will not be secure! Both Norton and McAfee's antivirus programs also require IE to fetch their updates. Again, you don't see IE open during this process, but it is the program that downloads the update. Without IE, you will have to manually download and install updates to your antivirus libraries. Besides, Microsoft has deliberately made IE almost impossible to uninstall. So, use Firefox as your browser. Just leave IE on your machine.", 10131, "OWt93isQaa", 3],

I would give some of the others like Opera a try because it doesn't hurt to learn how to run other software.  I run Firefox 95% of the time and I also use Thunderbird email.

You can have a computer without any web browser, and still be connected to the internet, reading email, playing games online, etc., and yes... you can have a computer with only Firefox, and it'll use the web just fine.
