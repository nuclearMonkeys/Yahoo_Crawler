	90027 : ["It is a popular misconception that it is a vegetable, but it is definitely a fruit scientifically. Here is a quote: \"The confusion about 'fruit' and 'vegetable' arises because of the differences in usage between scientists and cooks. Scientifically speaking, a tomato is definitely a fruit. True fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower, and contain the seeds of the plant (though cultivated forms may be seedless). Blueberries, raspberries, and oranges are true fruits, and so are many kinds of nut. Some plants have a soft part which supports the seeds and is also called a 'fruit', though it is not developed from the ovary: the strawberry is an example. As far as cooking is concerned, some things which are strictly fruits, such as tomatoes or bean pods, may be called 'vegetables' because they are used in savoury rather than sweet cooking. The term 'vegetable' is more generally used of other edible parts of plants, such as cabbage leaves, celery stalks, and potato tubers, which are not strictly the fruit of the plant from which they come. Occasionally the term 'fruit' may be used to refer to a part of a plant which is not a fruit, but which is used in sweet cooking: rhubarb, for example. So, the answer to the question is that a tomato is technically the fruit of the tomato plant, but it's used as a vegetable in cooking.\"", 9344, "None", 0],

It explains grief and the grieving process so if you can get your hands on a copy it wouldn't hurt if she read it. If she does have issues about what God thinks about it I have to say that I, personally, don't believe that suicide is some sort of unforgivable sin. Most people who kill themselves either don't really mean to, or they are so deeply distressed with life that they can't really be considered sane. The Bible says that God judges a man's (or woman's) heart, and that he is a God of grace and mercy.  One more thing, it's going to take a long time for her to get over the shock, much less the grief.

Anyway, I think it's sweet tht you're concerned for your neice like that, but I think there really is nothing you can do. I mean, obviously you're doing the right thing-- you're there for her, and she's feeling really sad. just show her that you love her and make sure she knows that her friends choice to end her own life had nothing to do with her.
