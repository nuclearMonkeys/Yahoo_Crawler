Today, against collingwood, they have got alot of young talent debuting - i think even I will struggle to name all the blokes out there in the blue and gold, since Im not sure what the 2008 draftees all look like.

Kobe shoots extra, and can get factors everywhere on the floor which nonetheless makes him extra risky offensively for my section. i think of Kobe remains extra effectual than Lebron although even along with his age, he's extra effectual down the stretch and in the snatch and has extra will and determination to win championships. i could supply it a minimum of four-5 extra years till now we hit upon out who the particularly extra effectual participant replaced into although the human beings who start up those debates in basic terms pay interest to the stats, and say that Kobe had Shaq that's stupid reason you could no longer win with out some respectable teammates.

Miami in 6 games. Denver will also beat New Orleans in 7. K-Mart and Nene can match up with West and Chandler. Also, who do you think is better in the backcourts- Melo, JR smith and billups or Chris Paul and Peja? CP3 is awesome, but still... Second round- Orlando will own Boston in 6. Somehow, I don't think Big baby davis is gonna shut down Dwight howard. the loss of KG is gonna hurt the celtics a lot. Dallas will beat Denver, not New orleans, in 7.  Third round- Cavs will beat the magic in 6 games. The magic will win the big man battle, but Lebron and his shooters will be too much in 6. Finals- Lakers in 7. Kobe has a better supporting cast than Lebron, and will take out his anger at losing the mvp trophy to Lebron by winning another championship.", 9557, "sSBY1SdZaa", -1],

At the first stoppage of play after the two-man advantage is no longer in effect, the numerical strength of the offending team will revert back to either a four (4) skaters on four (4) skaters or a four (4) skaters on three (3) skaters situation, as appropriate. Simply put, the power play team is allowed to have five (5) skaters on three (3) skaters until the first penalty is over. When the penalty ends, 5-on-4 or 5-on-5 play resumes until the next stoppage of play. After a stoppage in play the situation reverts back to 4-on-4, or 4-on-3 play.

Which one would you get Fisher or Mo? Don't tell me you'll get Fisher who is old, and is about to retire. Everybody will get Mo. Which back up center would you have Big Z, or DJ Mbenga? How about former All-Star Jamison or a inconsistent Lamar Odom. LeBron fans always said during the reg season that they will win this year because they are kicking butt, and that is true because Cavs are the number 1 in the league, 60 w and 20 remember? Didnt you guys said that they will go all the way? And now they lost, its all about LBJ dont have any supporting cast. The original scape goat plan for Mr. James. LeBron have the supporting cast. They just never, never ever blame him for anything because he doesnt take any responsibility for his team. and he and his fans, called himself the leader. Every year they blame someone, this year who did they blame? yup nobody else but Mike Brown. If LeBron is the leader, if the team wins all the kudos goes to you but you have to be willing to take all the criticism if the team lose.  In basketball you win as a team and you lose a team. You guys know what is the legit way of saying that you dont have any supporting cast? That is if you have Kwame Brown and Smush Parker in your team. Back 06 - 07 Kobe got C-Kwame Brown, PF - Odom, SF - Walton, and PG - Smush Parker in his first five. If you have Brown and Parker that only plays for the money, and they are not even playing anymore because they suck. But what did Kobe did he lead the Lakers to the playoffs in the tough competitive Western Conf. During those year West is still stong even though your above .500 its not for sure that you will make the playoffs. While in the East, even though you have below .500 you will still make the playoffs. Don't give me that LBJ don't have a supporting cast because thats just full of s**t", 9557, "GjyhgeNWaa", 0],

	95720 : ["Regardless of the type of league you're drafting for, you have to remember to keep things in perspective.  Andre Johnson does not run the ball or gain rushing TDs.  Adrian peterson runs and catches for yardage and scores TDs (lots of them). Any time you have a chance of getting a dual threat player, especially in a PPR, take him.  You want running QBs, rushing and punt returning WRs (think Tim Brown/Raiders), and finally Passing/Receiving RBs.  These players tally points in multiple categories, and for this reason are hard to keep off the field. Now here are some hard facts for you to make your decision: 1.  AP and the twentieth (where you will pick in the next round) best WR [worst case scenario] will get you about 20 more annual points than 2.  Andre Johnson and the 12 best RB [more realistic] 3.  Due to position scarcity, there are only a few RBs you will be able to count on 4.  Due to great positional depth, there are 30 WR who may do as well as the 20th best WR; you can draft them all throughout the draft to find a couple. Don't get me wrong, owning Johnson is a tantilizing idea, but you may have the opportunity to get AP.  I don't believe he'll be there, but any of the other 3 should still be drafted before Johnson.  If you want him, then I suggest trading down a few picks.  Taking him instead of the 10th best RB may make more of an impact for your team.  (Also realize, that after taking AP and let's say Greg Jennings, you'll still be able to get Ryan Matthews, LeSean McCoy, or Ronnie Brown with your next pick (this is the type of 1st round RB you would have had.
