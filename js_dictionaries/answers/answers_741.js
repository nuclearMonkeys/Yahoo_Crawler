	41285 : ["You're being way too hard on yourself. It's hard to meet and really get to know a strong man online. It's just too easy for someone to pretend that they're someone they're not. Use dating to find out what he is really like. Pay special attention to how he reacts when he doesn't get his way or something goes wrong. May I suggest that the first question to ask yourself when considering whether or not to date someone is, “Is this person a strong person?” If they're not, no matter how much you like them, how much they like you, or how “cute” or “hot” they are, - please don't date them. A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money). My suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you're not already) and eventually look for this type of guy (otherwise you're setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately this type of man is difficult to find – but save yourself the heartache and don't settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps! PS Here are \"21 tips that could help you to attract a strong person\" from the book True Love Lasts: 1. Take the time and put in the effort to become a strong person yourself (this is the most important tip) 2. Put yourself in as many situations as possible that will allow you to potentially come in contact with other strong people - community service organizations, the library, high school or college clubs, the “Y” or other workout facilities, religious book studies, coffee shops, non-alcoholic parties, bookstores, concerts (wear a good pair of earplugs to protect your ears from permanent hearing loss), co-ed recreational athletic teams, community service projects, mission trips, volunteer service, etc. Try to get to know other people as much as possible without dating 3. Be cheerful, approachable, and friendly - smile regularly to put others at ease (let people see your positive attitude) 4. Take a real interest in getting to know others. Ask people an open-ended question about themselves in order to get them talking. Share things related to what's been said as needed to keep the conversation going. Then ask them another question 5. Be polite and kind to everyone - even to people who you don't like or enjoy being around 6. If you decide to not accept a request for a date, do it in a kind way (being rude isn't a good choice and it doesn't help you - word about it will get out and you'll become less approachable) 7. Be confident about yourself - if you're trying to become a stronger person each day, you already have a lot going for you 8. Be humble - don't act like you're Miss Charming or you're Mr. Wonderful 9. Don't be concerned about whether or not someone likes you 10. Have the attitude that if someone doesn't like you - they don't really know you 11. Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep (at least nine hours for teens, at least seven hours for adults according to the experts), exercising regularly (if approved by your doctor), and eating a healthy diet 12. Develop a good sense of humor - including the ability to laugh at your own mistakes 13. Be known as a hard worker 14. Dress well and dress modestly at the same time (wearing seductive clothing doesn't attract another strong person) 15. Pay attention to your appearance, but don't obsess over it (remember that strong people are attracted to other strong people, they're not too concerned about looks - because they realize that looks fade with age). If you use makeup, make sure it's not excessive. Use perfumes and colognes sparingly - if at all 16. Truly care about other people 17. Stay in close communication with real friends who can help you through the ups and downs of life and hold you accountable 18. Be patient - real friends can help you with this 19. Persevere - please remember that almost nothing worthwhile is quick and easy. Please don't settle for dating a weak person 20. Don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to date you 21. Don't act desperate for a date", 6025, "U4o8Bs4xaa", 0],

	41290 : ["Luck=Moloch=demon.Gov't is killing you with high frequency electricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the StatueofLiberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (TheMostHolyTrinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbringsthemupalevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put thesewreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism/COVIDrestrictions will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.

	41319 : ["Dogs generally are taught \"specialized\" training techniques, after they have mastered basic obedience. In teaching your dog to track, ahead of becoming a well-mannered and obedient dog, you are impairing any attempts at obedience. When we took our well-mannered, older dog to actual obedience classes (and she did quite well), they would not allow her to advance to higher classes until she mastered the first classes. I do believe this was because it takes time and effort for a dog to learn things. It takes practice, as well. If a dog is off \"following his nose\", he has just forgotten any normal obedience and is on to a very different sort of activity. This would hold true for any other form dog classes or activities such as: fly ball; hurdles, agility, hunting, chasing ducks and geese, herding, etc. Any trainer will be certain the dog can follow basic commands and do them well, before advancing to any training in other areas. I also NEVER allowed my dogs on a long leash unless in my own yard. There is no reason for this unless you have a fully  trained dog who will return to you, no matter what. .  If you can take your dog to a dog park, off-leash and expect him to return to you with your first call for \"come\", then your dog can be off-leash at the dog park. BUT, you should never hike where other people are walking or running with a dog off-leash. That is asking for trouble and not considerate to the other people.  Take your dog to obedience classes through an actual dog trainer, and not one at a pet supply store. These trainers actually know dogs from previous experience and are selected for their experience. THEN, consider advanced training, once your dog has mastered: sit, stay, come, heel, down. There are lots of dogs who are bred for certain uses, but that does not mean they can just go off-leash. To get your dog to listen to you better: -Walk the dog on the sidewalk for brief 10 minute walks. At each of these walks, bring treats along in your pocket. Walk the dog for about 10 to 15 feet RIGHT NEXT TO your left side. The dog's neck or front leg should be right next to your leg. This is called, \"heel\". Move forward saying, \"heel\" and tug a bit forward on the leash. Expect the dog to move with you as soon as you lean into the walk. If he isn't moving, tug again a bit harder. At about the 10 to 15 foot mark, slow down, halt, and pull back on the leash. Say, \"sit\". Help the dog into the sit if he does not do this as you slow to a stop. Once he sits, praise him, and give him a treat. (A dog with a strong sense of smell should be quite adept at realizing there will be a treat each 15 feet).  Now, move your left foot forward and pull somewhat forward with the leash again, saying: \"heel\" and expecting the dog to move forward. Repeat as above. After sitting each 10 to 15 feet on every walk, the dog will soon realize you actually mean business and are not out for fun and games. (You can play in your yard, follow scents, do agility, do hurdles, etc. but, NOT on a normal walk.) Treats should help him pay attention, as well as your expecting him to follow these cues each and every time.  If someone will be passing you, make the dog sit, before they reach you. Squat down if you must and wait until they pass. Once the are well-past you and your dog, praise him for sitting and begin to walk on with the command. The only way to get your dog to listen to you is to practice this manner of walking, and NOT letting the dog follow his nose. These walks should be TRAIING, and not entertainment for the dog.", 6040, "p7ZdohGTaa", 0],
