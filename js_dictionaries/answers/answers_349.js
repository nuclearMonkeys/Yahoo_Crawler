You can make candles...it is a fun craft...but do not EVER expect to sell more than 2. (and one of those will be to your aunt and the other will be to your mother.)", 3014, "wMIOGYTbaa", 1],

Next - research has proved that burning scented candles inside releases harsh toxic chemicals in to the air. ALSO: I can get a scent diffuser LED 'flickering flame' candle that will provide atmosphere for 100 hours if I want it to...and it will not drip or tip over and start a fire. Besides...when I did buy candles...I always threw out the thing they melted in to  even if it was pretty because...it was filled with wax and I didn't want the mess of getting it out. Finally - candles are SO LAST CENTURY.  Is there anyone under the age of 80 that actually uses them for decorating? No. take the candles to 1979 and come back to the future with a better idea.", 3014, "z1bZifthaa", 2],

If a student doesn't put much into it, they won't get much out of it. Half the college degree programs these days are worse than worthless, they're shams. People spend a hundred grand for some ridiculous program (including anything with \"Studies\" in the name), then they can't get a job in their \"field,\" and can't get an entry level job either because they're overqualified. It just depends. My only advice to you would be to clean up your own presentation before you go criticizing anyone else about not valuing education.", 3040, "nqaERZ8Raa", 0],

You are afraid to call off work because you are afraid you will be seen as unreliable and you will be replaced with another employee who is reliable.  Thus, eliminating your paycheck. \"Time is something that you can't ever get back or replace.\" True, but as humans most of us don't get to do whatever we want, whenever we want. If you don't respect the job you are in, why do you work there? Good luck with your grandiose ideas. You work in a retail environment that likely has over 100% turnover which is standard for the industry.  Without looking at the details of your specific employer and location, there is no way for us to determine if they are better than their competitors, on par, or worse.
