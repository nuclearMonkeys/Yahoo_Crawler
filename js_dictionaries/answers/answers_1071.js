It didn't sting too much, just very annoying. The three other boys joined in. I yelled for them to cut it out! They wouldn't stop! I ran out of the house and hid for a few hours. Then realized I left my book at the house. All I could think was what they have done to it. Trashed it? Drew all over it? For all I knew my mother's last belonging was destroyed!
