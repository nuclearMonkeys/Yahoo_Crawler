I feel that Julio Cesar Chavez would have lost to Mayweather because Chavez always struggle with slick boxers like Whitaker and Meldrick Taylor.  I also think Manny Pacquaio would have beaten Henry Armstrong because Armstrong is a pressure fighter and stylistically, that is a perfect match up for Pacquaio.  I also think Nonito Donaire could have beaten Eder Jofre because Jofre struggles with counter punchers, slick and powerful fighters like Harada. I also think prime Shane Mosley at Lightweight would have beaten even the likes of Carlos Ortiz, because again the match ups.  So you are totally not out of line and in no way your comments are absurd.  Wladimir Klitscko's jab is really lethal and Joe Frazier pressure style with keep in backward because it will be difficult for him to get anywhere close to Klitschko.  Frazier likes to go at fighters and trap them in the ropes, Klitschko's movements has improved with the teachings of Emanuel Steward. So I think he will definitely utilize his jabs effectively and keep Frazier away on route for Klistchko to win by decision.", 10197, "None", 4],

However, I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that Joe Frazier who's roughly 215lbs would be a Cruiser weight by todays standards. The modern day Heavyweights are for to big and strong, Joe spent the prime of his career fighting Heavyweights that were Six Foot, two hundred twenty pounds not Six Seven Two fifty.", 10197, "R0J1W3BCaa", 1],

	111884 : ["When you delete something from your computer it is never really deleted. The explaination is that everything is saved to your hard drive basically as zeros and ones. A file is just a reference to an array of these zeros and ones. If the computer should really delete a file, it should delete all zeros and ones to be only zeros, and then remove the reference. This takes time. What really happens is that the reference is removed, so that the harddrive can just overwrite the old files zeros and ones, when it needs space. Removing a reference to a very large file takes no time. e.g. a file of 4,7GB would be approx. 37,6 billion zeros and ones. Zeroing these would be a waste of time. This also means that your can just get the file reference back, and viola, your file is there. Windows have built in support for this, which many fine programs utilize. Avira Unerase is one of these programs. And the Avira program is free too.(see source for link) Caution: Don't save files to the disk containing the lost files.
