	138837 : ["one can get shingles at any age.how serious depends up on underlying pts health.take a look at the follow in article \"Herpes zoster, a sporadic disease, is the consequence of reactivation of latent VZV from the dorsal root ganglia. Most patients have no history of recent exposure to other individuals with VZV infection. Herpes zoster occurs at all ages, but its incidence is highest (5 to 10 cases per 1000 persons) among individuals in the sixth decade of life and beyond. Recurrent herpes zoster is exceedingly rare except in immunocompromised hosts, especially those with AIDS. Herpes zoster, also called shingles, is characterized by a unilateral vesicular eruption within a dermatome, often associated with severe pain. The dermatomes from T3 to L3 are most frequently involved. If the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is involved, zoster ophthalmicus results. The factors responsible for the reactivation of VZV are not known. In children reactivation is usually benign, whereas in adults it can be debilitating. The continuum of pain from onset to resolution is known as zoster-associated pain. The onset of disease is heralded by pain within the dermatome that may precede lesions by 48 to 72 h; an erythematous maculopapular rash evolves rapidly into vesicular lesions (Fig. 164-2). In the normal host, these lesions may remain few in number and continue to form only for a period of 3 to 5 days. The total duration of disease is generally between 7 and 10 days; however, it may take as long as 2 to 4 weeks for the skin to return to normal. Patients with herpes zoster can transmit infection to seronegative individuals, with consequent chickenpox. In a few patients, characteristic localization of pain to a dermatome with serologic evidence of herpes zoster has been reported in the absence of skin lesions. When branches of the trigeminal nerve are involved, lesions may appear on the face, in the mouth, in the eye, or on the tongue. Zoster ophthalmicus is usually a debilitating condition that can result in blindness in the absence of antiviral therapy. In the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, pain and vesicles appear in the external auditory canal, and patients lose their sense of taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue while developing ipsilateral facial palsy. The geniculate ganglion of the sensory branch of the facial nerve is involved.", 11405, "AA11196202", 0],

	138841 : ["I am personally much more conservative than 'markmywords' or Biggie is with respect to income vs. payments for mortgages.  Whereas you might be able to get that loan on their income figures, you couldn't 'afford' the home with those incomes.  You'd be house poor. So, $485,000 is over the magic number of $417,000 which was the limit for conforming loans.  Unless in certain markets, this places the loan into jumbo category which increases the interest rate.  Assuming awesome credit and low debt, I'd guess that a 30 year fixed rate, $461,000 home loan (assume 5% down) would have an interest rate of ~7.25%  would cost $3145 per month for principal and interest.  I thought someone else's assessment of real estate taxes and insurance were way to low.  Real estate taxes probably average around 1.5% of value per year (I've seen anywhere from 0.5% to 4%) and that would add $607 per month for taxes.  Insurance on a home that expensive would probably easily run $100 per month.  Add-in $200 a month for the PMI (jumbo loan with only 5% down) and we're talking a total payment of $4052! Some banks might let you use crazy debt to income ratios (like 40% or 50%), but banks (a long time ago) used to use a 28/36 rule.  No more than 28% of gross income for a housing payment and no more than 36% of gross income for all debt payments.  Using the 28% for the housing payment and I'd want my income to be $14,470 per month (almost $175,000 per year) to buy that house!  That's a lot higher than the others reported, isn't it?   A general rule of thumb is that a mortgage should be 2x to 3x your annual salary.

If you don't put down at least 20% you usually have to have mortgage insurance, and many lenders are reluctant to even go that route for homes that cost more than $300,000.00.

It began with exquisitely  painful skin over the right hip area. I told our provider about it but she dismissed it as sciatica, I had had sciatic pain in the past. I did explain to her the pain was of the skin but as I day, she dismissed it. At the time there were no lesions.It continued and was severe. When the lesions did appear, she then correctly diagnosed it and as I remember she gave me a shot for the pain, but I just had to endure until it cleared up. I had very few lesions and by the time they erupted, the pain was beginning to lesson. This was the same Dr who misdiagnosed my husband 5 years before he died, telling him he had emphysema although the only symptom was spitting up a small amount of blood. He had no shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms. On the basis of that, a good Dr would have explored other possibilities for the source of the bleeding. Maybe the correct diagnosis of esophageal cancer in an earlier stage could have meant he would have been treated early enough to have a remission and be alive and comfortable today.

I went to the GP who diagnosed shingles and told me that it was unusual to get it so young. You normally get this when you are tired and run down but it is usual to get it in old age.

The virus lives on nerve cells - most of the time the immune system is strong enough to prevent an outbreak but if some one has a compromised immune system - either from chronic illness, stress, recent illnes, or normal aging - the virus can reactivate and cause shingles. While shingles is contagious it is only contagious to people who have not had either chickenpox or the the vaccine.
