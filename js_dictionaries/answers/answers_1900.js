	100740 : ["There are scriptures to back Rick Warren's belief: Romans 14:10-12 \"You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.  It is written: “‘As surely as I live,' says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.'” So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.\" John 14:6 \" Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.\" Hebrews 9:27 \" And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment,\" Revelation 20:12 \"I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God's throne. And the books were opened, including the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books.\" The first thing you have to understand about Rick Warren's statement is that he clearly says we can \"surmise from the bible\" that we will be asked two questions.  That means the bible doesn't specifically say we will hear those two questions word-for-word, but based on the scripture cited above we know that we need to accept Jesus to get to the Father in Heaven and we will be judged and need to give an account for our lives. Rick Warren just boiled this information down into two simple questions that everyone can grasp.  It doesn't mean he is lying or is a false prophet.", 9753, "3cfe5bb9470a482c67ca2220e8d3795eaa", 2],

Christians, no matter what denomination, have and will succumb to temptation at times. but just to add some perspective... even the early church had what might be considered denominational squabbles. look at Acts 13 and 14, where Barnabas and Saul (who becomes Paul) are the Christian dynamic duo - healing, teaching, converting Jews and Gentiles left and right. safe to say, these guys are tight and they have a strong relationship with God - but come Acts 15:36 and they had a \"sharp\" disagreement and went their separate ways - united in Spirit, but they still had a serious spat and they needed their time apart. i like to think the denomination squabbles that you mention are a lot like that, just on a larger scale", 9753, "6WKAvUQraa", 0],
	100764 : ["Faith without works is clear: Rom. 3:20, 20 Rom. 4:5 Eph. 2:8-9 Gal. 2:16 Titus 3:5 Faith with works seems clear in: James 2:24 Many passages in Hebrews Faith with works is all through the Old Testament (Duet. 30; Ezek. 18; 30 and many many more) The split is in Pauline Authorship. Paul is the Apostle to the Gentiles (Rom. 11:13) and received the mystery for the church and the Body of Christ (Gal. 1; Eph. 3) So the best answer is rather simple. However, we must understand that while works is included in the method of salvation appropriation for some dispensations, there is never any individual that earns their way to heaven.  The blood of Christ is the only thing that pays for the debt of sin. The faith and works combo is for people before the church age, and at the beginning of the church age (resurrection doctrinally), up through Acts 7 (as far as revelation at the time was concerned), and it will pick up again during the tribulation period after the rapture of the church. The faith WITHOUT works passages, which are crystal clear (listed above) are applicable during the church age.  How much faith is enough - faith is a gift from God given to every man (Rom. 12:3).  It is simply required that we place that faith in Jesus Christ by receiving (John 1:12) as Savior, and trusting (Eph. 1:13) Him for Salvation, at which point we are \"sealed by the spirit until the day of redemption\" (Eph. 1:14; 4:30). How much works is good enough - applicable in the tribulation period - According to Hebrews, 10:26 seems to align with the warning given in Revelation 14.  There fore it is required that one profess faith and not turn from it, and not to take the mark. Direct connection with or worship of the Antichrist is pretty much a prerequisite for someone on the path to go off the path.  Beyond that, I'm sure the Angel with the everlasting gospel (Rev. 14), the two witnesses (Rev. 11), and Christ himself (Ezek. 20:35), will make their requirements quite clear to them.", 9753, "vNvtwuBfaa", -1],

It is His idea to have that relationship with us.  Once you belong to Him, faith can not be measured and our works can never be enough to save us because we are already forgiven and declared God's child..   It is what Jesus has done for us and not anything that we can do that causes our salvation.   However, Jesus points out that faith without works is dead.  This means that when you love Him and you love others, you become the hands and feet of Jesus.  This is what Christians are here for.", 9753, "253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa", 0],

I got a frozen sandwich, crackers plain and an itty bitty apple.  I decided the school lunches were better, so I charged them.  Back in the day, lunch was only $  .65.  Towards the end of school, the teacher told me I couldn't get my report card until this debt was paid (it came to $4.50, or something close to that).  I didn't have any money as a 10 year old, so I decided to raid her purse.  There wasn't any money in there, but she did have the checkbook.   My brilliant mind of 10 years came up with the idea of stealing a check, forging her signature and writing this check out to the school for the amount owed.....in pencil.  I got away with it......for a while.  Seemingly, when you are 10, you don't think of everything, and I didn't realize my parents had their checking account set up for the cancelled checks to come back to them.  Yeppers, I got caught. I spent the entire summer working off that money.  I got paid $ .50 for mowing a 2 acre yard, with a push mower....got $  .5 for vacuuming a 2000sf house......it took the entire summer to work off that money, and I didn't get to go to my grandparents (as I did each summer) to play on the farm.

	100778 : ["It is not a matter of doing or achieving faith or works, so this question cannot be answered. It is a matter of \"walking.\"  If we walk by faith in Jesus (faith which leads to obedience), then we will eventually end up in the place where we see the One we believe in face to face.  And it is not a matter of faith or faith plus works. They are one and the same. It is like a 2-sided coin. On one side is faith, and on the other side is the action that shows you truly do believe.  If you don't believe me read in Hebrews where it talks about entering into the rest. You will see how it says that the Israelites did not enter the rest because they did not believe (Heb. 3:1), and then just a few lines further it says they did not enter because of their disobedience (Heb. 4:11). The author says it as though he does not even realize he has changed the word.  Also, the book that most Christians will admit is the most important theological book is Romans. Paul begins and ends the book with a \"summary\" of the gospel he preaches. He says in Romans 1:5 that the gospel that he was called to preach to the gentiles is the gospel that teaches FAITH THAT LEADS TO OBEDIENCE. He ends Romans with saying that Jesus' proclamation that has been revealed was so that all nations might believe AND obey Him (Rom. 16:26).  And of course there is the book of James which states that faith without works is dead. That means that they are completely connected. You can't say you are saved by faith unless it is alive faith which proves itself by action.  And if there is still any doubt, test it. Think of any sin you struggle with. Think of something that you can't seem to let go of. If you are honest, you will be able to idenitify a lack of faith that is the root of this behavior. For instance, lets say someone steals. This person continues to steal but sincerely believes they have faith in Christ. Yes, they have faith, perhaps, in the fact that he died for them. This is a great start, and where we all begin in our faith. BUT do they have faith that God will provide for all their needs. I think not. This can be seen in any thing we do or do not do that is against God's laws.  So, again, in summary. No one can look to see if they have enough faith/obedience in order to be saved. We all fail at times. But it is a walk. A walk of faith with Jesus. If we are truly walking in faith, when we fall, we will get back up and keep walking. This is the only thing to be concerned with. Not how much, but whether we are continuing in it. Hope this helps.", 9753, "None", 2],
	100779 : ["1. Faith and Works are both needed. 2. Faith can't be measured by amounts, it either exists or it doesn't. That's why Christ said that if he had faith the size of a mustard seed grain, we could tell a mountain to move and it would move. (Matthew 17:20) And also, when speaking of Christ coming, the question is asked, \"will he find faith?\" (Luke 18:8) The just shall live by faith. That is if someone has faith, he will live. It doesn't say how much. As far as works, doing justice is as easy as breathing when there's faith. But if someone measures how much work is enough, then it ceases to be faith and it becomes works of the flesh because it's seeking for the minimum it can do to please God.
