	119292 : ["Untrue Armenian genocide (I call it GenoLIE) and Turkish hate is only single thing that unifies their nation. It motivates them to help their state and to keep them more racist. Think about many nationalist diaspora Armenians. It is also only single hope to get rid of their geography which they are jailed now and to have some economic movement. We can not accept an untrue thing to make people happy. Can you imagine what will follow? 1. All of the non-Armenian supporters of GenoLIE will have more free time to support PKK and they will have more free time to pop up more GenoLIEs. They already started for new GenoLIEs like Pontus. 2. Their propaganda materials say that Hitler is inspired from Ottoman Empire. In fact it is adverse. They are inspired from Jewish people which got money from Germany due to  massacre during WW-II. So they are after money and land to have powerfull state, not the approval of their Grandfather's tales. I have a question to you. Would you like to be ashamed to the whole World because of untrue things? --------------------- Gerçekdışı Ermeni soykırımı (SoykırıldıkYALANI) ve Türk düşmanlığı onların uluslarını birarada tutmalarını sağlayan tek olaydır. Devletlerine daha fazla yardım etmeleri ve onları daha ırkçı kılmak için de motive eder. Milyonlarca milliyetçi diaspora Ermenisi'ni düşün. Ayrıca SoykırıldıkYALANI Ermenistan'ın mahkum olduğu coğrafya'dan kurtulabilmesi ve ekonomik hareketlilik kazanabilmesi için tek umut ışığıdır. İnsanları mutlu etmek için gerçek olmayan birşeyi kabul edemeyiz. Arkasından neler gelebileceğini tahmin edebiliyor musun? 1. SoykırıldıkYALANInın Ermeni olmayan destekçilerine PKK'yı desteklemek ve SoykırıldıkYALANları kurgulamak için daha çok zaman vermiş oluruz. Pontus SoykırıldıkYALANI üzerine çalışmaya başladılar bile. 2. Onların propaganda materyallerinde deniyor ki Hitler Osmanlı İmparatorluğundan esinlenmiştir. Gerçek ise tam tersidir. Onlar 2. Dünya savaşındaki katliamlar sebebiyle tazminat alan Yahudilerden esinlenmişlerdir. Yani sonuçta istedikleri daha güçlü bir devlete sahip olmak için, tazminat ve topraktır, dedelerinin hikayelerinin onaylanması değil. Sana bir sorum olacak.
