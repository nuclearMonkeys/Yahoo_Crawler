Law school admissions are based primarily on GPA and LSAT scores, with some consideration of letters of recommendation and sometimes additional factors for selective schools.¬†¬† There are actually a number of science majors in law school, as a STEM degree is necessary to be licensed to practice patent law.¬† I've known students to go to law school with degrees in music, theater, art, biology, chemistry, engineering, psychology, criminal justice, history, political science, business, etc.¬† You can seriously go with any degree.

Expensive booze can give you every-bit as much as a hangover as cheap.¬†¬† Any vodka can reduce some hangover effects, because it is purified.¬† It's pretty much ethanol and water, with small impurities.¬† The impurities are so low that the over-distilled expensive stuff makes little difference. Unless the spirit is complete dirt, with methanol or higher alcohols mixed in it, it won't be bad. Cheap supermarket vodka is made often in the same plant as brands.", 7115, "5vWSAhMnaa", -1],

A pint would be two units of alcohol and the UK limit for drinking is three units, so I'd be well below.

	50558 : ["Who is the \"they\" that told you this? Do you understand the different levels of nursing? Community colleges often have programs that make you an LPN. You can work in a doctor's office then, taking blood pressure and pulse measurements. To be an RN, you need a more complete program. That may be what they meant by a dual program, although I don't see how you could finish both programs at the same time. There are many accelerated nursing programs now that take one year if you already have a bachelor's degree, as long as you have taken some science courses. I know someone who had a math degree and got her nursing degree in 1 year. So you could major in anything. You don't have to decide now. Get your general education courses done at the CC- English, math, a social science, a language, etc. Then you can figure out which way you want to go.¬†", 7109, "cbMTODDZaa", -2],
	50559 : ["It depends a little on your field of study and the type of job you're seeking.¬† In some cases, the school you attend does make a big difference, but in others it really doesn't.¬† Attending a prestigious school can help with networking, and alumni of schools like Princeton often look out for other alumni.¬† But ultimately it largely depends on what you do while in college - get good grades, get involved, do internships or research or other such opportunities, etc.¬†", 7110, "xif22nwoaa", 2],

Anonymous meant to say that after you go to graduate school, your undergraduate school DOESN'T matter any more. That's mostly true. I went to an elite school for my bachelor's and a good state school for the graduate degrees. No one knows or cares where I did my ug work. BUT I also agree with Anonymous that you can't lump \"state schools\" together. Many are in the listings of the top universities in the world- U. of Virginia, UNC, UCLA, UC-Berkeley and many more. Penn State has the top philosophy program in the country- possibly in the world. Georgia Tech is a top-rated engineering program. Look at your major, and look up the lists of ranked schools. You may be able to get a top-notch education cheaper. And those schools are just as prized by employers.¬†", 7110, "cbMTODDZaa", 1],

	50603 : ["Yes. ¬†How much and in what ways depends, in part, on the major and the field into which the student goes for a career. ¬†For example, there are investment banking firms that only recruit from specific schools. ¬†If you don't attend one of those schools, you won't be interviewed no matter what your GPA is. A hiring manager could also have a particularly positive or negative experience or impression of ANY university. Networking and alumni are the biggest pluses of attending a smaller, more elite university. Princeton alumni are more likely to hire or at least consider Princeton graduates. ¬† It also depends on the reputation of the major. ¬†For example, Georgia Tech, University of Michigan, and UT-Austin ¬†are better choices than most \"Ivies\" for Astronautical Engineering. MIT still ranks ¬†#1, but it isn't technically in the Ivy League. Even across public universities there are significant difference in reputation because many of the top public universities are just as selective as private, elite schools. ¬†Boise State isn't going to rate with employers the same as UC Berkeley. ¬†", 7110, "RVK1NrNJaa", 0],
