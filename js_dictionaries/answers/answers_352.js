	18058 : ["There is no benzene in laundry detergent. There are benzene derived compounds called alkylbenzene sulfonates and related compounds that act as surfactants. But these are reaction products that contain no free benzene solvent. Some people see these chemical names and have no idea that a compound is not the same thing as the individual components. They just see a recognizable word fragment in a compound name and freak out, when in fact these compounds are completely safe to use as intended. It's the equivalent of someone refusing to eat salt (sodium chloride) because it contains two extremely harmful components: sodium, a heavy metal that explodes when it contacts water, and chlorine, a deadly choking gas that can kill within minutes. Some manufacturers go along with public campaigns to replace ingredients like ddbsa and bsa in their cleaning products, not because they are hazardous in the product, but because they are easy to replace in the formulation, plus it's easier than trying to educate the ignorant consumers who tend to have a negative knee-jerk reaction to anything involving chemicals these days.", 3066, "Q5S8b24eaa", 6],

My furnace is 58 years old and my heat exchanger is fine although several crooked furnace techs tried to say it was cracked and i needed to buy a new system. Naturally they didn't show me any pictures, video, or proof so i told them take a hike. I bought my own video inspection camera for $59 and unlike the furnace con men i fully disassembled the back of the furnace then carefully looked at every square inch of the heat exchanger and of course found NOTHING.

	18065 : ["Wholly ffuck!(excuse my French) but that is what a plumber would say out loud.  I hand wash dishes too.  . I fill the sink over half full of soapy water and wash the dishes .  As it is a double sink  I rinse on the other half and into the drying rack.  If your fingers squeak when you rub on a wet dish = it is clean.  That is dishes, pots pans, cups, bowls, mugs, forks, spoons, knives. Soapy one sink and rinse in other sink. . Laundry is done once a month or so.  Showers are 10 minutes and I am done. Your septic tank is probably 1000 gallon(the small ones are 600 gallons.    The tank holds the solids from your poop chute, and kitchen food and your hair and dead skin cells and scabs and TP.   If you use a garburator then that food also goes into the septic tank as solid materials, and dirt and soil from gardening off your clothes and bits of clothes and that is about it. .   I don't have a garburetor, nor do I use the toilet as a waste basket.  Nor am I heavy with bleach. I rarely use it.  Nor do other chemicals go into the system. .  I am only asking this because I was talking to plumbers who say they NEVER clean their tank. It works just fine. A leech field aka septic field aka drainage field if you are in decent ground (meaning not clay and the bottom of a valley or ravine) will absorb the water coming out of the sink, toilet, bathtub, shower, laundry tub and that water will go into the soil lower than your basement floor(unless you are in a flood plain and this year the water is up and is seeping into the basement(meaning it can't go down when it is flooding up.) Then YOU have problems.   Most homes are built on ground that is not swamp land (so not the lowest point)  When you are above that then water will always go down...as it does everytime it rains. . TP does break down, but slowly. Paper such as newsprint won't break down at all. Neither will pampers or Maxipads or Pantiliners.  So those things remain solids in the septic tank, filling it.  Basically what comes out your lower backside is what goes in the toilet.  That is it. 10 years go by and I see it is not even half full. I figure for 1 person it would take 40 years before it needed pumping out.   It is Full of water, yes but that just goes into the drainage field to drain away to HELL or Lower.(like China) You got the concept. . You will NEVER FILL IT.  Your way definitely 100 years can go by before it needs pumping out.", 3070, "None", -1],
