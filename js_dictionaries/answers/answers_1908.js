We did not party all the time, but saved some for the time when we could move ahead,, such as college or buying our own business.  Most all of us have a problem with work, especially if we can get money from others.. the fast buck! The right idea has always been the hand-up idea and not the hand out! We get Liberal hand outs of those who have to work hard to earn-- through taxation! That is stupidity, but it can get one elected! The more one can give our taxes to voters who do not want to work hard, the more we can get those votes! If we can use the media, out of their stupidity, the more we can take hard workers taxes as give-aways and not hand-ups to allow them to earn! Proof! If you were alive in the 50's you would have a choice.. go to school or loose out! It was free to all Americans and even minorities had this choice. The Politicians looked at their districts and saw churches supporting food and clothing. So they did not ask Fed help! In the 60's, we may note, the Liberals took over. They had all kinds of ideas that were not good! If they knew World History they would not of tried them again! We know that pressure for re-election or to be elected came from Minorities. But it was not for \"Hand-Ups\", but for hand-outs! One cannot teach a man/woman to fish if all we do is supply the fish! We only make a dependent! You want some American History that has  been removed by Liberals in our schools? In 1887 the worst depression occurred.. more than 35% of Americans had no job! It was 24% in 1929! Now, what happened that gave us jobs? A crook, some would say, bought up companies and merged them! Then he got others to hire! America works when America supports work!  We need Social Security as it was set up and we cannot undue what was! But abortion stole those that would keep it in place! This is part of financial analysis on our future citizens and putting in place others sex actions that are irresponsible will kill SS; the Heath Care Bill just enacted! Now, abortion is in place to make sure Seniors born in the mid-50's will not have SS!  I was told by AARP that women did not have the same health care as men! When I went to get a prescription for my marriage I was told that I could not.. it was for looks and for women's veins in their legs! Cosmetic injection, but I could not get help! I am wondering, is the cosmetic so important that it is more than marriage, which consists of Husband and Wife? It must be with the Liberals as they are our speakers! They are the ones SOME elect! If one looks at what bills and supports the Democrats have passed, you have to conclude., it was their ideas that caused school shootings; it was their ideas that made need of the killing of the unborn; it was their denial that makes these continue! Guns are to blame? We had guns since when? No, they are liars and are in our face! We had no need to kill the most innocent of us all! But we seem to now!  I have had to come to the absolute conclusion that if I ever voted for a Liberal, mostly now Democrat, I would have to hate my own Country and my fellow Americans! But, do not vote straight Republican, a mistake that many make. There are responsible and mostly honest Dems out there. They need our support! But do not vote for Liberals.. as they will blame objects instead of their mistakes; they will blame others, such as a President, when they voted against the veto and passed STUPID and anti-American bills! Investigate and seek the facts! Notice that few Conservatives will blame just the President, if Liberal! But they will, only if this uninformed, or borderline Communist veto's America! Look at the votes, not their foolish words.. see the results of each bill passed and who passed them! Then you will see why we are the tail of Communist China as we borrow from the Communists.. we use to be the head and could lend! Open you minds away from the Liberal Media!

The secret rapture is a man made doctrine.  During the Protestant reformation, they all pointed directly to the Roman Catholic Church as being the anti-Christ beast of Revelation.  The Catholic Church commissioned several Jesuit priests to write counter interpretations of prophecy that would point to the Antichrist being in a different time period, so as to take the focus off the Catholic Church.   Francisco Ribera, one of those Jesuit priests, put forth the Futurist interpretation saying that Antichrist prophecies were to be fulfilled in a seven year tribulation period somewhere in the distant future. .   John Darby also believed in this doctrine, but he was actually not the original inventor of this idea.   This futurist theory is now the most widely accepted theory and is accepted by most Fundamentalist churches today.
