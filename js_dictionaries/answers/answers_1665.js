The idea that the sun's apparent position in relation to the arbitrary pattern of random stars in the sky as they appeared 2000 years ago could have any affect on a human's life is simply ludicrous. Its the human belief we are somehow cosmically special, that the universe influences our daily lives.

	88921 : ["It really is nonsense. It implies that the Earth is some sort of center to everything. If you were on another planet, the constellations of stars would not be the same. The constellations only resemble significant things relative to looking at them from planet earth, so implying you are born under stars, constellations, signs, etc, that somehow predict fate is implying that these cosmic objects only have specific meaning to planet Earth. If I was born in the Andromeda galaxy, I would not be able to see any of those stars, and they would have no magical meaning to me. If I was on Pluto, the stars of any constellation would not resemble the same thing as they do on Earth because I am looking at them from a different angle. So to imply that certain cosmic objects have specific meaning only to life on planet Earth is really just none sense, and it is incredibly frustrating when ignorant people think that somehow the cosmos revolves around their own fate.", 9309, "QbEz5HDdaa", 1],
	88922 : ["Goodgirl, I have an opinion based on research and experience, not just ignorant guesswork or dogma.  I have studied astrology for many years and I see what it is.  People are influenced by the planets and the constellations.  People are born with characteristics which are a result of the conditions of the planets and constellations at the time and place of their birth.  This can be seen simply by studying the questions people ask about themselves and the locations of planets and constellations at their birth and also at the time they ask the questions.  I could list countless examples but that would be difficult.  Let me explain by giving you a simple fictitious example.   A person asks why is it that he or she keeps finding his/her self in abusive relationships, one after another, as if they cannot find and form a relationship with a person who does not abuse him or her.  A study of the person's natal aspects (relative positions of planets) shows that the person has a very close opposition to his or her Mars.  The astrology books say that the person will have abusive relationships.  The astrology cannot be proven because everything is subjective.  Did the person really have abusive relationships?  Is the person's definition of abusive correct?  Is there a numerical value to give to anything?  Is the astrology reading precise?  No, nothing is precise.  Nothing can be proven.  However, it is incorrect to state that the astrology is worthless.", 9309, "38c26599be871d9e5511dbd7d9622dc6aa", -4],

In nature everywhere there is balance.We need carnivores to keep the herbivores in check preventing overgrazing plant life and overpopulation.We also need species in between which are the omnivores which are the ultimate survivors. Life is always survival of the fittest ,even in modern society the alphas like alpha males gets it all.Humans have the ability to digest meat and we also possess canines for that exact reason.We also have eyes in the front of our faces like carnivores for the very purpose of hunting unlike herbivores who have eyes on the sides of the head to spot danger over a wide area and run away (I'm glad i'm not a herbivore).It is foolish to not do what nature had intended.I bet those animals will eat us without a second thought even the herbivores would eat us if they had the ability.The problem is only with the method of killing.In Halal and maybe even Kosher method of killing the throat is slit along with the veins that supply blood to the brain assuring a more painless death.Of course they pronounce the name of God while killing for religious purposes.Of course some people will still argue because we are ending a life but hey even plants have life.That is reality.It's kill or be killed.Thrive and destroy.Grow or perish.Kill bacteria,plants,animals and other life so that 'you' will survive.Harsh reality.But truth.We can avoid it as much as we can but we can go no further either out of wisdom or necessity. If you are a believer in God then God had a reason for giving humans the ability to eat meat.Many animals and plants have been created for the very purpose of feeding us.That is their very reason for existence.So eat them.  As for farmers, you learn young that there is a difference between pets and livestock and don't ever allow yourself to become attached to livestock.

	88958 : ["This is a huge debate that has been fought out for many years.  You must realize that people decide to become vegetarian or vegan for many different reasons, not simply because they love animals.  Decided to stop eating meat is a serious decision, especially if your plans are long term.  If you start eating meat after not eating anything from an animal for several years, it could kill you because your body isn't used to properly ridding itself of the bacteria that is aquired from meat. Many people still eat meat even though they love animals because they recognize that eating meat is natural, just as a tiger eats its prey, humans eat theirs.  The issue with that is the way our animals our killed, in slaughter houses, many times with awful conditions.  The conditions of slaughter houses and how the animals are treated there is one reason why many people choose a life without meat. Many people may also consider becoming vegan or a vegetarian as ridding the body of toxic waste (cleansing the spirit...etc.).  This doesn't always have to do with a love for animals, but rather, a love for oneself. Still there are others who only choose to eat certain types of meat because they like the way it tastes, or simply because they have a pet chicken and no longer wish to eat something that resembles their pet.   Whatever the reason, choosing to not eat meat is a personal decision, and there really is no right or wrong answer.  Would it be great if everyone could survive without eating animals?  Sure, but it is never going to happen.  As long as there are animals in the world, there will always be someone or something eating them.  It's the cruelty of nature.
