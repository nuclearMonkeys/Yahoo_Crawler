There is already pent-up anger and frustration in the country, and now to see the media coming out of the closet, not even bothering to hide their censorship and manipulative ways for their corporate interests and brazenly manipulating public opinion out in the open does nothing more than to throw white gas on an already smoldering pile of kindling.  CNN, FOX, ABC, CBS, NBC, et al, are sending a message to America: Your voice doesn't matter. We will frame the debate for you and decide what is acceptable.  I would like to hope that the American public would now see the mainstream media for what it is: Pressitutes for corporate and entrenched government interests. Everyday I make an effort to show at least one person this blatant manipulation of public opinion.

	82841 : ["The trouble comes because 'global warming' was so exagerated over the years.  A recent TV programme suggested a rise in sea level of 30 metres!  The generally agreed predicted rise by the end of the century is set at 58cm! The United Nations report this year put it in perspective with the following facts and predictions: If atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases double compared to pre-industrial levels, this would “likely” cause an average warming of around 3°C. The world's average surface temperature has increased by around 0.74°C over the past 100 years (1906 - 2005). A warming of about 0.2°C is projected for each of the next two decades. The best estimates for sea-level rise due to ocean expansion and glacier melt by the end of the century is 28 - 58 cm. However, larger values of up to 1 m by 2100 cannot be ruled out. (Definitely not 30 M!). Sea ice is projected to shrink in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Large areas of the Arctic Ocean could lose year-round ice cover by the end of the 21st century.   But research shows that whilst the arctic ice is melting the Antarctic is actually thickening. Whilst it is widely accepted that man has an influence on warming it is the extent of this that is in question.  Because environmentalists so exagerated Global Warming the majority of scientists politicians and pundits now use the term 'Climate Change'. Many factors affect and effect climate change.   The suns rays and the power of the sun varies substantially and does directly effect temperature and atmosphere. It is well documented that wind patterns have moved Westerly and this is a large factor in ice melt in the arctic. The earths magnetic field is slowly changing and becoming more complex.  This also has direct effects on the atmosphere and warming.  Magnetic anomolies are growing and the magnetic pole is moving 14 kilometers a year leading scientists to conclude that the poles are in the early stages of a magnetic flip. The sad truth is that whilst there are many factors involved most of what has been said up to now has been very one sided and extremely bad science.  It has set out to prove a theory rather than test it and together with the wild exagerations has produced many sceptics. We really do need not only good scientific research and interpretation, but also some level headed thinking and open and honest debate.    The effects being debated as being bad are only a small - possibly minute change in temperature.  If we over do the changes it would be easy to effect the reverse and plunge the world into another ice age. The carpenters maxim of 'measure twice, cut once' needs to be applied. The eco warriors have damaged the debate.  That said the UN has instilled some common sense and good base figures and that gives everyone something to work from. To what extent man has had in the warming is open to debate but what is now widely accepted is that mankind is living beyond it's means in the way it is wasteful and polluting.  Much good will come from that.", 9110, "None", 1],
