Rapture = heresy; Fireball (aka Shadowfire aka Corvus Blackthorne aka Nightwulf aka Reynaldo Weeks) should be beheaded for spreading this heresy on Yahoo Answers (deceiving Christians into false hope). Dreams/thoughts are from 1)angels who always do good; 2)demons who never do good; or 3)you making shyt up in your head while you sleep trying to solve your problems; or from 4) your gov't using this supertechnology. Usually, dreams/thoughts are from demons. So, that explains a lot of people being in the wrong all the time. Rapture thing is from demons but you can't rule out the gov't using some super technology like Project Blue Beam to kind of introduce people to the evil flying antichrist who will ride on a donkey into the Third Temple. So, churches who closed for COVID (or had COVID measures like dipping spoon into some liquid like alcohol) are no longer Christ's but now are working for Satan promoting the new COVID religion. Last Patriarch is Patriarch Irenaios 1st. He blessed Catacomb movement. For liturgy what you need is antiminis (towel with remains of saints sewn into it); wax candles; one cup/one spoon; non-Kosher non-yeast non-barcoded non-qrcoded wine/bread. Kosher = sprinkled with blood. Yeast is grown on pig bacteria. QRcode = barcode = mark of the beast. Roman Catholics tried one cup and one spoon and got sick with Bubonic plague (no laughing matter). You must hide (within a small group of 10-15 people according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov) in order to escape the unforgivable mark of the beast. No documents once you hid because documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. No electronics once you hid because antichrist's minions will track you using electronics that you got. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the antichrist using Tesla's ether. In case you're in 'Murica and want to hide, then consider inland Alaska. Arctic Circle = Security Circle for WW3.

Bring a raincoat, you might get a 5 minute sprinkle at anytime. See the little mermaid. She's by the cruise terminal. You might see online that the exchange rate is prob something around 5:1. This means nothing. In a restaurant/pub, a pint will cost roughly $10, and a burgers with chips with cost about $20 (all in USD). You should see the Christianborg castle, and Maersk is also based out of there (if you're interested in the shipping industry). Both are close to the cruise terminals as well. Tivoli is about 1or 2mi from the terminal. I'll warn you now. Tivoli Gardens is NOT Six Flags. It's a very small amusement park, and it cost and equivalent of about $45-50 for 1 day pass, or you'd have to pay per ride. Rides are VERY short, which is great for having people in and out, instead of spending almost 2 hrs online, but if you're paying to get in, then paying per ride, you must take this in consideration. It's not too bad. As far a language concerns, almost everyone speaks English, so it shouldn't be a problem. Make sure you get your VAT papers from the appropriate souvenir shops, because you'll be surprised how much tax you pay in this socialist state. A final thing... as far as transportation, just get a bicycle. Everyone will be on bicycles, and you'll find bicycle parking lots EVERYWHERE. Why? Gas is not only sold per litre, but it's also very expensive. Cars too are also expensive, and the taxes on both are really high. Plan carefully, and watch your dollar are my final words of advice to you. If you want to go to the Baltic region still, I'd say go to Estonia. The cost of living in Talin might be as little as a third of Copenhagen. Stay in the old town, it's beautiful, the people are extremely nice, and you will not have worry about language barriers.

	66693 : ["The first thing I will recommend is to test your water first to see what type of water contamination you have.  If your water does not sud enough and if you have to use a lot of detergents and soaps, see staining on your sinks, tubs, showers, or if you water flows very slowly because your pipes and showerhead are plugged, you need a water softener. Softener will remove calcium and magnesium that makes your water hard and cause deposits in your pipes and appliances. If you have bad taste and odor in your water then you need a filter to remove contaminants that make your water taste bad. There are water treatment systems that work as both filter and softener but they could be very expensive.

	66709 : ["It is fairly simple to understand the difference between water filtration and water softening.  Determining which method is best for your situation requires a water test.  Here is an overview of what happens when you filter or soften water. Filtering water involves separating “suspended” particles, like manganese, iron, hydrogen sulfide or other organic matter from the source water. By passing water through a “filter/media pack,” these small particles are trapped–and cleaner “filtered” water flows through.  As a filter traps more and more particles it allows less and less filtered water to pass through.  Eventually it becomes saturated with trapped contaminents and must be replaced – a sure sign that your filter needs replaced is substantially reduced water flow.  When we recommend a filter or a combination of filters as part of the solution to your water problems we set up a filter replacement schedule.  This schedule is based on the quality of the source water and estimated gallons used per month to insure that the filters never become completely saturated.  Waiting until the filter is clogged to replace it may allow contaminents through the system, fouling other equipment down line or even jeopardizing the health of your family.", 8343, "p4YO9IUdaa", 0],
