Since marriage is a legal union, then it should be defined by the state.    This is an interesting question.  I'm seriously thinking about this.  I am a traditionalist.  My personal opinion is that marriage should only be a union between a man and a woman.  However, if two men or two women can be allowed to marry, then why can't you have other non-traditional marriages?  Why not incestuous marriages?   Why not a marriage among three or more people?

	86076 : ["Ford was correct, he knew that by raising his employees pay that they would be able to afford the cars that they were building.  He was paying his workers the un-heard of sum of $5.00 a day.  By raising the workers pay he turned his workers into his customers and built more cars, and with more cars came more orders for parts for the cars so the concept of a rising tide lifts all boats was proven to work. Ford also was one of the first to get the idea that he had to do something about his absenteeism when he opened River Rouge, because he could no longer afford to keep idlers waiting to do jobs from men who were out sick.  River Rouge employed over 10,000 workers which meant that he would need to keep 10% on standby or risk shutting the plant down.  He knew that the main reason men missed work was because they were sick.  Ford put a clinic in the plant and eventually let family members use it also so that they could stay well and the men would not have to miss work to tend to a sick wife. Henry J. Kaiser did almost the exact same thing in his shipyards in World War 2.  Under the speed which he built a ship the weakest part of the chain was the man or woman doing the work.  If 4 or 5 workers were missing work then replacements had to be gotten and the process could slow down the building.  Henry J. Kaiser built clinics and later some hospitals for his workers, he began to deduct a small amount from the workers checks to cover the costs so that there would be no out of pocket expenses so that if a worker was short he could go and not have to worry about paying.   And that is how you wound up with employer based health care, it was not done out of a sense of goodwill.  It was done to keep the plants humming along. If you want to see if good wages and job creation can work better than a tax cut which may just get socked away into a trust then look at Boulder City, NV which was built to support the workers that were building Boulder (Hoover) Dam.  A full city grew under the BLR, yup, because the government.", 9211, "lIz2qQcdaa", 1],
	86077 : ["I am a Mormon - yes also Christian... I am not sure, I don't know if I will get to the Celestial Kingdom (heaven).  But I do know that I am trying to be like Him as much as I can and that I have made covenants in the temple and if I live worthily I can obtain the highest degree of glory, The Celestial Kingdom.  I cannot prove it, but I do have a testimony of the truthfulness and the divinity.  I cannot make anyone believe it, they have to study it out in their mind and heart, pray about it, ask if it is true, as I have, and they will find out for themselves.  I believe in repentance along with that, I believe once you have repented of a sin, you must try your hardest not to do that again or it is like you never were forgiven for it in the first place.  I do not believe just because a person accepts Christ as their Savior or into their heart or whatever that they are \"saved\" no matter what they do on earth, there is much more to it than just accepting Christ.  You have to make covenants, promises, and if you keep yours He will keep His, \"I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” (D&C 82:10.)", 9209, "None", 0],
	86078 : ["It boils down to this.  What we believe doesn't dictate what is Truth or not.   Whether we can make heads or tails out of what God has said in His word doesn't affect whether it is True or not.  Not everything in the Bible makes sense to our human minds.  We are trying to understand the one who created the universe and all the mysteries of it with a human mind that can barely remember what it had for breakfast yesterday. I also think you have a misunderstand of the relationship between Jesus and God.  I am not going to go deep into theology here, but the basic relationship is that there is a unity between Jesus and God that we as humans can not understand.  Along with the Holy Spirit, God and Jesus are all one and yet all 3 are separate.  It's a a mystery as to how that can be, yet it is Truth.  That means that what Jesus forgives is also forgiven by the Father and what the Father loves and commands Jesus obeys and willing submits Himself to doing. IF you are sincerely curious about this, my advice is for you to go to a full gospel church and ask questions of the Pastor there.  But you have to go with a willingness to be challenged in what you believe and a willingness to learn new things.", 9209, "4d6ac3d4ec7f2529977fef7a45742bf0aa", 0],
