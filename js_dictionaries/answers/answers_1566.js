I'm not a tax lawyer, so this is in general terms, but your \"bonus\" will be in a different location on your W-2 than your \"commission.\"  This in turn will move much of the tax burden for this income from your employer to you.

	83958 : ["The nasty little control freaks tend to arise over time in any religion. Jesus was one of the teachers who arose to counteract that. You're oversimplifying his message a bit there, but you've got the general idea of his position with respect to conventional authority. But he's not the only one who questioned the previous writers; you don't seem to have a very good sense of what is IN the Bible. Ecclesiastes was written to challenge the whole idea that the world was somehow fair. Job was written to dispute the idea that God always guaranteed prosperity to those who obeyed him. (Forget the last chapter of Job; it was jammed in by someone who wanted to undercut that message.) The Torah talks about God as a God of his chosen people, competing against other gods. But Isaiah writes of the other gods as mere human inventions, and directs Hebrew worship toward the idea of one real God. After a long string of bossy and sometimes violent prophets, the writer of Jonah came up with an outright lampoon on the concept: Jonah runs away when told to go prophesy, and has to be forced to do so. Then when he tells people to repent, and they do, he gets upset because God accepts their repentance and his prophesied disaster doesn't happen--and he's more concerned with whether he looks like a fool than with what happens to all those people. Jesus is in a tradition of re-interpreting and re-invigorating the Bible's message, and the characteristic of that tradition is that it usually gets authorities--who thought they already knew everything important about God--ticked off.  I don't know what your problem is with Paul, because I see him as doing the same thing. (Obviously my best case for that is I Corinthians 13.) The tendency of a conservative authority to resist new spiritual understanding continues well beyond the New Testament, too, as the follow attest: They claimed power from heaven; but they had made that heaven remote and they kept its power to themselves, to build up new separate institutions among upstart heroes on earth. Such institutions had been hastily thrown up by men for men. To these human institutions a new generation of Christians was prepared to transfer that sense of solemn delight which men of the old religion still sought in the clustering stars. -- Peter Brown, \"The Making of Late Antiquity\" \"Belief shifts. People start out believing in the god and end up believing in the structure.\" -- Terry Pratchett, \"Small Gods\" It was \"The Gospel from Outer Space,\" by Kilgore Trout. It was about a visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian, by the way. The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.  But the Gospels actually taught this:  Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isn't well connected. So it goes.  -- Kurt Vonnegut, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\"", 9144, "FY4cCjsOaa", -1],

I guess that abstinence program worked really well for her 17 year old - maybe they should have been teaching sex education.  I'm worried that McCain may kick the bucket, he currently is 72 years old and has already had skin cancer, that worries me that she may have a chance to become president. She lacks experience. As for \"Plummer Rock\"  the USA was not found on Christian beliefs.  The Puritans as well as many other groups came to this country to flee religious prosecution in Europe.  I'm sure you've heard something about Protestants being put to death because they weren't Catholic.  The founding fathers, esp. Thomas Jefferson (who by the way wrote the constitution) believe that we have something called freedom of religion, which means you don't have to be christian, you can be jewish, muslim, hindu, atheist, whatever you want to practice.  He is the main founding father who believed that there should be a separation between CHURCH and STATE.  If you don't believe what I just told you, maybe you should open a history book or research the history of this country.  By the way if you are wondering, yes, I am a christian person, who believes in christian beliefs.  I don't agree with abortion, but I think there should be an exception if the woman was raped or the pregnancy was caused by incest.
