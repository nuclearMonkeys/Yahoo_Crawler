We all know that God says if you Bless Israel you will be blessed, and if you curse \"Her\" you will be cursed. Woe to those who come against Israel, they will be destroyed by the Lord. She will be the only nation standing in the end. Don't worry about Israel. But the bible also says \"all nations shall rise up against Her\", sadly that means us too.  So when they speak of \"Peace\", we know the scripture tells us this is when destruction will come upon the land. People better wake up, and get right with God. He said he would come like a thief in the night. He also said \"What so ever I find you doing when I come\". So we better be ready.
