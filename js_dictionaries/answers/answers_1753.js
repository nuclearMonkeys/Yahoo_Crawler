For the Germans it was pretty common, they were used to having a dozen different types of weapons and the resulting having to supply a dozen different types of rifle and dozens of tank types and dozens of different types of all sorts of vehicles and weapon.  The same is true of the Russians. The western Allies, not so much.  They were big on standardization and were pretty anal about a soldiers kit and equipment and how it was used.  You see lots of wehrmacht with Russian mg's and Russian T-34s used by the Germans, but you rarely if ever see a GI or Tommy running around a battlefield with a Stg44 or MP40.

In the form of treaties regarding Feminist issues. The idea that the Bennington College model of behavior--\"May I?\"-- should prevail in an international case seems to degrade the image of both Sweden and the UK. Even if this version of forcible rape were to be credited, it still would not warrant international extradition--that's where the treaties come in. If he were subject to arrest in Sweden, that would be a pretty extreme punishment for a crime which has not been tried (although, since they take the woman's word for everything, no trial takes place in any case). But it is the exrtradition which turns it into persecution on a Biblical scale. He rightly fears for his life. Less understandable why he should appeal to Herod Himself. It has never occurred to Obama that part of the reason he was elected is people had \"reservations\" about a woman president in the current climate of extreme feminism.

Gretzky also had the most career points by far and his statistics are better than any bodies by a long shot. Also 99 was a far less popular number but if you retire 9 around the league lots of people would be forced to change numbers and other teams would want retired players on their teams to get that honor.

	93375 : ["Ayn Rand's philosophy- an excuse to be a sociopath. In the new eBook \"This God, I,\" the antagonist is obsessed with Ayn Rand's Objectivism and wants to force it onto the world. After studying this ideology for years, I've come to the conclusion that Objectivism is nothing but a well-reasoned, compelling excuse to be a sociopath.  The atheistic ideology creates the narrative of a world where everyone is boring, mediocre and worthless (the 99%), except for a select few who innovate and drive the gears of industry (the 1%). The mediocre losers are jealous of the good people and seek to destroy them by forcing them to conform and be worthless like they are, but the Howard Rourkes and John Galts win by being individualists and caring only for their own success.  Remember Rick Santelli, the CNBC market analyst who started the Tea Party with his infamous rant? Remember how he called homeowners who lost their houses in the crash \"the losers?\" It perfectly reveals the mentality of the Objectivists. The bankers who caused the crisis are not at fault because they are rich, and therefore good and deserve it, but the people who failed... it's all their fault for being the mediocre losers.  Rand herself was inspired by William Hickman, a serial killer who dismembered a little girl. She admired Hickman for doing something society didn't approve of, and she thought everyone else hated him because he dared to challenge them and wouldn't conform. She was like the women who marry imprisoned murderers, but she went a step further and made a religion out of it.  Alan Greenspan was a member of her club, the Collective (also covered in the book), and he brought her ideas to the Federal Reserve. They deregulated the banks to serve the rich and look what happened. Now, a candidate for vice-president seeks to implement her social-darwinist ideology on America again.
