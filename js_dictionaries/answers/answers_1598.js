And perhaps sometimes people get it wrong about who is racist, but many times they are right.  If you had experienced racism against you, you would find it's not that hard to spot. I do believe that many racists do not realize that's what they are feeling.  They truly believe they are upset about Obama's birth certificate or \"death panels\" in the health care bill.  But let me tell you that I have worked on many, many political campaigns in my life, some very hard-fought, and I have never seen this type of vitriol and anger and hatred directed at a president this early in his administration.   Do you ever wonder why no one ever worried about a flag pin, a guy's minister, his birth certificate or his religion before in our country's history?  Do you?  Because a lot of people look at that type of stuff and think it's racism, and they could be right.  Or it could just be politics--a concerted effort to discredit Obama and diminish his presidency. Having said that, there is nothing whatsoever wrong with disagreeing with his policies.  If you posted \"I don't like this health reform bill because...\" no one would call you racist.  How could they?  But I have seen posts like \"Michelle Obama is a gorilla,\" \"Should we rename the White House to the Black House,\" and much, much worse, including \"Does Michelle defecate on her pizza and then eat it?\" and \"There should not be a n*i*g*g*e*r in our White House.\"  What do you make of those posts?  Do you denounce them, disagree with them or ever let the poster know they are unacceptable?  Because we don't see any regular conservatives denouncing this type of crap either, which makes it seem like you think it is OK. We had an election, and McCain lost.  Just like many of us had to suffer through eight years of Bush, now McCain supporters get to suffer through Obama.  But they don't have to come on this site and elsewhere and type every imaginable criticism of him hundreds of times a day.  He wore the wrong jeans, he took his wife on a date night, who paid for his state trip to Russia, he uses a teleprompter, why does he have special pizza...blah blah blah.  It's as if no one ever paid attention to ANY president before this, because of course we all could have found the same type of issues about any president.  Did you EVER hear anyone care about Laura Bush's looks, what Bush ate, who paid for their trips to Crawford, where the two of them went, what Bush wore?  I never did.
