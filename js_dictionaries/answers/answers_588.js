A lot of people online having a go at Messi too but if you are offered that kind of money you're going to take it. Barca should know that they can't afford to pay Messi so much every year, they even refused to let him leave last summer when he was going to go.Â  On Musk, is he even a football fan?

Â£250 million, plus apparently he wants Neymar level wages which is around Â£30 million per season AFTER tax (which in the UK would be 58 million per season to get him the Â£30 million after tax, Martin Lewis to thank for this number). That's basically a million quid + change a week. I believe thats 5 times Mo Salah's salary. Lets say he stays 5 years, is he worth a Â£500 million + investment over 5 years or could that level of cash be better spent elsewhere for Liverpool. Edit - You could buy 4 or 5 really good players for that fee (including say a couple of great centre backs). You don't need Mbappe to win the title or the champions league (PSG Can't win it with him). You do need adequate cover across the park. Buy Mbappe and neglect that, VVD gets injured again next season, you don't win the title again... Strengthen the squad, you can win it without him...", 5070, "TdmTjKt8aa", 2],

But you have a title winning team and a champions league winning team you've a team full of great players . Just take this season for what it is but enjoy being a Liverpool fan I don't think your best days are over yet.Â  Rumour is Klopp will leave for the Germany job after the euros and Liverpool will approach Stevie G. A lot of people saying Gerrard isn't ready but I think he is. Doing well at Rangers seems to have put belief into the players they're going to win the league, doing well in Europe, why not give Gerrard a go? There's not much he can learn more up in Scotland so he's due a move away from there anyway. If he is offered the job I think he should take it I've seen enough of him at Rangers to think he could turn things around at Liverpool.Â  I suppose you could say his Gers team have his spirit. Look at the midfielders he could coach at Liverpool. Henderson, who he won the league cup with as a player, Fabinho, Thiago, Keita, Wijnaldum if he stays, Milner if he stays, local boy Curtis Jones who is a great young player. In attack Salah, Firmino. Jota, Mane. Goal Alisson. Defenders when they are all back fit Van Dijk, Gomez, Matip, Davies, Williams, Phillips, Kabak if he stays. Full backs another local lad in TAA and Robertson who was the best left back in the world only like a year ago.Â  And let me remind you Gerrard actually coached a lot of your young boys Kelleher, both Williams lads, Jones and a few other guys on the fringes like Luis Longstaff.Â  What do you think Aces would you take Gerrard next season if Klopp departs?Â ", 5066, "q1BX2eXuaa", -1],

They'll do okay this summer but will not win the Euros. we Will not win the euros unless Foden lights up the tournament and proclaims his status as the GOAT - same with Haaland and Mbappe.
