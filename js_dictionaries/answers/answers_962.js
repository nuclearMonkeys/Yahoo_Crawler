Yup, six year olds are going to test their boundaries and if there's been change (like a change in sitters or parents schedules) than it's not unusual for kids to act out. The best thing to do is keep building a relationship with him, be firm, plan to do things that are fun and engaging... a lot of kids will act out when they aren't getting the attention or stimulation they need. Give him attention for positive behaviors. Also... it's a lot easier to just capture the Nerf darts instead of trying to wrestle a Nerf gun out of a kid's hands.", 7475, "8HoGFOxraa", 0],

Don't let his young age fool you, kids are a lot more smarter than we give them credit for, seems to me he has the art of manipulation 101 down pact, and you are falling right into his trap! Nurf gun issue? He is far too immature and young to handle having a nurf gun, I think we can both agree on that one for sure. When you arrive he is to hand over the nurf gun right away, or he is physically escorted to his room where he will remain for the entire time you are there.  You don't negotiate with him, when you ask him to do something, it's done right away, and if not there are consequences for his defiant behaviour. There is no arguing with him, no pleading with him to come to your way of thinking, you are the one in charge and he is the child. You need to have trust in yourself,  because any kinks in the armour, he fill find them and try to expose them! Learn this lesson real quick, because its a very key lesson going forward. I have 4 nieces and nephews (all 6 and under), and I have NEVER had an issue with them trying to manipulate me! I am close with them all, but they know where the line in the sand is, and I never push them around, BUT when I speak they know to listen without playing games. Good luck.", 7475, "NaSgrh7Haa", 0],

When its lunch time or meal time, take the gun when he is eating and not looking. When he is being naughty, find ways to get his mind on other things. I can imagine he might be extremely focused on shooting you but there are ways around this without beating his head in.

To be fair, I wouldn't be too excited about my kid wanting to get their pubes waxed, either. So, if you really want that... You're just going to either have to get someone to do it without her permission [some professional might be willing and you can DIY or have a hoo-ha waxing party with your BFFs], wait till you're old enough to not require parental permission [which you might already be, IDK what the rules about that are], or lie/forge some kind of permission slip or form.", 7483, "AZILMgnQaa", 0],

I personally wouldn't dismiss kindergarten entirely, even if it's optional in your area.  Remote learning is already going to result in delays for a lot of kids, and it's entirely possible it'll go into next school in some areas.  Starting first grade online with no previous instruction could be downright traumatic for some kids, not to mention extremely difficult for the teacher.", 7491, "ljPmGFM1aa", 1],

If you are in the United States, I believe you have until your child is seven years old before you have to prove they are attending school, so if they do indeed require kindergartners to be online for five hours straight, I would consider not starting school yet. Let him play outside, read books together, explore the world, do real-world learning, and just relax. ", 7491, "8HoGFOxraa", 0],
