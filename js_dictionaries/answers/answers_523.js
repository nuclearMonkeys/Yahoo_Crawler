Anyone who gets a dog just to breed and sell puppies and thinks of it as an easy way to make money shouldn't either own a dog or be breeding a dog. Proper dog breeders do a lot more work than just letting their dog get knocked up. Your best bet is to offer to buy her if you are actually able to keep her. You need to pay him something so that there will be no question in the future that she is now yours. But you can't make him do this. Option two is to offer to look after her whenever he wants to go away on holidays, and play a \"long game\". His kids will eventually get tired of the dog, and she will get too old for puppies. Then you offer to take her. She will probably still be middle-aged (for a dog) when he realises he doesn't want her any more. You will then have many happy years with her. The problem here is that if the relationship was toxic and he realises how you feel about this dog he may exploit the situation to get back at you. He has this poor dog in his power, but he really doesn't care about her, whereas you do. Do you think he would mistreat this dog to hurt you? If so your best option is to hide your feelings. Option three is to get another dog, preferably an adult rescue dog. Look for one who is dog friendly, in case your ex's dog comes back into your life again.

But given the lack of health care, medicines & hygiene, I'm sure that greatly contributed to the death toll. By comparison, look at the Covid statistics in undeveloped countries. The ones with the least HC infrastructure have really alarming fatality rates. In Yemen, the mortality rate has been as high as 28%. So there's a huge disparity between first & 3rd world countries. Actually, we'll never really know and it's not a fair comparison, after 100 years. I've researched the Spanish flu pandemic and found disturbing accounts about people who literally dropped dead in the streets-- like they were functional one minute, then just suddenly croaked. With mostly anecdotal reports to go on, it's impossible to gauge its true impact.

And per the CDC information, up to 45% of the people are asymptomatic. Your chance of catching covid from someone is no greater than the common cold (your chance of giving it to someone is 50% more than the common cold based on the longer contagion period). my friends were staying in a cabin for 4 days with someone who was infected. He had no symptoms until 2 days after they returned. They were all in their late 40s.  No one caught covid from him, including the 3 people who rode 3+ hours each way to get there with him. There ARE medical treatments: The anti-inflammatories (not anti-virals) HAVE GREATLY reduced the number of individuals who have illness progression.  Dexamethasone has cut the average hospitalization days in half.  Remdesivir doesn't work for everyone but those it does, it's great. Just yesterday, Michigan, began using the Regeneron & Eli Lily antibody therapies as the go to outpatient treatment which has followed months of Marylard being a leader with it.   Albuterol and Budesonide have been very beneficial with keeping people from getting covid related pneumonia. HCQ is may or not be an effective treatment.  There are recent studies that still say it is. And FINALLY it appears that the medical community is starting to recognize that Vitamin D is not just a fluke.  -- Last week, the Ireland Joint Commission on Health began requiring all healthcare workers and long term care facility residents to supplement.  And will get out free supplements at their covid testing sites - NPR and Apple both had stories this week on the benefits. The US population in 1918 was 103M and there were about 675,000 deaths in two years. In the past 16 months there have been 565,000 US deaths out of a population 330M. ** based on basic numbers you can wee that the % of deaths will about about 1/3 less for the Covid-19 pandemic.

OK, so now that I have few seconds, Here is what NASA REALLY SAYS: \"NOPE, EARTH ISN'T COOLING\" \"Periodically, we receive queries asking if Earth is cooling. Although multiple lines of converging scientific evidence show conclusively that our climate is warming, stories sometimes appear in the media calling that into question. New studies are interpreted as contradicting previous research, or data are viewed to be in conflict with established scientific thinking. Last spring, for example, a number of media outlets and websites reported on a story that looked at data acquired from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP), which estimates changes in global surface temperature. The article discussed a short-term cooling period that showed up in the data in 2017 and 2018 and correctly stated that short-term cooling cycles are “statistical noise compared to the long-term trend.” Afterward, we received some queries from readers who wanted to know if this finding meant a significant period of global cooling either could be or already was under way. The answer is no. This story is a great example of why focusing on just a short period of time – say, one, two or even several years — doesn't tell you what's really going on with the long-term trends. In fact, it's likely to be misleading.\" Google it.", 4518, "Dvapiqwsaa", -3],
