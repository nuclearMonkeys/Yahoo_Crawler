Well that seems impossible because it would require probably the ability to travel faster than the speed of light, and the existence of highly advanced life on another planet, probably in a distant star system. There are too many credible eye witnesses of UFO's or flying saucers,to really say that they don't exist, but it seems less credible when people claim that they have seen alien creatures coming from inside the UFO after a landing.
