Paul is a fringe candidate - he actually gets way more attention that someone with his sort of following would usually warrant. He is not winning \"most straw polls\" - every now and again he busses in enough supporters to win one but in any meaningful polls he is getting 5-10% consistently. Paul is an extremist - he is not offering any real solutions to problems we face (other than overly simplistic nonsense that appeals to simple minds) - and it really is becoming very boring constantly hearing his fans blame the media for his inability to sell his extremist agenda.", 9116, "NqNbIp2caa", 0],

	82921 : ["A good question! While you did not personally agree to accept and abide by the laws, your ancestors did, and you are bound by their actions.  The founders of the US, that is the people that ratified the US Constitution, bound themselves and future generations to abide and accept the laws of the US.   In terms of a social \"contract\", it runs from our ancestors.   This is true for all societies, not just the US, going back since the earliest days of mankind.   Many early cultures had \"coming of age\" rites, where by a young adult would accept being an adult in that society, and be accepted by the soceity.   Modern nation states have dipensed with this, but you can still it in many religions.    This is binding on you, via the common law, without the need for express consent.   It is a basic understanding that underlies the US Constitution, and the structure of all nation states.   The same is not true in the same  way  for your obligation to obey state laws. Many states predate the US Constitution, so your obligation to them stems from the social contract between you and your sovereign directly.  For exmaple, your obligation to obey state laws arises in the same manner as the obligation of a citizen in a kingdom to obey thier king.  There may be no constitution. Because the two obligations, between you and  the state and you and the federal government are fundamentally different yet alke in many many ways, there is considerable friction between the two.  Some have thought that the State contract is superior to the federal contract, and that the Federal contract was revokable, hence the civil war.  The tension between the two continues to this day.", 9117, "3a8350c362a69a12a49a31229a281914aa", 0],

EDIT: The republican party has traditionally been the anti-war/less government party, the party has lost it's way not Ron Paul, he was elected into Congress as a republican and has been one for SEVERAL years.. sheebe: His record is more CONSITENT then any other candidate running SFC_Olli: Iraq is ALREADY in the middle of a religious civil war, one that cannot be resolved by the United States, Paul has a proper exit strategy for Iraq, one that will STABLIZE the country and have troops home within a 3-6 month period, it's not a “cut and run” approach Eyesofru: It's funny you mention Huckabee, considering he would also like to phase out the IRS, and set up a tax system that RAISES taxes for everyone CIA/FBI: There are over 100 different intelligence gathering agencies. He wants to end the bureaucracy and consolidate.. NOT ABOLISH THEM.. this actually strengthens our central intelligence by gathering intelligence and making it more effective IRS: This explains it better then I can: “1) The destruction of the IRS would include a free market solution of competing currencies. 2) Competing currencies (read: gold and silver used as money without government intervention) would lead to the destruction of the Federal Reserve. 3) The destruction of the Federal Reserve would lead to a halt on the interest we pay to them for the pleasure of using their valueless paper. 4) The income tax, which is solely used to pay back said interest, would no longer have a purpose. 5) Tariffs were collected at point of entry (read: ports and airports), just as sales tax is collected at point of sale today. 6) Excise taxes are collected at point of sale. 7) The abolishment of the IRS would not limit the collection of said taxes, just the unnecessary and unpopular Income Tax.” ***Only the income tax would be eliminated sparhawk7322: Isolationism? Paul is a non-interventionist.. He is a strong advocate of diplomacy and trade, not secluding ourselves from the world.

He also supports the Letter's of Marquee and Reprisal to counter terrorism.. “The issue of Marquee and Reprisal was raised before Congress by Rep. Ron Paul of Texas after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and again on July 21, 2007.
