I did that for eight months before going vegetarian just for health, and it didn't help at all. Then when I learned about animal mistreatment I went completely vegetarian and I don't have acid-reflux like I used to and I've lost weight (not that I needed to, I was perfectly healthy and still am).  I'd say go vegetarian. I'm fourteen and I've been doing fine. So are some of my other friends who are vegetarians and vegans. It didn't effect their growth in any way. I'm still short as ever, Sarah is still growing taller and taller as is Anthony, Annie is still the adverage height, and Katie is adverage height too, and we're all at perfectly healthy weights. You'll be fine. Here's a list I found online... -PROTEIN Plant proteins should provide for you enough, as long as you make sure your calorie intake is high enough for your energy needs. -MORE AMINO ACIDS If plant proteins simply aren't enough, try eating whole grains, nuts or seeds. -IRON If you're not totally vegan, egg yolk provides iron well. However, dried beans, dried fruits, and spinach are good sources as well. -VITAMIN B 12 This only comes naturally from animals. It can be found in some fortified (not enriched) breakfast cereals such as Total and some brands of nutritional brewer's yeast, or in supplements. -VITAMIN D You will need a reliable vitamin D source. If you don't get a lot of sunlight, you'll probably need a supplement. -CALCIUM Studies have shown that vegetarians absorb and retain more calcium than meat eaters. Cool, huh? Calcium can be found in greens such as spinach, kale and broccoli, and some legumes and soybean products. -ZINC Grains, nuts and legumes are good sources. If you chose to take a supplement, be sure to pick supplements containing no more than 15-18 mg zinc. Supplements containing 50 mg or more may lower HDL (\"good\") cholesterol in some people. --And some more tips-- Keep your intake of sweets and fatty foods to a minimum. These foods are low in nutrients and high in calories. Choose whole or unrefined grain products when possible, or use fortified or enriched cereal products. Use a variety of fruits and vegetables, including foods that are good sources of vitamins A and C. If you use milk or dairy products, choose fat-free/nonfat and low-fat varieties. Eggs are high in cholesterol (213 mg per yolk), so monitor your use of them. Limit your cholesterol intake to no more than 300 mg per day.

	131254 : ["These are generalizations of course, but they do offer a very real aspect of our support for Israel as you ask. I have seen pro-Israeli US supporters to fall within these categories: 1) The elite financial and industrial crowd support Israel only so far as they can make profit for themselves. They know no sovereignty or loyalty outside of profit. These people are not Republican or Democrat, Liberal or Conservative. These are the real owners of our entire system. If tommorrow no money could be made off it, Israel would be no different to them than Sri Lanka.  2) The Evangelical Christian crowd supports Israel only in as so far it leads to the return of Jesus and his rule. The land belongs to the Jews so that trumps all logic you can present to them. The Elites use this crowd over and over again as financial recruits for the extremists in Israel as well as our military endeavors. 3) The common American. His support comes from a combination of complete ignorance of history, constant Holocaust awareness, and propoganda that the Islamic militants we face are the same that Israel does. Of course, they are completely different, but he does not know that because he has never bothered to learn for himself. Let us be real for a moment. When it comes down to it, I am sorry to say, the partnership with Israel does not bring anything good to the common American. Not one. It never has. I am still waiting for someone to prove me wrong... First, it does not take a genius to figure out that in an age of nationalism at the end of the 19th century, allowing the foreign colonization of an area on top of a native population also yearning for self-determination is only going to create conflict. That has not changed. We supported the plan blindly back then because we were arrogant, bigoted, and ignorant. Just like everyone else, it was the context of the times. What is our excuse now? The democracy argument is awfully naive since we recognize democratic regimes at our whim, when it serves us we do, and when it does not we do not. Israel is a democracy whose entire spirit of being is based on establishing a Jewish majority using Jewish immigration onto the land. Any party that does not adhere to this general concept is not welcome, which makes it a strange democracy to me. Likewise, we do not give Egypt billions in aid to refurbish the pyramids. It goes to keep our man, Mubarak, in power. So much for promoting true democracy. In the first Iraqi vote after Saddams removal, our congress was considering not recognizing the winning party because the new Shia party did not want to recognize Israel. Finally, if Israel were such a great democracy it would have no need of a two state solution to ensure it remains a Jewish state demographically in the future. The next argument is the war on terrorism. This is completely void of any logic as well. Israel is not a buffer preventing the Islamic fanatics from arriving on our shores. The fanatics we face are few and drive pick up trucks. They are funded by the Pakistani ISI, which takes our covert funds to arm the militants we face. Yes, we create our own enemies to ensure that those areas remain destabilized enough so our forces can be there to 'fight terrorism'. The militants are always present but never strong enough to do serious damage. It is not a coincidence. As far as Israel and our relationship in the Middle East, how does supporting Israel help moderate Arabs see us as their friends? Quite the contrary, everytime Israel attacks with an Apache, F-16, or American provided weapon it is a reminder to the Arabs that as bad as those fanatics in their own countries are, America is still not to be trusted. One may say because of the Holocaust we have a moral duty to protect the Jews from it happening again, but according to the Zionist founders, they have always stated that the west would have to guarantee their safety in the Middle East. That was 40 years before the Holocaust. To make matters worse the whole concept of the Modern Israel was to escape persecution. Was Palestine the best place for that!? That is an Israeli problem not an American one. Apart for the elites making money off of the perpetual war and weapons Israel buys off us (With our own tax dollars of course) I still cannot think of one positive component.", 11095, "HFt4fsXJaa", 17],

Being 15 you probably don't have control over what you eat all the time, so it would be difficult unless you can explain to your parents that you don't want to eat meat, and they were willing to make you a different meal than everyone else, or change the families diet all together. There are different types of vegetarianism. Some can eat eggs. Some can eat poultry. Some can eat fish. Some can't eat or even use anything that is associated with animals. My advice is to talk to your parents about what you want to do, and find information on the different types of vegetarians, and see which one, if any fits your lifestyle the best.

Vegetarians do not eat any meat, poultry, or seafood.  As long as your research a vegetarian diet carefully, and balance it with lots of nutritious foods, then you won't be missing out on any nutrients.  Lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, beans, legumes, pulses, leafy greens, whole grains, and lots of other good plant based foods will give you all the nutrients a girl your age needs, without the fat and cholesterol in meat.  Try checking out some books from your library-there are tons of great recipes out there.  My daughter has been cooking veggie meals with me since she was little, and is quite an accomplished cook.
