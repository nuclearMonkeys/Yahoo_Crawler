	51048 : ["Your college GPA matters for graduate school. Nearly all graduate schools have a minimum 3.0 GPA requirement, and for more competitive programs (especially in the medical fields), the \"de facto\" GPA requirement is *much* higher. Even if you don't plan to go to graduate school now, you might change your mind after a few years in the workforce.  As far as getting a job is concerned, my experience is different from the other answerers. I'd say, in most fields, GPA isn't that important. Most employers *don't* look at your transcript in making hiring decisions. Some will request a copy to verify your degree, after they've decided to hire you, but even that is less common now, and degrees are typically verified through Student Clearinghouse.  There are some fields, like finance, where it *is* standard practice to consider GPA. But for the most part, for the companies I've worked for (including U.S. federal agencies and federal contractors), we'd focus on the degree and work experience, including internships and externships for entry-level positions.  That said, often college internship positions are selected on the basis of GPA, since there is little relevant employment experience to go on, so that's another factor you should consider when deciding whether to blow off your lecture. ", 7176, "96djwZCgaa", 0],

	51061 : ["The answer given by Don W. is correct.  A graduate's GPA is important.  When seeking their first career-type job after college, many new graduates don't have much to put on their resume.  A good GPA on your list of qualifications will help land that first position.   A second reason for a good GPA is that it leaves options open for you later in life.  Both myself and a coworker decided to change careers in our late 20s/early 30s.  I decided to return to college to study accounting, while she elected to go for medical school.  We both had good grades from our first college degrees, and both of us were accepted into our respective new colleges.  That may not have happened had we both originally scraped by with Cs.  ", 7176, "JLSFlJ7Xaa", 2],
