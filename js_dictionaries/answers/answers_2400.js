If they're screening to make sure they're not having a child with a chromosome defect (Downs Syndrome, Trisomy 18 etc), then I don't have a problem with parents making their own choices based on debilitating and sometimes deadly diseases. (Some genetic defects mean the baby will survive only a few weeks after birth and will be in constant pain - seems like an act of mercy to me to not put a newborn through that).  I'd also say it depends on if they're using genetic screening to abort otherwise healthy children, or if they're using IVF and merely selecting an embryo based on genetic preferences. I personally don't like the idea of screening based on gender or other chromosomal factors, but I also believe that if it's done before implantation it's really none of my business.

People just have an easier time saying that it is acceptable to select a child without  Downs Syndrome than to select a boy over a girl. I'm not really sure why the disconnect, but there you go. Personally, I don't really care if people want to design their own child. It isn't a moral issue for me. Chuckles- D.S. was just the first thing that came to mind.

	125851 : ["The priest was wrong about premarital sex. People make mistakes, they can be forgiven and enter into religious life. Since he was talking to teens, he may have been trying to drive home just how sinful sex outside of marriage is. In our current age, sex outside of marriage is accepted like eating ice cream.  You have to see the Catholic Church as being the divine institution established by Christ, and that the people who staff this institution are fallible and sinful. That is a fact. Priests with all good intention, can be wrong. They are on the same journey we all are. They have more knowledge, they've dedicated their lives to the service of God and the Church, but this doesn't make them perfect.  I think the point you made to the priest, was a good one. Perhaps you helped him, and next time he will alter how he says that.  But as for homosexual marriage, and birth control...you cannot support these things and be Catholic. The teachings on the fundamental nature and truth of marriage, and children being the fruit of marriage, are infallible teachings of the Church and must be believed.  It is difficult to sort through these issues because the worldly perspective, which you hear much more often and see portrayed as normal in every aspect of life, is so pervasive. However, that doesn't make it right. Jesus said \"the world will hate you because of me\" and \"you are in the world but not of it.\" If you find yourself at odds with the Church and agreeing with the world...you need to check your path. Are you following Christ? If you are, then you will find yourself at odds with core secular values, not in agreement with them. In reality you can't be against abortion but for birth control. I know it sounds good on the surface, but birth control is actually why we have so many abortions. I was raised Methodist and was taught that artificial birth control was expected and responsible. But birth control has changed the perspective of sex. It was understood since creation to be a procreative act. People who had sex knew they might have children. Now, people hook up in bars, at parties, without a thought to the child they might create. Because we now see sex as an act that can be (and should be) rendered sterile, we don't expect a pregnancy. Then when it happens, it is a mistake, an accident, unwanted...and so abortion is the fall back.  Once birth control was accepted, sex outside of marriage, adultery, abortions, single mothers, babies born out of wedlock, have all risen. When abortion was legalized it was considered something that would be rare, because after all we have birth control, so the thought was that there wouldn't be that many unwanted pregnancies. But no one foresaw (except Pope Paul VI) that the use of birth control would unleash a level of immorality that would lead to more unwanted children, and thereofre thousands of abortions daily. Sad, sad fact.  The connection between contraception and abortion is primarily this: contraception facilitates the kind of relationships and even the kind of attitudes and moral characters that are likely to lead to abortion. Here are some websites you might want to check into. Don't assume because you don't agree with Church teaching that you are right and the Church is wrong. Take the time to look into it. I have been amazed at how the Church position on these difficult teachings, makes perfect divine sense. ", 10854, "wxBFZ41Taa", 0],

	125863 : ["Greetings, You have either been misled by accepting other people's lies or you are purposely misrepresenting what Rutherford and Witnesses believed. In order to claim that Rutherford received massages from angels, you must rip quotations out of context and ignore the overall teachings of Rutherford. You must force your own illogical conclusions into what was actually taught by the \"Vindication\" book. The only communication that we receive is through the Bible itself. God's people on earth do not channel inspired messages from God outside of what is already written in the Bible. None of Jehovah's Witnesses have ever taught that they directly received messages from angels. In fact, Witnesses' very doctrine has ALWAYS been that the direct communication from angels ceased after the Apostles died. This is a belief that has NEVER changed from their modern day inception as Bible Students to the present day. Therefore, any claim that we have personally received direct communication from God through angels can only be viewed as a misrepresentation of the facts. Rutherford did NOT say that he was literally receiving messages from angels! This is made clear in many of Rutherford's writings. For example in his book \"Consolation\" he wrote almost the same thing: \"Certain duties have  been committed by the Lord to his angels, which include the transmission of information to God's anointed people on the earth. Even though we cannot understand how the angels transmit this information, we know that they do it...Many will recall now that in the year 1919, when the faithful were disconsolate, THE LORD GAVE TO HIS PEOPLE AN UNDERSTANDING of the Elijah and Elisha pictures ... Then later, at the convention  of God's people in 1922, the angel of the Lord 'SPOKE' to the \"young man\" class, ...and brought information to them; and these faithful ones were then permitted to \"see visions\", THAT IS TO  SAY, TO UNDERSTAND GOD'S WORD, and those ...have since continued to PROGRESS IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF PROPHECY.\"--pg 37, 38 So, it is clear that Rutherford did NOT think that angels literally spoke to him or any of the remnant. The angels only guided their thinking spiritually so they could understand the Bible and its prophecies! This is no different than what Witnesses believe today. We still believe that the angels are assigned to transmit information to Christians. But they don't do this directly but by influencing our thinking and our understanding of Bible truths. Note the following: \"However, since today it is not God's will for spirits to communicate directly with humans...their manner of influencing humans takes a measure of faith to appreciate ... The Bible, at Rev 14:9-11, Mt 25:31, 32 and elsewhere, shows that the angels definitely have a hand in this work of spreading the good news. Such angelic influence, however, DOES NOT OPERATE APART FROM GOD'S WORD, HIS HOLY SPIRIT.\"-g72 6/8 p. 28 w07 3/15 p. 25 \"Therefore, what is stated at Revelation 14:6, 7... These words clearly show that the great worldwide evangelizing work of Jehovah's Witnesses has angelic backing and direction. Jehovah is using his angels to direct sincere people to his Witnesses. The angels have also guided the Witnesses to deserving ones. This would explain why it is that on so many occasions—too often to be just coincidence—one of Jehovah's Witnesses meets a person at the precise time that he or she is going through a crisis and needs spiritual help.\" w07 3/15 p. 25 Angels—How They Affect Mankind The Bible clearly teaches that God uses His angels to direct His people (Heb 1:7,13,14; Ps 34:7; 91:11; Mt 18:10). So Witnesses believe that Jehovah uses His spirit and His angels to help them understand what His Written Word said. This is in complete agreement with the Bible's teaching that angels are assigned to transmit information to Christians. But they don't do this directly but by influencing our thinking and our understanding of Bible truths. It is only logical to conclude that the resurrected Christians in heaven would do the same work as the angels. There is a big difference between someone who is just trying to understand Bible prophecy and one who claims a direct communication with God from angels. If we want an example of someone claiming a direct communication from God then we can refer to several well known evangelical preachers (usually when they need more money, or to claim God has forgiven them for moral sins). For one example, Oral Roberts claimed to be told by a 900 foot Jesus that he was going to be used to find a cure for cancer and people should send him 8 million dollars or God was going to kill him. (His cancer medical center was only open for a few years.) Yours, BAR-ANERGES", 10867, "None", 4],
