I pray for guidance daily in my earthly duties as well as my religious duties.  In that way, I trust in the arm of the Lord, not in the arm of flesh.

Other pet warehouses are there to get you to buy their products and hang around their strore. And their trainers are their employees...never forget they have an agenda. Most of the trainers have very little education--if they had actual training and skills they wouldn't be there making just over minimum wage--trust me on this. But even if they did have experience and talent...a group setting is a terrible place for learning to take place. It's distraction training and it is the LAST phase of training not the first. You wouldn't have your child try to do their homework in a toy store, would you? Of course not...the level of distraction would be too high! It's the same with dogs. Having said that, these classes can be an excellent way to socialize dogs...but not to train them. And while they appear to be cheaper than a professional trainer...you have to attend many more sessions to get the same results because of the poor learning environment--so you wind up spending MORE money for less training than you would with a professional.

	76152 : ["\"the most basic function of any living organism down to the cellular level is to reproduce. So if your not a reproductive being, are you really alive?\" This is pretty offensive.  I can't have children, and last I checked I was most definitely alive.  \"In all honesty, the things that are being requested in gay marriages, can be just as easily gotten if they wen to an attorney, and had papers drawn up. It comes down to, as I understand from older gay men, who are very nice, as a matter of fact,...that it is about material possessions in many cases, and the fact that young user type golddigger men can take advantage of older rich men, and getting married will legally give them the right to alimoney, and community property, believe it or not\" Actually, there are many benefits to marriage that cannot be obtained through any other means than marriage; Social Security spousal benefits and the estate tax marital deduction are just two.  And if two men or two women have been a committed couple building a life together, if they break up why shouldn't they have the same rights and responsibilities to one another that a straight couple has? Why is it somehow OK that if Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall had divorced, she would have had the right to alimony and community property, or that Jason Allen Alexander would have had those rights if his 55-hour Vegas marriage to Britney Spears had ended in divorce rather than annulment, but it's not OK for a gay couple to have the same rights? \"...another thing that it does, is that a person other than a family member, might have no say in wether their brother or uncle or cousin stays on life support or not, while someone who might truly not have loved them, is prepared to pull the plug and get the will read...\" That's kind of the point...many gay couples would *prefer* that their partner have those rights rather than their biological family. Don't forget many gay people have been rejected and disowned by their biological families because they're gay.  If gay marriage was allowed and they didn't want their partner to have those rights, then just like a heterosexual couple, they could choose not to marry, or they could give a biological family member a health care power of attorney which would override the marital relationship.  If they choose to get married and don't give a poa to someone else, one has to assume they *wanted* their spouse to have those rights. Is it so impossible for you to understand that gay couples are mostly committed, devoted couples who love each other just like heterosexual couples?  In fact, given the social pressure against gay relationships, I would venture to say that the percentage that are bad relationships, where one is a golddigger, taking advantage of the other or some other unhealthy situation, is probably *lower* than it is amongst heterosexual couples. \"Another thing that it might promote weirder laws down the road, such as NAMBLA, loving young boys, and then all that has to happen is changing the legal age to get married,and then they can have their playground....\" Oh, please.  First, most pedophiles are heterosexual, not homosexual.  Second, the fact that children can't get married now doesn't seem to stop pedophiles from preying on them, so why should lowering the marriage age increase child molestation?  Pedophiles don't want to *marry* their victims; they're mostly already married. Third, what relationship is there between allowing two *consenting adults* who happen to be of the same gender to marry and allowing *children* to marry?  There will always be valid reasons for having a minimum age for marriage, and for protecting children from molestation by sexual predators, and no one is arguing against either of those things.", 8826, "XNfjaPaSaa", 1],

Don't panic, though-this problem often has a simple solution. Difficulty: Moderately Easy Instructions Things You'll Need A Startup Disk Or A CDROM With The Operating System On It 1 If your desktop computer does nothing at all when you try to start it, first check that the power cable is securely plugged in at the back of the computer as well as into a working power outlet. It's amazing how often this is the case. 2 If you're starting from a button on the keyboard, make sure the keyboard is connected to the computer. 3 If the computer is plugged into a surge protector, see if the surge protector has a reset switch that you can push. (If it doesn't have a reset switch and the problem is with the surge protector, it will need to be replaced.) Try plugging a lamp or other device into one of the surge protector's outlets to make sure it's working. 4 If you can hear the computer's fan or hard-disk drive, or if you can see indicator lights on the main unit but the monitor stays dark, make sure that the monitor is connected to a working power source, that it's turned on and that it's securely connected to the computer via the video cable. 5 If the monitor and computer have power but the computer displays a \"Non-system disk or disk error\" message, check to make sure you didn't leave a disk in the A: drive. If you did, eject it and restart the computer. 6 If the operating system still won't start even though the computer and monitor have power, try restarting with a Windows CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive or, if you've got a Macintosh, with a Mac OS disc in the CD-ROM drive. (You can start a Mac from the CDROM drive by holding down the C key while starting up.) 7 If the operating system then starts, your problem is probably with the startup hard drive or with the operating system installed on it. If you can't fix the drive, you'll have to replace it. (See also How to Fix Bad Sectors on a Hard Disk and How to Recover Lost Files.)", 8834, "None", 0],
