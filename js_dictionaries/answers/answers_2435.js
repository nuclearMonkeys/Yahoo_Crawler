	127571 : ["Before buying a tv, be honest with yourself and ask what kind of programs do I watch. Will my viewing pleasure be increased if the screen were xx inches bigger. Start at a model for example £200. Look at the next grade up if it's an extra £100. Am I seeing an improvement that can justify spending the extra £100 ? and can I reasonably afford it ? am I just getting functions that I'll never use ? If your answer is yes it is worth it to you then look at the next upgrade and do the same thing again. It sounds crazy but when you answer the question yourself (ignore the sales patter and cut straight to the chase) is it worth the extra money when model x suited all my needs then you won't end up with an over priced over sized monstrosity. I have worked in retail for many years. If the customer has the intelligence to ask the right questions the best salesmen can get caught off guard. They probably want to sell you the model that pays them best, not what's right for you. The golden rules IS IT WORTH THE MONEY ? WILL IT DO THE JOB I WANT IT FOR ? When it comes to negotiating the price, and you have decided which one you want haggle. Demand some kind of discount you've decided which product now you want to decide which shop !", 10948, "810cf5a8c7aa0da4189d75262a8f0cc2aa", 0],

Other conservative schools may be more close-minded to gay people and issues. You have to learn how to feel the situation out.

	127575 : ["Sounds like you should hunt out a GLBT group in college everyone has one. It is good for your stage in your coming out. I found I came out to my peers in HS and then later my family. Wom after some time fully accepted me for being gay. I am an introvert and there is lots of professions that are attuned to introverts. like science or geology. I think it is a good step in the right direction socially I think you will open up and meet alot of like minded people in college. and don't be scared of the mushrooms or weed that seems to circulate the dorm rooms. I always thought I'd go to skool in my 40's so your tackling things at an early age and you will discover what it is you really love to do. Way to go. I hope you find the courage to come out to a few people so they can understand what your going through, also if you want a sort of crash course in alternative philosophy you should try second life there are alot of gay bars where u can test your social skills a bit and come out of your shell. and you will see who you really like (like twinks, bears, daddies,asian etc)", 10941, "QkSCgW2laa", 1],
	127576 : ["I think you'll find that in a college environment, people tend to be a lot more liberal. (Of course that depends on the school you go to..like UCLA as opposed to say Harvard of course) but generally, in college people go there to become \"more well rounded inviduals\" hell..some colleges even offer queer studies, and MANY, MANY have GLBT student organizations (I'm in one now) So, I think you'll find that a lot fewer people will CARE about you being gay.      I've even had 5 gay professors so far that absolutely ROCKED!!       If you want to be more social, try joining one of these GLBT groups.  If your school doesn't have one, go to your office of Student Life and suggest one!!  You'll be around like minded people, plus, if the group does any kind of community service or awareness,...this volunteerism and leadership looks GREAT on job resumes.      And always, above all, ALWAYS be yourself.  People will come and people will go..but YOU have to live with youself FOREVER.  Might as well learn to like yourself.", 10941, "ZEIoyVWpaa", 4],
