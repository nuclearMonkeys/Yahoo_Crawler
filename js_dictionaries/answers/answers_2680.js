	139857 : ["It looks like ~22mpg.  However, I would not expect to still receive 22mpg on such an old car unless there has either been significant work done or it has been very well maintained. Another thing to look out for on older vehicles is rust on the underbody and frame.  The suspension components will probably be pretty worn out on this vehicle unless properly maintained, so you may consider replacing shocks, balljoints, tierods, bushings, etc once you purchase the vehicle.  I don't recall if the sunroof on these cars was a manual process or not, but that may be something else to look out for.   My advice, find a shop that services older European cars like the MGB and ask what they would charge for a Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI).  Then ask the owner if he agrees to let you take it in for the PPI, perhaps he will split the cost.  Most mechanics typically charge ~100 dollars and do a complete inspection of the car including leak-down/compression tests, suspension, gearbox, fluids, etc.  I purchased an 88 Porsche 944S about 8 years ago and had a PPI performed, I knew of pretty much every mechanical issue with the car prior to purchasing (helps with negotiating a price as well).

	139858 : ["Notoriously unreliable?  I ve owned two and used them both as daily drivers and never had any of the electrical issues that you ve reported.  They are old cars with technology from the era in which they are built but the main issues can be easily upgraded.  Get an electronic ignition for it or add an MSD igniton so the points don t deteriorate rapidly (as they do on any vehicle that has them).  The alternator output is only adequate; swap in a Delco unit with higher output along with the Delco voltage regulator (it runs the system at a slightly higher voltage) and it will resolve the rest of the issues.  Among other improvements you will have bright headlights and be able to drive in stop and go traffic during a rain storm at night with the lights on and defroster on high and radio playing and not run the batteries down.", 11447, "lrmmvwkLaa", 0],

	139863 : ["Hebrews 7:27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people's sins. (NLT-SE) Hebrews 9:12 With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever. (NLT-SE) Hebrews 9:24 For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with human hands, which was only a copy of the true one in heaven. He entered into heaven itself to appear now before God on our behalf. 25 And he did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the high priest here on earth who enters the Most Holy Place year after year with the blood of an animal. 26 If that had been necessary, Christ would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began. But now, once for all time, he has appeared at the end of the age to remove sin by his own death as a sacrifice.  27 And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment, 28 so also Christ died once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him. (NLT-SE) Hebrews 10:10 For God's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time. (NLT-SE) \"Once for all\" is a key theme, particularly in the middle section of Hebrews.
