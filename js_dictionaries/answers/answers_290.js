	14511 : ["\"Why do feminists think islam is the most feminist religion?\" Any \"good feminist\" of today must follow along with the critical theory ideology that the movement is involved with. That ideology mandates that Islam and its adherents, Muslims, are \"oppressed\" by Christianity and its adherents. No kidding! You couldn't make this stuff up! So even a person who self-identified as a feminist based on the idea of advocating for women and promoting gender equality, that had some qualms or concerns about Islamic teachings on women, and dared to mention them in public, would be shamed as an \"Islamophobe\" and potentially \"cancelled\" or ostracized from within the feminist movement. Classic feminism died when it accepted \"intersectionality\", as that was its entry into cultural Marxism and the death of simple women's advocacy through equal Rights, as feminism.  Today, feminism is much more complicated, and is in complete alignment with critical theory, even when that works against women's interests. .", 2424, "aSm9xSn3aa", 3],

The final sound 'ry' is indefinite, as many final sounds are in British English, it sounds a bit like the start sound of 'Richard' but less forceful.  Possibly Americans are more careful about those final sounds than many Britons are. I have not heard Americans say those words; Marli says that the ending sounds like '...air-ee'.   But the final part is not as strong as 'ree' suggests and the 'air' part does not exist at all in much of Britain, though Scots might disagree! But then Marli says that 'Harry' ends in '...air-ee' which is not my experience at all. 'Harry' rhymes with 'marry' and 'carry' and 'Barry' and 'tarry', as any British news item about Prince Harry will tell you. 'Mary' and 'dairy' and 'vary' and 'scary' end in the '...air-ee' sound, but even in those words the 'ee' is a fairly small sound.", 2445, "None", 0],

Like a snow globe from that year or a year book, or that movie t-shirt or that current pop band or rock band or R & B group that is very popular, items of popular sayings, over produced comic books, etc. Because there have been people to put personal sentimental or fiscally valuable items. Like all my ex - boyfriends, (what is with you guys?), they put these expensive items in. Then teachers or classmates, or geniuses or people doing recreational activities or people whom are close to the bankers, go by and steal them and then you owe $XX,YYYY.AA or whatever or $XXX,YYY,ZZZ.

	14544 : ["I agree that the medium in which you compose isn't important, except that your submission copy will need to be digital. (The days of mailing away a paper copy are gone.) Computers' word processing programs let you change, edit, and rearrange easily and can create that digital copy, so that's the first thing you need. Second is the concept. If you were summarizing your story for a TV listing, what would it say? Usually you introduce your main character and what they want or need. Examples: A Kansas farm girl transported to a magical place in a tornado wants nothing more than to go home. A man fighting alcoholism takes his family to winter in an isolated--and possibly haunted--hotel. Third is an overall plan that's fairly detailed, and where most would-be authors lose it. You need to know what happens in every scene. Who's there, where is it, when does it happen, why does it happen, how does the previous scene lead to it and how does it set up the next scene? Every scene needs to propel the story's plot forward or illuminate something important about the character. There are all kinds of planning methods. I like a spreadsheet. Fourth is mastery of basic written English. Your question seems literate enough, but trust me, there will be mistakes you have no idea you're making. Fifth is the will to sit down and do it, regularly, not waiting for the mood or The Muse. Whether it takes you a month or a year, you need to find or make time to write. There are other things that you'll find helpful, like character bios, beat sheets, an understanding of structure, yada-yada-yada, but that will get you started. If you decide this is something you want to do, consider joining AbsoluteWrite. It's down right now, moving to a new server, but the owners anticipate it will be back in due time.

Funny, that, but Collins A-Z publishes dictionaries so they must be right. I was taught the opposite: that writing paper (stationery) is to be pronounced \"station-ree\".  Both my grade one and grade three teachers had taught for over twenty-five years before I entered their classrooms, and both drilled me to e-NUN-cee-ate my words.
