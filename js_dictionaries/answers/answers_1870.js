I think that balance is key, and that this existence IS heaven. And two... a point my mom brought up... if heaven is truly 'heaven', then you would have all your past loves and friends at your side.  But can it be truly 'heaven' if one of them went to hell?

Not a fictional fire pit meant to scare people into doing what Christian religions think you should be doing. When God cast satan out of heaven, he cast him to earth. What kind of God would damn people to be tortured and burned for infinity??? Look, I'm not deeply religious in my adult life, but I was brought up on the bible, going to studies 4 days a week and all day on Sundays, so I do know more than the average bear when it comes to the bible/ religion. There is a lot about religion that I don't agree with and the number one thing that irks me is that people would think that God would do something like that. God is supposed to be a loving and forgiving God not sadistic and cruel. God would NEVER damn anyone to be tortured indefinitely, even the worst kind of people. I was brought up to believe that if you are a sinner, when you die, you just die, nothing else, no heaven, no hell, just nothing, your dead. If you die and you have excepted God and are a good person you will get into \"The Kingdom of Heaven\". And that makes the absolute most sense to me. The fact that some people believe that hell exists is just laughable to me. And if you honestly believe that your God would damn you to be tortured forever (for example, if you partook in one of the seven deadly sins which we ALL have at one point, which would certainly damn EVREYONE answering this question as well as oh, um 99% of the population), than well, if you ask me that God is not worth worshiping.", 9687, "pBEosEcxaa", -3],
