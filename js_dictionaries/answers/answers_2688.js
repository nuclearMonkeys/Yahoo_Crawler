You definitly need to define the realtionship she has with this other man tho. If she cares for you she\"ll consider your feelings and keep her distance. Good Luck", 11456, "RvezztaOaa", 0],

Do what it takes and I promise things will work out in your favor.  The funny thing is I came to the realization that I had to change a little too late. After I was kicked out and after I was about to lose the only things that truly mattered to me - her love. A funny thing happens when we truly love someone and lose them. We do what ever it takes to get them back. For me I had to drop bad habits that had caused not only our relationship to sour but practically every other relationship I had had in the past. Not only with women, but with friends, co-workers, family, you name it.  Which is why I say to you as my ex at the time said to me, the only thing you can do is change yourself.

They have the funds to get its leg treated and prevent it from being crippled. btw, the animal shelter will try and locate the owner before adopting it out.

I'm wondering how you've confirmed that he doesn't have someone out there frantically looking for him? If there is, how are they supposed to find you? I don't know what the policy of the shelters near you are, but my suggestion would be to call them up, and talk to them. Explain the situation, and go from there. You may be able to foster the dog for them until its owner can be found. They may be able to provide him with medical care, etc as well. If they take the stance of 'we euthanize anything sick' or something like that, then you probably don't want to drop him off there, but at least find out what the situation is, before you continue.

You should keep talking to him as the more he gets to know you the more comfortable he will be.  Now, if he still doesn't ask you out, then ask him out.  You don't want to drag this on as the longer it goes, the less likely he might be to ask you out as he will start to just think that you are friends.
