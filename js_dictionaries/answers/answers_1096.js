	60289 : ["Okay, that is how dinosaurs have compatibility into the Bible. First of all, reptiles under no circumstances give up developing. It's only a useful organic indisputable fact that reptiles develop all their lifestyles and under no circumstances give up till the day they die. This implies that the longer a reptile lives, the greater it grows. Well, again within the days of Noah persons lived 900 years. Adam lived to 930. Noah lived to 950. They lived approximately 10 occasions longer. Instead of loss of life at eighty or ninety, they died at 800 or 900. If persons lived longer, then almost certainly, animals might have lived longer too, adding reptiles. If reptiles lived longer, then they would develop greater. Scientists have discovered fossilized stays of crocodiles that reached as much as forty to 50 ft in duration. They've discovered stays of sea turtles that reached huge sizes, a lot greater than any sea turtle in these days. Also, fossilization is a infrequent and distinct incidence, now not an every day occasion. Animals and vegetation are not able to turn out to be fossils except they're buried rather speedily and deeply within the proper components. The natural animal that dies in a forrest does now not turn out to be a fossil. And neither does the natural creature that dies in a sea or a lake. Under such a lot typical stipulations, the useless creature simply floats and disintegrates. It's frame is destroyed via predators, micro organism, and the factors. So what stipulations might be such a lot superb for the enormous fossil formations discovered within the sediments? Creation Scientists consider it might be a violent, worldwide flood disaster. Dinosaur stays global are related to water-laid sediments. Well, the Bible talks approximately a global flood. And it happened within the days of Noah, while reptilesÂ might have reached huge sizes. So the truth that we are discovering fossilized stays of giant reptiles far and wide the earth - this suits into the Bible simply flawlessly. The rationale why they received so massive is due to the fact that they lived goodbye within the days of Noah. The rationale why they fossilized is due to the fact that of the floodwaters within the days of Noah. After that flood happened, the age of guy dropped off from approximately 900 years right down to approximately one hundred years in only some generations. The rationale why the age of guy dropped off so swiftly is due to the fact that of the cruel stipulations on the planet after that catastrophic occasion. Because of the ones harsh stipulations, many animals went extinct, adding many reptiles. The reptiles that didn't pass extinct (those which are nonetheless alive in these days) comfortably are not able to develop as massive as they used to, consequently there aren't any dinosaurs round in these days. But wait a minute. How might dinosaurs have lived in Noah's day, while they have got been dated at round sixty five million years? Well, there are a minimum of 6 unique ways of radiometric courting to be had. The assumed age of the pattern will dictate which one shall be used due to the fact that each and every one will supply another outcome. For illustration, while dinosaur stays containing carbon are discovered, they're NOT carbon dated, due to the fact that carbon courting might produce an age estimate of just a few thousand years. Because this might now not fit up with the pre-assigned age within the geologic column, scientists use an extra process of courting so one can produce an age estimate in the direction of the favored outcome. All radiometric outcome that don't fit up with the pre-assigned age within the geologic column are discarded. If you carbon date a dinosaur bone, the outcome will simplest be a couple of thousand years. The flood in Noah's day happened approximately four,four hundred years in the past. Creation Scientists consider that dinosaurs didn't turn out to be extinct till approximately three or four thousand years in the past. There used to be a time while a institution of Creation Scientists took a few dinosaur stays to the lab to be carbon dated, however they didn't inform the lab technicians that they had been dinosaur stays. After they had been dated, the lab technicians gave the stays again and stated that they dated round a couple of thousand years. Then the Creation Scientists educated the technicians that they had been dinosaur stays, and so they stated, \"Oh quite? Well, why did not you let us know? If we had recognize they had been dinosaur stays, then we do not need carbon dated them. We might have used an extra process of courting, due to the fact that, of path, dinosaurs are hundreds of thousands of years historical.\" Obviously, the suggestion of dinosaurs being hundreds of thousands of years historical isn't quite situated upon radiometric courting. It's situated upon assumptions, due to the fact that the assumptions are what dictate which courting process is used. As an issue of reality, scientists were pronouncing that dinosaurs are hundreds of thousands of years historical ever when you consider that the 1800's. However, courting ways did not exist within the 1800's. The first courting process wasn't even invented till 1949. So undoubtedly, courting ways don't seem to be what is dictating the age of dinosaur stays.", 8069, "xVvpBuwiaa", 0],

You can read about some of them here: >The remarkable similarities between different kinds of animals and plants is the common design by which all things were created, in particular the genetic code Wrong. The mere fact that almost all terrestrial life uses DNA as an information-carrying molecule is not enough to explain the similarities between different life forms. It is not merely the fact of using DNA that is similar between species, but also the information itself present on that DNA. For example, chimpanzees share some 98% of their genes with humans, and banana trees share about 50%. There is absolutely no necessity for God to reuse so much of the same genetic material in different species like this, so the matching genes are actually enormous support in favor of evolution.", 8070, "None", 0],
	60296 : ["You asked... And I quote: \"Christians, why do you believe so many things that are not in the Bible?\" True Christians (the Wheat of Jesus' illustration at Matthew 13:24-30, 36-42) DO NOT believe in the things you mentioned in any way, shape, fashion or form due to having received the great increase of ACCURATE knowledge of the Truth of God's Word FORETOLD at Daniel 12:4 to take happen upon the true worshipers of God Almighty during the time period known as \"the time of the end\" (aka \"the Last Days\"... Which we are now living deeply within). I am one of \"the true worshipers\" of God that Jesus referred to at John 4:23, 24 and as such I will be happy to demonstrate SCRIPTURALLY what I have relayed. # 1)  Those who are the \"Wheat\" (true Christians) of Jesus' illustration at Matthew 13:24-30, 36-42 concerning \"The Wheat and the Weeds\" DO NOT believe that the Bible's Hell is a place of ETERNAL TORMENT whatsoever, however the \"Weeds\" (False so called \"Christians\" which RESEMBLE Jesus' true \"Wheat\") of Jesus' illustration do. What backs up my statement? THE HOLY BIBLE itself does... And I quote Revelation 20:13-15 (King James Version Bible): \"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death AND HELL *DELIVERED UP* THE DEAD WHICH WERE IN THEM: and they were judged every man according to their works. 14 And *DEATH* AND HELL were cast into THE LAKE OF FIRE. This is THE SECOND DEATH. 15 And WHOSOEVER was not found written in the book of life was cast into THE LAKE OF FIRE.\" ~ Revelation 20:13-15 (King James Version) It is obvious that the teaching that the Bible's hell is a place of ETERNAL suffering and or ETERNAL separation from God IS NOT of the Bible whatsoever because THE BIBLE shows, teaches and reveals at Revelation 20:13-15 that hell (aka Hades) is to be emptied of ALL its dead! Contrary to the teachings of the \"Weeds\", people can and WILL get out of hell! Then we see that not only hell but DEATH also is to be cast into the \"Lake of Fire\" (which obviously means that hell and the Lake of Fire are two separate things). Death IS NOT a tangible thing which can be literally burned and neither is hell a tangible thing which can be burned. The Lake of Fire is SYMBOLIC and it means THE SECOND DEATH just as the Bible itself states at Revelation 20:14. NOTHING that goes into the Lake of Fire EVER comes out, is worthy of receiving a resurrection or comes back and the promise that God will FOREVER do away with DEATH is SCRIPTURAL because DEATH is to be pitched into the symbolic Lake of Fire along with mankinds common grave which is known as hell. # 2)  The Trinity is bogus on so many different levels that it is isn't even a joke (it's truly pathetic and not funny at all). Daniel 7:13, 14 show that the Messiah (the Son of Man) was to be GIVEN tremendous AUTHORITY from The Ancient of Days (Almighty God). The prophecy does not state that the Son of Man would give this tremendous AUTHORITY to himself and rather than there being THREE supposed divine Persons, Daniel 7:13, 14 only shows God the Almighty (The Ancient of Days), The Son of Man (The Messiah aka Jesus Christ) and the holy angels who were the ones who brought the Son of Man up close to the Ancient of Days. The Bible reveals fulfillment of this prophecy in Jesus' words at Matthew 28:18 and in the ENTHRONEMENT of the Christ at Revelation 12:10. 'Adrift Feline is HSDA' and 'A Zebra Striking' both gave great answers. People should not only carefully RESEARCH the teachings they have been taught to believe (as admonished at Ephesians 5:10) but should do so with a unbiased heart. Lastly, the statement that 'Chibueze' made in response to you that when a person dies they are conscious of nothing at all isn't even in the Bible and that he can tell that you are very ignorant of the Bible and don't even know much about it, perhaps someone should have told him to open up ANY Bible and actually READ Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10 where it states... And I quote: \"For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious OF NOTHING AT ALL, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.... All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising NOR KNOWLEDGE NOR WISDOM in Sheâ²ol (aka \"the grave\" aka \"hell\"), the place to which you are going.\" Or, in other words:  ** Did ya carefully notice in the above link that the King James Version translates Sheol as \"the grave\" while the Douay version (used mostly by Catholics) translates it as HELL? The reason for this is because SHEOL, THE GRAVE, HADES and HELL mean the exact same thing and lends further to the FACT that those in HELL can't possibly FEEL PAIN if they ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING AT ALL, HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE AND NO WISDOM **", 8069, "455eafc873b3e63d71587e6ba6e22ff4aa", 2],

	60304 : ["Your questions suggest belief in an eschatology-focused religion from the 1800's in America.  So you are either a Jehovah's Witness, LDS Church, SDA, or maybe even Missouri Synod I would venture?  There are a few more options (like around 20), but those are the most popular ones with those beliefs. There are MANY different opinions, beliefs, and interpretations regarding the Bible.  Why do you automatically assume yours are correct and everyone else's is wrong? Let me give you an example.  Something recently happened to me - I am reading more about the Apostle Paul because while I had read his inspired letters (i.e. the Bible), I didn't really know that much about him and I didn't necessarily read everything in order either.  How much do you REALLY know about the Apostle Paul? The Apostle Paul wasn't one of the twelve Apostles, he wasn't even one of the 70.  The Apostle Paul was a Roman citizen and a Pharisee by birth.  The Apostle Paul was responsible for organizing violence against Christians.  The Apostle Paul had his vision of being an Apostle and didn't tell the Apostles Matthew or Peter about it until FOURTEEN years after it happened.  His vision was of a resurrected Jesus and he was temporarily blinded.  The Apostle Matthew completely didn't believe the Apostle Paul, while the Apostle Peter tried to bridge the gap between the two.  After converting and doing missionary work all over, the Apostle Paul was arrested by the Romans.  The Apostle Paul then used his Roman citizenship to avoid execution and was given house arrest instead.  Finally before the Apostle Paul was executed by the Emperor Nero - the Apostle Paul proclaimed himself a PHARISEE, not a Christian.  This is years and years after his conversion. So these are all really good reasons to not really trust the Apostle Paul.  Some people even consider the Apostle Paul a worse betrayer of Jesus than Judas.   But I didn't do that.  Instead I had the thought that the Apostle Paul did write inspired letters, but he lived his life as an imperfect man with mortal flaws.  Some of the best parts of the New Testament are written by the Apostle Paul.  The Apostle Paul taught me that redemption and salvation were possible no matter what your actions.  The Apostle Paul also taught about fellowship and finding common ground with people who don't believe the same things as you, such as the idol to the Unknown God in Athens - when the Apostle Paul told the pagans in Athens they were righteous (it's in Acts). So maybe you should take a lesson from the Apostle Paul and realize that no Christian is perfect and even though other Christians may not believe the same as you, it doesn't mean you should chide or try to correct them.  Perhaps instead you should try to find common ground. And if all of this is too serious for you, I hope you will at least never think of eating Little Caesar's pizza the same way - \"Damn You Nero!!!!\"", 8069, "Q3jgfcVqaa", 0],
