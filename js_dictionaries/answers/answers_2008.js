The sun rays flash when it hits the surface of softly waving waters. On clear weathers, As if I can see your smile from those bright sunny blue skies.. A glow of magic brought some joy of mystical passion, From a heaven sent angel kiss, Shielded veils of warmth and tenderness around my soul. Thereafter suddenly nothing seems to hurt anymore.. Not even hate, love, lie or life, And maybe not even death could ever be feared to harm anymore. Just because of a kiss that was sent from heaven.. Sincerely, jeannie kathleen@", 9946, "aOy01jFEaa", 3],

	106153 : ["You could easily make the same argument for the conservatives.  There was a day and age when liberals and conservatives were similar, and they worked together to improve the country.  Then Goldwater came along, and stratified the political spectrum.  This opened the door for Reagan, and conservatives have moved further right with every election cycle.  So much so that Reagan, and even W, are looking more and more Liberal or centrist.  Think about it, Reagan raised taxes 7 out of 8 years in office, he gave amnesty to immigrants, saved Social Security in 1983, and negotiated peace treaties with the USSR.  What happened to conservatives?  I don't think Reagan would even recognize his own party now.", 9951, "apFAvEzqaa", -3],

	106159 : ["When I was sixteen I met a most extraordinary young woman.  Her name was Camille Soleil.  She was beautiful, smart, exotic, courageous, and completely unconventional, and I was smitten almost immediately.  But at the time, I was very shy and introverted, and didn't have the nerve to tell her how I felt about her.  She and I became friends through high school, but I always felt we had the potential to be so much more to each other. After high school we gradually lost touch with each other and went our separate ways.  I eventually met someone new and married her, but not a day went by when I didn't think longingly of my beloved Camille. Things didn't go well in my marriage.  My wife was physically and verbally abusive, but I never could quite get the nerve to divorce her.  Then one day I get a call from out of the clear blue.  It was Camille.  She and I started corresponding, and talking over the phone.  And hearing her voice brought all those feelings surging through me again, like it was yesterday. I filed for divorce, moved out of my house, and finally get the nerve to tell Camille how I've always felt about her.  And lo and behold, it turns out that she felt the same about me, all along! \"So,\" I ask her, \"What do we do now?  You're living in Kentucky, I'm still in California.  Where do we go from here?\" It's then that she tells me about a job she's been offered in Anchorage, Alaska.  She asks me if I'd be willing to fly up to Anchorage with her for a week, and if it looks like a good idea, would I consider relocating to Alaska with her? Would I? I met her at the gate (this was back when you could still meet people at the gate), right as she steps off the plane.  She's every bit as beautiful as the last time I saw her, all those years ago, and we fall into each others' arms.  We kiss for the first time, fourteen years after I first fell in love with her, and it's like the sole reason the entire universe existed was as a prelude for that moment. That was six years ago, last August.  Of course, it isn't always just moments of transcendant romantic bliss -- candlelit dinners inevitably give way to dirty diapers and PTA meetings -- but she is still The One for me; and I wouldn't have done any of it any other way....", 9950, "RLF5YZHGaa", 11],

Another friend told her not believe in people.  The third friend told her that she will never find her way because she was different from all the rest.

	106179 : ["PPl will say Gods words speak of hate, of racism, and saying women are not as important even. Wrong. The Bible speaks many truths, but so few will study to understand them. And, when God says something is wrong , it is.  Its never to hate anyone, but to hate the sin they are doing. We are to love everyone, be it a person that is homosexual, or in adultry, or lying, whatever.. To love them unconditionally as God does, yet speak the truths of God in love to warn them, so they wont be lost. HE doesnt want anyone lost, Nor do His ppl. God speaks warnings, and we are to do the same. They assume its hate, but it is not. When a person refuses to obey the creater GOD, YHWH< they will be headed for a life of misery, becuase disobedience leads to curse. Obedience leads to blessing. IF you see a child running towards a car in heavy traffic, do you holler to warn them? OF couese you do, if you have a drop of love for others in you.  Its not to scare them, or hate them, but to warn them because you care. But, ppl that dont know God or His word, always will say such things that we preach hate and racism, becuase they dont understand and most are afraid to, because if they did believe, they would have to give up their own precious sin. WE must love God more than anything else and obey  Him, and be glad to, knowing His ways are perfect. But, I dont let others bother me and upset me anymore. we know the truths that when we know and understand, we are set free. Not free to sin, but to be free from sin, as overcomers, just like Yashua, Jesus was. Yet, they will hate us, mock us and delete us. But we arent shocked. Look at all they did to Yashua, who came to save us all. To spit on Him, mock Him, torture Him and desire to take His life cuz they hated what He said. PPL rebellious against the word of God will always be rebellious to those of us who speak it God told us it would be this way. YEt we love and forgive them all. Without Jesus, we have nothing. But with Him, we have everything. Oh that all would hear that call from Him and answer with a huge , resounding YES. More will come. Keep speaking and praying.

	106180 : ["Because you quoting the Bible isn't proof of anything. You can say whatever you want, believe whatever you want. Doesn't make you more right than anyone else. But if you are being self-righteous about your beliefs and deliberating trying to force them on others, then yeah your hateful comments will continue to get flagged.  More important question, if you have such a problem with homosexuality, why do you feel the need to bother with their questions? There is too much judgment and hate that concerns so many on here that spew everything that the bible states. Yet they really know next to nothing about what it means to be a good, compassionate and loving person.  The bible has been translated how many times over the years? So you can't take the the words literally. Doesn't the bible say something about stoning adulterers to death?

	106186 : ["I am not what most people consider as a \"Creationist\" in the strictest sense of the term. The earth was NOT made in 6 literal days, the earth is MUCH older than 6,000 years old and dinosaur fossils are real and are millions of years old. I do, however, believe in the ACCURATE rendering of the Biblical creation account as found in Genesis and that the creative \"days\" mentioned were figurative which probably were thousands or even millions of years in length.  The creation record found in the first chapter of Genesis reveals that God created earth's living things \"according to their kinds.\" (Ge 1:11) These were endowed with the capacity for reproducing offspring \"according to their kind(s)\" in a fixed, orderly manner.—Ge 1:12, 21, 22, 24, 25; 1Co 14:33. The Biblical \"kinds\" seem to constitute divisions of life-forms wherein each division allows for cross-fertility within its limits. If so, THEN THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN \"KINDS\" IS TO BE DRAWN AT THE POINT WHERE FERTILIZATION CEASES TO OCCUR. In recent years, the term \"species\" has been applied in such a manner as to cause confusion when it is compared with the word \"kind.\" The basic meaning of \"species\" is \"a sort; kind; variety.\" In biologic terminology, however, it applies to any group of interfertile animals or plants mutually possessing one or more distinctive characteristics. So there could be many such species or varieties within a single division of the Genesis \"kinds.\" Although the Bible creation record and the physical laws implanted in created things by God allow for great diversity within the created \"kinds,\" there is no support for theories maintaining that new \"kinds\" have been formed since the creation period. The unchangeable rule that \"kinds\" cannot cross is a biologic principle that has never been successfully challenged. Even with the aid of modern laboratory techniques and manipulation, no new \"kinds\" have been formed.  From the earliest human record until now, the evidence is that dogs are still dogs, cats continue to be cats, and elephants have been and will always be elephants. STERILITY CONTINUES TO BE THE DELIMITING FACTOR AS TO WHAT CONSTITUES A \"KIND\". This phenomenon makes possible, through the test of sterility, the determining of the boundaries of all the \"kinds\" in existence today. Although hybridization was once hoped to be the best means of bringing about a new \"kind,\" in every investigated case of hybridization the mates were always easily identified as being of the same \"kind,\" such as in the crossing of the horse and the donkey, both of which are members of the horse family. Except in rare instances, the mule thus produced is sterile and unable to continue the variation in a natural way. Even Charles Darwin was forced by the facts to admit: \"The distinctness of specific forms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty.\" (Origin of Species, 1902, Part 2, p. 54) This still remains true.", 9951, "FsJTro2Oaa", 0],
