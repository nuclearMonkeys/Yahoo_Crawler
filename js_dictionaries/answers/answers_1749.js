	93157 : ["He's generally accepted as the greatest hockey player ever, so the league thought it would be appropriate to retire his number for every team. That's the honest answer - now here's my opinion: The idea of a league-wide number retirement is silly. The MLB, NFL, and NBA have never done anything like that. (Or if they have, I missed it.) Retiring numbers has always been a team-specific tradition in any sport. On top of that, Wayne Gretzky's status as the best hockey player in history is a matter of opinion, and it's an opinion that isn't shared by all knowledgeable hockey people. The Hockey News has had writers who say that Bobby Orr was the best player ever. (This is where I stand.) Based on the stats, you could also make a case that Mario Lemieux was a more talented (though certainly more injury-prone) player than Gretzky. So, even if I did agree with the concept of a league-wide retirement, I don't think Gretzky's #1 status has been sufficiently agreed on to merit doing it.", 9470, "MKQtULt4aa", 0],

	93164 : ["Though I favor Gordie Howe over all that you mentioned (though Gretzky is the best), Wayne put hockey into it's most successful times with his play, and has more records than anyone in the NHL. You could go on and on, but why? This question is practically redundant. Gordie Howe had numerous records broken by \"The Great One\", and why? Because Gretzky's the best, that might not be had Orr lasted longer... But he didn't.", 9470, "PLO7muLhaa", 0],
	93165 : ["People are much more emotional now. Gretzky had partial or full ownership of 61 records when he retired, most of which won't be broken in our lifetime (or maybe the lifetime of the nhl). He was a true superstar for three teams, and spent time with four that i know of. If I had it my way Nobody would have a league wide retired number, eve if 99 is less common than 9. I believe that Howe's grit, longevity, and skill at a time when only the cream could play because of the fact that there were less teams, makes him on tough cookie to not call the best player of all time.-", 9470, "ePA1sxf0aa", 2],
	93166 : ["ClayMeow, you obviously don't follow baseball either (but I do see you are a big follower of Wilkpedia, LOL!) ... #42 was retired for Jackie Robinson.  I think it is a fitting tribute to both athletes (Robinson & Gretzky) to have the numbers retired by their respective leagues considering the impact both men had in their sport. Yeah, you can make arguments for other nhl greats, but come on it's Gretzky. When someone comes along and breaks all his records, we'll retire his number throughout the league as well!", 9470, "lP1Oc9Zfaa", 0],
	93167 : ["Why not?  The number was made famous in hockey by Gretzky.  Orr and Howe wore standard lower numbers from a different era.  Also Orr had a short, injury plagued career and his numbers are lower than Potvin's or Borque's or Coffey's.  As for Mr Hockey?  By the time he retired two or three clubs had retired or were thinking of retiring number 9.  It was worn by Richard and Hull to name a couple.

The only current player allowed to wear the number is Mariano Rivera of the NY Yankees because of a grandfather clause (since he was wearing it at the time it was retired, he's allowed to continue).  Once he retires, the number will never be worn again (apart from tributes).  Reggie's # was retired because he changed the face of the game. As for Gretzky, as was said, he was simply dominant and he too changed the face of the game.  He may have only played for a few teams, but his impact was felt by all.
