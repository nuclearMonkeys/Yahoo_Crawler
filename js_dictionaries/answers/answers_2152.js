	113381 : ["What is most funny about the Obama v. Palin back and forth is that when she was Governor of Alaska she couldn't have justified hiring him as anything more than an Assistant Counsel reviewing clemency petitions all day. Obama has never been anything more than a 3rd-year junior associate lawyer and adjunct night lecturer in first-year constitutional law.  In most towns, that weak resume would barely qualify a person for a leadership position in the PTA.", 10347, "None", -1],
	113382 : ["Once again, a neocon gone awry.  I am well aware that Palin was the VP nominee.  Unfortunately, given the age of former presidential candidate McCain and the grim fact that he has had multiple bouts with one of the most dangerous cancers in existence, melanoma, the very real possiblity that Palin would have wound up as president made it impossible to vote for McCain.  By the way, Lieberman is essentially a neocon, not a liberal.", 10347, "m8f7rnBEaa", 3],

	113389 : ["If you consider yourself experienced then an advanced pattern is usually more about time than difficulty. If you've made prom dresses then your level is probably intermediate so an advanced level pattern might be an enjoyable challenge. I actually enjoy sewing projects that are challenging. There are lots of time consuming details in that particular pattern so it will take a while to complete. I think the important skill for the pattern will be transferring the markings from the paper pattern to the fashion fabric so that all the details go together -especially the pockets on the side, They will need to be symmetrical in order to look good -any difference in the placement will make you look lop-sided. I think it would be a fun puzzle-type pattern and well worth the time and effort. i really like the pinstriped cut out shoulder top, the high neck says \"covered up\" and \"conservative\" but the close fit and the cut out shoulder say sexy and sophisticated. Do test the fit of the blouse in a scrap fabric first, the fit tells the story of the blouse. Alter the test scrap fabric first and then adjust the pattern before cutting the fashion fabric.", 10351, "yQtCzgBCaa", 0],

	113391 : ["Firstly, you are treating her as another of your collection. Sound as if she is one of your collection. Don't sound nice. Is normal if she's angry and stormed. She is jealous, eventually you don't make her feel she is important and probably the way you explain things to her sound you are not serious. She is defintely not unreasonable, sometimes you don't get angry for a reason in relationship.", 10341, "n6b8pnGQaa", 0],
