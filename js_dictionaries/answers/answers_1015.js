Even if we are talking average distance (so what long term effect on climate if this 5 million wide range of distance  between earth and sun was shifted 300 km closer). Well, that is quite simple to compute. 1 million feet = 300 km closer, is a reduction of distance of 0.0002% So an increase of energy input of 0.0004% (inbound energy is inversely proportional to the square of the distance). So an increase of average absolute temperature of 0.0001% since temperature is proportional to the fourth power of energy (Stefan-Boltzmann) That is 0.03 degrees Celsius increase. Climate scientist say that climate change effect will be sustainable if we remain under a 2 degrees Celsius increase. And we sure won't (we already have gained more than 1, and nothing can prevent gaining at least another one, and probably even +4 or +5). Those +0.03 are nothing compared to what awaits us anyway. +0.03 are approx (and on average, since oscillations around that average are way bigger than that anyway) what global warming gives every pair of years since 1975 (we have gained +0.8 degrees since 1975. So 0.8/46=0.017. So 0.034 per 2 years since 1975) Those would be +0.03 more, sure. Maybe the straw that break the camel's back. But just a straw, tho.
