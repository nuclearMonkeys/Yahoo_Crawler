Also, and this part is indeed for real, have a computer expert go through your smart phones and laptop computers and wireless router and look for \"Spyware\". Also have them check for spyware in your cars. This prank caller may be using spy tech to spy on you, so get a trusted friend who knows computers and have them use a magnet to go through the walls of the house and find metal speakers or microphones and start getting rid of the spy tech. Then again ask this person for money. When you get a phone call from this person, learn how to use the operator to trace the phone call and bill that person for the minutes they are using on your phone line. Get a list of received calls from this prank person and see if they come from a specific computer. You can use that computer id to get a location and address. When you find an address you can make 2 copies of a bill for the charges of the minutes used on your cell phone and bill them (Always keep a copy for yourself), then when they don't pay, you have a piece of paper with their computer IP address, a list of all the phone calls, and a reason to take them to small claims court.

If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbringsthemupalevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put thesewreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism/COVIDrestrictions will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.

	43236 : ["The Kurdish friend is likely unfamiliar with what a lot of people know or perceive in the West, which is why he or she doesn't understand. To them, their reality is that Arabs (or at least certain Arab-majority nations) can be oppressive and cruel; however, the world's viewpoint isn't limited to Arab-Kurdish relations. The perception most white people receive is informed more about how Arabs are treated here in the West, rather than on-ground realities in the Middle East. In the West, Arabs are a minority and can be discriminated against, so sympathies are given rather than scorn. Many people, including many whites, have a perception that Arabs are often discriminated against due to their ethnic or national origin, skin tone, and/or religion (a lot not realizing that some of these things may be shared by them too, as Arabs don't come in one uniform way). When they think Arabs, they're more likely to rely more on what they see at home rather than what happens abroad. And... that kind of viewpoint can paint how they see all Arabs, both those close to them and far away. Many displace their feelings of Arabs they see discriminated against at home onto Arabs who aren't discriminated against elsewhere. Despite being the majority of people in the Middle East, some people still talk about them as if they're minorities everywhere. I've at least seen it in regards to the Arab-Israeli conflict, where certain things said by armchair pundits only make sense if they think the situation is involving Arabs that live in the States. And it doesn't help that most white people are wholly ignorant of Middle Eastern demographics. As I've hinted up two paragraphs ago, most don't realize many Arabs pass as white (or are white, depending on who you ask) and are Christian. However, it's more than that: There is no knowledge of non-Arab minorities in the Middle East. Many don't know of ancient Jewish populations, or of the Assyrians, Copts, the Druze... and, of course, of the Kurds.

	43263 : ["Hello, As I wrote to the question at URL: it has been reported that the \"Palestinian Authority\" aka \"Fatah\" had refused to communicate with Israel about a Coronavirus vaccine at the time Israel was making arrangements to obtain them, and that the  P.A. / Fatah have subsequently made their own vaccine arrangements. The reader may also be interested to have some more information about who are the \"Palestinian\" Arabs: Who were the Arabs living in British “Palestine” Mandate administered Israel? There has never been an indigenous “Palestine” / Arab sovereign state in the land of Israel upon which the “Palestinian” Arabs could base any claim to any part of Israel. Following the Ottoman Turkish defeat in the First World War, the League of Nations in 1922 resurrecting the name “Palestine” from Roman occupation, authorized a British Mandate; an administrative region ruled by a foreign imperial power, it was an area that later would be today's: Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Territories - Please compare the second and third maps down, at: Jewish citizens were Palestinian: Irrespective of race or religion citizens of the British Mandate became: “Palestinian”. Specimen 1947 British “Government of Palestine” passport: “Palestinian citizen”. The Media of the time referred to Mandate inhabitants, as: “Palestinian Arabs”, / “Palestinian Jews”, or as: “Arabs” / “Jews”. The “Palestinian Arabs” dropped the name “Arab” because they do not want you to understand they mostly originate from Foreign-Arab-Migrant-Workers who came to the land of Israel just prior to, and during the British Mandate, to take advantage of higher wages through Jewish returnee-exiles: - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “[...] most Arabs in British Mandate Palestine were migrant workers and descendants of the 1832-1947 wave of Arab/Muslim immigration from Egypt, the Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, Libya, North Africa, Bosnia, India, Afghanistan, etc. While the British Mandate encouraged Arab immigration, it blocked Jewish immigration.” Extract source: - - - - End of extract - - - - - - - - Start of extracts: - - - - “[...] the Zionist project was very attractive to Arabs who were drawn to Palestine by the good wages, healthcare and sanitation offered by the Jews. [...] the Arab population of Palestine increased the most in cities where there were large numbers of Jews [...] [British] restrictions were placed on Jewish immigration in order to appease Arab troublemakers. However, the situation regarding Arab settlement was much more lax. [...] the Arab population of Palestine had been in a state of flux for centuries and that the overwhelming majority were migrants from the rest of the Arab world and/or the Ottoman empire. This is important because it tells us that the postmodern notion of a deep-rooted Palestinian Arab history/culture is bogus. [...] This explains why, historically, Arabs never talked about Palestinian identity - because there wasn't one. They were Egyptian, Syrian, Moroccan, Iraqi and Ottoman Arabs, and many of them expressed allegiance to the concept of a Greater Syria.” Extracts source: “Arab Immigration to Historic Palestine: A Survey”, by Richard Mather: - - - - End of extracts - - - - - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “Not until the Zionists had arrived in numbers did the Arab population begin to augment itself. The introduction of European standards of wage and life acted like a magnet on the entire Near East. Abruptly, Palestine became an Arab center of attraction. By 1922, after a quarter century of Jewish colonization [Jewish returnee-exiles], their [Arab] numbers mushroomed to 488,000.” Extract source: - - - - End of extract - - - - The “Palestinian” Arabs considering themselves Arab were opposed to being called a “people” until the 1960's, when they decided it fitted with their intention to steal the land of Israel from its indigenous Jews: Why did the “Palestinian” Arabs decide to falsely-claim they are native to the land of Israel? The purpose of League of Nations Mandates such as the one awarded to Great Britain, was to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people: - - - - Start of extract: - - - - “Two governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-annexation of the territory and its administration as a “sacred trust of civilisation” to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.” Extract source: - - - - End of extract - - - - Research (2014) on 1,000 “Palestinian” Arab surnames ranked them (numbered them) in order of the highest instances of each surname found in the Palestine region. It also then identified the country(ies) having the highest incidence of those surnames; whether of \"Palestine\" or other countries.  I examined the first 100 of those ranked “Palestinian” Arab surnames (from the total of 1,000 ranked surnames), which makes a 10% sample.  Of the sample first 100 ranked “Palestinian” Arab surnames, 16 surnames had the highest incidence in the Palestine region.  The remaining 84 “Palestinian” Arab surnames had the highest incidence in countries other than the Palestine region, as follows:  35 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Egypt.   11 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Iraq. 9 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Yemen. 7 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Syria. 6 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Jordan. 6 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Pakistan. 3 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Nigeria. 2 ranked surnames had highest incidence in Sudan. 2 ranked surnames had highest incidence in India. 1 ranked surname had highest incidence in Tanzania. 1 ranked surname had highest incidence in Saudia Arabia. 1 ranked surname had highest incidence in Bangladesh.

But the truth of the matter is that the Gazans are in control of their hospitals. Israel is under no obligation to operate or supply those hospitals.
