The problem with Socialism is that instead of taking that money to improve defense, roads, and other things the government are here for, a socialist state will take that money and give it to people that sat on their asses so that everybody can be \"equal\".

Most liberals do not support full-blown socialism. You are definitely wrong on that part. Healthcare? Please, that's nothing and is a moral thing to offer citizens. Maybe we could trim that giant war budget and eliminate some of those tax breaks (History shows economic growth follows raising taxes). \"Oh no that's my money...\" No, that's the war you probably (maybe not) supported.

Democratic socialism is practiced in much of Europe and you still find the wealthy living very opulent life-styles there.  Socialism doesn't dictate that everyone gets the same compensation and benefits for the work they do.  Just like under capitalism, those with the most responsibility, get the biggest paychecks. People with money - including some Republicans like Warren Buffet - advocate for a fair system of compensation.  Maybe it's their belief that someday they're going to have to answer to God for their actions here on earth.  Maybe it's the idea that all of us are in the same boat whether we choose to be or not.  Maybe it's because some things are just the right things - the moral and ethical things - to do.", 8254, "uJBnZWtcaa", 1],
	64407 : ["Based on what I have read on what they propose, is that they are doing away with the mandate to buy insurance, so can go w/out and not be taxed.  Everyone gets a \"credit\" regardless if rich or poor, but is based on your age.  So, instead of getting a subsidy, you pay 100% of the premium, then \"wait\" till you file your taxes to get back the credit a year late. They are limiting Medicaid, so that will limit the poor to get health insurance, since the states will only have \"so much\" they get from the government to insure, thus many will lose \"any\" insurance at all.  Instead of the older paying a max of 3 times what the youngest pay, they can now charge up to 5 times more.   They are keeping the pre-existing, but if you lapse, then they can charge you 30% more in premium, which is good, since you need people to keep insurance, thus not on/off.  But, now with no mandate, then that will allow all those young who are healthy, and think they don't need insurance, to not buy, thus you will end up with a lot of sick that will buy, and then the cost of insurance will be more, since when you don't have enough healthy and sick together, then the cost for insurance will be more vs less.  Now, this is just w/in the last few days of what I have read of what the GOP wants, so can change tomorrow.  Either way, the cost of healthcare will continue to rise, unless something can be done.  And even if you can afford a policy, the other problem we have is the deductibles of on average of $6,000 which most people can't pay, so do not use even for just preventative care.   The pharmaceutical companies can charge \"whatever\" they want and can get away with it.   The US has the highest cost in healthcare vs other countries.  So, to reduce or change, we need to figure out how to reduce the cost for health care 1st, so we can reduce or pay less in premiums.", 8255, "IXtiKaOYaa", 0],

I never understood why the lower class pays more in ss and other taxes per earned dollar then someone who is in the top bracket. Also its backwards that capital gains is taxed differently then regular income taxes. Income is income. Some people entirely make their income off of capital gains and to have that money be exempt and a lower % from all the other taxes associated with income is wrong. We should all pay the same % of taxes on our income. As for the socialism bit its all they have to run with. Obama has said many and many times again that  95% of WORKING AMERICANS will get a tax cut. McCain supporters keep taking that out of context. Even McCain said before he ran for 2008 that the Bush tax cuts favored the rich. Common sense says that if the current program isn't working you find a new one. Lower capital gains taxes, less regulation and the bush tax cuts obviously isn't working.

	64423 : ["Boehner's delusional, at best, and downright dishonest in a worst-case scenario.   I like to use an analogy for the GOP's always-fail \"Reaganomics\" or supply-side approach to economic policies:  unlimited (unregulated) sugar snacks for toddlers throughout the day.  Supply side policies during the Reagan/Bush days provided a GLUT of supply (building) funded by the American taxpayers (government spending) for which there was no established DEMAND for the products or buildings under construction.  Once all the government-subsidized (taxpayer-funded)  building in cities across the nation was completed, the GLUT of new buildings in downtown areas for which there were no tenants (no DEMAND) sat empty.  Providing more than is needed DEVALUES the goods or buildings and thus the economy eventually FLAT-LINES or runs out of momentum, in the same manner that a sugar-eating toddler climbs the walls in false (hyper) energy and then CRASHES to a depression lower than where the child was prior to ingesting the sugar, as any parent can tell you.   Now add to this recession-causing Republican policy of SUPPLY-SIDE economics the DEREGULATION that removes all government oversight, all consumer protections, and all systems of checks and balances (or what I like to call Congress's \"dereliction of duty\" but what the corporate-colluding GOP calls \"less government\"), which unleashes a PANDORA'S BOX of corporate GREED and CORRUPTION (savings and loan collapse anyone?  financial system MELTDOWN anyone?  housing and credit markets' COLLAPSE anyone?).   President Obama, like Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton (all Democrats), was able to reverse the GOP's always-fail-policies-caused Great Recession by introducing DEMAND-SIDE economics that focuses upon CONSUMER SPENDING to create a DEMAND that, in turn, SPURS MORE PRODUCTION, which CREATES MORE JOBS, that means even more CONSUMER SPENDING, and so on in an upward and outward GROWTH SPIRAL.  Sensible re-regulation (consumer protections, moderate oversight) of the greedy-gut banks and Wall Street (Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Banking Reforms Act of 2010 with its Personal Responsibility Fee that prevents using taxpayer dollars for any more bailouts...see whitehouse.gov or ReadTheBill.org), big oil, health care providers, the 1300 for-profit insurers, pharmaceuticals, credit card companies (see the Credit CARD Act of 2009) prevents CORPORATE GREED from being the \"order of the day\" at the expense of the American people or the U.S. economy.  Replacing the GOP's OUTSOURCED manufacturing base with a focus on President Obama's dreamed of \"green energies\" technologies initiative (see recovery.gov or read Michael Grumwald's \"The New New Deal: The Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era\") lays a very strong foundation for long-term FUTURE GROWTH that will see America become the WORLD LEADER in manufacture, export, and sales of renewable energy resources, making sure our manufacturing jobs base has lots of room for GROWTH that will sustain us for years and years to come... Democrats are the party of fiscal growth for the LONG TERM, whereas Republicans take us to a \"fool's gold\" sugar-spurt beginning that leads to CRASH and DEPRESSION once the energy runs out.  Like dedicated CORPORATE RAIDERS, the rightwing fiscally illiterate Republicans also NEGLECT our nation's infrastructure, pulling dollars out of the economy to give undeserved and revenue-destroying TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH.

The tax increases arent going to pay only for infrastruture, it will increase giveaways to those dont pay net income taxes.   The funny part is when the top tax rate was 70% in the 1970s, the top 1% paid < 20% of the tax burden. Now with rates cut in half, they pay 40% of it.  Most people arent all that good at math so they wont understand the irony of the numbers. \"Economist Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University points out that in 1970, the highest tax rate was 70%.
