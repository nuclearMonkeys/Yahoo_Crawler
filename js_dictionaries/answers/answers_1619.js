	86617 : ["Medicaid and other entitlement programs are there for people who CAN'T afford health care (or food).  It is NOT for those who are too lazy, or determined to be on the government nipple for handouts.  It should NEVER be enough to keep people from working as the 2 years of unemployment has been. Those entitlement programs are pathetically written, but INTENTIONALLY written, to keep the poor stuck in the system.  They punish effort and reward sloth.   In your example of a Wal Mart worker, let's say that he is making $8.00/hr and receiving Medicaid that would equate to $2.50/hr.  But the worker gets a $1.00 raise.  He would lose his Medicaid and probably some or all of some other \"benefits\" that he is getting so his $1.00/raise would cost him $5.00/hr in lost benefits.  Democrats INTENTIONALLY caused this because the poor is a huge part of their voter base.  When they start to become self-sufficient, they tend to start voting republican.  The dems NEED the poor to stay poor. So, I find it sad that a Wal-Mart worker would have to go from $8.00/hr to about $14.00 just to get ANY improvement in his situation.  THIS is tragic, and you can blame the liberals for their design of programs such as Medicaid, etc. Alex and Chuck....funny, the only place I saw your answers or have ever heard any comment like that to a question like this is from liberals who say \"a common response from cons would be...\"  Get over your delusion, we do not think like that.", 9235, "ZrMic2rOaa", 1],

Whenever I say I need help, he throws it up in my face that it was MY decision to stay home with our child so I need to just deal with it.  I did what was best for our child, not putting her in daycare, I did think I was not being selfish in that way.  As for you, you are gonna have to just let the dirty clothes fall where they may.  You will drive yourself crazy trying to keep up a house and take care of kids.  It gets depressing seeing the clutter I know but you can't do it all.  Our house is a wreck but I'm happier.  If I get any babysitting help from a grandma on the weekend, fine, but if not, he can wash his own clothes and then dig them out of a basket to put them on.   Trust me, your job is WAY harder than his although don't ever try to get him to admit it because that ain't gonna happen.  Are there any grandparents, perhaps his mother, who could lend a hand?  My husband's mom helps me a lot and to me she really kind of should since she raised him to act this way towards his wife.  lol!  j/k The only other thing I could suggest for you (and I know this is deceitful but if you're as desperate as I was), fake a contagious illness or something for a few days.  That way he HAS to deal with that baby and he HAS to deal with that laundry and he HAS to deal with those dishes, etc.  It was the only way I could get my husband to even remotely appreciate what I do all day.  I couldn't just leave and say I'm going somewhere because that would have caused a big argument but how could he argue with me being \"sick\"??

A few thoughts occurred to me: 1.  Are you setting your housekeeping standards WAY too high?  What's messy?  In our house, if the trash is taken out when it gets full, nothing's left on the floor and said floor gets vacumned and swept (along with basic hygenic cleanings of the kitchen and bathrooms) that's good enough.  As the old saying goes, \"my house is clean enough to be healthy and dirty enough to be happy.\" 2.  Is your SO working weekends too?  I can't imagine that he is working 7 days a week.  Is he interacting with your child at all?  He needs to be involved with the care of your child and not \"be putting his feet up\" completely to establish a bond with his son, and this is the age to do it.  He can take your son out to the park as a means of relaxing, or he can watch him while he is \"relaxing\" and let you get some other stuff done. 3.  It sounds to me like you're putting more pressure on yourself to be \"SuperWoman\" than your SO is.  Cut back on your school schedule.  If your SO carps, point out that you need some more time to yourself and it actually will allow you to save money that you're not spending on tuition.   Take a deep breath, and realize that you aren't going to be perfect in everything, your SO needs to be more involved and this will all work out in the end -- even if your house is a little less than pin-perfect neat.

Countries are represented by governments, and governments are consisted by humans, and greed, stupidity and selfishness don't have geographical and national limits. I suppose the term 'great' refers to an era of financial, political, social and cultural prosperity. In these terms, the UK is not doing that bad at the moment. Consider all the countries that were empires at one stage or the other: Greece, the Romans, Alexandria, China, the Ottomans, Germany, and now the US. They were all prosperous in the aforementioned terms, yet this prosperity was always founded on the grounds of war, murder and suffering. Unfortunately this is the way humans write history.  This is why a truly educated person is by no means a chauvinist. There is no blessed country, no blessed nation, and national pride is merely another way to boost our egos: we belong to a country, so that country needs to be great, in fact the greatest.

	86627 : ["Its a fair question even If GB means its a big island because GB can be great or can be not so. Greatness or pre-eminence is a concept heavily dependent on a person's perspective and biases. Whether someone or something is great or not depends from subjective judgements of the value of one person or thing as compared to another. I believe it is the people of a Country that makes a country have great/majestic/remarkable qualities - GB has many great people even today - also we have had dumb people in the past and we still have our fair share of idiots in GB. The people of the GB in general not all but in general have a sense of fair play and want to do what is right - we do not always manage to do what is right but we try. I think we are moving towards thinking that the human race is great and we should stop the violence and make the Earth a Great Place for all us humans but I wonder if this will ever be achieved.

BNP is not the answer but not one party or group is the answer we all have to work together and have some cool sensible thinking - then we as a Country and all Countries and we as the human race will be great - until we achieve this; then and only then will we realise that we can make the future great for GB and all Nations and all life forms on Earth. Will we achieve it, that is a great big question mark? There is good and bad, great and the minuscule in all Countries throughout history and now; but we will only ever be truely great when we have World peace, no more starvation, population control and always remember that the Earth and all life forms are the most important for Mankind to protect or we really will never recover the Great Earth.", 9238, "None", 0],
	86628 : ["Well you can bet your bottom dollar that if Britain wasn't \"Great\" then no other country was.  First things first, I'm Canadian, so if I give you any inaccurate information, don't sue me. The name \"Great Britain\" is derived from the size of the territory, not the status. But since you are intent on figuring out what makes Britain so great, think about this. What language are you speaking right now? What language is the world speaking? The fact that the English language has taken dominion over the world proves to you that the British did their work right. Now time for a history lesson. Yes the British did defeat the Spanish Armada to gain some reputation, but look at the face of Britain in 1914. The Brits had colonies all over the world. Africa, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Middle East, colonies in South America, even bloody Antarctica. Everyone answered Britains call. (Map of the British Raj:   The British were the dominant species, and on top of the food chain. They had the most Colonial power, and if not the strongest ground army, they were the kings of the sea.       \"At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922, the British Empire held sway over a population of about 458 million people, one-quarter of the world's population,[1] and covered more than 13,000,000 square miles (33,670,000 km²): approximately a quarter of the Earth's total land area.\"           \"At the peak of its power, it was often said that \"the sun never sets on the British Empire\" because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous territories.\" The British never stayed quiet on any level. As I said before, they held the strongest Naval power in the world, and no other country even came close.       \"The British boasted the largest fleet of ships in the world and had initiated a general rule that the British fleet would always be 10 percent larger than the combined totals of the next two strongest powers.\" In 1905 the British created the supreme battleship, the HMS Dreadnought, which had ten 30cm guns (each able to fire a 386-kg shell), protected by 4535 tons of armor, capable of reaching a speed of up to 19 knots and measuring 26m longer, 61cm wider and 1270t heavier than any other ship to sail the oceans. This was a single ship, due to the fact that it cost 10 million dollars to build one of these things. Germany got jealous and created their own battle ships to match the Brits and ended up with dreadnoughts of their own. But Britain wasn't going to sit idle. Both countries competed fiercely in the naval race, but by the time 1914 hit, Germany had 17 Dreadnoughts, while Britain had 29. Both countries had suffered a major economic decrease because of the ships, but Britain still stood at the top with 120 million dollars worth of ships more than the Germans. If I continue on, this could be as long as a wikipedia article, so I'm going to stop here. There is one other thing I'm going to say; There's a reason that it was called the World War. When Britain picked up its sword, it brought along with it the entire world. If that 'ain't great, I don't know what is.", 9238, "luUAoH38aa", -1],

For example, he lost his job, crashed my car, shrunk my sweater, and seems to be afraid of the kitchen.  All marriages will have problems like these but if you are young and don't know how to do things on your own, you will have more conflict and not have the maturity to put things like this in perspective.

Your parents from what you wrote seem like reasonable people. And they don't just have a problem with you being young, they have a problem with your fiance.  Since you have been dating for 3 years and are 18, it looks like you started dating when you are very young and who you would choose as a 15 year old isn't necessarily who you want to be with as an adult.  Marriage is a wonderful thing and you want to marry someone you are compatible with as opposed to the first guy you got a long with. I think that if you are older and more adult and have more life skills, your marriage will go smother and you do need to put some trust in your parents' judgment. I suggest you take a premarital counseling class so you can discuss and learn what sort of things you will have to consider before and within a marriage.  Is one offered through your church? Also, no birth control is 100%.  If you start having sex, regardless of the precautions you take, you may end up pregnant.  This is something you will have to be at least ok with before you get married.   The pill is 99% effective with perfect use, but only 92% effective with typical use.  So, it is unlikely that you will get pregnant in one year's use of it.  But, after 8 years of use, it would be more likely than not that you would have gotten pregnant.  Regardless of how careful you are, don't get married before you can be okay with a baby.", 9236, "JnWzHVnEaa", 5],

How about wait 2 years, and plan the most amazing wedding ever? That way you will have waited, you'll be older and will have grown even MORE together. If your parents aren't ok with a date you set for 2 years from now, then you need to do what's best for you.  Try to wait just a little longer, get excited about planning and start looking around for things as soon as you want! Search online for cheap invites, amazing dresses, accessories, places you'd want the reception to be... it's a lot!  So take your time and plan a wedding you'll be glad you put so much effort into.
