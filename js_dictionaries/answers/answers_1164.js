Eventually it will stop expanding and the gravity of the matter will cause it to gather together. The univers will contract and eventually all the matter in the universe will all be attracted by gravity back to the same spot. This is the big crunch. Then after this big crunch the mass and density of all the matter in the universe crushing in on top of each other will cause another big bang.

It's tough for a non-specialist to keep up. Right now, for example, I believe that big bang theorists have concluded that the universe is expanding, and has been since the beginning.  No cylce of expansion/contraction.  Is that true?  Also, the universe is currently thought to be finite containing roughly 10 to the 55th kg of matter and extending approximately 13.7 billion light years in diameter.  Is this true.

	63697 : ["TUITION: Private Schools- it can vary greatly depending on where you live and the individual school, you will have to talk to the people at each school you are interested in. Charter Schools- Free.   Montessori Schools - depends on if they are public or private. Public and Charter Montessori schools are free, private ones run the gambit.  You will have to check individual ones. PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES: Public schools use taxpayers dollars. They are regulated by the state and federal governments. Nowadays they are closely watched because of the NCLB laws that test the children in them at the end of the school year. Schools that don't have enough children passing the end of the year test receive mandates such as less funding and are forced to use scripted programs. Private schools charge money for children to go to them. They are not covered by the NCLB laws unless they have special education students in them, and then not in every state. Since private schools use tuition money they can use their own curriculum and philosophy. Some people think that since you pay for it, private education is always better. Sadly nothing could be further from the truth. There are WONDERFUL private schools and HORRIBLE ones. Since there aren't any standards or requirements for private schools, they run the gambit. I have seen private schools where every teacher had a Ph. D. and private schools where none of the teachers had graduated from high school (Sad, but very true. Not that they told this to the parents who were paying $5000 a year per child though.) Some other differences between public and private schools is that private schools can pick and choose the children that they serve, while public schools can't. This being the case, some private schools only contain upper middle class white and/or Asian children. Others contain only children of a certain religious persuasion, while others contain children not doing well in the public sector. Some families, find the exclusiveness very attractive, others find it stifling. Montessori is an educational philosophy. There are many different  forms of educational philosophies. To name a few... Play based schools - where there isn't any kind of official academic \"pen and paper work\", but concepts are taught through games, music, .... Non-academic schools - where children DO NOT do any kind of academics at all and learn to work and play with others as well as following directions. Academic schools - where children are taught in ways similar to a traditional elementary school. Reggio-Emila schools - where children choose which things they want to learn about and then the teachers design many lessons to teach them the concepts that they want to learn. The lessons come in many different modalities (art, music, movement...). Waldorf schools - which focus on fantasy, and work to confirm the spirit in each child, his natural senses of gratitude, wonder, and reverence, while using natural materials (wood, metal, bees wax crayons...). Summerhill, sometime called \"Free' schools\" -  where children do whatever they want as long as they aren't hurting themselves, each other, or the materials. It is believed by the proponents of this philosophy that children know what is best for them, or what they need to learn, and will naturally choose activities that they will learn what they need. Montessori schools which have many studies: practical life, sensorial, mathematics, language, science, cultural studies, fine arts... Each area has many different ways to teach each concept and children have the freedom to choose which way they learn the concepts. Charter schools are private schools that use federal and state funds. This means that they are often smaller in size and therefore know their students and families better. Teachers have more time and ability to collaborate, and they can adhere to a specific philosophy such as Montessori or Waldorf, but not charge parents tuition. That is wonderful, but since they use public funds, they must adhere to the NCLB laws and that at times comes in conflict with their philosophy. For these schools, it is a fine dance that they do, trying to remain faithful to their philosophy and still abide by the NCLB laws. So which is 'BETTER' ? It depends... On the individual school, your goals, and your child's personality. There are WONDERFUL private schools, there are horrible ones too. There are WONDERFUL public schools, there are horrible ones too. And There are WONDERFUL charter schools, and there are horrible ones too. My suggestion to you is to first research the different options in your area, find the philosophies that interest you and then go and visit the schools.", 8212, "AA11770802", 1],

Evidence of the Big Bang theory can be seen, but what we have is also not exhaustive.  In this sense, dealing with abstractions is different than having faith.  For example, most folks can drive a car, but very few understand the mechanisms that occur under the hood.  It takes no faith understand what a vehicle does even though we may not understand it completely.

	63718 : ["I think you are wrong in how you present this. Big Bang theory has been described in many popular physics books and put into layman's terms many times over. The concept and the theory and the aftermath of the big bang are not that difficult to understand.  The mathematics is something else. Now you are going into plank length mathematics, and quantum statistics and I agree that there are very few people in the world that understand this. What they are trying to do is describe mathematically what happened in those first few seconds. The particle physicists are hunting the Higgs boson, searching for that elusive particle that causes gravity etc. Nobody here is claiming to understand the mathematics and physics at this level but there is a certain amount of understanding among atheists anyway because they are prepared to learn something for themselves. Do I need to understand the full mathematics of the 1st law of thermodynamics to believe it is true. Of course not.  Let me put it another way. You work in physics but when you get sick you happily put your faith in the medication that a doctor prescribes even though you have no understanding of medicine, biology or pharmacy? Why do you put so much faith in medical treatments if you have never studied them. Is it faith? No. The point is that I was scientifically trained as you claim to be. You understand the process of peer review and how science will continually test itself and its theories and replace out of date scientific theories with new ones when necessary e.g. Newtonian physics was replaced by Einsteins theory. When you understand the scientific method then accepting the product of science becomes so much easier and does not rely on faith. it relies on methods which are continually challenged.

	63721 : ["Montessori schools differ in the way they handle their High School and Junior High School programs. Ideally, Maria Montessori envisioned a farm community where the students could live and work. This was all in theory at the time of her death and the Montessori High Schools did not come along until recent years. There is a high school in TX where the students live on the farm for a week out of every 2 months, but that is rare. What Montessori really offers at this level are several things. You will want to look at the particular school you're interested in (I am not familiar with that one) and see how well it does with these: --A strong connection to the community. Community service is a big thing in Montessori Junior and Senior High Schools. The one in Cincinnati has their students have a certain amount of community service hours. --A realization that the physical well-being cannot be separate from the mental well-being. It is just as important to find time for physical activities as it is to find time to study science. Also important is a time of reflection, which most people do not realize they need at this age until they're provided with it. Montessori incorporates these as well. --A more integrated curriculum. Most school curriculums tend to be sectioned off into 45 minute periods. You have x amount of time to study a subject, then you forget about that subject for an hour while you're studying something else. Montessori is not like this. It integrates their curriculum so that everything is tied together. A history report will likely include many other subjects as well. I have a Montessori Life magazine at home that features the High Schools. I will take a look later when I get home. I read an article this morning about different Montessori High Schools, but I didn't read it carefully and it has been several hours so I do not remember many exact details.

	63722 : ["Charter schools are schools that are in the public school system, but are released from some of the requirements as long as they can show progress in other ways as agreed upon in their charter.  A private school is a school that is funded mainly through tuition and the accountability is to the customers (parents and students) to provide a quality education; not to the state.  Non-religious simply means it does not teach or promote a certain religion. The main difference between those two is where the funding comes from and to whom they are accountable.  Charter schools receive money from the school district, are accountable to them, and cannot charge tuition for K-12 (many do charge tuition for preschool).  Private schools charge tuition to the parents (or even receive grant money), are accountable mainly to the parents, and are not funded by the school district. A Montessori school can either be a private school or a public school.  It can also be a religious school or non-religious school.  Montessori is a system of education developed by Maria Montessori during the 20th Century.  A Montessori classroom is more like a learning environment than it is a set of desks.
