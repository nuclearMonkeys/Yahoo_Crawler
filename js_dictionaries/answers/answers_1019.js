Also, I wash my hands so many times a day (before making bottles/food, after feeding Lukas, after nappies, after toilet etc etc) that I accidentally squirted hand soap on my toothbrush one night.  We also have one of those movement sensor baby monitors in Lukas' cot... if we ever forget to turn it off when we get him up, it goes off 20 seconds later (just as you get to the bottom of the stairs)... I got myself out of bed the other day and went halfway downstairs then ran back up to turn the monitor off... only to realise duh, I don't actually have a movement sensor on my own bed to alarm myself if I stop breathing... sigh.", 7904, "2F5HNPqPaa", 2],

Now there is another way it could be installed. The jack for the voip on the cable modem could be going into the wall, and that is feeding the rest of your house.  I do this, so I can put the phone anywhere.  Your original phone in must be shunted at the feed to prevent someone cross connecting a real land line.

It would possibly take awhile for her to get used to it, however in case you use the title more commonly, she'll finally appreciate it and reply to it.

Slipknot fans think they are listening to the most death metal music out there, only to be mistaken when they actually find other bands. I'm a Tool fan myself, but some of the fans of Tool, as you said, over analyse their music. Radiohead fans do take their music too seriously and there seems to be so many of them out there. The band Porcupine Tree are a million times better than Radiohead and if you havent heard of them check them out now! But at the end of the day Slipknot fans are the most annoying", 7903, "None", 1],

You might check out mutual funds, they are good investment a safe investment and depending on the fund you might be able to turn over a decent return in the mid term.

You know what would happen if MM never had his image? We wouldn't even be having this discussion. He would be a nobody. That shows that Slayer fans have better taste in music, at least.
