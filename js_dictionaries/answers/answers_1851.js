	98303 : ["Hey losing weight and fixing your image by dressing better and taking care of yourself helps alot trust me. First of all start eating 6 small meals a day it will help keep your metabolism high. Also first thing you should do in the morning is start running running becaus ethe first hour we are awake our body doesnt need any food and we will burn direct fat. A few hours later to keep your metabolism elevated do light lifting since you are a girl to tone your muscles. When you run your metabolism remains elevated for a few hours when you lift it remains elevated for 48 hours catch my drift. and immediatly after lifting for 40 minutes or less run for another 4o minutes because the lifting depeleted your glycogen. Drink lots of water preferably ice cold because are bodies need to warm it down to use it and that burns 11 calories per a glass. WOrst mistake isstarving yourself or getting your body in the habit of very little alories it damages your metabolism. trust em i lost 120 pounds years ago. 20 mins after your workout take some preotein and carbs. When reducing calories eat dairy 3 times a day eat fish peanuts or avocado the saturated fats will burn more fat due to the calorie deficit. I used to eat 3 meals of special K exactly 1 cup per a meal and half a cup of skim milk. Eat fruit for the fourth meal. Kep your breakfast as the heaviest meal and your lunch as second heaviest. When you are sitting queeze and flex your muscles holding it for 30 seconds and repeat.  When lifting do 4 ightweight workouts 3 sets at 12 reps your a irl use very light weight. Do bench press, and squats, and deadlifts it will strenghten your core and give you a nice stomach.

I would be cautious if you had been around her at all with in the past days leading up to her illness or until she has been given the \"all clear\"! You certainly do not want the Shingles! Hope you do not get them! Usually people do not have them again until later in life, but it is not uncommon if exposed, if your immune system is slightly compromised or under stress.

They close off the vents that let fresh air into the car from the base of the windshield. Air Recirculation should be combined with A/C usage, which is why on some cars (older domestic US cars in particular) it's labled Max A/C. Air Recirc setting helps the air conditioner system by recirculating already cooler air through the system, rather then trying to take warmer outside air and cool it down. You can use it with heat, but on some cars (older Japanese and German cars in the US) they aren't set-up to run the A/C compressor in defrost mode. Any moisture at all will cause your windows to fog, ALL OF THEM, unless you also turn on the A/C button too. A/C doesn't really cost much more then 1 mpg on most cars.

It is the tummy that seems to have a mind of its own. Well I will tell you a sure shot method to reduce the flab around the waist line. Mind you this doesn't hold true for post pregnancy tummies. This is what you have to do. Breathe in air as strongly as you can and as you do so, tuck in your tummy as much as you can. Hold it like this for a few seconds and then slowly release your breath taking care not to let out your tummy. Try to keep breathing like this at least fifty or sixty times in a day. In fact breathe like this whenever you can remember to do so. After the first day, you should feel the muscles of your stomach tightening each time you do this. Then you know that you are on the right track. If you practice this without fail for 20 days, at the end of the twentieth day, you will have lost at least an inch.", 9646, "None", 0],

	98322 : ["The company widely considered to be the source for the infected spinach, Natural Selections, has stated that all packaged spinach has been of the non-organic variety. However, an FDA spokesperson has specifically stated that the FDA hasn't cleared any products.  The first article below doesn't say so, but I assume the lack of organic spinach being cited by victims of the outbreak could be more easily attributed to the fact that less people BUY the organic variety. If it does turn out that the source spinach is not grown organically, it seems that ground water contamination is a more likely source than manure from infected animals... but that's only if the non-organic variety is grown using artificial fertilizer. According to the second article, from the Christian Science Monitor, the source could even be feces from birds who ate infected animal feces. But that seems a little far fetched considering the widespread nature of this outbreak. As far as possible solutions, it seems increased monitoring of groundwater sources would be needed, probably by the FDA. This article likens the current situation to that in the 1990's, when the FDA was given more power to regulate the beef industry after a series of outbreaks of E. coli were linked to ground beef.", 9655, "AA10729814", 0],
	98323 : ["Most likely it's because the water used to irrragate the crops was contaminated.  That's usually the culprit.  When the contamination is in meat, it's usually caused by poor techinques in butchering that result in intestinal contents being spilled over the flesh.   Factory farming is a leading cause of groundwater contamination, as is poor sewage systems in cities.  In some cases, its just natural, and one of the risks of life.   Also note that E. coli is normally harmless, but one variant HO157 can be dangerous.  It is important as an indicator organism, when you find it, it means there's probably fecal contamination, which has a long list of possible bacterial, fungal, and parasitic problems.", 9655, "AA10697902", 0],
