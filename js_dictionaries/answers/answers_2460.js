	128858 : ["OK. The answer is: you don't \"add a header\". Assuming you are asking about Yahoo webmail since you ask this in Yahoo Answers, what you do is ATTACH a file TO the email. In the email \"compose\" screen, there is a button to ATTACH a file. Click on it and it opens a menu to choose the file from where it is stored on disk. Email is mostly TEXT only. Attachments can be anything you please so long as it is a file. I suggest you get an \"archive\" program. An archiver compresses files. An archive can contain more than one file just like a file cabinet, so not only do the files take less space, you can group several into one container. The most popular is WINZIP which makes ZIP format archives. Next most popular is WINRAR which makes RAR type archives. However, these two are commercial programs which cost money. A better solution that can do all that WINRAR and WINZIP do is 7-ZIP, which is absolutely FREE. Go to: and enter \"7-ZIP\" in the search box for keywords. These sites have a wealth of free and shareware programs to do most anything you want to do. Send a copy of 7-ZIP along with the archive to whoever as they will need 7-ZIP to extract your compressed file back to full size so they can use the file as intended. Compression is for storage. Compressed files can not be used while still compressed. One last thing, Yahoo webmail imposes a limit of 10mb total. 7-ZIP can \"split\" a large file into several pieces. Just tell 7-ZIP the maximum size for each file. Then, you simply attach the pieces to a separate email. Again, the recipient will need a copy of 7-ZIP to reassemble the parts and extract the contents. The original purpose for splitting an archive was to store it on floppy disks. Now, you can do the same thing with burning really huge files over several CD's or even DVD's. Instead of sending emails, why not \"share\" the file via the web? There are free file sharing sites where you upload a file, they give you a link, and you send the link to a friend, and then they use the link to download the fle. I use: The max file size is 50mb and it was kept for 30 days. They used to have a \"free upgrade\" to a premium account which means your uploaded file does not expire after 30 days and the size limit was upped to 100mb. A few more uploading/sharing sites are: Do a web search and you will find dozens. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Most that are free limit file sizes to 50 or 100 mb and keep files for a limited amount of time, and also may limit bandwidth for people who download.", 11005, "5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa", 1],
