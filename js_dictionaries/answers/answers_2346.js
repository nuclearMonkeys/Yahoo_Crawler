	123125 : ["If you feel like you deserve a pay raise then you should definitely ask. If you have a solid work ethic and the training to back it up then why not ask? The worst that can happen is that you receive a \"NO\" and are offered what you were previously making. A lot of businesses perform quarterly or 6 month reviews along with pay adjustments because a lot can change in only a few months, so being away for 7 months is a big window. Within 7 months you have welcomed a new life into the world, co-workers have left, and a competitor has popped up. With a new mouth to feed, your priority lays with your family and who gives you the most in exchange for your time AWAY from them. You have to be vocal in the fact that because of changes in personal priorities and needs that you are seeking new opportunities with higher pay. When you are asking for the actual raise start by highlighting the reasons that you are even considering coming back. There is something that is keeping you there or else you would have already jumped ship... whether it be the history you have, connection to the families, location of facilities, or respect for the owner - build up their ego first and sell the reasons why you have had a mutually beneficial work relationship before your leave. Let them know that you would love to come back because of \"this\" and \"that\" but that you would leave for an opportunity that offered you what you were looking for.  I wouldn't mention that you are leaving for the competition because that automatically pours salt in the wound and puts the owner on the defensive. Whether you work for the competition or make a career change with the traveling circus, the threat is that YOU are very open to other opportunities that offer more. I'm sure that the manager already has the competition in mind without you mentioning it. Definitely speak truthfully if the manager asks you directly about working for the competition, but don't be the one to bring it up.  As the business landscape changes, managers and owners need to adapt their competitive strategy. Not just in sales, enrolling new clients, or managing budgets, but also in attracting the BEST TALENT for their workforce.  This is an opportunity for the owner to adapt and compete. You should definitely ask- the worst that happens is that you are only offered what was previously offered before. It will be up to you to decide whether or not you accept. Another thing that might help is to really know specifically what you want, instead of just saying \"I want a raise\" - know what that figure is. If what you suggest is too high for the manager they may think about it then get back to you, or counter you on the spot. The key is communication from both sides. Since September is still some months away and you can never tell what might happen between now and then, you may take the job right now for security. Even if you go back at the same pay because that's all the owner offered... just having the discussion about the raise gets it off your chest and it will definitely stick in the mind of the owner who may revisit the issue with you later.

	123136 : ["* In days gone past, they used to advise forcible retraction for intact boys, and made the claim that you need to pull it back and wash underneath there. that lead to life-long infection problems for a lot of intact men as well as problems with phimosis and adhesions. * Circumcised penises harbor more invasive and infectious bacteria on their glans's, while intact men have more of the bacteria which help us keep healthy and ward off infections. Just as in our guts, genitals do require a balance of good and healthy bacteria and pH levels. * In case you haven't noticed, the US is the only developed western country where circumcision is common. And the US has the highest rates of HIV, infections, UTI's, yeast infections and STI's etc. * Circumcision reduces UTI's in the first year of life, but is nowhere near as effective as breastfeeding. Later in life, during boyhood, teenagehood and adulthood recurring UTI's are far more common in circumcised men due to the fact that the foreskin helps protect against UTI's. In countries outside the US where no-one would ever consider pulling back the foreskin on a baby (it's fused and shouldn't ever be separated ahead of it happening naturally) there's no increased risk of a baby boy having UTI's. * In terms of sensitivity, removing the 8 most sensitive structures of the penis is major harm. As a woman I am very attached to my clitoris and would be horrified if someone told me to cut it off, along with the labia minora and clitoral prepuce so I'd be \"cleaner\" and have no more smegma building up around my clitoris and in the labia. If I was a guy I'd be very attached to my ridged band, no doubt. If I was told to remove the clitoris and labia and clitoral prepuce (hood) and it wouldn't change a thing because I'd still be able to have sex and orgasm and still be functioning, but I'd give up sensitivity but gain a lot more cleanliness I'd slap that person silly. That's the way a lot of guys feel about their ridged band, frenulum, outer mucosa, foreskin lips, inner mucosa, the structure responsible for movement and gliding, and which helps with lubrication and prevents the corona from flaring (ie mushroom head - devastating for sex) and the glans from drying. * Statistically there's no difference between the rates of penile cancer in intact men or circumcised men. However, even when they thought there was a benefit, they did say it was slight. How slight? Going by the OFFICIAL circumcision death rate (and it's not required to report circumcision as being a cause of death in babies) 90 babies would have to die to save one elderly man from penile cancer. That's how rare penile cancer is. But then they found out that there's actually no difference, and that cut men are just as susceptible. Cut or intact, hygiene is necessary. Talking to a lot of people you'd think a cut man never had to wash. * Cut men suffer twice the rates of urethritis, which is known to be a risk factor in the development of other infections, such as STI's and HPV infections. That's just one reason circumcised men suffer more STI infections in their lifetime and why in Australia it was found that after we'd stopped circumcising the rates of cervical cancer in women was halved, even before the introduction of screening and women having regular pap-smears. * Cut men are very likely to suffer meteal stenosis, which is essentially an ulcer of the urethra. 30% of all men have their peehole a different and enlargened shape to what it should be. This is caused by urine reabsorption. * Foreskin contains antibacterials, antivirals and antifungals. As far as disease transmission goes, when the infection load is not too high the foreskin can fight it off and prevent infection. That's only slight protection, but during the asymptomatic incubation period of infection it can be significant. But condoms are still much safer. * In developed countries there's almost a perfectly linear correlation between circumcision and HIV. The higher the circumcision rate, the higher the rate of HIV. It's been found that Langheran's Cells trap viruses, bacteria and fungi where they are destroyed by lysozymes.  * 10 out of 15 countries where the African circumcision programs are currently being run have higher rates of HIV among circumcised men than intact men, and more than one study has found that circumcision drastically increases the transmission rate to partners.  * The actual procedure. It's horrific and painful.", 10740, "None", 3],

	123140 : ["Yahoo! Answers is definitely a great place to spend your time on. When I first started answering question (which was about 1 year and 4 months ago), I never thought that this would become so addicting, so much that I log in to Y!A daily. I see Y!A as a site where I can ask for opinions or help with anything. I agree that this (Y!A) is a unique knowledge-sharing forum. Most of my contacts are very experienced in their respective fields, which is why I chose to connect to them (geniuses). I agree with Dr D that one of the plus points about Y!A is the wonderful network that we build here. My contacts, I believe, do not care about points and there is no way they would ever leave Y!A if the point system was scrapped. All that matters is that as long as they can keep their brains active, and at the same time, help others with any problems, eg, Mathematical problems, they would be contented. Of course there are those who are points-crazy. I have come across one TC who would always leave insulting comments if his answers were not chosen as the best. There are also a few who create multiple accounts so as to gain high percentage of BA. I have witnessed one TC who would ask questions from his other accounts so that he could be the first answerer to the question (using his main account). How did I notice this? Of course, isn't it impossible to type out lengthy solutions in such a short time (of approximately 2 minutes) after the question was posted? Sadly, I reported this to YAT, however no action was taken. Another unique reward is the joy that you get when you answer questions posted by someone else. Of course, being a student, I do not claim that I am a genius and that my answers are all correct or helpful, but I always try my best to help others with the problems or questions they have and share with everyone what I know when it comes to answering questions (mostly Math). I apologize if sometimes there were errors in my answers. Well, we human err.

My boyfriend wanted to do anything he could to help me but as much as I wish his words would make it all go away, it doesn't. It was something I had to deal with on my own accord. In time I did, and unfortunately we broke up and moved out of our shared house. I too would not leave my house and some days my bed. I wouldn't eat I couldn't sleep I was a wreck. Eventually after almost a year I gradually got better. I eventually reconciled my relationship and we are living together again and very happy and I am happy.
