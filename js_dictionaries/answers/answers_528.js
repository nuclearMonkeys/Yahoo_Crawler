When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 4551, "None", 0],

There is nothing that kills the mood more than being interrupted. Hence, if asking your parents means that you will be guaranteed privacy then I would do it! Also be sure to use condoms, even if you are both virgins. Take it slowly, lots and lots of petting and kissing and touching, foreplay is so important the first time because you will be scared and nervous.Lots of foreplay will turn you on physically and your body will respond. You need to be aroused before your bf tries to enter you or it will really hurt. Be sure your boyfriend uses a lubricant with the condom as this will help. Take it slowly when he enters you and it might be a good idea if he masturbates before you start so he won't be \"ready to explode\". Keep up the touching, kissing and loving talk while he slooooowly pushes into you. you on your back with knees pulled up a bit will probably be the most comfortable position.The first time it rarely good, but it is different for everyone. Some girls bleed, some don't, some just a spot, so be prepared with tissues or something. Be sure your bf holds the condom in place when he pulls out because you can get pregnant if it comes off.Talk these things through with your boyfriend. Don't have any drugs or alcohol before as this can affect your judgement. Be sure your bf knows you can tell him to stop at any time and you must trust that he will stop if you say so. ", 4561, "None", 2],
