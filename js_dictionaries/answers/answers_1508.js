We can look up that 0.0338 ounces = 1 ml anywhere on the internet That means 0.0338 ounces/1 ml = 1 and also 1 ml/0.0338 ounces = 1.  Since both values are equal, dividing one value by the other will always = 1.  So we have created two conversion factors, but which one do we multiply by 30 ml to get our answer???  Since our question is in ml, we need to multiply by the conversion factor with ml on the bottom so the ml's cancel out, so 30 ml = 30 ml * 1 = 30 ml * 0.0338 ounces/1 ml = 1.014 ounces or about 1 ounce (notice how the ml cancelled out top & bottom!)", 9053, "VcQydSheaa", 0],
