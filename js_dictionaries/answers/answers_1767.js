There is so much pressure for kids to do well on the test because if not the school looses funding and gets put on the watch list. Teachers are not incorporating concepts into a lesson but rather teaching to the test.", 9497, "AA10494763", 2],
	94057 : ["In theory, I agree with you.  In reality, though, each public school teacher can not have the freedom they should be afforded because those students will move on next year, and there has to be some sort of standard in place when dealing with the masses. Most of what you mentioned is what led us to homeschool our children.  There is no room for individuality in the public schools-you fit into the cookie cutter mold or you are either going to get left behind or held back.  Unfortunately, it takes both extremes to get the average that the classes are taught to, so there are many students that are not working at their full potential or are being moved along before they are ready. I think that most teachers try to do the best they can with what they have to work with, they are just extremely limited in what they can do.  It is sad.", 9497, "aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa", -1],
	94058 : ["You can thank the no child left behind act. Which incidently I am 100% for.  Kids are skating through school without learning a thing.  Teachers are frustrated they have to teach in a certain time period because the students will then be tested on the material. These days kids have to be on top of their game.  Kids are a lot smarter than we give them credit for, children in other countries are much more intelligent than those in the US. Why?  Lack of funding for proper teaching and materials. Teacher who are tenured in, and it make no difference to them if the kid passes or fails, the pay is still the same, and lack of parental support. We cannot just send our kids to school with the attitude of it is the teachers job solely to teach the student.  I love all of my children's teachers. And my children do excellent in the public school system. We have an open line of communication. The teachers need to be help accountable, a few years ago statics said 75% of the people 18 years or age or older in NY state were illiterate.  Who's fault would that be-50% parents 50% teachers who improperly teach.", 9497, "hKJIDdVqaa", -2],

	94075 : ["Sorry, but I find that funny! lol  If mom ain't happy, kids just might find a way to tune her out and find somewhere else to be for a while. lol  In some ways, if a woman isn't happy, others will know it... but... really... like anything else.. it may not be such a big deal to those around because they're off in their own worlds, not really \"into\" the moment. If the man ain't happy, many surely will know...depending on how he handles it.. same for the woman.  I think... sometimes... the mood is set and THEN mom isn't happy! lol EDIT: one person may make others miserable with the unhappiness, but ya know... I am not responsible for always making sure everyone is happy. Sometimes, people need to do that for themselves or maybe even think about WHY mom or the woman isn't happy. Woman is part of a team, not the sole worker at any part of a relationship or family. Everyone should be working towards setting a good mood. I find it very outdated and kind of crappy the way woman is looked at on many things. Even being happy doesn't mean everyone else will be. Me again.... I do get what you're saying, but it's not just a \"mom thing\". Once had the nastiest, meanest man who wouldn't allow anyone else to be happy. It's an individual person thing... and sometimes... ANYONE can kill a good mood that was set. It's a disposition, character, trait thing that others can't change.", 9499, "T9xbywGPaa", 2],
	94076 : ["Indeed, you are right, not only bible does say this, but other religions and culture, for example the traditional chinese believe that woman of the house determine the \"luck\" or blessing of the family. Her allegiance for example, if the wife committed adultery (whether or not she was caught red handed, as long as she betrayed her husband), then the family is doomed to collapse in everything including financial. And, so the other way round of blessings too, if she is obedient. Shalom,", 9499, "uy1TDaZMaa", 1],
	94077 : ["I agree. I work at a K-12 school teaching ages 12-17, and luckily for me, I teach a subject (music and now dance) that I have a lot of flexibility with.  But I know many of the teachers have set topics they have to cover, and they can't stray from them. Even if what they are teaching is outdated, or is not beneficial to the students at all. Even if the class they have is too advanced for the work, or not advanced enough. It's ridiculous and I do believe the childrens education is suffering because of it. I think creativity is SO important, especially when it comes to teaching. For example, last year one of my classes got to talking about the impact some songs have, and songs that are controversial. They inspired me to come up with a unit of work on \"protest music\". It was something the majority of them found interesting and educational-they were learning new things, and at the same time getting to express their opinions on matters like sex, war, drugs, politics. They got to compose and write lyrics for their own protest songs, and select 3 they wanted to answer a series of questions on. The students who really wanted a good grade had the option to do more, while the students who just wanted to get it over and done with had the option to do the bare minimum. I was SO happy when a lot of them chose to do a lot of really great work! But my eldest (who attends the same school I work at) is sometimes stuck doing work that is below her level, and completely bores her. She even asked her English teacher if she could do extra work on an essay because she really wanted to dig down into the real motives and meanings of the book they were studying and he told her \"No, I have enough work to mark already\" and he said the same thing when she asked if she could do extra creative writing. I was SO shocked.  And yes I do think that the quality of teachers has been drastically lowered. Why would anyone choose to teach? I mean it's a crap paying job, that is very stressful, VERY time consuming, LOT'S of hard work, and on top of that, having to teach subject matter that has no point. As teachers we don't just have to deal with these kids educations, we have to deal with behavioural issues, medical prolems, emotional issues, and very difficult, and sometimes heartbreaking situations. I don't teach for any finanical reason, the only reason I do it at all is because I enjoy (most of) it, and it's very rewarding. Some of those kids are like family to me. Maybe if teachers were given more flexibility and options, plus better conditions and a drastic pay rise our childrens educations would be greatly improved.", 9497, "kSZx9cY5aa", 3],
	94078 : ["It's probably related to the current societal trends of suing whenever things go wrong.   If teachers are required to follow a bland, sterile, but consistent lesson plan, that is backed up by research showing that it is the best for teaching a group of children -and- that teacher is not allowed to inject her own personal feelings & judgment about individual children into the lesson plan, then the school board is less likely to be sued - less likely to be accused of preferential or prejudicial treatment of students.", 9497, "0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa", 2],
	94079 : ["Probably for the same reason our system cannot properly weed out the elementary school teachers they hire that have a criminal background, or are capable of abusing or molesting our children.   Probably the same reason teachers are not permitted to punish a child that misbehaves in their classroom and have parents that are willing to sue the teacher and school system for nearly anything they perceive as unfair to their child.  Probably for the same reason a teacher cannot lead their class in prayer.  There must be guidelines to protect both the child and teachers.  Unfortunately the system is NOT perfect and has many flaws on both sides.  Until parents, teachers, and administrators work together it will only continue.  The number of caring, concerned, and conscientious teachers is nearly as small as the number of abusive, sexually deviant, and criminal teachers.  The majority just go to work everyday to bring home a paycheck, they really don't care anymore.  And it is evident.", 9497, "AA12107238", 0],
