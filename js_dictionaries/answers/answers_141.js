	7056 : ["The claim that humans interbred with Neanderthals is not proven by irrefutable evidence in the form of either Mitochondrial DNA or Y-Chromosome DNA evidence. Not a single modern human has ever been found with either Neanderthal Y chromosome or mitochondrial DNA. Not one. That means the DNA that is supposedly shared between some modern humans and Neanderthals may well be the result of contamination of Neanderthal remains by modern humans, or it may be incomplete lineage sorting.  Incomplete lineage sorting means that some genes shared by Neanderthals and Europeans may have been lost in, say, Africans. Although the chimp and gorilla are more closely related to humans, there are some genes that humans share with orangutans that are not found in chimps and gorillas. Those are ancient genes that have been lost through evolution in chimps and gorillas, but they are retained by orangutans and humans. It does not mean that humans interbred with orangutans or that humans are more closely related to orangutans than to chimps and gorillas. Until mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome DNA of Neanderthals have been discovered in some modern humans, it is a leap to claim that there was interbreeding. ", 1141, "None", 0],

Neanderthals are a different species than modern humans and we last shared an ancestor with Neanderthals about 500,000 years ago.. To this date, despite claims that Neanderthals and modern humans interbred, there is no solid, irrefutable evidence in the form of either mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosomes to prove that modern humans actually did interbreed with Neanderthals. No modern human as ever been found with a Neanderthal Y chromosome or Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA> Similarly, there is no evidence that Homo erectus (our direct ancestor and Java Man and Peking Man fossils) interbred with modern humans either.

Civil wars such as the industrial north fighting the agricultural south over slavery in the USA, communists fight against capitalists in China, or Muslims fighting against the government in Iran, are not race wars.x Tribal wars may happen between African tribes and wars in the Balkans are similar. I do not remember any war being waged because one race tried to eliminate another race. It is probably because such wars do not accomplish anything economically. Even when American whites waged war against native Americans, race was not the motivating factor. The reason for genocide was territory.
