JUST BECAUSE A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE OF LACK OF HEALTH CARE OR GO BROKE EVERY YEAR DOESN'T MEAN THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HELP YOU STUPID AND USELESS PROLETARIAT'S!!!! Actually, I'm pretty liberal. I think the Republicans are pretty good at contradicting themselves. \"Yeah, I understand that everyone needs car insurance! It's for our safety. OH NO!!! NATIONAL HEALTH CARE!! COMMUNISM!!! SOCIALISM!!!\" The thing is... every other country industrialized country in the world has universal healthcare. Why would the United States have a worse health care system than Cuba? Because the American people are afraid of change.  Wow... I feel that I'm gonna get a lot of hate from conservatives", 9125, "fs6rHgXyaa", 0],

	83018 : ["While Obama's winning the majority of the votes in overwhelmingly white states suggests that many Americans are ready to move beyond race, it is painfully clear that others are not. Among the people who are likely to be most disappointed with the Obama administration are those who thought it would usher in a post-racial society. That they wished for such a society is a credit to their values. But that they actually expected a move in that direction suggests that they ignored both Barack Obama's history and the heavy vested interest that too many people have in race hustling. This is just one of many areas in which this country is likely to pay a very high price for the fact that too many voters paid attention to Obama's rhetoric while ignoring his actual track record. However soothing the Obama rhetoric, and however lofty his statements about being a uniter rather than a divider — both racially and in terms of bipartisanship — everything in his past fairly shouts the opposite, but only to those who follow facts. Has he been allied with uniters or dividers in the past? Do Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayers and Father Pfleger sound like uniters? What has his administration done — as distinguished from what the president has said — since taking office? It has dropped the prosecution of black thugs caught on camera stationed outside a polling place intimidating voters. Obama has promoted to the Supreme Court a circuit judge who dismissed a discrimination lawsuit by white firefighters, whose case the Supreme Court later accepted and ruled in their favor. He preceded this appointment by talking about needing people on the court with \"empathy.\" That is a pretty word but the ugly reality is that it is just another euphemism for bias. For generations, white Southern judges had all kinds of empathy for other white Southerners, which is to say, bias against blacks. The question is whether you want equal treatment or you want payback. Cycles of revenge and counter-revenge have been at the heart of racial and ethnic strife throughout history, in countries around the world. It is a history written in blood. It is history we don't need to repeat in the United States of America.  o_O", 9118, "yQ0OzEbZaa", -4],
	83019 : ["You are quoting a man that called his white grandmother \"a typical white person\".? And jumped to the defense of Prof Gates, even though he first admitted that he did not know the entire story?  And sent special government investigators to work on a case where a black kid was killed on the street in Chicago? And has increased welfare, food stamps and housing for inner city blacks.

	83020 : ["I understand that you are a supporter of Ron Paul but the bottom line is that he isn't very good at generating news. I have been a supporter of Ron Paul and I am very happy to say that he is a fellow Texan. If you have followed the poles then you already know that he isn't generating a lot of interest in him. I understand that he was on the ballet in some places but so were a number of others that did not garner a majority of the votes. I already know that you are not pleased with my answer as it does not agree with you but I am the guy that you need to appeal to I am an Independent and I have voted GOP for the last 40 years but not this year. I like Ron Paul as a person, and I agree with some of his positions. I just don't agree with all of his positions", 9115, "Zb9KtIYAaa", 0],
	83021 : ["The media helps the status quo, wherein political specific pastimes are maintained. Ron Paul caters to no specific pastimes, in simple terms man or woman liberties as defined by utilising the U.S. shape. If Ron Paul have been elected president, he might start to dismantle the present political gadget, giving lots back to us all as persons, yet disempowering people who've trusted the instant device. no person loves to provide up power - so the media treats him like a leper. I believe you - the media's reaction to him is truly a reason to take a closer look at him. I recommend going to Ron Paul's internet site - you will possibly no longer disagree with him on as many themes as you think of.", 9115, "UxzltE0Maa", 0],

There was a bigger chance of 5/6s of the worlds population to catch cholera and die than Ron Paul getting elected President. I know you dont like it. But its reality. Get over it.

	83026 : ["Obama was simply too nice... he wanted a bipartisan bill, and it got watered down to the point where it's completely useless. If he'd been tougher on the blue dogs, it would have been passed by now, and he wouldn't lks weak as he does. Bush always managed to get his bills ramed through. Now that the Congress has handed over control of the nation's health to Big Business, there is an open road for corporate takeover of another necessity- the food supply. There are seven corporatios that control a very large chunk of the US food supply - and they're going for more. The Republicans will be more than happy to let them do that, just like they've handed over control of health in the country.  Be afraid - be very afraid.", 9121, "EYjDmwFVaa", 1],
	83027 : ["sure, and the Blue dogs and equipment of the insurance market like Lieberman. with the intention to get previous a Republican filibuster each and each and every between the 60 Democratic and self reliant votes contained in the Senate has to count number. The concessions and bargains have watered down the Senate wellbeing care reform bill a approaches too a lot. Democrats might want to bypass to reconciliation, bypass as a lot as they could of wellbeing care reform utilising that approach and use supplemental law to fill interior something else.

	83028 : ["Yes, but it is abundantly clear that the Republicans are a monolithic, obstructionist, useless bloc that are determined to oppose everything President Obama tries to do. The Republicans are also of course threatening a filibuster.  That is why every single one of the 60 Democratic and Independent votes is needed in the Senate.  As a result, the bill has been watered down to meet the demands of conservative Democrats and insurance industry servants like Lieberman. The Democrats should forget about the Republicans and their threatened filibusters, forget about the Blue Dogs, ignore their super-majority and go to reconciliation.  Republicans have used that method in the past and it worked for them.", 9121, "t3QAaSN9aa", 4],
