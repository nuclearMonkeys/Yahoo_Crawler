But guess what, she did, right before my eyes.  I cried more than her when it happened. It must have happened to every mother.  Please don't feel so bad.  I'm sure every baby has fallen off the bed at some point.  You must be so exhausted from waking up at night, and taking care of baby all day.  You're not a bad mom.  You're a very good mom, who needs a little more understanding from hubby. He's probably upset that the baby fell, and he needs to take it out on someone.  I'm sure when he calms down he'll understand that it wasn't your fault.  If he doesn't, then try to explain to him.  Tell him that babies are so unpredictable, and quick.  That they can fall right before your eyes if you don't have your hands on them the whole time.  That you're sleep deprived and your reflexes not as good right now.  That you already feel horrible, and it would be nice to hear from him that it's okay, and not to feel bad.  That babies don't get hurt that easily, and you'd probably hurt yourself more if you fell of the bed.  That you need some help with the baby once in a while, and that this happens to all moms, and all babies.  If you think it may help, show him your answers. Good luck, and hang in there mommy.", 10116, "WLdeJwbraa", 5],
	110082 : ["Okay, every parent has experienced what happened to you!  First, you are probably a little tired taking care of the baby alone!  My first son rolled off the couch at 3 1/2 mos. while I went to make a bottle.  I remember because I was traumatized, as you are.  It happens, and you are not a bad mom at all.  Seems as though your little guy is the center of your world!  I am sure your son is physically and mentally fine.  After my first one, I did not make that same mistake again.  Though my little girl (also 6 mos. and does not roll) flipped herself out of her swing!!!  How, I have no idea, but lesson learned.   Your husband should have been a support to you!  You care for his most precious cargo!  He also should be an active dad.  I noticed when writing about your son, that hubby was not mentioned.  No one is 100% perfect, and he is not justified in being angry with you.  You will both make mistakes; it is inevitable in any situation, but as long as knowledge is gained than it is purposeful.  You two have to come together as a team, or your little guy will surely use this situation to his advantage as he grows.  I am assuming that dad is not home much due to work.  Sometimes the \"working\" parent feels that they should not have to help with the mundane parts of taking care of the children, home, and all that needs to be done.  This feeling evolves from the sense of they are the \"bread\" winners, so to speak.   Success is when you feel like you are team.  The money one parent brings into the home is just as much the other parents.  The responsibilities should be shared, by BOTH parents.   Though sometimes the money making parent, does not see the other side. Here is a great way to show your daily, weekly, monthly value.  Take down what you do for a week, as far as work goes.  Write all the things out, with how many hours you do each on average.  Take only minimum wage and add up how much it would cost to hire someone to do the \"job\" you do.  Remember, late nights are overtime, and over 40 hours is overtime.  Now this would be if you could actually hire someone for minimum wage to do all these things.  Than show it to your husband, and his appreciation should grow a bit! Sorry the Psych. is comimg out of me.  I am a bad speller sorry!", 10116, "6WwRtiAQaa", 1],

It is never too late, but always remember, God has his set time for Armageddon and we should ALL be \"Living with Jehovah's Day in Mind\"... we need to keep it on our minds at all times. Remember when King David lusted after Bathsheba and had her husband murdered then made it look like he was killed in the line of duty (war)? Well, even Jehovah God forgave him later when he repented... that is because Jehovah God loves us. ONLY JEHOVAH is the true reader of hearts. James 1: 12 - 15 Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, which Jehovah promised to those who continue loving him. When under trial, let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.  2 Peter 3: 8 - 10 \"However, let this one fact not be escaping YOUR notice, beloved ones, that one day is with GOD as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. GOD is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with YOU because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet GOD'S day will come as a thief...\" Stay close to the kingdom hall, and to your congregation and watch your associations.  1 Corinthians 15: 33 Do not be misled; bad associations spoil useful habits. Hope this has helped. (My son didn't listen and screwed his life up... now he's looking for someone to blame. He needs look no further than his own mirror. Listen to what is good, what is from God; watch your associations because they will influence your conduct, your behavior in your life.)", 10123, "None", 0],

	110095 : ["Pangel, no matter what the holy rollers will tel you, the Bible is the work of man, NOT God.  The moment some guy took a pen and set it to paper that man's words, feeling, predjucices and thoughts came out on the paper along with the \"inspiration\". Therefore God's inspiration came through the filter of that person's own personality.  IF it WERE the \"unadulterated Word of God\" then WHY are there so many different VERSIONS of the Bible around? Why isn't just ONE version good enough for all? The Bible BECAME the work of man and not God the moment Moses broke the stone tablets which were written in God's OWN hand, when he came down from the mountain and saw the people of Israel worsipping a \"false God\" and broke the tablets. in anger. From that pont onward, everything that has been put into documentation has been NOT in the HANDWRITING of god but in the handwriting of humans. As such, it is supect at every step of the way, all the they down to the present.  It is 100% politically censured and approved by HUMANS and there isn't a single word, not even a punctuation mark that has escaped the approval of disapproval of SOME human ever since. Now, SHOW me something written in God's OWN handwriting, something that is undeniably the ACTUAL words that GOD put down on paper, parchment, skin, stone or whatever, and I'll be totaly inclined to believe it. Until it can be demonstrated then I will go to my grave KNOWING that the Bible is NOT the \"Word of God\". Therefore, YOU are 100% justified in believeing in what Jesus has taught you and ignoring the REST of the Bible, as it is NOT the word of God.
