Thus the time, place and real historical characters are all correct but the fictional characters and stories are not! There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded! There is not a single contemporary record from any source and even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death! He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record? Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death! Pilate is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter! At best he was an amalgam of those others but almost certainly never existed! Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until several hundred years after the period the story is set in!! How did the apostles write their books more than a hundred years after they would have been dead? Christianity is an invention of the Italians and that is why it came from the Holy ROMAN Catholic church! Please realize that those claims for the Old historians are worthless since they were not even born until long after everyone in the stories would have been so long dead! Josephus AD 37 – AD 100 Tacitus AD 56 – AD 120 Suetonius - 69 – 130 AD Pliny the Younger, 61 AD – 112 AD Justin Martyr (Saint Justin) AD103–165 AD Lucian - AD 120 -180 AD but he was hostile to Christianity and openly mocked it. Pamphilius AD 240-309 AD Eusebius AD 263 – 339 AD Photius AD 877 – 886 AD Thallus - But there are no actual record of him except a fragment of writing which mentions the sack of Troy [109 BC] Showing that he was clearly not alive in biblical times. Some even try to use Seneca. 4 BCE – 65 CE but as a Stoic Philosopher he opposed religion yet made not a single mention of a Jesus or Christianity! Even funnier is trying to claim Celsus AD ? – 177 AD Who said that Jesus was a Jew who'se mother was a poor Jewish girl whose husband, who was a carpenter, drove her away because of her adultery with a Roman soldier named Panthera.

It is one of those strange anomalies about the Divine Creator who is therefore both a He and a We since the Holy Spirit is effectively an extension of His being and unlike any other being in existence.  Two major events have been a poor advertisement for womankind.
