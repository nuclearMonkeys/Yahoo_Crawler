True or false; Liberals are sore losers and are like cry baby children who pout when they don't get their way? If the people wanted to listen to Liberal talk show host \"then they would\" and there would be no need for any so called fairness doctrine. The people in a free society have chosen to listen to Conservative talk radio and to watch Fox news more then any other news station like MSNBC or CNN. That's the way it works and is why Fox news ratings are so high. The left don't seem to take any issue with the fact that ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, The New York Times, The LA times and many other Liberal media outlets are all controlled by the Left who all vote for Democrats. You don't see them crying about how the fairness doctrine is needed to make the mainstream media more fair and balanced in giving a more Conservative to moderate voice. Liberals, you can take your so called fairness doctrine and you can smoke it along with the rest of your dope.", 10344, "8sYAlt0Caa", 0],

God sees us through our trials, but believe me, don't you think it hurt when Paul was taken outside the city and stoned nearly to death, or flogged three times with 40 minus one stripes? When we make a stand for Jesus, we have taken the batter's box against Satan--and he hits back. So, as God sustains us, still our only hope is in Him and a better home--Heaven.

	113347 : ["Your are looking for excuses. Astrology is ancient, made up, bigoted, unproved, belief and magical based fortune telling system. Not a science but myth and superstition. Lets say indeed you are a follower of the Bible. If you practice astrology, that is a violation of the First Commandment. No other gods, remember? Also the Hebrews in the bible did not practice astrology. It is considered an abomination. There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that uses divination, an observer of clouds, or a fortune-teller, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or one who calls to the dead. For all that do these things are an abomination to Jehovah. And because of these abominations Jehovah your God drives them out from before you. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12) The Bible says that those who are stargazers and make predictions based upon that are in error and will not be saved from judgment: \"Keep on, then, with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood. Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror. All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you. Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up. They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. Here are no coals to warm anyone; here is no fire to sit by. That is all they can do for youâ€”these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood. Each of them goes on in his error; there is not one that can save you. (Isaiah 47:12-15) In ancient times, astrology had a function. Not now. Edit: I apologize. Only the believers are allowed to cherry pick who can say what and which bible passages to quote. It's an open question and answer, Yahoo makes the rules. \"If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the LORD gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God in violation of his covenant, and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars of the sky, and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death.\" (Deuteronomy 17:2-5) At least people in this day and age won't stone you.", 10338, "531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa", 0],
