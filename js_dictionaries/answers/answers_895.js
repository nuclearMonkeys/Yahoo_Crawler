The first several inches of the film that was pulled out of the canister when loading is ruined, which is normal.  If after properly loading the film you should open the film door and then close it, the camera will think a new roll of film was loaded and will attempt to advance the film. You may have just ruined the first few frames.  Don't worry about the film that was still in the canister as it's safe.  If, however, you had taken some shots or your camera pulls all the film out of the canister and rewinds it back frame by frame, then the film on the top of the take-up spool is ruined.  After development, you'd see an area of ruined (i.e. fogged) film, then a few frames where the film was okay, and then another ruined area.", 7015, "OczpbeMdaa", 3],

	49826 : ["Cameras are tools.  As with many tools, say, a hammer, there are a variety of cameras each designed for specific end users with specific needs, expectations and budgets.  Without knowing what types of photos you need or want to make, it's hard to say which one is best for you.  I mean, a Ferrari is an amazing vehicle, but if you're a pig farmer who needs to haul pig manure, you'll take a pickup truck over a Ferrari La Ferrari any day of the week. In terms of technical specifications and capabilities, the A6400 is the superior camera in many ways.  First, the A6400 has a larger APS-C sensor (crop factor of 1.6x) vs the smaller Micro 4/3 (crop factor 2x).  In order to fit 20MP into a small sensor, the pixels have got to be smaller.  The smaller the pixel, the more noise you'll get, especially at higher ISO settings.  The Sony A6400 has at least a full 1 stop advantage over the G9.  You can compare ISO performance of these 2 cameras here:  The Sony A6400 has a higher maximum ISO setting than the G9, but don't let that concern you.  Why?  Because at some point (much lower than max ISO) the image quality gets too low anyway.  It's like having a car that has a top speed of 200 MPH, but the car becomes undrivable at 100MPH. The difference in resolution is a modest 4MP (20%).  If you think you'll be doing a lot of tight cropping or larger prints, then 20% can be an important thing for you. Bokeh and blurring backgrounds is a big deal in portrait photography.  Because the G9 uses a smaller sensor with crop factor of 2x, the lenses are 1/2 the focal length compared to a full-frame cameras.  However, the depth of field produced is the same as closing down the full-frame lens by 2 stops.  In other words, a 50mm lens on the G9, for example, shot at f/2.8 produces the same angle of view at a 100mm lens on a full-frame camera shot at f/5.6.  Thus in order to get the same depth of field, you'd need to shoot at (in this example) at f/1.4.  There are lenses that will allow you to do this, however they're prime lenses.  As for the quality of bokeh, this is due to the optical design at that of the aperture, thus the camera can't have any influence on bokeh. A huge advantage for the G9 over the A6400 is that it has in-body image stabilization (IBIS) of up to 6.5 stops!  If you need to shoot hand held in low light, then this could be the main reason to go with the G9 over the A6400.  Even though the G9 has 1 stop poorer ISO performance, the 6.5 stops of IBIS completely negates that, providing your photographing something that is not moving so fast that you get motion blur.  Six and a half stops is the difference between having to shot at 6,400 (with the A6400 without a stabilized lens) and ISO 100 (lowest ISO setting) with the G9.  The image quality here is tremendous.  Yes, of course there are plenty of lenses available for the A6400 that have stabilization.  But with IBIS, ALL lenses are stabilized, even vintage manual focusing lenses from the 50s, 60s because the body is doing the stabilization and not the lens.  If you're a low-light shooter that routinely can't or don't want to use a tripod, then I'd just might go with the G9. The A6400 is a better camera for those shooting with flash.  Unlike the G9 which has  a max flash sync speed of 1/250th (which is great), the A6400 has high-speed sync allowing the use of any shutter speed just as long you're using a capable flash, too.  This can be critical for those shooting outside with a flash where the flash is used as a fill with larger apertures.  Portrait photographers will greatly benefit from this. The G9 can shoot 20 fps (83 RAW images before the buffer is full) compared to just 11fps (buffer capacity: 42 RAW images) with the A6400.  This makes the G9 a better camera for sports providing that its AF tracking is up to par with the A6400.  If not, then having that many more fps could often been useless if you're getting an extra 10 blurry frames per second.  If you're a sports shooter, I would STRONGLY recommend a DSLR instead of one of these two bodies.  Or, go with a higher-end mirrorless like a Canon R6 or Sony A9.  The Sony A6400 has gotten pretty good reviews regarding its AF tracking capabilities compared to older Axxx models.  I just don't know how well it compares to the G9. I would read the reviews of these two cameras at imaging-resource.com.  IR goes into detail about the real-life shooting performance of these two cameras.  This is something a spec sheet like this one:   can't show. Don't forget to look at the various lenses native and adaptable lenses available for these two models.  You may find that one has the ability to use a specific lens that you want/need to use that the other body does not.  Adapting lenses with the G9 can be more advantageous if you use the $300+ Metabones Speed Booster.  This narrows the image circle down to M43 thereby increasing the illumination by a full stop.  Thus, an f/2.8 lens, for example, becomes an f/2 (note that the depth of field doesn't change, just the illumination).  Downside is that at around $300 USD, the MB SB adapters are expensive.", 7004, "OczpbeMdaa", 3],

If your camera has an exposure compensation setting that's going to be +2.  If it doesn't but has manual mode then use A two stop slower shutter speed, or a two stop wider aperture or one of each.  Then check your results on the EVF or a shaded LCD and fine tune your adjustments. Bias towards too much exposure (not overexposure though) and shoot in RAW if available and you can then fine tune the exposure afterwards.  Bear in mind that unless the turtles are very close you'll also be using either a telephoto lens or a zoom on high magnification. Either way, you'll need a shutter speed fast enough to avoid blurring from camera shake. The photo below of a Loggerhead turtle was taken by me in bright Mediterranean sunlight at 2:26pm in the afternoon, at Argostoli, on the Greek island of Kefalonia. I used a 200mm lens on a Pentax K5ii (APS-C dDLSR), so that lens had an equivalent angle of view to a 300mm lens on a 35mm/full-frame SLR.  Exposure was ESP metering, shutter priority, at ISO200, f/5, 1/800th. Because it was so bright and because the sunlight was reflecting directly off the turtle, AND because I was using a polarising filter, I needed no exposure compensation for this image.

	49847 : ["Not sure how detailed of an answer you want/need, but I'll start off with the \"Cliff Notes\" version: 1) Put the card into a card reader that is either built into your computer or an external one. 2) Double-click on the icon to open the folder, copy the files or the entire folder. 3) Open or create a new folder on your computer and then paste the images or folder that you just copied. Now here's a more detailed version: You could use the cable supplied with your A3100, attach it to the camera and the computer that way.  However, this method is the most problematic way of doing.  So with that in mind, I do not recommend you try. The best way to get your images onto your computer is with a card reader.  Your computer might have one built into it if it's relatively new.  If not, no problem.  Just get an external USB card reader such as one of these:  There are a lot of card readers to choose from.  The more expensive ones will have higher data transfer rates. But in all honesty, just get an inexpensive one that has USB3.0, and you'll be just fine.  No need to spend $70 when a $25-$35 reader will be just fine.  I'd avoid the really cheap $10 readers. Once you have the reader connected to a USB slot in your computer, turn the computer on.   The computer will recognize the reader and automatically install the proper drivers for it.  Next, put the SD card into the reader.  The card and the reader are designed in such a way that the card can only fit in one way.  Once the card is in, the computer will automatically recognize that the card has been inserted. So now your computer has access to the images on the SD card.  To remove the images from the card, double-click on \"My Computer\" (Windows 7) or \"This Computer\" (Windows 10) icon on your desktop.  If you do not have one of these icons on your computer's desktop, no problem.  Click on the search bar on the bottom left of the task bar and enter \"file explorer\" and press enter.  A box will open up showing you all the different storage devices such as your hard drive that are connected to your computer.  One of these will be the SD card.  Find that icon and double-click on it to open up a new window that will show you the folders on the SD card that contain your photos.  To see the photo files, double-click on the folders.  These last steps are what I believe to be the best way to get the images from the card to your computer.  You first need to select either the entire folder containing the individual image files, or open the folder and choose all or some of the files.  Normally you will want all files.  My personal preference here is to open the main folder on the SD card.  Next, select all the files by pressing press Ctrl_+ A.  Then copy all the files by pressing Ctrl + C.  This is where a lot of people make the mistake of \"cutting\" the image by press Ctrl _+ X.  I recommend not doing this because if you have a problem in the transfer process, you will always have the original files on the card. If you cut and paste, you could lose data.  So copy instead of cut. Next go to the spot on your computer where you like to save your files.  Create a folder by right-clicking and choose New Folder.  Name the folder whatever you like.  Double-click on the folder to open it, and then paste the images that you previously copied by pressing Ctrl + V. And now, sit back while the files are copied from the SD card onto your computer.  Once you have confirmed that all the files have been properly copied, I recommend putting the card back into the camera and use the camera's Format utility.  This clears out the card and gets it ready for the next time you want to take photos.  Never use any other device such as a computer or a different camera to format your SD card.  This will corrupt the card making it unusable in your camera.", 7000, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
