	109071 : ["These are the hardest questions EVER!!! 1)  Boy O Boy, does that sound familiar.  Hey, are you still following me again, carrying around my avatar picture at the mall to see if you can find me, lmoa.  It is not really a ripped jersey, but rather Martin St. Louis (they don't make sweaters in his size, and that is also the reason for the small numbers).  He has a towel wrapped around him because some buddies slipped some acid in his Gatorade, and he decided to join a Pickup game on Tampa Bay.    2)  At first, I am relived when I realize the honeys on the couch are actually blow-up dolls, but then immediately become even MORE concerned.  Then I become double concerned when I realize that I am wearing nothing but a Datsyuk jersey. My mind starts racing.  I am thinking, “How could I have slept with that Quazymoto.”  “What in the hell could we have even talked about, for me to end up here?”  “Then I think…what am I doing in Sweden with a Russian?”  Then I get up and the next room, is a locker room.  Then I keep walking and there are showers…now running, I open two double doors and realize I am in the Joe.  I run back to the locker room lobby, and see the janitor cleaning up my clothes.  I yell, “Hey, those are mine!!! Don't touch those!!!” Then he says, “That's not what you said last night.”  …………little puke in my mouth now, thanks,  3)  Apparently, I was drunk again…big shocker.  I saw Avery walking down the street is his gay little Vogue fashion clothes with some tramp pinned to his arm.  Well, upon passed them on the sidewalk, the little witch sneezes on me.   So, I turn around and kick her in the back.  Since her diet is tic-tacs and water, I break her in half.  Then Avery decks me in the face.  Fortunately for me, there were a handful of hockey players across the road, waiting to waffle imprint Avery's abnormally round, Charlie Brown-like head.   4)  I guess I originally was camping with Joe, Lubers, Zam, Awesome Bill, Shock, Snoop, Erica, and the rest of the Pennsylvania crew…and then somebody had the great idea to start playing a drinking card game…I don't remember the rules, because when the beer ran out we were drinking 151.  So, I went to go wiz in the woods, and ended up riding a Cheetah like in Harold and Kumar go to White Castle (that had to be the dumbest scene in a movie), and ended waking up the next morning with Jordan poking my knocker.  I guess he was curious.", 10079, "None", 6],
	109072 : ["Wow, these are pretty hard questions! (my answers aren't too great but that's all I could come up with) 1) I guess that fight got a little too carried away. 2) I got kind of crazy the other night when the Wings won the cup and pleaded Holstrom to convince Lidstrom that he should have a sleep over at his house and for some crazy reason invite me 3) Well, I guess I was drunk (that's why I don't remember what happened! lol) and I accidently spilled my soda on top of Hollweg the night of the game and he got revenge (along with Orr and Dawes)! 4) I was camping with some friends and then before I knew it these hockey players come along (when my two friends were both sleeping) and it's dark out and I heard some noise. I was knocked out not too long after. When I woke up I heard one of them say something about how hungry they were and how disappointed there wasn't much meat on me. It turns out that I was tied up and was supposed to be dessert. They must have been drunk to think I was similar to the rabbit they were roasting - I suppose they thought I was some kind of puckbunny - literally! lol", 10079, "rHhnW1zIaa", 1],

Can't prove that 3) Is it just me, or on that Versus commercial when they talk about 6 dollar champagne tasting good; do you think that guy that buys 6 dollar champagne for the Stanley Cup winner, needs to be fired? No need to fire someone that's just saving Money want him to Buy $200.00 in more Expense Tasting Champagne Wake Up now 4) It is just me, or does the Hockey Hall of Fame's old CNE location look MUCH larger than the Bank of Montreal Building where it is currently located? I agree with you and that, The Bank is bigger then The Hall of Fame 5) Is it just me, or do you think if the Penguins win the Stanley Cup, Wheaties will put Sidney Crosby on the cereal box?

You are dealing with many exhausting factors: pregnancy, work, kids, household...Of course you are tired! It's a good thing you fall asleep with the kids or you'd probably end up sick from exhaustion soon enough. Maybe you can switch to part time work? Maybe he can do more around the house and with the kids so you have time for you? Maybe he can let you sleep in on the weekends?

	109087 : ["1. I probably got into a fight at a bar in Sarasota (i.e. Captain Curts) with some Buffalo relocator. I was probably trying to have a civil conversation about Buffalo hockey when the guy in the Tampa garb came waltzing by. The other guy from Buffalo (probably from North Tonawanda) said something stupid, and I had to break up the fight. Being that the guy was from NT, as I'm trying to pin him down I realize its one of my former retarded students from NT high school and decide to let the guy from Tampa have at him cause the kid probably deserves a swift kick in the ***. Aaaaand because he's from NT he probably already has mommy on speed dial to post bail so me and Tampa guy are stuck in the bin. As soon as we're released, we go to IHOP for breakfast. 2. I'm the blond on the recliner. I went to Sweden with some of my other hair dye obsessed friends, we had a spa night with a criminal mastermind friend who stole the cup, and who happens to be a wings fan. 3. This time I was probably defending a Buffalo fan outside the UNIS building and some Cambodian diplomat probably hit me for no reason. The aforementioned people actually brought me home to take care of me in a non rapist kind of way, but theyre laughing at how jacked up I look. 4.
