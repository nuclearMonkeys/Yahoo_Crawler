If the loss was to Florida, rather than LSU, I'm sure they would have won out, especially considering VT came back and beat one of the teams they lost to.  But this really isn't even arguable.  It sucks for VT (of which I am also a fan when they are not playing LSU) but that's college football.   Just think how bad it sucks for teams that go undefeated and cannot play.

If you are only smoking one, smoke something strong like Benson and hedges or Rothmans as this will deliver more niccotine curbing you appetite for longer and doing the same amount of harm as a lighter cigarette.  I know lots of people who are pack a week smokers and are absolutely fine.  Its when it gets above 5 a day you should worry.  Also, to prevent getting addicted, smoke only when you really enjoy it and it doesn't become a habit without thinking of it, and if you see your numbers slowy rising, then quit for a week, in time, you will learn to appreciate just that one cigarette.

Zen practice is the direct expression of our true nature. Shunryu Suzuki-roshi (1905-71)  2. The formless body of complete illumination of the nature of awareness; Don't use knowledge and views, misconstruing far and near. If thoughts vary, you're blind to the profound essence; If the mind differs, you're not close to the path. When feelings discriminate myriad things, they submerge the present situation; When consciousness perceives many aspects, you lose the original reality. If you can understand clearly from such sayings, Clearly you're the man of before, without any concern. Sozan Honjaku [Ts'ao-shan Pen-chi] (840-901)  3. Just avoid seeking from others, Or you will be far estranged from yourself. I now go on alone; I meet Him everywhere - He is now just I, but I now am not He: One must understand in this way In order to unite with thusness. Tozan Ryokai [Tung-shan Liang-chieh] (807-869)  4. Fellow learners! To achieve Buddhahood there is no need for cultivation. Just carry on an ordinary task without any attachments. Release your bowels and water, wear your clothes, eat your meals. When you are tired, lie down. The fool will laugh at you, but the wise man will understand. Rinzai [Lin-chi I-hsuan] (?-866) 5. In the universe there is not a spot of land as small as a mustard seed where I have not sacrificed my life or have not buried my bones. Sakyamuni Buddha (c. 563-483 B.C.)  6. Even when then bamboos are growing thick, they do not obstruct the running stream.  7. The Perfect Way knows no difficulties Except that it refuses to make preferences; Only when freed from hate and love, It reveals itself fully and without disguise; A tenth of an inch's difference, And heaven and earth are set apart; If you wish to see it before your own eyes, Have no fixed thoughts either for or against it.  8.  I asked God for strength, that I might achieve, I was made weak, that I might learn humbly to obey ... I asked for health, that I might do greater things, I was given infirmity, that I might do better things ... I asked for riches, that I might be happy, I was given poverty, that I might be wise ... I asked for power, that I might have the praise of men, I was given weakness, that I might feel the need of God ... I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life, I was given life, that I might enjoy all things ... I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I had hoped for. Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. I am among all men, most richly blessed - Anonymous 9. Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" (Matthew 5:38-39) 10. If you judge people, you have no time to love them - Mother Teresa  11. First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. Mahatma Gandhi  12. The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart. Hellen Keller  13.  My advice to you is get married: if you find a good wife you'll be happy; if not, you'll become a philosopher. Socrates 14. Impossible is a word only to be found in the dictionary of fools. Napoleon Bonaparte 15. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  Neil Armstrong  16. History is a cyclic poem written by time upon the memories of man. Percy Bysshe Shelley 17. Always go to other people's funerals, otherwise they won't come to yours. Yogi Berra 18.  A gentleman is one who never strikes a woman without provocation. H L Mencken  19. Life is like a game of cards. The hand that is dealt you represents determinism; the way you play it is free will. Jawaharlal Nehru 20. In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief; to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds. Aristotle", 9784, "None", 1],
