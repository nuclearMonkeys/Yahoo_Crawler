	83271 : ["Honestly, I think so. The GOP hasn't really been united at all. If they don't set a base for their members to support more conservatives will switch to the Libertarian Party. Only 20% of Americans consider themselves Republican.  I think that is too bad, really. We need at least two major parties to oppose the party in power but as of now the only party that seems united and able to win big elections is the Democratic party.  No Libertarian or minor party will win a presidential election because of the rules of debates and the Electoral College.

	83280 : ["Peer pressure is a definite problem in schools today. Peer pressure helps the hierarchy function (yes, it's terrible but true!). This is shown in upper-primary/middle school where it is shown that possession (what you own or wear) with girls is a big thing. The things girls own will determine where girls stand in the hierarchy of things ultimately proving that peer pressure is alive & well. As children get older and turn into teenagers, their priorities grow and change. The pressure to drink, smoke, do drugs, etc becomes evident within some crowds; peer pressure knows how to guilt trip teenagers. There's also the peer pressure to disrespect/lie to parents; peer pressure will determine your views, attitudes and beliefs. This can be a good or bad thing with teenagers, but in more cases than not, it is a bad thing. School & the first year out is a terrible time for peer pressure. I'm not saying there is no peer pressure after that, but it is severely reduced. So, yes, I do feel peer pressure is a problem.", 9127, "None", 2],
	83281 : ["I have to disagree with \"the voice within\". Just because a person falls into the hands of peer pressure does not mean the person is immature. I fall into the hands of peer pressure from time to time (okay, daily), but my experiences are less drastic. I don't ever fall into the pressure of something like smoking or wearing showy clothing. My experiences are such as giving someone an answer to a homework question, even if I really don't want to. I can't handle little pressures like that.  Someone above said something about mentality - okay, I'm not mentally stable when it comes to peer pressure. I have a severe Social Anxiety Disorder. It may not seem like it sometimes, and you may think I'm very social, but it's more of modification of my personality for people to be social with me. That's not what I call being social for myself. I think its a real problem. I hate it. The people who do it for the sake of being cool probably have issues to work among themselves. They shouldn't be doing that, I would say, but I'm not one to judge. In middle school, yes I have been one of these people, once or twice (little things such as saying \"Well that sucks,\" etc.) But I soon fell out of because I realized it wasn't cool. I really didn't like saying that.  ~Silly Turtle --edit-- @The Voice Within: I didn't mean to cause an argument. I was simply stating my opinion, I didn't say you were wrong.

I feel bad for having caused you any hurt. Please ignore my rudeness.  --By the way, I did not give you a thumbs down. I would not give thumbs down for a simple different opinion.

However, Huckabee is an extremist andboth is and represents areligious stratum (the \"fundamentalists\" or religious right) who have statedtheirintent to undermine civil libertiesin America--particularly freedomof religion. That is NOT just hype: they have repeatedly attempted to insert their religious symbols, etc. into the public sphere, advocated \"profiling\" (discrimination ) against the millions of law-abidingAmericans who happen tobe Muslim, etc.   Quite aside from the fact that his remarks about advocatingthe stripping of AIDS patients of their civil liberties, huckabee is a firm supporter--indead a leader--of this anti-American religious right.

I respect not everybody shares the same opinion as mine, and that's fine. To correct you though, I didn't say every person who fell into peer pressure was immature. Could you quote where I said that?

Don't even worry about it, you didn't even need to apologize, you did nothing wrong.
