There is a lot of ocean when compared to the quantity of faeces and blood so it is in effect diluted. Plus what is there does not remain there because it is decomposed.", 7864, "kz04oBhsaa", -1],
	56631 : ["It isn't a contaminant when it is the normal state of things, just so you know.¬† The normal state of things is that there is a minor background level of organic debris of many different origins including excrement, but such debris is impermanent, so decays away relatively quickly, and concentrations never become high. Besides, the ocean is huge and life is a tiny, tiny proportion of it, so even tinier amounts of dead stuff or excretia that are added are really tiny in proportion relative to the life form from which it comes.¬† It definitely would become a problem if the stuff never got destroyed, but it does, so there is no \"contamination\" except locally for short time periods, if at all. Salt, on the other hand, does not decay, and the seas are salty because of addition of small amounts for extremely long times.¬† See the difference?", 7864, "WbVE1cXKaa", 0],

	56644 : ["I don't know about the magnets, specifically but auriculotherapy generally means ear acupuncture, which I know something about.  I would imagine that the magnets are a substitute for the needles. Ear acupuncture is used for anti smoking therapy and it is commonly used to help people that are getting off of heroin.  The idea is that it helps relax you and it does.  It is wonderful for heroin addicts, but not used alone.   When you say pain pills, if you mean opiates, then it is the same theory.  Auriculotherapy will help a lot along with medical treatment.  Don't try to go all natural with this if you are addicted.  The acupuncture would be especially helpful along with a clonodine (medication to lower your blood pressure) treatment for opiate addiction. If you are talking about treatment for benzodiazapine or other types of pain pill addictions, I believe it would be helpful, again along with medical treatment.  Certainly it can't hurt to do anything that is physically relaxing when you are going through a detox. I really would recommend going with the real thing - use the needles.  You can get free auriculotherapy in big city clinics and it really works.  It doesn't hurt and it actually feels wonderful - I've tried it.  The magnets sound iffy to me. I hope this helps you a little.  Good luck.", 7934, "jzf9V3KDaa", 0],

The answer to these questions is obviously no. Should an uninformed citizen cast a vote which may have a bearing on important issues facing this Nation? No. It's not that easy though since certain sects or groups in society would start screaming discrimination if God-forbid we required voters to even be able to state thier candidates first and last names. So many minions vote along party lines like so many sheep in a pasture. Most voters don't understand the gravity of thier vote and through pure laziness don't bother to check out their candidates beliefs and ideas.

Ask a republican who Michael Steele is, and they might tell you he's that black guy that Fox shows from time to time. Most democrats can't name the succession order down to 4 people.   Everyone's vote counts, regardless of their personal knowledge. Just because they aren't informed enough doesn't mean that they shouldn't have a say. What would constitute being \"uninformed\"?
