I decided to be tolerant about gays even though I come from show biz and know exactly what goes on in their movement, but of course it also goes on in the hetero movement too.

Islam, as you and everyone else may know, is the fastest growing religion in the world. But why is that? The answer is more and more people are finding the truth in Islam! In it, there is faith and there is proof. Islam is very practical! If you have any more questions on Islam, feel free to email me. Thank you for your time.", 9337, "kHAeYCBHaa", -1],

I agree with others that posted regarding the issues of the seeds causing it to belong to the fruit family. I think that I once read (or heard) that tomatoes are part of the berry family, not because of the taste or looks, but because they come from a vine or shrub, as opposed to how the majority of other fruits come from trees. It was something along those lines that made it part of the fruit/ berry family. Anyway, I think many people refer to tomatoes as veggies and consider them to be so. It does have to do with the fact that they aren't sweet like most other fruits are. I'd also like you to know that there is also a veggie that is sometimes thought of as a fruit, called rhubarb. It grows like and resembles celery, but the stalks are pink to deep red instead of green. Since many people may buy it already chopped and frozen, and aren't aware how it looks whole, and they take it to be fruit. When rhubarb is cooked or baked and prepared properly, it's taste becomes sweet. Rhubarb is used in many dessert recipes, like for making pies, etc. and yet it is a vegetable!
