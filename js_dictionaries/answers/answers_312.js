	15616 : ["When Packard went under Chrysler had three lines. Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler.. Chrysler was the luxury division of the company. Dodge was the mid-range product and Plymouth was the cheap line. Chrysler products were designed so that the a top hat could be worn by a man while riding in  one. This single trait no doubt hindered the design of the product line. After the war Packard acquired Studebaker. Which was to be the lower priced car for Packard. When Packard went under Chrysler was already having troubles. They did not need another luxury level line of cars. It would have expanded the car line to five in number. What Chrysler did that hurt them so much was hiring Lee Iaocca. While he was good, he made a few mistakes. One was the \"K\" car. A good concept, but poorly executed. It had dependability issues and signaled the beginning of the end. A series of vehicles followed. All had a similar problem- good idea but poor engineering. The poor engineering was in part due to Lee cutting back on the budget for engineering. Also in part due to the poor choice of Mitsubishi as a partner who provided many of the power trains. As for Packard, the choice to rebadge Studebakers as Packard was the mistake. Studebakers had a lot of design innovations that were ahead of their time. But cost savings were done in the wrong places. The results were similar to those seen by GM when they rebadged Chevrolets as Oldsmobile's, Buicks and Pontiac cars. Interchange between product lines can only go so far before the public see's through it.", 2675, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 2],

Training can impel us to see things differently which can expand our creativity.  It gives us the understanding to examine things from different angles and come up with something creatively unique.
