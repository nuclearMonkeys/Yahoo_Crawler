When my son was ready for potty training he suddenly started doing this of his own accord.  We'd come home and he'd immediately strip off.

	79427 : ["That sucks, yeah some people hate it. It's not unlike some women hating to give blowjobs. But there is really nothing gross about it, it usually has benefits from what I know.  As a girl, I only happen to unfortunately know what my vagina tastes like, and I wouldn't like it either, vaginas really kind of look gross, and I hear some of them don't smell pleasant. If the girl is a vegetarian, it should taste better.  To get over the phobia, read more about it, there should be some comforting facts, or at least awareness might make you feel better, and then doing it and having positive results should help, maybe take it a bit slow if you have to.  There are a lot of guys that hate it, and a lot of guys that love doing it so much, they'd try to pry my legs open for it.. Which, I'm not normally in the mood for that anyway.  They just like giving the girl that kind of pleasure I think, it can yield some pretty strong and sexy orgasms.  If you find that you'll have some issues doing that, or just don't want to, you can strike a fair deal with a girl, so things are more even. In my current relationship, I'm with someone that doesn't like doing that, and hasn't, some of that is because he isn't confident with his licking skills, and that's all good. I mean, in a relationship, people are supposed to be understanding toward each other, and I don't want him to do that if he doesn't want to, that seems wrong, because if I didn't want to do something, I would expect him to understand.  But, after a while, I started to feel like I was doing more of the work in bed, most of the time. Which is alright sometimes, as I'm a dominant sort, but I like attention also, I want him to want to pleasure me, and he does. Despite the fact that I give him blowjobs, like, a lot, almost every time we have sex, and other times, also, I'm not going to ask him for oral, since he seems uncomfortable with it. Instead, I can ask for something else, and it doesn't have to be sexual. Like a massage, who doesn't like that, or for him to play with my hair, which I would really like, or something like that.  Just to make things a bit more even. I could live with that, quite contently.", 8983, "kBXTWcy1aa", 0],
	79428 : ["It's normal I would never do it.. It just looks weird.. Think of all the stuff that touches it. Period blood pee and the fishy smell it can have.

	79429 : ["Want to know how to get your ex back? Change yourself. Don't worry about changing other people, worry about changing yourself. Go to  Once you do that then you can start to worry about getting back together with your ex, other wise you will find that you are fighting about all the same things and getting no where. Do what it takes and I promise things will work out in your favor.  The funny thing is I came to the realization that I had to change a little too late. After I was kicked out and after I was about to lose the only things that truly mattered to me - her love. A funny thing happens when we truly love someone and lose them. We do what ever it takes to get them back. For me I had to drop bad habits that had caused not only our relationship to sour but practically every other relationship I had had in the past. Not only with women, but with friends, co-workers, family, you name it.  Which is why I say to you as my ex at the time said to me, the only thing you can do is change yourself. Work on yourself and improve on the person that you already are. Drop the negative things in your life that don't belong there and you will see all of your relationships start to take off to new heights.", 8982, "HhpFgnpyaa", 0],
