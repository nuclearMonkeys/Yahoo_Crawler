	118594 : ["I didn't vote for Hillary (in the Primaries) and I'm sure there are numerous other (women) who haven't either.  Personally, I think voting may be a little biased whether a person is in favor of her or not.  Think of all the people who probably didn't even give any of her debates and campaigns a second thought just because she is a woman.  It goes both ways. If a lot of women are voting for Clinton because she is a woman, then I'm sure this goes the same for blacks and Obama.  Logical?  No.  But, it's going to happen because this upcoming election may be exciting history in the making.", 10549, "None", 0],

Since she wears the pants in the family, is Bill the one wearing the apron & making the cookies? She gags me!!!!", 10549, "4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa", 0],

	118616 : ["I researched the three main candidates: McCain, Obama, and Hillary. I found Hillary's stands more appealing than Obama's wishy-washy answers and McCain's authoritative ways. But Hillary, being a woman, is an extremely strong example as to what a REAL woman is.

	118621 : ["Air inside the car is travelling at the same speed as the car. So for a fly, the car is not moving. The Earths rotates at a speed of 1000 miles/h at the equator. If you jump why don't you fall miles away? The answer is the same, the Earth is the car and you are the fly.", 10552, "AA10403505", 4],
	118622 : ["The bug flies in the air. The air moves forward just as fast as the car. Although there are pressure gradient transients created within the car as the car accellerates and decellerates, these changes are apparently not so great as to disrupt the bug's flight pattern significantly. You can see the effect of pressure gradient transients in a car if you have helium balloons in the car. 1. Place a helium balloon in the middle of a stopped car. 2. Accellerate the car and start driving forward. 3. You will observe the balloon - seemingly paradoxically - move forward in the car. How can this be, you ask? Since everything else seems to be thrown to the back of the car as the car accellerates? The answer to that question is that the AIR in the car is pushed to the back of the car - and since the AIR is denser than the helium - the helium gets pushed forward in the car by the denser air that forms a zone of higher pressure at the back of the car during accelleration. The opposite will happen when you stop the car. So, a bug in flight in a car will be subject to the same sorts of air movement. However, at the normal accelleration and decelleration rates of most passenger cars, the bugs use their innate flying abilities to fly, seemingly unaffected - not unlike how the bugs fly outside in mild breezes without too much problem. So, the short answer is - the bugs fly because the air moves with the car and pushes them forward with the car. In a vacuum - the bug would seem to go backward as the car accellerated - but of course, in a vacuum, a bug could not fly.", 10552, "None", 0],
	118623 : ["If the vehicle is moving with constant acceleration, it's as though the contents of the car are standing still.  It isn't until the car's acceleration changes that the bug would experience any other forces affecting its movement relative to the car.  For example, if you're travelling at 70 mph, you're not being slammed against the back window are you?  But if you slam on the breaks you will move forward relative to the car.", 10552, "AA10312971", 0],
