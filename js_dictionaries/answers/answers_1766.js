	94034 : ["I've been teaching a long time - 17 years.  All of my years have been at the primary level.  I agree with what you've written and with the posters who have blamed the \"no child left behind\" act, but only to a point.  The extreme we have gone to is frustrating, but the idea isn't all wrong.  When I first started teaching, teachers pretty much did whatever they wanted and were creative in the classroom.  This works well with an experienced, skilled teacher.  It doesn't work well with an inexperience or less skilled teacher.  Teachers are just like doctors, lawyers, accountants, or any other profession; some are more skilled than others.  The result of the \"do your own thing\" philosophy was that some teachers never covered some subjects or skimmed over others. It still happens.  We have a long time teacher at our school who every teacher knows would walk into school each morning thinking, \"hmmm.  what am I going to teach today?\".   Parents love the teacher because she is quite personable.  Other teachers quietly grumble when they have one of her ex-students who is struggling, because the student's  difficulties won't ever be reflected in a report card or referral for an assessment by the speech therapist or school psychologist.   The curriculum we have to follow at least gives her a framework.  The assessments force some evaluation of her students' progress.  My opinion is that while the scope and sequence of curriculum are a good thing, teachers should be able to supplement and adjust how they teach and how they assess their students progress.  No teacher should be forced to read a script out of a canned teachers manual.  The assessments we are asked to complete are excessive, but some assessments are necessary to prevent teachers from using subjective measures to evaluate their students.  I am rarely surprised by the results of an assessment I give, but I'm always glad I have the concrete measure of my students' progress.   Teachers in California are encouraged to differentiate their instruction to meet their students needs. In the language arts curriculum adopted by our school district,  differentiation is called universal access time.  That's just a fancy name for small group instruction based on academic need.  It's a positive thing, since even with standards and curriculum, children learn at different speeds.  The problem is that even though  I'm encouraged to meet my students needs, our system expect every student to be able to meet the same standards at the end of the year.  That inflexibility is what is difficult.  Teachers often talk about the \"pendulum\" of education and curriculum.  A great example is how we teach reading.  Teaching reading has gone from whole language to scripted phonics instruction. Teachers know that it's best to teach reading is a combination of the different methods: phonics, sight words, context and exposure to literature.  Somehow education always seems to go from one extreme to another without ever finding that happy medium.   Teachers often go into their rooms, close their doors and don't go exactly by the book.  Just today I did that with an art project connected to literature.  Trust me, nobody will come complaining to me as long as my students make  progress.  We all do that, we just don't talk about it with our administrators.  The administrators aren't concerned as long as we are following curriculum and standards the most of the time.  I'm running out of space.  I am frustrated at times by my profession, but I still enjoy it and wouldn't choose to change careers. If I were a doctor, I'm sure I'd have just as much frustration with insurance companies and state of our health care system. There is always good with the bad and all I can do is my best with in whatever constraints are given me.   :-) Great question, by the way.  I've gone on too long.  and I expect thumbsdowns for not entirely defending creativity and teacher judgment.  What I am saying is that it is the balance we're lacking in education.  The extreme we've come to isn't but good, but neither is the other extreme.", 9497, "UsPexIj0aa", 0],
