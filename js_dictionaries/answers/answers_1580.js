	84659 : ["Most people express a lot of confidence thier candidate will win. Certainly Republicans are all telling us McCain has it in the bag. Polls show Obama in front of McCain despite the tough battle going on for the Dem nomination and the free ride McCain is getting as a result.

	84660 : ["its not going to be a sure win but here are some reasons Obama will probably beat McCain very unpopular President thats Republican war in Iraq not going well (4,000+ Americans dead) Iran is threatening but no real plan for them bad economy unemployment rate is 5.1% 250,000 jobs lost this year so far the US dollar is falling cutting taxes and increasing government spending record national debt and still rising i think it's going to be a very close race this November, but the stacks are against McCain.", 9170, "AA11620670", 3],
	84661 : ["Because Donald looks at things purely from a business perspective. Hillary would be the best for our pocketbooks in the long run. Many will take issue with how she does it, but as with Bill, you can't deny the end result.  Lowering taxes is not the best way to improve the economy. Bush has proven that. Aside from that, the amount of \"regressive taxes\" we have under Bush is astronomical. In case anyone missed it, we have a LOT of dangerously inflated markets that are taxable based on percentage. Taxable Goods Real Estate/Property Gas ...about the only thing that has blown up since 2000 that is NOT taxable is health care. Thanks for small favors. In addition, INFLATION is rampant, and these cowards refuse to use the word. Much like \"recession\". We're paying more than ever before at the supermarket, which can be directly correlated to the Bush administration's irresponsible foreign policy, which McCain WANTS TO CONTINUE!  No matter how you crunch the numbers, life is more expensive under the Republicans, and we're not making the money we need to cover it, period. Lowering taxes in the face of stagnant and/or declining wages is just \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\". What would you rather have? 8-10% more with 3% more in taxes, or 2% more in wages with an $1800 rebate check? There's an old saying, \"you get what you pay for\".  Ironically, one major corporation we can thank for our survival through this is WalMart. Yes we sacrificed plenty of jobs, but if they didn't drive down the price of goods as much as they have, we would really be in trouble. This is not how I prefer things to work, but nonetheless this is what has been getting us by. Simply put, I would rather worry about paying higher taxes, with higher wages to do it with.  All that being said, the only tax increase Hillary has talked about is 35 to 39% for folks making over $250k a year.  Fine with me. It's time they gave back to the country that has made them successful in the first place. The sad thing is, after all the creative accounting those folks will end up paying less than you or I.", 9175, "mtMoznNXaa", 7],

	84669 : ["There are various clear finishes you could use, but polyurethanes will be the toughest (least susceptible to later scratching or cloudiness from humidity).  You can buy polyurethane in hardware and home improvement stores, and it will normally come in several variations ...gloss, satin/semigloss, and matte ...water based and non-water-based (sometimes called \"outdoor\" or marine...the label will say that it *must* be cleaned up or thinned with paint thinner, etc). My favorite brand and type is Varathane, water-based/indoor, gloss (I use it mostly on cured polymer clay), but since you're using air-dry clay you could use any brand and type of polyurethane you want.   It can be applied with many coats if you want too (and get even stronger and stronger), just dry well before adding a next coat.   It can be applied with a brush or even a sponge, etc., or the item can be dipped into it if it's small enough (let dipped item hang in some way, and soak up the drips that will form during the first few minutes with the tip of a paper towel, etc). It can also be applied over other paints though permanent paints will also \"seal\" your air-dry clay by themselves. Also, since you're using an air-dry clay (which *needs* to be thoroughly sealed), make sure to coat every tiny area, crevice, in and around around holes, etc. P.S.  You can also use things like ModPodge or thinned down permanent white glue like Elmers GlueAll (same thing), or acrylic mediums, etc, but those won't be as tough...they'll be fine though for short term and light-duty use though perhaps not as rigid.", 9172, "5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa", 0],

I would not only feel betrayed, I would be SURE that I NEVER gave him another chance in this particular situation.  His honesty should have been at the beginning of your association, not now, now when she is on the verge of getting surgery.

	84678 : ["I appreciate how you're trying not to be a jerk about it. Your analogy, though, isn't the best.  Usually when people suggest a show, they are suggesting a new and current show.  (ie, Homeland, which is great)  You're suggesting a show that most people have heard of and already have an opinion on.  Since you are saying you want to 'spread Christianity' I can only assume that means you want to talk to non-Chrisitians, or people who already have a distaste for Christianity.  Do you have anything new to add to the discussion?  Why are you so sure what you have is better than what anyone else has?  It seems rather self-indulgent of you to simply want to spread Christianity especially if all you have to contribute to the discussion is 'how awesome God is.'  How were you able to determine that anyway? Does it matter anyway?  What if I don't believe in the god you believe in, does that really make a difference?  Why not spread goodness by just being good? If you are being sincere and you truly want to do this, your first step should be to understand the perspective of those you want to talk to.  Try to understand how things came to be this way by reading books of science and history.  Read \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" by Jared Diamond and \"The Selfish Gene\" by Richard Dawkins.  Read \"Ishmael\" by Daniel Quinn to bring it all together. When you've understood the issues those people write about, only then will we be able to speak the same language.", 9174, "Ub8wrlcTaa", 0],
