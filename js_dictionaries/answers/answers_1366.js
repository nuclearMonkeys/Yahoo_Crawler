One thing that has certainly upset me with regard to greed is the latest Tennessee Congressman who campaigned and did all he could to smear the young Ford, who also ran against him.  As fate would have it, he won.  And now guess what he's doing?? All that money he spent raising hairs over another candidate and making those promises - he has the nerve to have set up MORE THAN THREE FUND RAISING BANQUETS with charges upwards of $1000 PER PLATE and it was announced so that HE COULD PAY FOR ALL THAT HE SPENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

	73939 : ["Hello sir, great question as usual.  My friend, this would have been a very good fight, and although people say that old time fighters aren't that good and are flat-footed, even though that could be true, I believe Jack Johnson would be a great threat to Rocky Marciano. Jack Johnson was an excellent boxer with tremendous counterpunching skills and very good defense as well. He was very well conditioned and fought a lot of 20 round fights. Rocky Marciano was also very well conditioned and I believe that he could also fight 20 round fights if he had to. Of course, that era was over, and he fought 15 round fights, but he never seemed to get tired. A lot of people say that Marciano's competition was terrible and the fighters he beat were passed prime. He beat the likes of Joe Louis, Jersey Joe Walcott, Roland La Starza, Ezzard Charles, and Archie Moore, and the only one truly passed it was Joe Louis. Age doesn't always determine prime, and Walcott, Charles, and Moore were all very good opponents even in their 30's. Although I'm usually a fan of technically sound boxers, I've started to become more of a fan of Marciano now because he shows so much heart and determination every fight, and explosive punching power. Fight time: Jack Johnson will come out moving and jabbing with his great movement and defense he always has had. Rocky Marciano will keep coming forward. If Jack Johnson could get dropped by Stanley Ketchel, I believe he wouldn't be able to handle the great punching power of Marciano. He will get dropped for sure in my opinion. Like I said, Johnson boxing, Marciano trying to slug it out and swarm Johnson. Finally, in around the 13th round of a boxer-swarmer type fight, Marciano lands his signature Suzie Q punch that puts Johnson down. He'll get back up, but Marciano's swarming style will again succeed for him. Johnson will then be taking too much punishment, and the referee will call a halt to the fight. Winner: Rocky Marciano by TKO in Round 13! Thanks for the question and yes this would be a great fight for sure, because styles make fights.", 8756, "M2PrJ4smaa", 3],

	73947 : ["That's some wild thinking man. I liked reading it. But a few complaints: \" FDR started WWII and Wilson started WWI\" you make a leap from, \"got us into the war\" to \"STARTED THE WAR\". if you were trying to build a rational argument, you should have avoided this. Obviously neither of them \"Started\" either world war. Your accounts of both world wars is off. But you have a good point. if we had a republican president, in today's mold, they would have been more likely to intervene early, instead of letting the situation get outta control. Hindsight is genius, and most geniuses agree that letting the situations develop as they did made the ultimate costs much greater than they could have been, i.e. Clinton could have gotten Bin Laden years before 9-11 when he was still a terrorist threat but didn't, so instead we get two decade long wars. But the issue here isn't \"democrats get us into wars and republicans don't\", it's \"republicans get us into smaller wars that we can win fast and democrats are ******* who like to wait till the $h!t hits the fan.\" As for Hitler calling his party socialist. That is somewhat fair, but China also calls itself a republic. Does any of that bother you? Hitler called himself a socialist, and since he controlled the economy, I suppose on a level, that is applicable. But Hitler was beyond any shadow of a doubt, fascist. WHy did he sell himself as socialist? Because it doesn't sound as bad. Same reason China calls themselves a republic. FYI. China is a republic. They just don't practice democracy there. IF you don't like that, the splitting Hitler's hairs, consider this...what do you hate about Hitler, the fact that he was supreme ruler of Germany's economy...or...the fact that he thought the germans were a superior race that had a right to commit genocide in order to restore that race to supremacy. I hope you think it's the latter. And you don't honestly think that all the liberal, progressive, equality minded, practically reparation-like in function, programs that dems come up with to help poor people, which are disproportionately african american, are Republican backed? The belief that \"Democrats\" were opposed to the civil rights act was only true in the south, the deep south, where the republicans were also against it.
