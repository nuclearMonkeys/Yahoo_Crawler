I don't know what you mean by our 'attitude' to the royals - we've had monarchs throughout history and it's an important part of our history.  What has 'when Phillip born' got to do with it?  I daresay some people laugh at the UK, but many people laugh at the USA as they do at most countries.", 2641, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 2],

Calling Elizabeth \"Queen of England\" is shorthand that ignores the fact that she is regnant of more than just England. The Queen, as a widow, may be free to remarry, but she will not. Her situation is much different than Charles'. Charles was so much younger, divorced, then widowed. He had a long-time girlfriend in Camilla.

Bill. They were not in a mood to keep taking orders once Germany was defeated. You can see this in the many desertions that took place as soon as the fighting was done.  This is the explanation for the poor performance of the US Army in the early part of the Korean War.

I would like to throw-in one small thing: lay off him a little bit for the past; yeah he hasn't made too much progress, but focus more on what's between y'all; and less of his ex and how he was back then. Anyways, it is way sucky that he protests traveling w/o him when he hasn't done anything to remedy the situation. Given everything else, even if he isn't actively doing wrong by you, you aren't able to spread your wings, so's to speak- so I'd start working on break-up speech.

What does the tenant have to do with the executor of the estate except the executor being the one who is now responsible for managing the property and collecting rent from the tenant? NO ONE can force the tenant to do anything but pay rent per the rental agreement. And the mortgage lender cannot force the executor to transfer the mortgage into the executor's name - again, what does the tenant have to do with that, anyway? The only thing the mortgage lender can do is foreclose on the property if the mortgage is not paid.  It is the legal duty of the executor to act in the best interest of the estate, as well as pay all estate debt before any estate assets can be paid out to those named in the will.  Usually the property is sold by the executor.  If there is a written lease, the buyer must honor the lease and the tenant stays until the lease expires.  The only way to 'transfer' the mortgage to the tenant is by selling the property to the tenant and the tenant applies for and is approved for a new mortgage in their name. That's the only way. And NOBODY can force the tenant to buy the property.", 2667, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 0],

Those rules state that the maximum permitted number of mourners is thirty. It has been widely reported in the press the Queen had to make some very difficult decisions to in order to keep the number to thirty. I thought her choice was very good and she included most of the people I thought she would. She included four I never considered. One was a very dear friend of Prince Philip and three were drawn from among Prince Philip's German relatives.

Since they have been raised this way since birth, they are not going to be upset when they do their duty and follow protocol.   And their spouses need to know that this is also expected of them as well (evidently, Meghan Markle never read the \"agenda\"). Only immature and emotionally-unstable people get upset over something they cannot change.  And if you are a Royal and NOT the King/Queen, you have very little say in anything you do as soon as you step out of your residence and into the public eye.  They are used to this.

I would say that absolutely doesn't bode well for longevity in your relationship. You will only get more and more frustrated with the situation as time passes, and nothing you say or do is going to change him.  I'd suggest you let him know how things stand with you. Not from the standpoint of you being in a better place than he is because you have more in savings or have been more financially stable and secure. But from the perspective of hey, here are these things I want to do and accomplish, and while I'd love to have you join me on the adventures, I'm not going to pay your way.  I plan to take this trip on this date, or buy a house by this date, or whatever, and if you'd like to join me, I look forward to you making a plan to make that happen. But I'm not willing to put my life on hold waiting for you to figure yours out. But ultimately, I think you'll be much happier in the long run to end the relationship and make sure your next partner has common financial goals. ETA: I completely get the good guy thing, I've been married to one for over twenty years. But as kind, loving, and supportive as my husband is, he is not driven. He's been perfectly content to be happily underemployed for almost a decade, leaving the bulk of the financial support of our family on me. I'm fortunate to have a good job and earn a good living, but I'm also really tired of carrying so much of the load.
