Your stomach is so squished right now, you can't eat.(when i do i get nasty heartburn for two days) I feel the same. My sis did too.  And you can't sleep! (my sis said she could not either at nine months preg, and she swears it is your body prepping you for when the baby comes and baby wakes you up.)

	140951 : ["We didn't have Sky Bars in the UK but I remember a Fry's Chocolate Cream bar (chocolate bar with fondant centre, divided into about 5 segments). At one time they produced a version where each segment was a different colour/flavour but I can't remember what they called it. One of my earliest chocolate memories is of Five Boys chocolate (which I think was first made by Fry's and then by Cadbury's). It was a slab of milk chocolate divided into five segments, each of which bore the embossed face of a little boy. Each face had a different expression ranging from smiling to crying. This subject brings back a wave of childhood nostalgia. Near my first childhood home there was a shopping parade with bubble gum machines outside the sweet shop, You put in your penny, turned a knob and your gobstopper or bubblegum magically dropped into the drawer below. Some of the machines had little plastic toy prizes inside but these proved elusive. In later years, on the way home from school we would call in daily to the large newsagents/sweet shop that occupied a large corner position on the street. They had a huge counter divided into what seemed like a hundred sections, each containing different chocolate bars and packets of sweets. On the wall behind were large jars containing sweets which were sold loose by weight. Another section had many varieties of sweets which were 2, 3 or even 4 for a penny, such as jelly snakes, flying saucers and fruit salad chews. There were also Lucky Bags, Sherbet Fountains, Liquorice Catherine Wheels or \"shoelaces\" or \"pipes\", Barley Sugar sticks, Coltsfoot Twists, Love Hearts, Candy Necklaces and a myriad other goodies. We kids used to stand amid this Aladdin's Cave of sweet delights for what seemed like an hour, deciding how best to spend our tuppence or threepence in order to get the maximum value for it. The shop assistants must have had the patience of saints! Nice memories .....", 11485, "MuriOrXjaa", 0],

	140974 : ["Well, for the last couple of seasons anyone could tell Man United were very strong and a step ahead of other top clubs in the BPL but after Ronaldo's exit there is a big change. They don't have that special free-kick taker anymore. They don't have that special penalty taker. They don't have a good enough play-maker like Ronaldo was. They also lost Tevez who was very hard-working and never gave up. These two players are a BIG loss to the Man United squad. Ronaldo and Vidic in my opinion carried Man United to PL glory for the past two seasons. Now Vidic doesn't look as strong as last season and Rio Ferdinand is playing pants. They will miss Ronaldo's 30 odd goals a season very badly. I'm not saying they won't win the PL but they have been damaged severely and clearly won't do as good as they did for the past couple of seasons.

Then shave upwards in the opposite direction of the hairs with a 5 bladed razor. Be sure to shave hard to make it smooth.

If you do experience beginners side effects don't panic, just put acne cream on the bumps, keep up the shaving routine, & they should go away within a month. It's just like starting a new medicine.
