	100792 : ["First United Pentecostal As far as faith and works are concerned: Works are produced by faith, but works will not save you. Only help grow closer to Christ. Now as far as to know when you have enough \"faith or works\", I look at it like this: If you ever feel you have done all you need to do in your walk with Christ then that is when you really need to worry. For it is then that Satan has you in his grasp. Ephesians 2:8-9 (New International Version) For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. James 2:14-26 (New International Version) Faith and Deeds  What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, \"Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,\" but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.  But someone will say, \"You have faith; I have deeds.\"        Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.  You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.  You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was fulfilled that says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,\" and he was called God's friend. You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.  In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.", 9753, "PKjoM9xtaa", 0],

	100812 : ["This is an easy question to answer if you don't mind my being a bit simplistic. 1)   Jesus said that if we have faith as small as a mustard seed then we can speak to a mountain and it will move  2) If it is God's works then He has prepared works for us to do, so we don't need to strive - just rest in Him. If it is our works, then we can never do enough because we can't earn our way into God's heart by doing works. James said that faith without works is dead, so we express our faith by entering in the works that God has prepared for us, so one \"work\" is enough. In our walk with Christ, we know that we have enough faith once we have met with him and repented.  Faithfulness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit and faith is a gift.  Once we are born again we know. \"Then they said to Him, \"What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?\"  \"Jesus answered and said to them, \"This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.\" . \"   John 6:28-29", 9753, "o0I5YXMNaa", 2],

	100819 : ["Good question.  Many skinny athletes trying to gain weight identify themselves as \"hard gainers\" before they thoroughly evaluate their diet, routine, & lifestyle.  You should talk to a personal trainer who can help you obtain your goals.  They will be able to discuss the details of your current approach, including nutritional intake, whether or not you're training with enough intensity/good form, as well as mention good strategies & help you apply them. 1) Focus on nutrient dense foods- real foods like beef, chicken, fruits, vegetables, etc, rather than breads, pastas, or sweets.  Foods with lots of carbs but little fiber will dispose insulin to store fat rather than transporting nutrients to muscles. 2) Start with a fist sized portion of animal food (or vegetarian replacement), a fist sized portion of fruit, & a fist sized portion of vegetables.  For instance, try a fist sized piece of chicken, combined with a medium apple & broccoli or carrots.  If you can handle more protein & fat without feeling too full, do so; if you can add more carbs without feeling like you need to sleep afterward, do so.   3) Some folks trying to gain bulk will use weight gain supplements, which typically have loads of sugar as dextrose.  This will cause some muscle gain with some fat gain.  Avoid products with high amounts of dextrose.  You can do better by gradually increasing your nutrient intake in proportion to your training. 4) Try to hit the biggest muscles first in your weightlifting program.  They will stimulate the greatest release in testosterone (leg presses, squats, & bench presses/dumbbell presses are the chief testosterone increasing exercises), & consequently demand more nitrogen (from protein).  This will help you grow faster. 5) Aim for at least 1 g of protein per lb of bodyweight.  That may require you to consume more meals/protein supplements.  You will need more protein as you grow. 6) A meal can be as large or small as you want it, but keep it balanced with the principle above.  The more frequently you eat small meals- say 4-6 meals (as opposed to eating a 2-3 large meals), the more you prime your body to build muscle rather than storing fat. You should definitely do cardio/some aerobic exercise for its cardiovascular benefits.  Additionally, it is helpful for losing weight.  How intense you should train will be determined by how you fare on a certain program.  You can start with jogging 10-15 minutes on Monday, Wednesday, & Friday (or whatever 3 times a week split that gives you enough time to recover).  An equivalent intensity in cycling would be 20 minutes 3 times a week.  Or you could play sports like basketball or soccer for at least 30 minutes 3 times a week. Choose whatever method you enjoy & can stick to.  As a side benefit, cardio/aerobic exercise will help your weightlifting by promoting proper breathing & endurance, which will give you greater lifting strength & allow you to do more reps. Diet & proper rest are largely determinative of what results you get from lifting.  Make sure you get enough sleep (~7-9 hours)- this keeps two anabolic (growth-oriented) hormones- HGH & testosterone- high.", 9760, "sTdlAMv7aa", 0],
