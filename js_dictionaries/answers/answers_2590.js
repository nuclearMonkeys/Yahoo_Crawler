Gee, I wonder why Vladimir Putin didn't buy that horse manure? Russia has also announced that they intend to send out on partrol nuclear bombers.

	135330 : ["For a good book on China invading the US, look at 'invasion' by Eric L Harry. A good book but unlikely in the near future. The war games between the two are merely rattling the saber. Both China and Russia are both facing questions from the international community. Russia is suspected of coercing its neighbors and removing political dissidents while China is facing questions over the quality of its exports which is crucial to its economic development. By both participating in war games they can give the illusion of great cooperation and strong militaries, when in reality an alliance between the two is unlikely. Although Russia sells a vast amount of weaponry to China they have been at war a number of times in the 1970's and 80's and its part of the Psyche of China that it never forgets such events and violations so a future alliance is unlikely.", 11272, "AA11264540", 0],

Do you realize that they are part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's efforts to stamp out terrorists and are designed to coordinate the military efforts of several countries in fighting terrorism? For the Russians, that involves those in Chechnya. For the Chinese, it's the Ugers who belong to the East Turkmenistan Liberation Front.  The others (Uzbekistan, et. al) also have Jihadists operating in their country or using their country to prepare for carrying out Jihad in another nation. It's called \" Hijra\", which is voluntary expatriation for the purpose of waging Jihad. To me, the ethnic Ugers in China are a frightening threat, just because they live in the very province where China has its Nuclear test site.

	135350 : ["Mr Putin said the halting of long-range bomber flights after the Soviet Union's collapse had affected Russia's security because other nations had continued such missions. Theres some odd political speculation going on and equally odd statements being made by the presidents. Around 6,000 troops and hundred of armoured vehicles and fighter jets have taken part in military manoeuvres in the Urals, watched by Mr Putin and Hu Jintao. The meeting has concluded with a thinly veiled warning to the US to keep away from the energy-rich and strategic region. But i fail to see where the US is meddling in that immediate region. A statement said: \"Stability and security in central Asia are best ensured primarily through efforts taken by the nations of the region on the basis of the existing regional associations.\" Without mentioning the US directly, Mr Putin called for a \"multi-polar\" world order. \"Any attempts to solve global and regional problems unilaterally are hopeless,\" he said. The SCO, founded 11 years ago, focuses on border security and combating extremism in central Asia. As well as its full members, Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Iran, India, Pakistan and Mongolia have signed up as observers in recent years. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, took advantage of the platform to call US missile defence plans that could include stationing missile interceptors in Europe a threat to central Asia. \"These intentions go beyond just one country,\" he said. \"They are of concern for much of the continent, Asia and SCO members.\" Moscow and Beijing have developed what they describe as a \"strategic partnership\" in the region. Washington supports plans for pipelines that would carry the region's oil and gas to the west and bypass Russia, while Moscow has pushed strongly to control the export flows. China is eyeing the region to secure energy for its booming economy. This week, the China National Petroleum Corporation announced that Turkmenistan, which is not a member of the SOC, would aim to supply China with 30bn cubic metres of gas annually over 30 years. In 2005, the SCO called for a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops from two member countries, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. The US left Uzbekistan later that year, but Kyrgyzstan still has a US base, which supports operations in nearby Afghanistan. Russia also has a military base Kyrgyzstan. In another move with cold war overtones, Russia took the BBC's Russian-language FM broadcasts off the air. The Moscow distributor of the broadcasts said the programmes were \"foreign propaganda.\" The decision by Bolshoye Radio - and similar moves by two other radio station in the past year - leaves the BBC's Russian-language services available only on medium and shortwave broadcasts. So i think there is a lot of political shouldering right now and Russia is sore over the US putting in a ABM missile base in Poland. Then there is the Russian Bomber flights and i too think that this is pure Russian military posturing.  Cheers.", 11272, "Sc0Ql5uoaa", 0],

	135353 : ["I think you've pretty much nailed it with those three points. I might put a bit more importance on the influence of history than you do. I do think great rivalries can have long periods of one team dominating another and still have a lot of national interest... USC vs. Notre Dame for example. However, the team on the downside needs to turn it around to maintain the national interest. The luster of the rivalry wears off. A historic rivalry can fall off the national interest list. Texas vs Texas A&M is an example. National fans will still tune into the game because it's Thanksgivings Day weekend, but it's not \"can't miss\" TV. It's still a big deal for the fans of the teams. A&M still thinks it's a huge game. The Longhorns want to win obviously, but in reality.. it's just another dot on their schedule after the annual Oklahoma game.  Your second point is true. I'll look at the season TV schedule and mark down games with teams I don't follow that close but are games I want to see. The records of those teams aren't that important to me. But I want to watch because of the rivalries. And yes, Yale and Harvard fans go nuts when they play.. as do Army and Navy fans. Yippy for them.

	135354 : ["Umm, Ohio State has beat Michigan 80% of the time in this past 10 year cycle, and that is the best rivalry in all of sports. And it started out with Michigan dominating. History is what does it for me. When an entire campus spends the whole season building up to one game, that's what makes it a great rivalry.  Every Buckeye knows how many weeks until Michigan, and most of us refuse to even say that name (it's \"that state up north\"), and every Midshipman plebe has to yell either \"Go Navy!\" or \"Beat Army!\" every time he turns a corner... in July.

	135355 : ["the U. S. Code gives you that that's prohibited to burn the flag, yet united states best courtroom has held, a number of circumstances, that burning the flag is a secure form of speech. in the U.

S. isn't unlawful yet like the yankee flag or any public burnings, you may nicely be fee for violating the hearth code. In Muslim countries that's prohibited to burn a Quran in spite of the undeniable fact that that's not unlawful to burn an American flag or Bible. i locate this unusual considering that Mohammad seen the Bible a Holy e book a useless ringer for the Holy Quran. Muslims in jap countries are undemanding to burn Bibles and American flags in public without being charged with a criminal offense. there have been no protests by ability of Muslims until eventually the President of Afghanistan called on the yankee authorities to punish the Christian who burnt the Quran; quickly after there have been protests; in spite of the undeniable fact that the violence replaced into all started no longer by ability of ordinary Muslims yet by ability of people of Al Quaeda who used the incident to create confusion. the unhappy issue is that many Muslim leaders and those who decision themselves real Muslims do no longer condemn the terrorist attacks as a outcome providing information that Islam is unquestionably no longer a faith of peace.", 11280, "bi4rS0x2aa", 0],

	135372 : ["The Iron Bowl certainly is a fierce rivalry. Given that there's very little else of note in Alabama, it completely shuts down the state. Florida-Florida St. is another good one, and USC-UCLA, while a little one-sided as of late, still has a lot of history. Army-Navy is played for more than just the game, the Red River Shootout is a great game, and Wisconsin-Minnesota is the longest continuous rivalry in I-A. Notre Dame-USC is without a doubt THE intersectional rivalry and pits the two most prominent programs in the country against each other in a classic Midwest vs. SoCal battle.  Arkansas-LSU? Determines the SEC-West? Yeah, because Arkansas is so much better than Alabama and Auburn…and Duke-North Carolina? When's the last time either of those teams were in contention for the national championship, much less the ACC title or even the Top 25? Didn't Duke go something like three years without winning a single conference game? A great basketball rivalry, but doesn't quite translate to football so well. The best college football rivalry though, as has been said by many others, is Michigan-Ohio St. Heck, these two states once fought a war (over Toledo of all places). Simply put, people in Michigan hate people in Ohio. And people in Ohio hate people in Michigan. These two schools have some of the worst, most obnoxious and psychotic fans I've ever seen. Not to mention they owned the Big Ten for about half a century. Auburn-Alabama is as fierce rivalry as there is, but in the end, they're all still Alabamans. UM-OSU is a year-round, seething hatred. A Michigan coach was once recruiting in Ohio and he ran out of gas a couple miles from the border. Rather than purchase gas in Ohio, he and his assistant pushed the car across the border back to Michigan. Not to mention the rivalry has more significance on a national scale than the Iron Bowl. No disrespect to anyone's hometown rivalry (except the chowderheads who said LSU-Arkansas and UNC-Duke), but this is the top rivalry in college football. P.S.: Argives, are you high? Michigan's top rival is NOT Michigan St. Everybody knows it's Ohio St., which is why ESPN ranked it the top rivalry of all sports. Every Michigan fan I know would gouge your eyes out for that remark. UM-MSU is the one-sided one that only matters to Michigan if they lose it. UM-OSU isn't their big rivalry, are you kidding?", 11281, "AA11574285", 1],
