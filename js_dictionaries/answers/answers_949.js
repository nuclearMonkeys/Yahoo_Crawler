My cousin talked to family members and narrowed it down to me being the only family member in the Philippines during the correct time period.  They both used ancestry,  I also used ancestry to confirm.

	52935 : ["Every kid is different. Many \"tweens\" and teens find their parents extremely annoying. Many kids hate having their parents work with them on homework if they aren't used to be homeschooled. Some kids are close and cuddly, some aren't.  Some are more like us than others. Some kids are visual learns, other are either auditory or kinetic (by doing) learners.  If you are concerned, I'd strongly encourage you have your 12-year-old tested for a variety of things from dyslexia to ADHD. Your pediatrician and or local school district can direct you to testing resources. Rather than being frustrated at him (and him at you), it is important to know if his brain just functions differently and how to help him.  ", 7410, "RVK1NrNJaa", 2],

	52951 : ["Kids learn at different rates of speed, and every child has his or her own set of strengths and weaknesses. Calling your daughter stupid is NOT helping her, not one bit. In fact, it's very mean spirited and cruel. She's not stupid, she's just learning differently than her brother is. Not all smart kids make straight A's. Some of them make B's, and there are still others who have or had terrible grades and still succeeded in life. I was like that myself. I had horrible grades in high school, but I still managed to get into college and get a college degree. And kids that age can have issues with forgetfulness, just like adults can. It DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE STUPID. That's pure BS. Struggling to pay attention in class doesn't just happen to kids either. It also happens to college students and even to graduate students.

	52958 : ["Your question is total BS. Your question makes it obvious that you know nothing about the wearing of wigs or weaves..  Your 13-year-old daughter is NOT going around yanking a wig off someone's head. A wig is anchored with long bobby pins to the hair underneath the wig's cap. A wig  can't be yanked off someone's head - not without tearing out a huge hank of hair and injuring the scalp of that person. An anchored wig can't be yanked off a person's head, nor can it be blown off in the wind. Just because a teacher or anybody else  is wearing  a wig doesn't mean that person is bald. It  usually means that person didn't want to have to bother with fixing their hair that particular day, and decided to wear a wig instead. A weave isn't the same thing as a wig. A weave is anchored too, and it's \"weaved into\" to your hair. It would be ten times more painful for the wearer if your daughter to try to \"yank it off\" than would be for a wig.  ", 7419, "gRZNp2fbaa", -2],

	52961 : ["Obviously you don't know much about children.  Kids love to talk if there's an audience, and this girl seems to like you.  Take that as a great compliment.  Those are perfectly normal behaviors for an 8 year old.  What you need to do is engage her in doing things with you.  Let her help you with the laundry by teaching her (if she doesn't already know) how to fold things neatly and put them away.  Let her help you in the kitchen when you're preparing a meal.  Her mother isn't around to do those things, and she needs a female adult to teach her.  She also needs someone to talk to, and the fact that she loves talking to you is again a great compliment to you.  When you're really tired or don't feel like talking, have something for her to do.  Get some books and tell her to read one, and when she's completely through with the book, she can tell you what is in it.  That will keep her occupied for a while.  If you are talented in arts or crafts, teach her how to do things on her own.  Get her some supplies and let her create some pictures or some   decorations.  Then put them up where everyone can see them, and compliment her on her talent.  Your boyfriend will love you for being kind to his child, and she will forever be grateful.", 7411, "O0WKIr31aa", 0],

If you're only contemplating having another one because your son wants a sibling then I suggest that you don't have another child if you feel swamped already.  I don't know how old you are or if your clock is ticking but if you can wait, I'd suggest you wait until he's at least 12. At 12 your son will have learned ways to control himself to a degree better than what he can do at age 7, perhaps he will be ADHD meds for school and at home so he will be less hyper and calm to learn life skills, family skills and school skills.  Either or, I think you should wait.", 7412, "U02pCj0laa", 0],
	52965 : ["Well, I don't have ADHD and as an only child, I really wanted a sibling when I was seven (and at other times) but it didn't happen and it never will. But you do what you all want.

If you and your husband WANT another child and can afford the costs, then feel free.  If you and your husband do not want another child and or do not feel you can handle the needs of your son, then don't. You do have to understand that another child could also be hyperactive.  Your son is also old enough that your family can be working with a psychiatrist and other professionals to work on possible medication, behavior modification (brain training), and changes in diet that may help your son.  ", 7412, "RVK1NrNJaa", 1],
	52968 : ["You've gotten great advice from other parents. I would for sure teach your child how to box, get him some lessons. Growing up, I learned that adults don't always protect me so I have to learn to protect myself. Karate is not the way to go but boxing is. Teach him how to defend himself. Tell your child, to spread the word that there will be a fight after school and handle it on the playground, all the kids will see this and learn to lay off your child. He's got to earn their respect. ", 7413, "U02pCj0laa", 0],
