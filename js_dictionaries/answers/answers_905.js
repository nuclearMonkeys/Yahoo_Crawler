	50309 : ["Eddie is correct, but integer division in c/c++ will return the quotient, which is 0 for 5/9.  The c/c++ compiler should not return 1 for 5/9.  The c/c++ standard for the Arithmetic Operation \"/\" is the quotient of two integers. Since fahrenheit is a float, you will most likely have to change 32 to 32.0 as well. Test a decimal value at cin.  Test 32.1 and 29.9 and see if it returns 0. Other languages may not return the quotient, but actually round.  Check the languages Arithmetic operations.  For example in Visual Basic: 5/9 would return 1, but to return the quotient with integer division, the \" \" would be used, thus 5 9 = 0.  If the language does not support quotient division, you would use the floor function.  I mention this to point out how integers are handled, and how well one understands what the compiler is doing with integers.", 7079, "T1XHPQTSaa", 0],

As far as I can tell, MySQL does not seem to have that feature.  Even if it did have that feature, there would be a limit on how far back you can go. Edit:  I heard about a company who designed that feature in their software:  Before running a month close out, they would back up their database. When the month close out finished, they'd make another backup. All the transactions to the database were logged. The logs included the date and time of transactions. They could \"undo\" back to any point up to the beginning of the month. If they needed an \"undo\", they would restore the backup made after the month close out. Except the restore would not affect the log files.

You mean using characters, probably from one of the extended ASCII character sets, with different colors used to present data in tables, and crude (very low resolution) pictures -- ASCII art. To answer your question, it depends on the application.  Suppose I run a weather simulation, and I want a forecast for 5 days from now. When the program is done, I might get 6 lines of text output. But, the simulation might have used gigabytes of data and have used 100% of each CPU core for several minutes. It might even have done some processing on the GPU. You are generally correct in that graphics require more memory and higher performance hardware. Among those who use computers at home, it is gamers who want the fastest hardware and biggest memory. You might be able to run old office and bookkeeping software on an old computer with 640K memory, and 12 MHz CPU clock. But, you couldn't do much beyond that.

	50334 : ["Your reasoning is very good. But, you overlooked one thing: What you wrote would be true if there was a negative zero and a positive zero.  But, there is only one zero. So, the binary value for negative one occupies the place where negative zero would have been if there was a negative zero. Negative two occupies the place where negative one would have been if there was a negative zero. For more information, do a web search for \"two's complement.\" Compare that to \"one's complement.\" The following numbers are using two's compliment:  Minus one is 0xFFFFFFFF. Minus 2 is 0xFFFFFFFE. Minus 3 is 0xFFFFFFFD, and so on until -2147473648 is 0x80000000. (The '0x' prefix indicates what follows is a hexadecimal number.) Comment: Early computers could do operations on decimal numbers, using a number format known as Binary Coded Decimal or BCD. BCD does allow for the possibility of a negative zero or a positive zero.  Comment: A modern CPU might support BCD, but a lot of programming languages don't support it. So, hardware support for BCD may be dropped. Programming language support for BCD is one reason some old timer programmers and their managers still like COBOL.", 7089, "k7hBT7MGaa", 2],

	50360 : ["Your computer is a general purpose computer.  In physical terms, the difference between a server and a general computer is probably limited to extra network ability, extra memory (RAM), extra disk ability, OR extra software. A general purpose computer is a \"jack of all trades\" but some things it doesn't do as well as other things.  A server is really just a slightly enhanced (and I DO mean \"slightly\") computer that will, based on the software loaded to it, focus on one type of activity or purpose. For instance, a computer that is on the network and set up for sharing, and that has SQL Server loaded to it, becomes a database server. A computer that is on the network and has extra large disk drives - but no special software other than the operating system itself - will probably become a file server. A computer that is on the network and has extra disk and network interfaces and a package like IIS or Apache will probably become a web server. A computer that is on the network and has some extra disk and some extra RAM will probably be a time-sharing server. Depending on a lot of factors, even a very ordinary Windows machine can be a server in some cases.  Remember there are such things as Windows Home & Windows Pro.  Well, add one more to that - Windows Server. If you load up a computer with Windows Server and some special software, it almost immediately becomes a server for that software.  But that computer could very well have started as a desktop system.", 7078, "aj5IBTuXaa", -2],
	50361 : ["Two right answers, up until this point, and EddieJ was first hint: consider granting a top pick. What I'd recommend is that you start having the entirety of your constants coordinate the information type being utilized in the articulation.", 7079, "usHUzrU8aa", 0],
	50362 : ["I agree with the previous answers: (5/9) is integer arithmetic, so is evaluated to zero, remainder 5. The remainder is disregarded. You need to replace it with floating point.    I'm answering because I want to ad some comments, and  Yahoo! Answers currently has the comment feature disabled.   1) There might not actually be code to do that in the executable. An optimizing compiler would see \"(5/9)\" as a constant. Using integer arithmetic, the compiler would evaluate it, get the result \"0\". Seeing the resulting expression is  \"0*(fahrenheit-32)\", the compiler might even optimize again. The result is, it creates code for \"celsius = 0.0\" and avoids creating code to do arithmetic.  2) If I coded that line, it might be \"celsius = (5.0 / 9.0) * (fahrenheit - 32.0);\" 3) An old fashioned way to debug things is to add statements to show the values as the program runs. You could add something like the following: cout << 5/9  << \" conversion constant   \"; You could also do something like this, to quickly turn debugging on or off: #define DEBUG_MODE      ... #ifdef DEBUG_MODE cout << 5/9  << \" conversion constant   \"; #endif Comment out the #define when you don't want debug mode. ", 7079, "k7hBT7MGaa", 1],
	50363 : ["Two correct answers, so far, and EddieJ was first (hint: think about awarding a favorite). What I'd suggest is that you get in the habit of having all of your constants match the data type being used in the expression.  \"Silent\" conversions can be a source of surprise. Another recommendation: Use double instead of float, unless you have a specific need for float.   I'd write that program as: #include <iostream> int main() {     double fahrenheit;     double celsius;     std::cout << \"Enter a temperature in faherenheit. \";     std::cin >> fahrenheit;     celsius = (fahrenheit - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0); // converts fahrenheit to celsius     std::cout << celsius << std::endl;     return 0;} You could shorten that conversion to:     celsius=(fahrenheit-32)*5/9; ..and that would work. Since fahrenheit is double, the 32 will get converted to 32.0 before subtracting.  Since (fahrenheit-32) is double, the 5 will converted to 5.0 before multiplying.  And 9 will get converted to 9.0 before dividing.  The suggested code, though, makes the intended conversions explicit and clear (to anyone who knows C++, at least.)", 7079, "EuN4zRCLaa", 1],
