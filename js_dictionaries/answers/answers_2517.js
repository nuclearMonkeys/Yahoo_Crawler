	131679 : ["Dogs grieve. Your dog is missing his companion just like you are. In the 1800's in Edinburgh Scotland there was a man and a little Skye terrier named Bobby. The dog and man were together for two years and then the man died. Bobby was practically the only one at the man's funeral. After the man was buried Bobby remained at the man's grave. Bobby stayed by the grave through summer and winter, through snow and rain. The towns people fed the little dog. Bobby stayed devoted and near his masters grave until his own death 14 years later. The town buried Bobby beside his master and erected a statue of the Skye terrier in the cemetery. Isn't this a wonderful story about loyalty and friendship and a little dog named Bobby? Just give your dog more attention and time to heal his heart and life. If another dog is what your family would like than by all means get one.", 11109, "0vhm04lgaa", 0],

	131681 : ["How others perceive you is very important in the job market. Wrestling is a career. To have a well-established career, you must have a reputable reputation. Your actions speak louder than your words. In the world of pro-wrestling, I'd say that this is no exception. I will display my reason with two examples.Your moral fiber and character resonate on others to how you are to be reflected. If you are a hard worker, co-workers and management will take notice. Being a hard worker is a positive trait associated with being responsible, loyal, and trustworthy. That factors into how successful you be with how you are booked. If you have pride and instill positivity, you are more often to be worked with. If you are lazy, management and co-workers have the moral to worry about and you aren't trustworthy. You will have no positive traits to contribute to the business, therefore, you will not be respected as much.", 11105, "UvjQTnLlaa", 1],
	131682 : ["It depends on what promotion you're talking about.  In TNA and the WWE, I do believe politics have been a major issue in who gets pushed.  As much as I love Austin Aries, and as much as I think he's a great wrestler and an awesome performer all around, he wouldn't be in his position if it weren't for the fact that Bischoff and Hogan both saw something in him and Aries started cleaning up his act in regards to how professional he'd react toward TNA.   Likewise in the WWE if you aren't in with certain people, you're not going to get pushed.  Just ask Sheamus, Triple H's golfing buddy.  Punk's guilty of it too.  As much as he is for speaking his mind, he wouldn't have gotten anywhere without buttering up Vince to his ideas.   People on the main stage really do have to suck up.  It doesn't matter how over you are.  Guys like The Miz, Zack Ryder, and Daniel Bryan can attest to that.  I mean, Daniel Bryan was fired at the height of his popularity and the WWE resentfully hired him back so they could try and bury him.  The Young Bucks got fired from TNA and wouldn't get picked up by the WWE simply because they neglected to shake Booker T's hand during a tryout and he got the word out to his boy Rob Van Dam and TNA blackballed them too.  OVER A HANDSHAKE.  Robert Roode lost Bound For Glory Series last year because Hogan decided at the last minute that he \"Wasn't the guy (To be the face of the company), brother\".Meanwhile, in the same PPV, Hogan makes a face turn and you begin to wonder if he was worried Roode would steal his spotlight.   The bottom line is that you wont get over anymore unless TNA offices or Vince McMahon like you. BA: No.  Some kind of structure is necessary backstage, and with any structure comes a hierarchy.  You just have to make sure that structure doesn't become a caste system.", 11105, "7sa6B6Qhaa", 4],

	131700 : ["My guess is that your dog that died was the more dominant of the two.  So your dog is not only feeling the loss of its companion but also its leader.  So, I am not sure that a replacement dog would work since your dog would be the pack leader to the younger dog, and it doesn't want that role.  My suggestion is that you fill in and play the role until time brings about the recovery.

	131701 : ["It's highly unlikely that a dog would still be mourning the loss of a companion that he lost 4 months ago. A dog does mourn, but only for a few weeks if not a few days. It is unhealthy for him to still be mourning after that long amount of time. A dog is made to mourn the loss of a friend, but to move on,just as everyone must.  If you are still mourning, the dog will sense that and if you never move on, neither will your dog, and that's not fair to the dog. The dog will never be normal and healthy again if you don't give him the chance to move on.  A dog will sense your mourning, negativity, and hopelessness and will NEVER move on if you don't. So keep the memory of your beloved dog in your heart but try to move on. Your dog we be happy and grateful when you do.  ' HOPE THIS HELPED!! (=", 11109, "OAcrpuXeaa", -1],

	131707 : ["Yes. Randy Orton is a good example. He was handpicked by HHH before he debuted in the WWE as the next big baby face of the company.

	131708 : ["In my opinion, a wrestler's success is highly influenced by backstage politics. There are so many great wrestlers who failed to be big because of politics. And there are so many big name wrestlers who got more success because of politics. But, in my opinion, very rarely wrestlers became big because of politics. There are some examples that I would like to name here. Hulk Hogan and Triple H are two wrestlers that got more success because of politics. Hulk Hogan worked his way all to the top, taking WWE mainstream. But, that made him cocky and thinks that he's bigger than business, thus he starts using his creative control in his last years in WWE and of course in his WCW days. Hogan got more success because of this, while he should have stayed out of spotlight in 1997, after losing clean to Sting at Starrcade 1997. So, Hogan got more title reigns (including 1993 in WWE), it was because of politics. And he got more wins (the times he refuses to lose) because of politics. Nobody can force Hogan to lose since he had that creative control. Triple H is the same case with Hulk Hogan. Triple H worked his @ss all way to the top, from being fired from WCW, getting suspended in WWE, making his way back to the top, and eventually became a main eventer and World Champion. Triple H had gone through all of that. He eventually married Stephanie McMahon and from there he would gain more success by using politics. Triple H had more power than anyone else in WWE and can do anything he wants. As you can see, Triple H had buried countless wrestlers such as Umaga, Booker T, Carlito, RVD, etc. Triple H is just as bad as Hulk Hogan was, he is the modern day Hulk Hogan. So, his success are mainly self booked. There's no denying that Triple H is great, but he got more than what he deserves because of backstage politic. Those are the examples of wrestlers whose success got influenced by politics. And now you ask if it is possible for a wrestler to become a successful main eventer and World Champion without playing the politics game, or does he have to kiss @ss, join cliques, and be a \"yes man\" doing whatever the bosses tell him to, to get the big pushes and big titles. This is very hard to answer, but like I say Hulk Hogan and Triple H did that. They worked their @ss to the top. Anyway, I would like to give you another example and that man is Chris Benoit. Chris Benoit was long known as a quiet person, a loner who lacked of social skills. All he cared was about Pro Wrestling. He trained his @ss in Hart Dungeon and New Japan Dojo to become the best Pro Wrestler. Chris Benoit never cared about gimmick, becoming a main eventer, or even becoming a World Champion. All he cared was to amaze the Fans with his great performance.   But, all the promoters saw all the hardwork Chris Benoit had done. Although he lacked charisma, his pure wrestling talent made him very well respected by his peers and Fans. Eventually, Vince McMahon made him a main eventer and a World Champion at Wrestlemania 20. Chris Benoit never had anything to do with politics, kiss @ss, etc. He never even cares about fake World Titles. I also believe that Eddie Guerrero never have anything to do with politics. BQ : No. Pro Wrestling business won't be able to survive without backstage politics. The backstage politics would show that there are wrestlers who really wanted to be big, to get a higher position in Pro Wrestling business. And this will pretty much motivate them to be bigger.", 11105, "kXrohLMjaa", 1],
