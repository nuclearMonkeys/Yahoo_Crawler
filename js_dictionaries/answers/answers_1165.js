So there really is geological evidence which are definitely found in the science books...not religious. This goes to show that the Bible is truly well-founded and established and the scriptures tried, tested and true. Here is the information I located: -- Since, as the Genesis account says, “all the tall mountains” were covered with water, where is all that water now? Evidently it is right here on the earth. It is believed that there was a time when the oceans were smaller and the continents were larger than they are now, as is evidenced by river channels extending far out under the oceans. It should also be noted that scientists have stated that mountains in the past were much lower than at present, and some mountains have even been pushed up from under the seas. As to the present situation, it is said that “there is ten times as much water by volume in the ocean as there is land above sea level. Dump all this land evenly into the sea, and water would cover the entire earth, one and one-half miles deep.” (National Geographic, January 1945, p. 105) So, after the floodwaters fell, but before the raising of mountains and the lowering of seabeds and before the buildup of polar ice caps, there was more than enough water to cover “all the tall mountains,” as the inspired record says.—Ge 7:19. Effect on the Earth. With the Deluge great changes came, for example, the life span of humans dropped very rapidly. Some have suggested that prior to the Flood the waters above the expanse shielded out some of the harmful radiation and that, with the waters gone, cosmic radiation genetically harmful to man increased. However, the Bible is silent on the matter. Incidentally, any change in radiation would have altered the rate of formation of radioactive carbon-14 to such an extent as to invalidate all radiocarbon dates prior to the Flood. With the sudden opening of the ‘springs of the watery deep' and “the floodgates of the heavens,” untold billions of tons of water deluged the earth. (Ge 7:11) This may have caused tremendous changes in earth's surface. The earth's crust is relatively thin (estimated at between 30 km [20 mi] and 160 km [100 mi] thick), stretched over a rather plastic mass thousands of kilometers in diameter. Hence, under the added weight of the water, there was likely a great shifting in the crust. In time new mountains evidently were thrust upward, old mountains rose to new heights, shallow sea basins were deepened, and new shorelines were established, with the result that now about 70 percent of the surface is covered with water. This shifting in the earth's crust may account for many geologic phenomena, such as the raising of old coastlines to new heights. It has been estimated by some that water pressures alone were equal to “2 tons per square inch,” sufficient to fossilize fauna and flora quickly.—See The Biblical Flood and the Ice Epoch, by D. Patten, 1966, p. 62. What evidence proves that there truly was a global deluge? Other possible evidence of a drastic change: Remains of mammoths and rhinoceroses have been found in different parts of the earth. Some of these were found in Siberian cliffs; others were preserved in Siberian and Alaskan ice. (PICTURE, Vol. 1, p. 328) In fact, some were found with food undigested in their stomachs or still unchewed in their teeth, indicating that they died suddenly. It is estimated, from the trade in ivory tusks, that bones of tens of thousands of such mammoths have been found. The fossil remains of many other animals, such as lions, tigers, bears, and elk, have been found in common strata, which may indicate that all of these were destroyed simultaneously. Some have pointed to such finds as definite physical proof of a rapid change in climate and sudden destruction caused by a universal flood. Others, however, favor explanations for the death of these animals that do not involve an earth-wide catastrophe. Proof that the Flood occurred is not dependent on such fossils and frozen animal remains. --- it-1  page 609-612   WT Library", 8214, "HziXc5Ovaa", 3],

Never.   Evolution is, and always has been since Darwin, the concept of MANY small mutations piled on small mutations, relentlessly culled by natural selection to only the beneficial mutations, for thousands upon thousands of generations.   The fact that you fail to understand that ... and think that speciation is caused by a single \"positive mutation\", just reveals that you have rejected a theory that you don't understand *AT ALL*.

An open-minded person would recognize that the overwhelming *CONSENSUS* (not just majority) of scientists in the world absolutely endorse evolution as one of the two cornerstone theories of modern biology ... and would honestly wonder *WHY*.  Why would there be such an overwhelming consensus among the hundreds of thousands of professional scientists in the world ... pretty much anybody with a PhD. in biology, biochemistry, genetics, organic chemistry, paleontology, zoology, botany, etc. etc. ... endorse an idea without *CONSIDERABLE* amount of evidence?  Why would so many brilliant people agree on a concept as central as evolution, if it was as easily shown to be absurd as you seem to think it is?

If clergymen and the religious cannot live up to the moralities that they're pushing, then why should I be given them at face price? General examination of the Bible confirmed obvious inconsistencies and biases (many the result of repeated translations and modifications), which led me to reject the concept of divine authorship. The truth that i'm a scientist failed to directly lead to my fitting an atheist, but it surely made it less difficult to be given. I will look on the wonders of the world and provide an explanation for them with absolutely typical way, and those I can't explain, i can investigate (even supposing i do not in finding an answer inside my lifetime, there are still advantages from the method of investigation itself). In other words, I take remedy in skills, rather than claiming that lack of knowledge is skills (or that lack of awareness is a advantage). So, finally, I rejected my religion because i could not believe folks that had taught it to me in the first location. I settled into atheism when you consider that I felt no need to give an explanation for the world through a divine being or old traditions - in other phrases, there was no \"God formed hole\" in my life. Simply to clarify, i am no longer claiming that everyone else is incorrect, or that I somehow have \"the reply\". I don't.

There is also the fact that there are many other religions out there and who's to say which one is right.

Problem is we don't know, which is why I am specifically agnostic. Until we have answers, I don't believe we should be jumping to the conclusions religion basically makes up.
