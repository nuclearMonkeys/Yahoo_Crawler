Others take a subway or light rail train. Lucky ones walk. Some fools in Texas drive 1/2 mile to work. Payday, the mom or wife (usually women- in Texas anyway) go to a food supermarket and buy a weeks worth of boxes of dry and frozen foods. Some eat fresher food. Many get a \"bucket\" from Colonel Sanders (KFC) for the supper meal, some cook. Watch TV, go too bed and the rat race begins again tomorrow. Vacation time (for those who GET paid vacations) are often spent working for EXTRA MONEY!! Many Americans are content to never leave the Home Shores. It can be different- any scenario you can imagine. ", 4797, "AA11835015", 0],
	31372 : ["For me that would be hire a car.   At least you'd not be tied to rail times, much as SwissRail is extremely reliable.    Having a car would mean you can get off the beaten tracks (excuse pun) and see things you won't see from the train.   However if you can't be bothered with having somebody do the driving, then use the train.  ", 4798, "iNsBFkZ3aa", 2],

	31374 : ["Hiring a car is cheaper but make sure you stick to the speed limits and park only in the right places or you'll get a massive fine. The railways are extortionately expensive and also many scenic routes are privatized so you have to pay separately for them. Check out where you want to go, the timings and how much it costs first. If money is no object then go by train. It's charming.", 4798, "None", 1],

	31382 : ["That is how the 'market makers' make $$$ with the stock market.  The game (which is what the stock market is for) is akin to a casino, or a carnival midway.  The people who lose $$$ into the market, are having their $$$ go to those who have the inside information.  \"Congress shall be the only creator of currency\" or something to that effect - the market cannot create new $$, and so that funding for the 'winners' comes from the 'losers'.  Just like the lottery, the prizes are paid for by the purchase of tickets.  At least the lottery tells us the formula for determining how quickly the prize increases. Thrump and every other richbitch plays the market in this way, buying low, and selling high after triggering the ability for the prices to move.  It's how the game works, just like every other single thing in our society.  Get the masses to pay for it, they are generally unknowing about it all anyhow.", 4791, "None", 3],
