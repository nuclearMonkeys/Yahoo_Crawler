Puff Pastry  225g (1 1/2 cups) plain flour  Pinch of salt  30g lard, chopped  125ml (1/2 cup) iced water  200g butter Place the flour and salt in a large bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the lard into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Add the water and use a round-bladed knife to stir until a dough forms. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead until just smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.  Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out the dough to a 10 x 30cm rectangle. Place butter between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and tap with a rolling pin to make a 8 x 9cm rectangle. Lay dough on a lightly floured surface with a short edge closest to you. Remove the plastic wrap from the butter and place in the centre of the dough. Fold the end closest to you over the butter, then fold the opposite end over the top (the butter should now be enclosed in the dough).  Turn dough 90° clockwise and gently press edges together. Use a lightly floured rolling pin to gently tap to flatten butter. Roll out dough to a 10 x 30cm rectangle and repeat folding process as before. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.  Remove dough from the fridge and repeat rolling and folding process 2 more times. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest. Repeat rolling and folding process a further 2 times and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.

Notes Makes: the equivalent of 3 sheets (25 x 25cm) ready-rolled puff pastry  Prep: 30 mins (+ 2 hours resting time)  Lard is rendered animal fat and is available in the dairy section of your supermarket, near the butter.  Top tips:  When making puff pastry, both the ingredients and the equipment should be as cool as possible.  Chill dough between folding so the butter doesn't melt into the dough and the layers remain separate.  Use a short, quick rolling action so the butter is gradually and evenly distributed between the layers.  Roll lightly so the butter doesn't tear the layers and break through.  The pastry should be chilled and rested before cooking and the oven must be hot so the pastry puffs before the butter melts and runs out.  When cutting and trimming pastry, use a sharp knife that cuts quickly and easily without dragging.", 9832, "None", 6],

AMD Phenom II AM3 Black Edition is very powerful and support ultra overclocking... :) AMD Phenom II Black Edition is faster and the 6-core Operaton is also comparable.

AMD is 30% faster than Intel in HD viewing and picture editing. AMD will be the first to make a Directx 11 Processor.

Kill tougher critters, get better loot so you can go kill tougher critters and take their loot, ad infinitum... I don't like the constant connection thing myself because as a network engineer, I know full well how flakey the internet is...  Yes I can understand WHY they did it but I still don't have to like it.  I also think it's inexcusable that they had server problems.  What was the beta for, if not to stress test a small number of servers?  And they also knew in advance how many copies they had pre-sold.  Sheesh, Blizzard.  I expected better from the likes of you. I didn't play the first Diablo but did put some considerable time into Diablo 2 - especially after the addon was released.  The constant hunt for loot can be quite addictive which is both good and bad - for obvious reasons. There have been reports of people finishing their first run-through in 12 hours solo, or just over 7 hours in a team.  However I think these folks are missing the point.  And anyways, the game doesn't get REAL interesting until you start playing at the higher difficulty levels which you have to unlock by playing through the easier ones first. One of the new features I'm interested to see how it does is the in-game auction houses.  You'll be able to take your excess stuff and sell at the auction house for either in-game gold....or real cash.  Blizzard takes a cut for the cash auctions so this should turn into a revenue stream for them as well.  I don't think you'll be able to make a living just by selling loot, although you know a lot of people are going to try to do just that. If you want to try the game, each copy comes with a guest pass.  Just ask a friend who bought the game to give you the pass.  You'll be able to download a limited version that only contains the first part of the first act which should give you a pretty good idea of what you're in for. Or you can buy the Diablo Warchest from just about any store that sells PC games.  This includes Diablo 1, Diablo 2 and the Lords Of Destruction addon for Diablo 2.

	102887 : ["they DON'T go at 60Hz.   That would be 60 revs per second.   Ideal turbine blade speed is governed by the speed of the blade tip.   You always want the best ratio of tip speed to wind speed for optimal energy capture.   Until recently, most wind turbines could only go at one speed, so you picked the tip speed that was best for your expected wind speed, and then decided how long the blade was, and that told you how fast it should spin.    The longer the blade, the slower the rotation rate.  You then need a gearbox to get to mains frequency in the alternator (50Hz or 60Hz, depending on which side of the pond you are) Nowadays most wind turbines are variable speed so they adjust their rotation speed to the windspeed to increase the energy capture - they go slower at low windspeeds.   They are also getting bigger, which means they must naturally reduce the rotation rate in the design. That comes out at something around 15 revs per minute. You can also reduce the rotation rate by having more blades - but there are engineering problems with that.   Notably, the bit of wind turbines that is most likely to fail is the gearbox.   The higher the gearbox ratio, the more times you'll have to nurse it.  So ideally you want the fastest rotor speed - and that means the smallest number of blades.   A single bladed machine is virtually impossible to balance (though an italian company did manufacture one for a while) and a twin bladed machine is still very tricky to balance (and twin blades spook people for some reason).   That's why three blades is now standard - the so-called \"Danish model\". And finally: I got a letter from the RSPB some years ago supporting positively a proposed wind turbine.   The reason?
