St Enoch center is a mall, Buchan Galleries is another mall within walking distance of each other  very busy city a bit like New York. If you have a car got to Stirling Castle much better than Edinburgh Castle it is where William Wallace is and the Wallace monument its great if you climb to the top the view is worth it. The oldest house in glasgow is great and there is a Peoples Palace all the history of the city and go to Glasgow City council website it will give you great information. great food in most pubs and cheaper than most restaurants if you like chinese go to Sauchiehall Street across from British Home stores upstairs to China Palace cheap and great. Pavillion Theatre usually has great shows on along with the Kings Theatre both old but great . Inverness is another great city I have family up there if you need tour guide they would be happy to help. good luck The best place to stay is the Holiday Inn Express which is in the center of the city and no need for a car there plenty of buses, trains the train is only 30 minute journey to Edinburgh or if you got to Gourock down beside the seaside great wee place , food good and ice cream the best. The subway is great too. contact me if you need any other information'", 9997, "hPyDO6PBaa", 1],

	107363 : ["Of course He does! Phil. 2:6-8 states: “Though he was God, he did not demand and cling to his rights as God. He made himself nothing; he took the humble position of a slave and appeared in human form. And in human form he obediently humbled himself even further by dying a criminal's death on a cross.” (NLT) Since Jesus appeared as a man, and because one of the duties of man is to worship and pray to God, it was proper for Jesus to call the Father “my God” and to address him in prayer. Because Jesus retained his humanity even after he was glorified (1 Tim. 2:5: For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men, the MAN Christ Jesus) in order to serve as our mediator, it is proper for him to continue addressing the Father as “my God.” The question is, has Jesus ALWAYS addressed the Father as his God? You'll find the answer to this question in Psalm 22. Read the whole chapter to confirm that this is a prophecy concerning Jesus. Then go back and take note of verse 10: \"Upon You I was cast from birth; You have been my God from my mother's womb.\" The Bible is clear that Jesus existed in heaven prior to being born on earth. It is equally clear that the Father became the God of Jesus from the time Jesus took on humanity, while he was in the womb of Mary.", 9990, "8pIGQdybaa", 1],

	107365 : ["I'm going to keep with the eye makeup themed answers. It can transform your whole appearance. Smoky eyes: Dramatic eye makeup works beautifully with glossy lips. 1. Brush a deep shadow on your upper lids and into the crease. 2. Draw a line out from the center of the lower lid with a pencil and smudge gently in each direction with a hard-pressed Q-tip. 3. Offset the dark with light: a stroke of vanilla, off-white, or bone shadow under the arch. 4. Apply black mascara. Stylized: A graphic, gamine eye pairs up perfectly with simple matte red lips. 1. Apply a wash of light, pale shadow to your upper lids. 2. Draw a smooth line with black pencil or eyeliner on the upper lash lines. 3. Highlight under the arch with a stroke of vanilla, off-white, or bone shadow. 4. Apply black mascara. These two looks (the former for evening, the latter for daytime) are easy to pull off and will definitely make you look older. If you notice, the color pallette is very open-ended, using general terms like \"dark shadow\" so you can fill them in with whatever colors are best for your eyes. Another thing to keep in mind is dark eye liner can be dramatic and beautiful but go easy on it if you're light skinned. A celebrity whose eyes are always GORGEOUS in my opinion is Winona Ryder. She uses shades of grey and brown to give herself a sophisticated air. You can learn how to achieve this look here:   I've tried this and it's so glamorous!", 9995, "AA10424951", 0],

	107375 : ["Yes = \"But to the Son He says: \"Your throne, O God, is forever and ever... Therefore God, Your God, has annointed You.\" (Hebrews 1:8,9) This is also in the OT from Psalm 45:6,7.  Here's strong proof that Jesus is God.  And it will be for a sign and for a witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the Lord because of the oppressors, and He will SEND them a SAVIOR and a Mighty One, and He will deliver them - Isaiah 19:20.  Now connect that to this next one. \"I, even I, am the Lord, and besides Me there is no SAVIOR. I have declared and saved, I have proclaimed, and there was no foreign god among you; therefore you are My witness,\" says the Lord, \"that I am God.\" - Isaiah 43:11,12.  In the 1st Scripture it says He will send them a SAVIOR who will deliver them. In the 2nd passage of Scripture, from the same book, Isaiah, the Lord says that He is the SAVIOR and that He is God. He's the same person. He will send them a SAVIOR, and the SAVIOR is God. Plain and simple. Jesus Christ is Lord, and Jesus Christ is SAVIOR, and Jesus Christ is God. Proven here with the above OT Scripture. Jesus said, \"I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me.\" - John 10:25.  Jesus answered them, \"I and My Father are one.\" - John 10:30  Jesus said, \"If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.\" - John 10:37,38.  Jesus said, \"He who has seen Me has seen the Father.\" (John 14:9). Jesus answered them, \"Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.\" - John 8:36. He was talking about sin and being free from being a slave of sin.  Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either... - 1 John 2:22,23.  He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life - 1 John 5:12.", 9990, "KgGDlXpqaa", -3],
	107376 : ["Wear mascara AND eyeliner...wearing mascara without eyeliner makes you look younger.  Also, depending on how much eyebrow hair you have, fill in your eyebrows.  You wouldn't believe how defined, thicker eyebrows make somebody look older.  Try a more dramatic lip in a deep color and then a little bit of blush so you don't look washed out.  I also think hair has a little bit to do with how old you look, so try to avoid bangs - they automatically make you look younger.  Another way to look older is to dress older...try blazers and jackets.  Heels can also help you appear older by making you taller.  Good luck!", 9995, "None", 0],

And who says God gives opportunity to earn and do duty? If you argue that God gives everything good, then you  have to accept that God gives everything bad also. Well, maybe you do not have an open mind to look at the misery and pain the world is undergoing, maybe you just want to stay in your self-created shell, where you always maintain that God is good. Or maybe you've never seen enough pain or death. But when the bad times come you'll see how grandly God protects you, how much care he provides you.
