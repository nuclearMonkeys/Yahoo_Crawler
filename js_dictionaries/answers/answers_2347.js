	123166 : ["The health benefits of male circumcision include a drop in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life by up to 90 percent. ... It drops the risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition by about 60 percent. It drops the risk of HPV, herpes virus and other infectious genital ulcers. This is one reason why circumcision is a health benefit. Trust me it isn't harmful at all. It's easier to clean and to take care of. In fact I have a lot of guy friends who got circumcised when they were 18, they don't regret the decision at all they say that sex feels better when a guy is circumcised because the penis head is more sensitive now that it's out. the circumcision that you're thinking of that is harmful is female genital mutilation which is practiced in some African countries to make sure a girl doesn't have sex until marriage which is sort of good because it means no sleeping around with any man but at the same time it's horrible because they take out your labias and clitoris so sex will never feel nice again and then they stich up your vagina with a small hole left for period blood and urine. However infections can build up underneath and when the girl gets married her husband is to tear it open and a woman can die from this barbaric ritual while giving birth. Also with FGM they don't use anesthesia, making it extremely painful, whereas with male circumcision, it's often done when the boy is a few days old in a hospital or if he's Jewish or Muslim, in a synagogue or mosque with specially trained professionals. Also they will not remember anything, for example when my little brother was having his circumcision done he actually slept through the whole procedure. If it's done in adulthood, you can have anesthesia and the circumcision procedure only takes 30 minutes, maybe even less.", 10740, "None", -1],
	123167 : ["You would probably have a different opinion if you had had a female circumcision forced on you as a child, leaving your own genitals mutilated and scarred.      And your statement is certainly unbelievable, as penile cancer is very rare, and even can occur with circumcised males.    Obviously, amputation of the parts of the female anatomy forming the female foreskin---the clitoral hood, would also be \"cleaner,\" and uncircumcised women frequently get infections down there, and also cancer. And male circumcision is not a \"one size fits all.\"      The damage varies wildly from individual to individual, and can cause complete sexual dysfunction for some.      In any event, it diminishes a male's sexual feeling and function. Males in Europe, Scandinavia, South America., who aren't circumcised are not dropping dead bythe thousands, and in fact they have a reputation as being better lovers than American males. An undamaged penis obviously will feel and function better than a damaged one. Circumcision is a fraud and a hoax. A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.

	123182 : ["To stereotype both sides a little to start with:  Democrats tend to be more socially conscious and want progress and reform.  That is stressful feeling a social responsibility to help and seeing all of the problems with the world.    Republicans tend to want to keep things where they are and are more concerned with themselves, since they put responsibility for individuals to help themselves. The questions are very subjective though.  So, for example, it is possible a group of Republicans would answer the survey saying they are happy and a group of Democrats answer they are not, but if outside observers watched how they lived their lives and their overall mood, they might see it much differently than the people they are observing do because of different ideas of happiness. Maybe Democrats are setting the bar higher for happiness, or maybe even when the Democrats are in power, the people still feel that the government is too far to the right.  Maybe the easier it is for you to be happy, the more likely you will be a Republican. These kind of surveys are fascinating, but they shouldn't be taken at face value (i.e. in this case, it can't simply be said Republicans are happier).  It is impossible to completely control an experiment through asking people subjective questions.  There are too many variables, but it interesting to think what those variables might be.

Democrats are seen as whiny while Republicans are seen as selfish and evil. Whether or not there is any truth to that, who knows, but I do think that Republicans may be more self-reliant and self-sufficient than Democrats. Democrats see all the problems while Republicans see all the opportunity. I'm not suggesting that either is all bad or all good. I just think that the mindset may be different for each group which would affect happiness.", 10742, "None", 0],
	123184 : ["I have a few theories, which are also discussed in the article, part of which I've quoted below. 1. Republicans have more money.  However, according to the article, \"poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats; middle-income Republicans are happier than middle-income Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats.\"  Nevertheless, money gives you choices and power to enact those choices.  If your basic needs are met, you are happier. 2. Republicans may be more likely to be white, and therefore not subject to the racism suffered by blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and Middle Easterners.  Racism is like whipmarks across the back of self-esteem. 3. Conservatives are more likely to believe that they can be whatever they want, and that those who aren't are lazy or untalented.  Liberals are more sensitive to the sufferings of others, and are more aware of factors beyond one's control--economics, injustice, lack of opportunity, bigotted sabotage--that keeps some people down. 4. Over the past few decades churchgoers have been lured into believing that moral and religious equals Republican and conservative, and so are voting Republican.  Association with God, and frequent attendance to worship services, makes people happier. Now here's a quote from the article: \"Republicans tend to have more money than Democrats, and -- as we've already discovered -- people who have more money tend to be happier. But even this explanation only goes so far. If one controls for household income, Republicans still hold a significant edge: that is, poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats; middle-income Republicans are happier than middle-income Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats. Might ideology be the key? It's true that conservatives, who are more likely to be Republican, are happier than liberals, who are more likely to be Democrats. But even controlling for this ideological factor, a significant partisan gap remains. Conservative Republicans are happier than conservative Democrats, and moderate/liberal Republicans are happier than liberal Democrats. Hmmm, what other factors might be at play? Well, there's always... Religiosity People who attend religious services weekly or more are happier (43% very happy) than those who attend monthly or less (31%); or seldom or never (26%). This correlation between happiness and frequency of church attendance has been a consistent finding in the General Social Surveys taken over the years.", 10742, "AA10091424", 0],

There is evidence that circumcision may be moderately beneficial in decreasing the likelihood of transmission of HIV and HPV, though there is some debate about whether that is the case in the United States (where more effective methods, such as condoms and the HPV vaccine, are widely available).  That being said, there are arguments about the reduction in sensation from loss of the foreskin, and general desensitization of the glans of the penis that happens after circumcision.  This ultimately boils down to a more individual experience (having been circumcised as an adult, I personally haven't noticed a significant change in terms of sensation during intercourse).

This is true regardless of which religion they have chosen.  Many studies indicate that among voters who are lower-income, there is a clear breakdown in terms of religious fervor, with more fervent religious believers much more likely to identify as Republicans.  In fact, demographic studies of the Republican party have revealed that the Republican base has two clearly differentiable elements:  affluent Americans (no more likely to have strong religious beliefs than affluent Democrats), and lower- to middle-income Americans with very strong religious beliefs.  By contrast, most Democratic voters are lower- to middle-class but are less likely to report they have strongly held religious beliefs. Look again at the Pew study.  Those who have more money are more likely to report being happy.  Those who have strong religious beliefs are more likely to report being happy.
