	89578 : ["Well, I've been to a Halloween (weekend) wedding (it was the 30th of October), but the Halloween theme didn't extend any further than the cake and decorations. You sound like a pretty fun-loving, laid-back couple to consider this.  I'm not sure I'd be crazy about the idea, because I think the point of a wedding and reception is to celebrate the beginning of your new life together with your nearest and dearest.  All the costumes might detract from the point - people will be trying to figure out who somebody is dressed as, who's behind the mask, etc., instead of paying attention to the proceedings. Just make sure this is what you want, because getting married isn't something you do every day.  If, after careful consideration, you decide this is right for you, then that's great! Best of luck and congrats to you.", 9334, "AA10592697", 2],

Its fun to see how many people want to poke at it and smell it, Try these candy bars: Almond Joy, Take 5, Hershey's Cookies and Cream, Whatchamacalit, Kit Kat, Twix, Peppermint Patty, Mounds, Symphony with fruit, and Snickers.", 9333, "UwYztUHuaa", 0],

Each bottle can be filled at different levels, they do not have to be full and set on a table with paper and pens or pastel pencils, I typed up my guess slips asking the guest name, bottle letter and their guess. The closest guess wins the bottle of candy. Also, if you want to give the guest a feeling of love and warmth toward the baby you can type up forms for the guest to fill out with their name and a pearl of advice for the baby, the mom can put in the baby book.", 9333, "AA10428745", 0],

Those folks receiving Social Security have to watch their income.  If you over a certain level you will have to pay taxes on that.  You do not pay taxes on Social Security, you pay taxes on income, earned income.  Yes, that is fair. You folks aware there are millions of well to do seniors/elderly in America?  The wealthiest generation in America are the Baby Boomers.  Most of them do not need Social Security.  Unfortunately there plenty that do need it and some that will have to continue to work.

	89593 : ["I've seen a Halloween wedding and infact, its my favorite holliday of all time. I think it would be awesome. The wedding I saw was really cool. They had fog machines set up and the bride was like a corpse bride and the groom was a vampire. It was way cool. You could set up jack-o-lanterns carved with hearts and wedding themes. Make sure to use the battery operated tea lites though because a fire at your wedding/reception is definately a downer. I've often thought of a Halloween wedding where the bride is dressed as a princess and the groom is dressed as a knight. I think that would be cool. You could hold either the ceremony or reception in an old antique barn which would totally add to the ambiance. I've seen pictures in a magizine that had that theme and it was so rustic and beautiful (believe it or not). Search through the October wedding magizines to come up with ideas. I really think its a fantastic idea.", 9334, "2q0HUf2Maa", 3],

Just an FYI, if you have people with kids, especially younger kids, they will not attend your wedding because of the kids and trick or treating. There are 2 holidays that are super fun when you have kids, Chirstmas and Halloween, and sadly both are holidays that dont really last because the kids outgrow them quickly.   they find out about   and Halloween comes to a point where they want to go out with friends instead of their parents and it also becomes about the candy instead of the dressing up and going door to door. When we were told about his cousins date of 10/31 my husband immediately got so angry and said \"no\" to the invitation. And as we have spoken with the other parents invited each has said the same thing to us. There is nothing wrong with a Halloween wedding, but be prepared for quite a few declines from people with young kids. PS Alot of people wont want to dress up either, that would also get alot of no replys in my social circle, so either make it an optional thing or dont do it at all.", 9334, "752dae63ebe2a79c118bfda479a539f7aa", -2],
