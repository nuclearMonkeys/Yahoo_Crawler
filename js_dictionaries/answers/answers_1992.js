	105346 : ["Many people think that dreams mean something. But that isn't necessarily true. Dreams actually mean nothing. Although it probably is not what you want to hear, but it is the truth! Although it may be disappointing but, modern medicine has proved that dreams are nothing more than a succession of images recalling past memory. I'm sorry if this is not what you want to believe. I will start off telling you that ALL dreams mean nothing! Dreams just express you or your emotions, they express what you feel and what you do in real life. thats why they feel so real. Dreams cannot create people, places and things thats another reason why they feel so real! dreams recall past memory, -for example if you see a person you don't recognize in dreams, you probably saw him before on TV or walking in the street (you probably didn't pay attention to them). Dreams express your emotions and thoughts in a negative way Nothing. The dream was about nothing. dreams mean nothing they just express your emotions and feelings in a symbolic way. Dreams are simple synapses in your brain firing off all sorts of things. Your brain gathers all this random information, sights, sounds and so forth. And as you are sleeping, these sights and essentially memories are jumbled up into one big mess, just random nonsense, and your brain works and works for an hour or so trying to create a nice little story with all of these sights and sounds because it wants to make sense of it. It wants to make sense out of nonsense! So, then you end up with this dream. This happens several times in one night but when you wake up, you forget all of them, and when you do remember one of them, when you do remember at least one dream, we try to make sense of it. We tell ourselves, what is this? What could it mean. When in reality, it means nothing, it is just complete nonsense. So stop trying to make sense of it, it is nothing! Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions and sensations occurring involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.

	105366 : ["'Ello Ivy! :D 1.) Have you ever asked for a plot idea ( don't be ashamed to say yes or no to this question.) -No, but I've asked for help on my plot. Does that count? :P 6.) Have you ever answered a “ Give me a plot,” idea? What did you answer back with? Yes. When I just joined - at the beginning - I actually did give them a plot. An extremely boring, cliched plot, because I figured they could elaborate themselves and maybe they just have trouble coming up with ideas. Later I acquired the philosophy that it's easier to come up with ideas if you exercise your imagination. So if people have already told a guy to come up with his own ideas, I'll write about walls, clementines, keyboards and whatever I happen to see next to me. XD 7.) Are you disappointed with the lack of hard work with coming up with ideas when you see a “ I need a plot” question? ( rate 1-5.) It depends. If it's just a blatant, incredibly lazy, \"All the world is serving me so you better answer\" with an added \"HURRY UP??!!???!!\", I say 4-5. If it's more of an \"All my ideas suck and I can't come up with any good ones\", I'll go 1-2 because there's always a point where you learn something. As long as they're humble enough, I don't get annoyed. 8.) Do you believe in those people who blame their inability to come up with a plot on “writer's block.” ( give me an opinion.) There are certain cases where I do believe \"writer's block\" exists - although I know little about it, I'd say the death of someone close to you would count as one. (Maybe some people start spouting poetry while the rest are inspiration-dry?). For myself, I haven't encountered much more writer's block than not being happy with my plot and not getting a start on it. XD But if it's a two day \"Someone insulted my writing so I feel down, give me some good ideas for a change?\", that doesn't qualify. 9.) What do you want to see more of in the future with \"give me a plot,\" questions? ( i.e: they aren't asking for a full plot or et cetera.) I'm agreeable to questions on plot inconsistencies or other troubles, as long as they know what they're writing about and not asking you to do work for them. Sometimes people realize there's something wrong with their plot and don't know how best they should change it. I asked a few questions on whether or not I should have scrapped my plot... I'm not going to, but I have backtracked a lot. :D", 9917, "C4q8haQZaa", 1],

So, I decided to search “plot ideas” in the search bar because I'm sure with how many of these questions I see, there must be over a hundred results. There are over a thousand results. Ha-ha!  I've noticed that since I joined in 2008, when people ask for story ideas, they get the least of what they expected. Meaning: two years ago, some users would have actually given you ideas and stuff like that. Now all you'll be getting is “ Do it yourself.” ( and the occasional duck and tiffany lamp.)  Anyways, a lot of users sometimes think that we're being “snitty” when we don't give a plot ideas, others disagree, and some don't really care.  I just want opinions for the future. 1 means strongly disagree, three is no opinion, and five is strongly agree. I'm going to do a questionnaire with rates from 1-5 on some questions. You may skip questions if they don't apply to you. 1.) Have you ever asked for a plot idea ( don't be ashamed to say yes or no to this question.) Nope. I have what's called an imagination. 2.) How happy have you been with the answers you've received to the question ( rate 1-5.) 4/5 3.) How unhappy were you or disappointed with the answers you received to your question? ( rate 1-5.) 1 4.) What answers do you wish you'd received instead of the ones you got ( give me your opinion.) just more detailed answers:P but the good overshadowed the bad so no problem really. 5.) Do you understand why you got certain answers from people. For example: “ Do it yourself,” “ Write about a duck,” or “a writer comes up with their own ideas,\" when asking for a plot or idea? lol I never got those. lol was talking about just lame answers with no literary merit:P 6.) Have you ever answered a “ Give me a plot,” idea? What did you answer back with? I don't answerr them. They are a waste of time. 7.) Are you disappointed with the lack of hard work with coming up with ideas when you see a “ I need a plot” question? ( rate 1-5.) No I don't care. I pass them up. 8.) Do you believe in those people who blame their inability to come up with a plot on “writer's block.” ( give me an opinion.) Nope. 9.)

	105370 : ["I would go with mike's answer. But the manual doesn't list an external antenna as an accessory or show that it unscrews. When I learned about radio, I recall that VHF is usually operated with a quarter-wave whip which would be about a half-metre (not hard to work out). To run HF with a shorter antenna you would use coil-loading to match the impedance. So I suppose that the stubby antenna on handhelds has a coil load somewhere. It may well be inside the antenna itself, which would make sense. In which case, just unscrew it. If it won't unscrew, don't try cutting it or attaching an external antenna to the end unless you have some way to match the impedance. The length of the antenna does not affect how much power is required from the transmitter - there's no problem transmitting 1W on an antenna which could take 25W. But if the impedance is mismatched then the power will not all be transmitted out the antenna but instead will be reflected back to the transmitter and heat it up. I think, however, that if you use a long cable with a low-power transmitter that it may attenuate the signal to the point of futility. VHF antenna cable is available in different varieties with different cost and attenuation. You may still win, though, if the idea is to raise the antenna above the horizon, e.g. to the top of a mast.", 9924, "rbztvrRWaa", 0],

	105387 : ["Ello thar~ ;D 1.) Have you ever asked for a plot idea ( don't be ashamed to say yes or no to this question.) I've asked with help with a minor plot point relating to a huge plot that I had already worked out, so I suppose so, yes ;D The question was titled something like: 'I'm writing a story and need help with one plot point..?'  2.) How happy have you been with the answers you've received to the question ( rate 1-5.) 5 - People were super supportive and came up with dozens of ideas ;D I didn't get a single snarky answer. I suppose its because I didn't ask for an entire plot. 3.) How unhappy were you or disappointed with the answers you received to your question? ( rate 1-5.) 5. HAPPY~ They were really helpful :) 4.) What answers do you wish you'd received instead of the ones you got ( give me your opinion.) Hmm...I think the answers were pretty good, some people seemed to have spent a lot of time writing me a massive block of text. I was pretty flattered by all this help from complete strangers, considering it was one of my first questions on y!a. 5.) Do you understand why you got certain answers from people. For example: “ Do it yourself,” “ Write about a duck,” or “a writer comes up with their own ideas,\" when asking for a plot or idea? I understand these answers since I've given them myself, but I've never gotten these answers myself :)  6.) Have you ever answered a “ Give me a plot,” idea? What did you answer back with? I tend to be nice. There's always the chance that they're not trying to make us do their homework.  Here's an example: Sweetie, I'd love to go into your head and turn on the switch that says 'Creativity, on' for you, but unfortunately I can't. You'll have to do that yourself. Turn that imagination on and find an idea yourself.  ;D Remember, originality tends to mean that you thought of it yourself. So~ Go think! Look around. Watch movies, read books, read short stories...steal from everywhere Artists are dignified in their thievery. What you are doing is not artistic at all. Got Best Answer too. I feel distinguished ;P 7.) Are you disappointed with the lack of hard work with coming up with ideas when you see a “ I need a plot” question? ( rate 1-5.) 3.  Here's the thing: Coming up with ideas has never been 'hard work' for me. Either I get an idea, or I don't. Either I have inspiration, or I don't. If I don't have inspiration, I wait, and when I get it, I write it down. I'm not even sure how someone can just 'come up' with an idea by themselves. It's not a skill, its an innate sense. When people have an idea, I won't mind helping them develop the plot (that's where the hard work comes in) 8.) Do you believe in those people who blame their inability to come up with a plot on “writer's block.” ( give me an opinion.) Yes. When I am not being hit by inspiration, I am having writers block. It's simple. ;D I know that all writers will be hit by writers block at some point in time. When I first started writing 5 years ago, I thought I could never run out of ideas, I felt like a God (yeah, my ego swells pretty easily ;P), but recently my ideas have been coming slower, and when I can't think of anything at all, it's writer's block. And it's perfectly natural. They just need to learn to have some patience. 9.) What do you want to see more of in the future with \"give me a plot,\" questions? ( i.e: they aren't asking for a full plot or et cetera.) People should never just ask for a plot. :) They should ask about a plot point of a plot in construction. xxChae", 9917, "c9ogKrjBaa", 0],
