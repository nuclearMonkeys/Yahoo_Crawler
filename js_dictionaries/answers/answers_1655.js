	88414 : ["Actually, unless you're doing serious academic work, almost everybody on all sides has trouble with rigorously supporting the assertions by which they live.  Atheism, for example, cannot prove that God does not exist, yet here on R&S they spend so much energy trying to prove what is impossible to prove, you would think they suffered from a compulsion disorder of some kind.   The bigger problem is that your statement appears to assume that evidence only comes in one flavor.  That is hardly the case.  A math proof is not the same as a historical proof is not the same as a philosophical proof.   Thus, when one side offers what it considers good historical evidence, the other side can sidestep by demanding proof of a mathematical kind that can't possibly be satisfied by historical evidence.  This is a mere stunt.  It is useless as a way to carry on a meaningful conversation about what matters most, truth.  Until people really want to engage in a serious process of mutual learning, they will continue to spew their team's slogans, and we all know that slogan fights are the best form of debate because they require no proof at all.", 9292, "None", 0],

That's a damning opinion of Christians you have there! That is how stupid your question is.... just because I act morally without fear does not mean I pick and choose my right and wrongs. Civilisation has only survived due to common morals which are upheld in the majority and evolved along with advancements. I'm certainly no the right person to explain morality to you but then, I also think you are being more than slightly facetious in you question. Why do some Christians hate homosexuals but work on a Sunday? Why do some Christians accept that the bible is not literal and use it as a comforting \"guide to life\" and some will argue the earth is about 6000 years old? the use of common sense has an astonishing affect on the beliefs that one holds and the manner in which one lives their life.", 9298, "lMJbtEsBaa", 3],

It is not atheism that preaches that Gandhi went to hell, but Hitler went to heaven. Personally, I decide if something is moral based on the question, \"How would the world be if everyone did this?\"  If the world would be worse off, I assume it is immoral.  If the entire world walks into a store and steals, the store would go out of business.  If everyone started murdering others for reasons other than self-defense, society could lose contributing members. Atheists don't need a \"divine author or judge,\" because they are smart enough to use their own brains.  I suggest you try to do the same.

	88434 : ["The point of asserting a claim without evidence is that the more times you repeat the claim, the more times it is asserted, over and over again, little-by-little more and more people start to accept it, believe it and take action consistent with the assertion.  This is a well known principle of propaganda: \"One cannot determine theoretically whether one propaganda is better than another. Rather, that propaganda is good that has the desired results, and that propaganda is bad that does not lead to the desired results. It does not matter how clever it is, for the task of propaganda is not to be clever, its task is to lead to success.\" There are two kinds of propaganda, one aimed at the understanding, the other the feelings. Both depend on imponderables. Worldview movements aim for the feelings. The force behind worldview movements has never been understanding, but rather faith.
