	77918 : ["Kchao! thanks = ) Uh CPA guy, can you explain how this is NOT socialism for the rich: Does anybody know that every dollar in existence is debt? Inflation is built into the system and there really is no way out of it. For every dollar created in the Federal Reserve is expected to be paid back with interest. If every dollar created is created at the federal reserve where does money to pay the interst comes from? the answer is NOWHERE. There fore the feds keep creating it out of thin air and the dollar loses value every single time. The result is you can never get rid of debt every dollar represents debt if all debt were ever entirely paid there would be no single dollar out there. But that can never happen because to pay debt we need pay not only the principal, but the interest and where does money to pay the interest comes from? Eventually someone ALWAYS is going to end up bankrupt because there simply is no money out there to pay the interest. If all money ever created is principal there's no \"extra\" money coming from anywhere to pay the interest. The bank reposeses the goods because the man could not pay because no matter what he did he could not get the money to pay unless he got a loan from the bank! which he has to pay with interest which puts him further into debt. Bank creates money out of nothing, but bank gets material goods when the person who can't possibly pay doesn't pay back. Result= Bank aquires something for nothing. The last time the national debt was completely paid off was in 1835 by Andrew Jackson The amount owed back to the banks will always exceed the amount of money that is in circulation, this is why infaltion is a constant in the economy. new money is always needed to help cover the perpetual deficit built into the system caused by the need to pay interest. Bankruptcy is built into it. Defaults are inevitable. One dollar in 1913 needs $21.60 in 2007 to match value. A devaluation of 96% since the Fed came into existence. Pretty greedy from the bankers, don't you think? to make people pay debt they KNOW they will never be able to.", 8922, "AA10152346", -2],
