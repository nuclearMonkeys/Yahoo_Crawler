In a fifteen-12 months-historical, he more often than not is not doing it voluntarily, however you may also wish so as to add extra muddle containers across the condominium that he can get to speedily. My 18-12 months historical male neutered tabby had failing kidneys for years. When he started urinating everywhere the condominium it was once due to the fact he had to cross so immediately that he could not get to the muddle field. My kitty's issues had been brought on by way of a blockage that built very immediately (inside two weeks of his earlier vet talk over with). If kitty hasn't been to the vet considering the fact that the difference in his urinary conduct, it is valued at a checkup simply to be certain that this is not a signal of anything extra extreme.", 10032, "q0TUFQ4Yaa", 0],

	108110 : ["This is really more of a rant than a question, but I'll bite. I think that if anyone from the child's family can stay involved, that is a huge positive. As an adoptive parent, and an adoptee, I don't see a down side to more people loving that child. However, there ARE cases where it is inappropriate. I fostered a little boy several years ago. He was in foster care from birth until he was 2 1/2 and his first mom kept getting extention after extention after extention on her case plan. She refused to take parenting classes, life skills, CAP (Child Abuse Prevention), counselling, etc., etc., etc...Well, she failed to follow through the last time, but luckily (or so we thought) this little boy's grandparents stepped up to the plate. However, it turned out that the grandfather was a convicted sex offender. Everyone involved had failed to mention this. His offense was related to children also, so it was a total no-go. Having grandparents involved can be a good thing, but not if they are legitimately a danger to the child. However, we have been trying for two years to get (supervised) visitation with my daughter's grandparents (they also have criminal history, and a history of child abuse), but they have not been willing to participate. Has it ever occured to you that it is not always the AP's putting the brakes on? We have sought contact with various family members over and over and over, only to be shut down. We thought it would be better for her to know them than not, but they can't be bothered. After our calls, letters and emails go ignored, are we still supposed to apologize for our actions? I don't know who you're mad at, but you should take this up with them.", 10031, "None", 11],
	108111 : ["Some sort of attempt should be made at keeping a connection between the biological family and the child.  Visits, letters, pix, cards, a small present, whatever...as long as it's something tangible.  The adoptive family probably dislikes this idea, but you did say \"in the best interests of the child.\"   If you know anyone who's adopted, you may appreciate the wisdom of this connection.  Or read forums where adult adopted people rant (and rightfully so, since they're the ones most affected) about being denied this.   One of the worst things I heard was a young adopted man say he never felt human til he saw photos of his biological parents for the first time.  Til that moment, he felt like a lab experiment and not \"real\".   If you think about it, most of us take for granted knowing who we look like, whose temperment and intelligence we have, our ancestry, so many details of the family that created us.  And we have a sense of being rooted, of being part of a family and belonging.  An adopted person is handed over to strangers - good intentioned people, but the hard-wiring is all different, the coloring, features, aptitudes for various things, it's just pot luck if they'll fit in well or not.  Granted, some people never fit in in their biological families, and some adoptive families meld beautifully, but I'm saying in general.  Another point is that even adopted people who adore their legal family and have no axe to grind would probably appeciate knowing their bio-family.  The relationship shouldn't be mutually exclusive or cause the adopted individual to suffer for wanting to know their roots. Best thing to do is ask adopted people or those (like me) who've been around enough adopted people to hear from the front lines what the fallout can be.", 10031, "vooqANOxaa", 1],

	108119 : ["Agree that you should stay away from bonds or bond funds at your age and at current interest rate levels.  Unless you think you can invest more wisely than the professionals, put your money in the \"target date\" fund - which looks like the Blackrock Lifepath fund whose year number includes your planned year of retirement (2054). They probably have a target date fund that spans 5 or 10 years, i.e. 2045-2055.  The concept behind a target date fund is that the fund is actively managed to meet retirement risks and goals as the retirement date approaches. For your case, since you are 23, a target fund would be generally heavily weighted toward stocks. You can afford more \"risk\" the further you are from retirement, so there are more equities, often in growth stocks, etc. As you approach the target date (retirement), and all along that time path toward retirement, the mix of investment types changes, such that the nearer you are to retirement, generally,  the \"safer\" the investments in the target funds, and usually there are more bond-type or blue-chip dividend paying investments which will through off an income stream.  Some target funds manage toward the entire portfolio being \"safe\" (low risk) TO the target date. Others manage THROUGH the retirement date, meaning that at age 65 you may still have some equity (risk) exposure because you're still going to want some of your investments to grow in value DURING your retirement years. I am not familiar with the Blackrock funds per se, but as I said, unless you are an investment expert, leave the asset picking to the experts and don't sweat trying to do it on your own. You most likely can't outperform the \"experts\". Pick the target fund and sleep at night. And put as much money into your retirement funds as you can possibly afford. Remember that you will work and save for retirement for about 2/3 of your adult life (ages 23 - 65) and you will SPEND your retirement savings for about 1/3 of your adult life (ages 65-85). Plan accordingly and take advantage of compounding, tax-deferred investing! Good luck!", 10033, "AdcQYv8saa", 0],

As part of the services, the administrator should have a registered adviser, who has fiduciary responsibility to help you set up an allocation based on questions regarding your risk tolerance.  The administrator should be able to provide the ticker symbols for you to obtain daily net asset values, unless it is using collective trusts for the different investment options or a fund of funds approach.
