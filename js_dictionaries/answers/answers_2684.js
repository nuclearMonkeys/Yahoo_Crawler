	140037 : ["If a African American has a french last name do they have some French ancestry? Maybe. They might just have taken their former owner's name, though. Their former owner may have been their father or grandfather, too; a lot of slave owners trifled with the help. > I know french people didn't own slaves. Not in France. They did in Haiti, until the slaves revolted. They did in the rest of the French colonies in the Caribbean. Americans with French ancestors kept slaves in the USA, too.", 11446, "None", 0],
	140038 : ["To go back over what has already been said to your prior questions.  Mississippi borders on Louisiana. No doubt there are black people from  Mississippi whose direct male line ancestors were in Louisiana during the days of slavery and those direct male line ancestors took the name of their French slave owners.  Therefore they might or might not have French ancestry. They don't have to have French ancestry but they can have French ancestry.  The French in Louisiana had plantations and owned slaves. When you drive west to east  from Texas across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia always try to fill up with gasoline in Texas or Louisiana. They are oil producing states and usually their gasoline is a lot cheaper.  It won't take you long to cross Mississippi and Alabama.  You'll wind up in Georgia with lots of gasoline left over. The French settled in New Orleans in the late 1600s.  French Canadians called Arcadians or locally they are called Cajuns.  They had plantation and slaves.   Descendants of slave owners as well as slaves haven't always just stayed in Louisiana but found themselves in neighboring states. Yes, Ted deserves 10 points for his research on the 1860 census of Louisiana giving you the names of some slave owners named Pierre.  He didn't get up to the Thibodeaux. That is pronounced Tibbeedough.  Believe me I don't think any of them were Swedish. Some people call them Swamp Irish though Actually surnames themselves are a poor proof of ancestry. In genealogy you trace your ancestry starting with yourself and working back one generation at a time. You don't get overly involved in the origin of a name. It doesn't matter if you are white or black.", 11446, "AA12343309", 1],
	140039 : ["The Prius will probably get the best mileage of all the vehicles that have been mentioned. My mother-in-law averages about 50 mpg with hers having both highway and city driving combined. The one thing to consider about that vehicle is that the battery will have to be replaced at 100K miles and will probably cost about $5K - $7K to do so. It all really depends on how much driving you see yourself doing and how cost effective it will be for you considering the price tag of the Prius is $20K+. As an alternative, a hybrid version is also offered for the Highlander if you still wanted an SUV. A 4 wheel drive version is available for your winter driving. They say that it gets about 26-29 mpg on the average but I guess that would be pretty impressive compared to the 18 - 21 mpg of other vehicles of the same class. My girlfriend averages about 32 mpg with her Corolla. Friends have said that they averaged about 35 mpg with the Yaris. Not really that much of a significant difference there. Between the two, the Corolla may be the better choice in a practical sense as the Corolla definitely will have more room and would probably be more easily visible to other drivers especially in harsh weather. If you still needed a little more cargo room, there is also the Matrix which is just a wagon version of the Corolla. They share the same engine and are built on the same platform. One of the minor but noticeable difference is that the Matrix has more safety feature options that are offered but that is probably what you're paying for with the few extra thousand that are added to the price tag. Hope that helps.", 11447, "oKbbxej7aa", -2],
	140040 : ["Put on a good set of snow/traction tires for the winter, and drive appropriate for the weather, and you'll be fine in any car.  (At least get a better set of \"all season\" (3-season) tires than what comes OE and you'll do much better.)  Be sure that your car is properly maintained and you carry standard winter gear (like extra windshield washer fluid, a snowbrush/scraper, and a shovel), and you'll be fine.   If still concerned for your travel, carry a cell phone on you at all times.  Subscribe to an auto club, such as AAA or Better World Club. You can use Toyota's model selector to decide based on MPG and some other criteria:   Yes, the Toyota Prius currently has the best fuel economy available in the US, at 48MPG city/45MPG highway/46MPG combined. But no, the hybrid batteries do not need to be replaced at any specified interval.  Just because  Toyota's hybrid warranty (which includes the hybrid battery pack) is over at 8 years/100,000 miles, doesn't mean that the item will fail then!  If you are in a California emissions state, the hybrid battery is further covered by the CA emissions warranty out to 10 years/150,000 miles.  For both, that's a full warranty (no parts/labor costs to you), not pro-rated.  There are many high-mileage 100K+, 200K+ Prius on the roads (particularly taxis).  Hybrid battery replacement is extremely rare.  Used packs from wrecking/scrap yards are <$1000 (check eBay), if you were unlucky enough to ever need one.", 11447, "d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa", 0],
	140041 : ["The Prius is the best choice when it comes to gas mileage.  I have a friend who has one, and he averages over 55mpg in the city, and around 45-50 on the highway.  However, if you want to do even better, then wait until next year.  The 2010 Prius will be a plug-in hybrid, meaning that you can plug it in to a regular wall outlet, and the 1st 30 miles or so will be totally electric, meaning that getting 100mpg won't be out of the question.  If you don't want to wait, then probably a Corolla would be your best bet, because the difference between what you would save in gas, and the extra that you would pay for the Prius wouldn't be that different.", 11447, "AA11249341", 3],
