This means in effect discriminating against men to bring up women's numbers under the guise of \"affirmative action.\" 2.  Equal opportunity in areas where women are ahead.  In other words, don't do anything to help men.  For example, they ignore or oppose any attempts to help boys' education despite the fact that feminist changes to our educational system have led to a growing imbalance in favor of girls. 3.  Dismantle any area of privilege previously accorded to males. 4.  Preserve any area of privilege previously accorded to females (e.g., women-only food lines in Haiti, pro-mother bias in family courts, the VAWA, etc.). In the end, feminism is about attacking the advantage of one side (men) while maintaining or expanding the advantages of the other side (women).", 8270, "None", 6],
	64645 : ["Feminism is supposed to try and make females equal to men. But they forget that sometimes men are the ones that are discriminated-meaning treated unfairly.

	64656 : ["It could be 28 minutes from now or 280 years from now. When the superpowers square off against each other in two camps, then come back and we'll talk WW3.. Unfortunately, WWIII will be global suicide, therefore in answer to your question, as long as there's rational superpowers who believe in MAD, there will be no WW3. By definition, the next world war wil be nuclear, how could it not. In a nuclear war there will be no winner. In a nuclear world, the only true enemy is war itself. The next World War will involve a nuclear exchange, how could it not if both sides believe no price for victory will be too high. In the first 30 minutes, nearly a billion people will have been vaporised, mostly in the US, Russia, Europe, China and Japan. Another 1.5 billion will die shortly thereafter from radiation poisoning. The northern hemisphere will be plunged into prolonged agony and barbarity. Eventually the nuclear winter will spread to the southern hemisphere and all plant life will die. You ask what country would be victorious, you are asking when will we commit global suicide. My answer is it won't happen soon because the larger superpowers are more rational than the rump states in the middle east. While we hear talk of a nuclear-Iran or a confrontation with NorKor, little is said about the 2 bulls in the glass shop. The arsenals of Russia and the US are enough to destroy a million Hiroshimas. But there are fewer than 3000 cities on the Earth with populations of 100,000 or more. You cannot find anything like a million Hiroshimas to obliterate. Prime military and industrial targets that are far from cities are comparatively rare. Our biggest threat is from an accidental launch by the Russians. At the point of global suicide, it doesn't matter who is on what side....where you go to hide, or how long you can survive.

	64666 : ["It could be 28 minutes from now or 280 years from now. When the superpowers square off against each other in two camps, then come back and we'll talk world war 3. Until then, just think regional conflicts, wars between rump states, proxy wars and brinksmanship. If you recall the Yom Kippur War in 1973, a coalition of Arab States (Egypt, Syria and Jordan) were soundly defeated by the Israelis. That was a worse situation than the current conflict and it didn't raise a blip on the world war radar (not that it didn't have the potential to spark a global war). The next World War will involve a nuclear exchange, how could it not. In the first 30 minutes, nearly a billion people will have been vaporised, mostly in the US, Russia, Europe, China and Japan.

	64668 : ["I don't believe there will be a Third World War. Economy, diplomacy, and warfare have simply changed too much for a conventional world war to take place.  For starters, the entire world would be devastated in a matter of days. It's mutually assured destruction. No nation would be foolish enough to instigate such a war. What would they stand to gain?  It's also inconceivable for two major powers to \"go to war\" in modern times - the movement of any troops or war machines would be unnecessary. The war would be decided in a matter of hours with air warfare, strategic bombing, ICBMs, and weapons of mass destruction. They would also upset the delicate world economy. Plus, with international organizations such as the U.N., it's unlikely that any international dispute would result in total war.  Modern wars are being waged on a smaller scale and with fewer casualties than the wars of the past several centuries. If there was to be a World War III, it would have probably occurred during the early Cold War (the '50s and '60s) In any case, it's hard to imagine a war more devastating than World War II.
