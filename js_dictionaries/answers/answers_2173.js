	114436 : ["Child support due to the custodial parent is not payable to the state EVER.  If the child was placed in foster care or other substitute care-then yes, all debts due to the parent to the point of them returning to the home is paid to the state to cover the cost of placing that child. So if the children have been in their mother's care all child support arrears are still due to her.  Your child support agency sounds like they are not doing their job.  You should first speak to the director and advise them you are not getting the enforcement services.  If you have no luck with the director file a complaint with the state (see link below) and find your county CSA's board members.  Write to all members about the lack of services you've been provided.  Also your local congressman or state senator can be very instrumental in getting them moving.

As a player, Alan Shearer was a class act, however the jury is still out for me when it comes to Alan Shearer the Manager, only time will tell whether the decision to appoint him as Manager was an inspired choice, or a foolhardy final nail in the Premiership coffin of Newcastle United.  There are eight games left, however you can ignore the weekend fixture against Chelsea, as Newcastle will get nothing from this game so Shearer really only has seven games left to secure the Premiership status of Newcastle United for next season.

	114456 : ["Post mortem is a euphemism for autopsy, as currently used.  The word autopsy, as correctly cited above, is from the Greek words for \"to see for oneself\".  Necropsy is the same thing, but in current culture is used more frequently for animal autopsies.  An autopsy consists of external examination, internal examination (both with the organs in situ and then removed), and followup testing and report completion.   Internal examination consists of opening the body cavities,  removal, weighing and dissection of the organs, looking for any and all injury or disease process.  Followup testing would consist of histologic (microscopic) examination of tissues if necessary, toxicology testing and interpretation, and any other laboratory tests deemed necessary.

	114459 : ["This is going to hurt - but here it goes... Firstly, when your dad had to sell his business and property to give your mum $800k, this was for the property settlement for their divorce and has nothing to do with Child Support in Australia at all.  This payment would have been divided depending on the assets they had, what they acquired together and who has care of the children.  Do you have siblings that are residing with your mum and that is why she got a bigger share??  I am not saying it is right, but that is the way the Family Court looks at it. Secondly, the CSA does not go out of its way to make people's lives miserable.  Although I agree that many errors are made with the CSA, they can only go what the legislation states.  Just like any other Govt Dept.  I am sure that every single person reading this can agree on other Govt Dept's that need their policies adjusted.  For example, the Family Court needs to provide a fairer divorce settlement.  Why is it not a 50/50 split?  Even if one parent has the children in their care, why do they receive an extra portion of the families finances - isnt that what child support is for? You need to inform the CSA of you residing with your dad so they can ensure that the assessment is correct, you will also be able to reflect his income correctly if he is on the dole.   The CSA cant be held responsible if they are not aware of the details and try to remember that they have guidelines to work with as well.  They cant just make changes in the system because they believe that your dad has been given a rough trot - after all, hasnt everybody who has been involved in the divorce, child access, child support, family court process? Also, please take up the offer from your other answer providing access to an organisation to help your dad get through this difficult time.", 10386, "28fNWjeDaa", 0],
	114460 : ["They do anything they just about want to whether right or wrong. If your mum received 800 k why is she not paying toward this as well? Try writing to the CSA and see what they tell you. It will probably be a lot of gobbledygook if they even bother to reply to you but at least you will have tried. There are a lot of people and families in your dads and your shoes who the CSA have ruined and most of the time the money taken from these people don't go to their families but is shared out to all the layabouts families they can't find or don't really try to find. They all make sure they draw their inflated paychecks though.", 10386, "HhtD4XLSaa", 1],

	114468 : ["Losing your keys is not a crime or an incident!!   I seriously doubt they're going to change locks everyt ime someone loses their keys.  House insurance won't cover, for two reasons - \"oops I lost the keys\" isn't a covered peril, although on a few high end policies, if your keys are STOLEN (with other things), then it might pay to replace your locks.   The second reason is, the policy has a deductible - which is more than the cost to replace the locks.", 10384, "e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa", 1],
	114469 : ["Normally you can claim if they have been stolen but not if you have just lost them unless you have this clause in your policy, depends on what your policy says BUT most policies have an excess anyway, normally you have to pay the first £50-£100 sometimes even £200 so would make claiming pointless (unless you have lots of expensive locks).  Read your policy very carefully or phone your insurance company to clarify.  It is always a good idea to inform the police that your keys are missing.  You will need a reference number if they are stolen, because this is a crime and should someone gain entry using your keys and then rob you - you will have proof that the keys have been stolen. Also bear in mind that a claim may mean that your insurance costs you more in the future.  Depending on the type of lock it might be easy for you to change them yourself - yale locks are a doddle as its only the barrel you have to change.", 10384, "None", 0],

	114477 : ["There's no warrant for believing either of them, that natural things require supernatural causes or that supernatural things require even more supernatural causes. In principle it could be that one requires it but not the other, that both are required or that neither are. So while any of them could technically be the case, there's no rational reason for believing they are. But you're entirely right that there's a hypocrisy in accepting one as true without a warrant but not accepting the other.", 10385, "0WB5Tru5aa", 0],
	114478 : ["The universe does need a supernatural cause by our understanding of the universe and the definition of natural. This is no special pleading, it is quite simply logical deduction.   1.) Anything outside of the universe would by definition not be \"natural\".   2.) Our current understanding of the universe highly suggests that it does have a beginning.   If you do not agree with 1 or 2, provide your rationale. If you do agree with 1 and 2, then by definition it would force a supernatural cause.  So we see that the only difference is whether or not we are willing to place intelligence to that cause. So we go to: 1.) Multiple universes, which lead to one of two ideologies.  a.) Infinite universes that pop in and out of existence for eternity, thus not having a cause and going to the same \"not caused god\" that you consider \"special pleading\". b.) Multiple universes with a completely unknown cause, thus entirely not answering the question and leading to either a \"special pleading\" or an infinite loop of what caused questions. 2.) Some intelligent designer or force or whatever you want to call it, leading to the special pleading as seen in 1a.  3.) Some thing that we have not even come close to thinking of and thus is no use discussing. Now as for which Occum's razor cuts? Infinite universes with no scientific evidence of existence or one God with no scientific evidence but many possible personal experience evidence? I say it cuts the infinite universes to shreads, but I can see an argument the other way.  Now the entirety of the above arguments have been made under the ideology of cause and effect, which works fine in a time-based universe.  We have, however, no reason to assume that outside of time, cause and effect is actually necessary, thus leading to the idea that we do not need a cause for either 1a or 2. Got proof, Which requires more logic?  Insulting others or what is seen above?", 10385, "None", 0],
