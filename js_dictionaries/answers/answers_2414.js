Fear results when we are first surprised--again by the unknown.  I remember as a kid we lived five blocks from the location of the local theater which my folks owned and operated.  Quite often I would walk the path that lead first to my street then down my street to the house.  That stopped after a frightening encounter with the unknown.  On the corner of the main highway leading into town, actually the beginning of business was my street but not on my street.  Anyway, on that corner toward town was the Presbyterian Church which faced the highway.  The main entry was in front, but a second enter place was on the side and I had to pass right by it.  It was a set of steps leading up to a small stoop porch and a door.  So here I am probably still playing cowboy and Indian, the Saturday afternoon movie.  I walk by the porch and suddenly a large dog jumps out, barks loudly and runs away.  Who was the most frighten who knows, but there was fear in both our hearts.  I had not expected the dog, and apparently it had not expected me.  I do not think I ever went that way again. Fear until examined can frighten us.  Then we often find it was not necessary to be afraid or to fear the unknown.  Our bodies are designed to react under such circumstances.  However, the fear you perhaps refer to are more basic falling within the events that are to occur, could occur and sometimes even has occurred.  Fear of death for few go and come back to tell.  Fear of failure in life.  Fear of rejection from someone we love or hope to love.  Fear again is of the unknown.  On this forum I see a lot of fear for eternity.  Some brazenly claim there is no here after, or God which they do not profess would not send to hell as many people as is indicated.  So on and on.  Anil, here is the secret--except for the events like the large dog, we who have our faith in Jesus have nothing to fear.  If we practice this in our daily lives, we can truly believe and live  without fear.  The reason I can do that is I trust God to be faithful, I trust he can do what he promises, and I have safety in time.  Dying will be a day to rejoice, great injury is only to the flesh and if I survive the injury, then my life begins again at that point.  My faith is not in myself, but in Jesus who has promised me a safe journey to the unknown of heaven, but like here on earth most likely will be traumatic.  That too is okay since my faith is not of me, but is on Jesus.", 10899, "HrnlBc4Laa", 1],

FOOTPRINTS IN THE SAND One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord. Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand. Sometimes there were two sets of footprints, other times there was one only. This bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life, when I was suffering from anguish, sorrow or defeat, I could see only one set of footprints, so I said to the Lord, “You promised me Lord, that if I followed you, you would walk with me always. But I have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand. Why, when I needed you most, have you not been there for me?” The Lord replied, “The years when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, is when I carried you.” I am 62 years old and this has always been the outcome.

	126532 : ["The knowledge of good and evil is the loss of innocence. Paul said that the law teaches us what sin is, and that knowledge simply draws us into the forbidden. The story of the fruit in the garden graphically portrays that temptation. We have all been confronted by people who say things like, \"If you haven't tried it, how do you know you don't like it?\" That is essentially what Satan did to Eve. He lured her into some mental gymnastics that sidestepped the fact that God wanted his creation to remain pure. It could have been any fruit at all. The tree's name -- the tree of the knowledge of good and evil -- is a way of clarifying the truth that tasting the forbidden fruit is the outgrowth of the real sin -- trusting self instead of God.  The story relates Eve's thought process as she looked at the fruit. It looked like all the other food, and was attractive besides. What's more, under Satan's tutelage, God's prohibition became the message that eating the fruit would make her as smart as God. She trusted herself more than she trusted God. She put SELF on the throne of her heart. Then she took that fateful bite.  In that moment her innocence evaporated. She had that guilty feeling in the pit of her stomach that alerts each of us to the fact that we have done something wrong. She could never again act with innocence and freedom, because she was doomed forever to evaluate every move and try to figure out whether she trusted God or herself more.", 10909, "AA10263910", 0],

Yes, evolution is still Darwin's theory which will never be proven, because Jehovah God has created all things in the sky and all life on this precious planet we live on.

Unfortunately, that i not the situation for most of us, and if dogs couldn't survive on their own while we work, well, then no one would have dogs! I would advise adopting a mature dog that has had its house training.  Since you live in an apartment, a small breed would probably be best.  Either get a nice crate, roomy enough for the dog to be comfortable in or if you feel comfortable enough doing so, confine it to the kitchen.  Once you KNOW the dog, it is possible  to maybe let it lose in youe apartment.  If you think 10 hours is too long, there are pee pads you can use. I am unemployed right now, but when I was working, I worked some long hours, and my dogs were fine.  The 2 big dogs have their own bedroom, and the Papillons and cats have the run of the rest of the house.  I always leave a radio playing for them when I'm gone, and plenty of wated, toys and chewies.

A toy breed abandoned 10 hours a day would be a miserable, unsocialized, anxious disaster of a dog, it would develop massive behavioral issues, and you'd end up giving it away. Also, no puppy can be left alone more than 2-3 hours. Dogs do not stick with litter training, they are not cats. They inevitably start having accidents all over the house.

Mine easily goes from 10 pm to 9 the next morning without needing to pee.
