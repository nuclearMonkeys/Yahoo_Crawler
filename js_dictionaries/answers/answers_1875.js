Warming up should not be less than 10 minutes for every stage of it, as it spans three  stages and this means 30 minutes for warming up. It is essential to do this is you want to know how to  sing better next time. Start with medium tone then go up to the high tone and then down to the low one.  Do not forget your face muscles. It is also very important to train your face muscles in order to get in  shape because they are what you use to produce sound and they help you to pronounce letters and sing  louder. People always forget about these muscles and only concentrate on the jaw.  How to sing better is all about eating in the right way. Make sure that you are following a strict diet  to keep yourself in shape while consuming the right ingredients will help you learn how to sing better  and how to protect your voice from bad effect of some foods. For example, milk and sugar tend to coat  your GIT so, they are forbidden before singing. A warm cup of herbed tea is much better to help you  voice.
