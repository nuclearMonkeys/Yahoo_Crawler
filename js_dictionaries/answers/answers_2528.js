Some simple mind decided that, \"If we pay people, that can't work, a reasonable amount, people will take advantage.\"  As a person with narcolepsy, I have a pretty good idea of your situation. I was told 20 years ago by my doctor, \"You will never drive a car again, you will be on medication for the rest of your life, and you will be on disability.\" I was 28 years old.   I went to my social security office, to apply for my benefits. The people treated me like a moron, I filed the forms and months later I was notified, that I was not entitled to benefits. I went, on my own, to every program and organisation I could find, trying to return to the work force. One of the organisations I went to accused me of faking my illness. A federal program staled me for a year before giving me any help finding a job. I had to write and complain, to get them to help me. I was told that the man handling my case was lazy, but protected by his union, so management could do nothing to him.    Before my illness I lived in a town house, in a very nice area. I rented a heated garage to keep my classic car in. After I lost my job and was let go from every job I found. I ended up living in my brothers attic. I applied for food stamps and was denied, the state worker told me she thought I was hiding assets. And when I asked what she was talking about, she called security and I was removed from the building.   Your question was how to live on state benefits ? My answer is, I'm sorry but you can't.    In the USA you have to spend all your time filing in forms and standing in lines. I guess they think, the fakers are too lazy to go through all that.   Being disabled is a full time job.   The added bonus is the cost of medication. I was lucky enough to get a job, 9 years ago, for a company that helps the disabled. They have medical insurance for employees, but the medication I take is amazingly expensive. With insurance I still pay 2 weeks salary for a 3 months supply.   I could go on and on,  but my point is made. I wish I had a secret, but I don't. My advice is do your best to reinvent yourself. Find a job that no one is watching and take a nap every 2 hours. Depending on your back ground and your interests, I know there is a way you can make your life better.   Life can be unfair, I see disabled people every day at work. I'm glad I only have narcolepsy. Good luck, Paul", 11136, "OKlRx7ynaa", 1],

	132244 : ["First, you should realize that the majority of couples choosing a specific gender through IVF are choosing girls because they have a sex-linked genetic disease.  If I were going through IVF, I would do the same as there is a sex-linked disease in my family as well.  Instead, I have to go through CVS and determine if the child is male or female and if male, whether he has the disease.  Then I would abort if he did. Personally, I think my method is the more painful choice. If you could eliminate the issue at the sperm or embryo stage, it is better emotionally because you don't have to really deal with it.  We have been TTC since December and will move up to IUI soon, where I can choose to spin sperm and increase our odds at having a girl. Male sperm weigh differently than female sperm and thus spinning separates the two. Still, not a guarantee. As an FYI, the number of blue eyed people is actually diminishing naturally quite rapidly every generation.  The number of tall people is increasing as more children get more fat and protein as children (I'm as tall as the average Asian man at 5'4\", but a 2nd generation Asian in the US is normal height for a caucasian).  Fewer than 8% of couples even go to a reproductive specialist, and about 15% of those use IVF.  IVF is only successful for, at best, 40% of women.  So even if they do designer babies, the majority aren't going to do it, so it's just a drop in the pool.  (Please note that the percentages I listed were ones I read in a magazine a while ago). I disagree with you, however, that technology is at the point where designer babies can be made.

Individuals are empowered by freeing them from dependence on government handouts and making them owners instead, in control of their own lives and destinies. In the ownership society, patients control their own health care, parents control their own children's education, and workers control their retirement savings.\" The Congress has voted to insure it's failure so it was not given a chance to 'change' things. the belief that personal responbilities for education and health care befongs in the hand of the people rather than the government has both good and negative issues. sadly, most people are not good stewards of their money and end up looking to the government to provide for them.  i think a person should be given the option, if one is wise enough to handle their own money that is great for them but the majority would find this difficult as 'delayed gratification'  unrealist or do-able for them.  some will think they can and fail, then they would be in serious trouble. i do think that education and health care need serious revisions but i cannot offer solotions since i do not have all the facts to be able to make an informed suggestion.

I understand why it was started as well, and just like many other things in science, people have found a new use for it. Before my husband and I ever got pregnant or decided to have a baby we had actually talked about this. I wanted a girl, and we really only want 1 child. Why not get what we want the 1st time around, provide the best life that we can for that child and be happy? Not to say that we wouldn't have been happy with a boy, but really if you have your heart set on 1 gender, it can be hard to come to terms that you are having the other. Luckily when we got pregnant, we had a little girl. I couldn't be more happy, and to me just by getting what we wanted made me a happier person. Now granted I wouldn't pick what color eyes/ hair and such as that. That to me didn't make a difference, and it still doesn't.  And your right you could change your mind about it in 10-15 years when you find someone and are ready to have a child.
