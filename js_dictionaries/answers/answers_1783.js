You have an inate sense of glamour and hate the idea of being penniless, particularly if it means you cannot afford to buy presents. Creative, generous, enthusiastic, organized (if bothered), broad minded, expansive, dramatic. .... Difficult to Live With! Pride can get in the way and Leo's can sometimes cut off their nose to spite their face. There is a danger of attention seeking too, and the need to bring drama to a perfectly ordinary occasion. Leo's need space in every sense to express themselves and are really not at home with the idea of being modest or living in an understated way. Occasionally, Leos can be quite snobbish and arrogant. Sun Signs You are most Compatible with Gemini - full of laughter. Aries - memorable. Cancer - loving. Libra - great fun. Capricorn - short, but sweet.

LEO LOVE MYSTERY Since Leo likes to do things in style, which is usually very attractive to the opposite sex, yours is the sign best suited for love and romance. Your romances are full of high drama and you play out your role to the perfection. The average Leo has much glamour and is the ideal lover in all dimensions - emotional, physical and sexual. The opposite sex is bowled over by your ardent appeal and generosity. The Leo man is full of machismo and is a good companion. You are loyal in marriage, but tend to be possessive. The Leo woman ought to be careful to see that this tendency does not get exaggerated. You have great personal charm and glamorously attractive personality. Don't expect too much from your spouse or mate. You will also hate to be involved in a divorce and the resultant loss of face. SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS Sex plays an important role in the life of every man and woman. It lies at the root of life, and we can never learn to revere life until we know how to understand sex. Indian astrological science attributes certain sexual characteristics to persons according to the sign under which they have been born. You do not beget many children. You have a strong command over yourself in matters of sex, and are not easily deceived by the guiles of your partners. You require deep loyalties for happiness.

	94877 : ["Yes, that is a good time to run 6 miles in.  If you want to add a lot of miles to your training, the rule of thumb is to add no more than 10% each week.  This is a sustainable way to add miles to your training, i.e. you should be able to do this without your body collapsing from fatigue.  So if you ran 20 miles this week you can run 22 next week and then add another 2.2 miles and run 24.2 miles the week after.  Also make sure to give your body some recover time.  You can do this by alternating easy and hard days.  Your body should respond better with a long run, then follow up the next day with a short run.  Instead of running 5 miles every weekday, try a run of 7-6 miles one day and then a 3-4 mile run the next day.  Pick one of your weekend runs to be the longest of the week.  This can be a run of at least 60 mins.  The 10% rule is good here too, the week after a run of 66 mins. will work.  Variety in hard runs is good for your muscles too.  Substitute a hilly run on a hard day or run a fartlek.  Run at a faster pace for a minute or two and then jog for the next min.

	94889 : ["LEO the Lion July 23 to August 22 Leo traits, both good and bad: Leo Positive Traits Generous and warmhearted  Creative and enthusiastic  Broad-minded and expansive  Faithful and loving   Leo Negative Traits  Pompous and patronizing  Bossy and interfering  Dogmatic and intolerant  Leo is a generous soul, the kind of person that would give you the shirt off of their back. Always has a smile, this warmhearted individual will be the first to boast your spirits when you are feeling down. Some of the most creative people out there are Leo. The approach art and music with a raw unbridled enthusiasm that is unmatched by their peers. You will find many famous Leo people out there, simply because of their level of creativity. Broad minded, Leo will be willing to experiment and try new things. This can be a tad bit dangerous for them as they tend to take risks sometimes. A Leo person will be open to all kinds of suggestions and gets bored rather easily.  Always true to their love, you will seldom find a Leo cheating on their mate. Leo loves strongly, and will defend the honor of those that they love.  Ruling planet is the Sun (ok, so this not really a planet...)  Gold is the primary color  Birthstone is Ruby or Jade  Leo is symbolized by the Lion. You're stubborn yet impulsive. You're also showy, dramatic and sometimes vain. You have a sunny demeanor and love to be the center of your loved ones' adoration. You'd make a great actor; in fact, many actors are born under a Leo Sun.

	94890 : ["Your most likeable trait: EXUBERANCE Your loyalty is beyond question. You are devoted to yourself. All Leos possess a kingdom. The kingdom may be big or small, it may be your home or a lover or a piece of creative work or your whole career. But whatever it is, you are unquestioningly ruler of this kingdom. Self assurance surrounds Leo people like a ghost image on a television set. You don't have to look for a role to play in life. You've found it. You are the monarch of all you survey. When you enter a room you secretly hope everyone will stand up and sing a few stanzas of the Hallelujah Chorus! At a party it isn't long before you assume control of the evening. Witty, vivacious, a fluent talker, you are a born entertainer who can lend spice to any occasion. people gravitate to you as steel filings to a magnet. Your Sun sign confers a great flair for drama and an instinct for getting attention. Because your nature is flamboyant and expansive, you despise the humdrum, the ordinary, the dull. When real life does not supply all the excitement you need, you try to create your own. Hyperbole is second nature to you. You are born to do things in a r-r-really big way. If you invite people to your castle (which is how you think of your home), you entertain them royally. You are a splendid party giver. Others may become reconciled to accepting second best; not Leos. Born under the most royal sign of the zodiac, there is absolutely nothing Leo people can think of that's too good for them. Luxury is as vital to you as breathing. You want to enjoy the good life, and never mind what it costs. You are not a good haggler or bargainer because basically you want what you want when you want it. Your public image is very important to you. When a Leo woman's checking account is down to two figures somehow she'll find the means to buy a glorious new dress, and when his credit cards are overdrawn a Leo man will still make reservations at the best restaurant in town. Leos are the most lavish spenders in the zodiac (Librans run a close second). Generous, kind, and openhearted, you find it hard to believe ill of others. If injured, you strike back quickly, but you also forgive easily and never hold a grudge. Marvelously affectionate and cheerful, you have genuine joie de vivre. The Sun is your ruler, and you always bring some sunshine into the lives of others. Obviously, this is one of your most endearing traits. In many ways you are like the Sun itself—life-enhancing, radiating energy and magnetism, burning with steady fixity. Astrologers call Leos eternal children, for you take pleasure from the moment and are uninhibited in giving affection. No one could ask for a better friend. If approached in the right way (flattery is the right way), you will do almost anything, but you expect praise and appreciation and admiration in return. pride is your Achilles heel. Your ego demands not respect but adoration, not compliments but flattery, and when you receive lavish praise you never stop to wonder if it is insincere. Despite your self-centeredness, you need others to give to if only to get back their appreciation. However, because you're too proud to ask for appreciation, you often suffer silently from a wounded ego. In business you are the one in command. Another sign that gravitates toward authority is Capricorn, but its natives steadily climb toward a high position. Leos simply assume that they were born to high position. However, you are also a hard worker who doesn't ask more of anyone else than you do of yourself. You won't quail before a challenge or flinch from a confrontation. You are ambitious, but not ruthless. All you ask is to be in the limelight. Routine quickly leads to boredom, and makes you desperately unhappy. Your unhappiness doesn't last long, because you simply won't put up with it. You have an unshakable belief in your luck and quickly bounce back from despondency. It is difficult (though not impossible) to dislike a Leo. True, you can be bombastic and overbearing at times. True, you love to give advice and tell people how to run their lives. Like your symbol, the lion, you can be quite indolent and lazy; you like to sit back and bask in your own glory but your great warmth and sunny disposition is very hard to resist. The world would be much less fun without Leos.", 9526, "873da54cf4d7a480b32598f905cff43aaa", 0],
