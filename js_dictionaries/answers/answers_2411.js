	126384 : ["Q:  \"I am looking to hear exactly how Mormons view their religion and how they would summarize it. \" == I view my religion as the complete picture of what salvation through the Savior and Redeemer (Jesus Christ) offers.  I view it as the channel in understanding my purpose here on Earth, and what is expected of me next.  I also consider my religion to be in complete harmony with the physical and tangible evidences that I can comprehend around me, since my beleifs declare that my Master, Jesus Christ, is the Creator of them.   I view my religion as the definitive source to comprehend all elements of good and evil, but that these things are known through a gradual process of line upon line and precept upon precept.  As a result, I cannot claim to know where these sources are, collectively speaking, but I can learn how to comprehend them are as they are \"added\" to my life.  I view my religion as the roadmap to overcome the diversities and trials that develop as a result of these things being experienced in my life. I view my religious beliefs as the ultimate source to learn of service and compassion toward others.  I believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as represented through the doctrines of the LDS church, to be the only authorized and legitimate source where the ordinance and covenants of God can be performed and established in a manner which God will accept. I believe the family unit and the roles of men and women are secured the best within the doctrines of the LDS Church, and that the standards therein are the most efficient means to preserving mankind to reach the full measure of its creation. It has once been said that one may not know all the things that are pertinent to happiness and joy, but one can know where to find them.  I believe the LDS church, with Jesus Christ at the head of this great organization, is that place.", 10883, "AA12345881", 2],

If Mary really conceived, bore Jesus, and went back to Israel, the town would have stoned her to death, understanding it to be a case of pre-marital sex/fornication. Why is Mary afraid of the angel? Maybe there was some reason...but then again, that's just according to Muhammad. Jesus being able to speak in His very young self? I doubt that.", 10884, "QZaR2Ueoaa", 0],

EDIT--You're crazy if you think France is a very traditional society.  I've lived there, and it is far from traditional.  Feminism has strong roots in France, and French women have always been more outspoken, expressive, and independent.   Here is a good article on feminism in Russia--Russia has always had strong women, as evidence to their historical tales as well as all women combat units during WWII.  Russia has a complex society, but feminism has had its place, although there is an actual term for feminist like movements, but its not called \"feminism.\"   As for Korea or Vietnam, it doesn't matter if their feminism is different from western feminism, it still exists.  Feminism swept the world along with Western thought many many decades ago, and whether it remains in place today is not the point--but that when Western thought was imported, feminism (or at least the idea of women having equal rights) came along as well.", 10885, "QQQ36jMOaa", -1],

Every nation has feminists - i was speaking to a 74 year old Muslim South African feminist just a couple of days ago. Secondly - no feminists did not give women anything - feminists raised awareness of inequalities and society overthrew them - women would never have got rights over their children, rights not to be beaten, rights to own property or the right to vote had not men voted them in - women could not do it. Will post you links on feminist activity in some of the places you would not expect. :) Edit - re France and your debate with Ferested - France is the home of feminism - Simone de beauvoir? Helen Cixous, Julia Kresteva? In fact the most well known body of work on feminism is known as French feminism with Anglo American feminism coming in second. France had the head start with the women's involvement with the French revolution. ", 10885, "gFart0H9aa", -2],

With your reasoning it would be a statement of faith to assert that no such things exist because, hey, there might be some under some bed you haven't looked under yet. Notice how people don't actually think this. Everyone thinks there are no monsters under beds and that this conclusion is epistemically justified, i.e. people think they know there's no monsters under beds not merely that they guess it. This includes you btw, you too think you know there's no monsters actually there under the bed when a child complains of it. You don't look under the bed expecting to find monsters. You think there's none there. It's only with things people want to exist, like gods, that they suddenly revert to saying \"Well if you can't prove it doesn't exist then it's faith\".

And if we're not happy with it, and/or continue to fall, we can perform a ritual which via a reality set up by the Gods, we can declaim, decry, denunciate, excoriate, impugn, proscribe, revile, repudiate the Holy spirit, thus condemning ourselves to the second death.", 10899, "None", 0],

They only gain worth or merit when evidence is presented that shows them correct.

Death and sin were necessary elements of this plan, as we need to over come them with faith and through Jesus Christ. 4.  We believe that Christ reveals his will to chosen men.  These men are prophets who tell us of God's will and direct us.    5.  Some of the prophets are found in the Bible.  Others are found in the Book of Mormon (written in the Ancient America's). 6.  Christ established his church on earth in Jerusalem and in the Americas.  However, all the prophets and apostles were eventually killed and Christ's church was no longer found on the earth.   7.  Christ restored his church to the earth through another prophet, Joseph Smith.  This includes prophets, 12 apostles, the priesthood, etc. 8.  Smith was led to and given the ability to translate an ancient cannon as scripture that was written by ancient prophets there (see #5).  This text is known as The Book of Mormon. 9.  Christ is the head of the Church.  It is HIS church and he leads and directs it through chosen men. 10.  ANY man can discover for himself if our teachings are true or false.   A.  Contact the missionaries and learn a bit about the church. B.  Read all or part of the Book of Mormon. C.

The fact that he confuses Mariam the mother of Jesus with Miriam the sister of Aaron (28) and who lived centuries apart should ring alarm bells in any one who claims that the Koran is historically accurate. Moses and Jesus both claimed they gave us the word of God, but they performed great miracles to prove it. It seems to me that the author of the Koran took what suited him from God's incorruptible revelation, added his own ideas, revised history as it suited him, and tried to pass it on as some \"new\" word of God.
