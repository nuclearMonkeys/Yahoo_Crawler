	23510 : ["You would get more bang for your buck with TCL, Vizio and Hisense around that price range. You won't find any premium features on Samsung, Sony or LG's TVs around that price range. Quantum Dot display, full array local dimming, MiniLED backlighting, higher panel refresh rates and higher peak brightness are going to be slowly implemented as you move up their premium line up.  With TCL, their 2020 6 Series had a Quantum Dot and MiniLED backlight display and the price started around $700 for a 55” display. Samsung's traditional LED display with full array local dimming and Quantum Dot display started at their Q80T model and for the 55” was at $1,299 if not more at the beginning of 2020. However, if you put the two head to head Samsung was the better one... just cost a lot more. So around the $700 range you would get a far better display from budget friendly display like Vizio, Hisense or TCL, than you would a $700 Samsung, Sony or LG. However, the premium Samsung, Sony and LG are superior but cost a lot more than what you are looking to spend. I would suggest waiting for TCL's 2021 model line up before buying a TV.

Even if you're at a low marginal rate like 10%, add another 5% at least for state, and 15% for self-employment tax (an independent contractor's means of paying social security and Medicare tax), that's a minimum of 30% of your net profit. When you're an employee your employer withholds amounts for federal and state taxes along with social security and Medicare and also pays half of SS and Med. When you're an independent contractor you need to send that money in yourself. An independent contractor isn't covered by workers compensation and won't qualify for unemployment benefits. Get everything set up from the start or you'll get nasty surprises at tax time. It's common for a new independent contractor to owe thousands of dollars in tax on April 15th, plus owing a bunch for the first quarter installment of estimated taxes on the same day.", 3769, "nqaERZ8Raa", 1],

In theory, you are free to negotiate a better rate of pay. In theory, you can refuse any work you don't want but, in reality, if you do, they will simply stop offering work. The reference to supplies you buy being 'written off' is not meaningful. It needs to be made clear WHO pays for supplies.  Do you have to buy them and then claim the money back? If so, how quickly will they repay you?  Do THEY buy supplies for you and bear the cost directly? This needs to made clear up front. Who pays for your transport costs to jobs? Does this come out of your $14/hour? Do you get paid for travel time? If you were an employee, you would be on the clock and getting paid for ALL your time related to the job. In normal practice, you would be an employee with full employment rights and benefits. By giving you the option to refuse jobs, they are hoping this is enough to stop you being legally an employee. It is a way of shafting you while they make a nice living off your efforts without them carrying any risk or long term responsibilities.  A job is a job. If you really need it, it is better than the alternative. It is not a deal I would enter into unless I had absolutely no choice.", 3769, "gYPV2W02aa", 2],
