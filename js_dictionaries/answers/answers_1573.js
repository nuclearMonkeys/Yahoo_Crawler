Very very frustrating as Yahoo does not let users know that there is a problem. I am seriously considering moving to another Email supplier. I thought Yahoo was the best but not anymore.", 9158, "wi7svUakaa", 1],
	84309 : ["I just went to a military funeral in October. It is at the very least, sobering. The gentleman served 2-3 tours in Nam and had earned the Purple heart along with many other military awards during his 30 year career. I live within an hour of a military base so I attend these funerals more often than the civilian population. All of our friends are retired military. When they present the family with the flag, the spent bullets are enclosed with the flag.", 9153, "AA11089846", 2],
	84310 : ["danielle, you will have to go to your own father's funeral when the time comes. It is the final respect. And, yes, I went to a military honor funeral with some friends who are in the Patriot Guards. The funeral was so impressive. Quite an honor for a 22 year old soldier that gave his life. By the way, the Patriot Guards are a group of motorcycle riders that show up at military funerals to keep the protesters away. It is just a different kind of troll.", 9153, "lAxe8oMvaa", 4],
	84311 : ["McCain is against republicans on some issue, but he usually is not far off.  He does have heavily conservative voting record. But when it comes to real stuff, like the war, and energy, and immigration, he seems to stick to his own. I know you will argue my mentioning of immigration.  He has not dropped his view, only said the first step is obviously a fence, and he changed because the American people want something done, not his party. Will he change, I don't know.  I like McCain because he will change course if it is the right thing to do. IT shows he is not willing to accept one answer.", 9164, "Cx8sAJT2aa", 1],

	84318 : ["Some one wrote that capitalism is great if it was not monopolized, i think that capitalism is based on monopoly of multinational companies and has a clear aim to support them. I sometimes cant understand how come a person favor capitalism when all means of it are in the hand of few investors and multimillionaires of multinational companies whose need of profit decides whom to put in the war and how. The resources of poor countries are sucked out violently and a few drops of the blood are feed to those who could create problem for them, therefore bestiality of such countries can not be seen in the core of them but in the peripheries, like Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan etc. But strong reasons are created to show the world why they are doing so.likewise American establishment created Talibans to fight against USSR and when they are of no use, they are terrorists. I clearly say that they are terrorists but i also say that they were terrorists also at the time when they were in the use of America. if you go through the statistics the economy of socialist countries is better then those who are capitalists in nature.  The percent money spent on making weapons is many times more then the food taken by whole the humans on globe for a year more.  We need a change in the system, if not socialism, then not capitalism at least.", 9152, "AA10429414", 1],
	84319 : ["As the world evolves it should be clear to all that there is not one economic model that is the best.  Pure capitalism will not work any better than pure socialism.  The key is to find that mix that works the best.  Clearly things like military, police departments, fire protection, education and health care would be best if provided by the government. Other things like transportation and finance would be best if they were a public-private partnership.", 9152, "None", 1],

	84324 : ["very sorry, but yea, Iverson has to b THE guy to win.  thats what made him good in philly, which is the same thing that made him BAD in denver and now in Detroit.  Detroit was desperate for change (as was Denver) and they made a bad move, luckly for my Nuggets lol.  BUT since they DO have iverson, i agree in that they should get a center.  u might not like this, but TRADE SHEED! he is a shell of himself.  good D, but just wants to shoot. no inside game.  get an inside guy like Okefore.  Iverson needs a Big defensive Center and PR.  an athletic all around SF (prince) and an oversized PG wjo passes and shoots, not hamilton obviously, since hes better w/o the ball.", 9155, "qJaM0AY8aa", 1],
	84325 : ["They just played bad. Rasheed Wallace just gave up in game 6 of the conference finals. I think the bench was highly overrated especially when you have a lot of young players and not enought veteran contribution. The bench basically was Lindsey Hunter, Maxiell, and Stuckey. The coach couldn't motivate the players and they ran into a hungrier more determined team. At one point after they destroyed the Lakers in five games this team was suppose to have dynasty and instead their a joke a disappointment. Of course Joe Dumars couldn't find that one missing piece that would have reignited the team. They were overconfident and Billups was injured for the first two games of the series. Tayshaun Prince once again disappeared offensively. The Boston bench is better than the Pistons bench no doubt after that last series.", 9155, "3I3ai8Uxaa", 0],
	84326 : ["I think it reflects badly on them and Palin. They have legitimate gripes, but  it is unprofessional to air their grievances in the public arena. Of course, she knows nothing of these issues and they should have known that before they selected her. With five kids and a full-time job, she had no time to study these issues. This creates a risk because of McCain's age. ", 9160, "iyLV1CADaa", 0],
	84327 : ["These are questions and issues they should have addressed back in AUGUST, not now. They should have been aware of something when she said back in July that she didn't know what a vice president does and obviously they did a lousy job of trying to explain it to her afterwards. And they should have realized that despite her appeal to women, most women don't have the same views as her. And also that certain things would become public - the pregnant daughter, Troopergate, her expense records...the list goes on.

	84343 : ["Yes.  He has made tasteless jokes toward Iran.  There are \"bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran\" and his 'kill Iranians with cigarette' joke.  What is on this man's mind?  Remember his spiritual adviser, Rod Parsley, said it is America's job to see Islam destroyed.  McCain has indirect ties to terrorists through Carl Lindner.  Lindner's firm pled guilty to funding a terror group in Columbia.  Lindner knew of this due to his position in the firm.  Lindner co-hosted a fundraiser for McCain.  Was that blood money from terrorists?  Then there is his \"stay the course\" and \"never surrender\" ideologies on Iraq when the Iraqi PM wants us to withdraw ASAP!  Obama is for diplomacy and/or stricter economic sanctions when dealing with Iran.  However, McCain is against both.  What other options are there?  War!  McCain wants war with Iran.  After all we have Iran surrounded.  Attack from the sea, Iraq, Afghanistan.  Add all this up and you have one warmonger of a Presidential Candidate!", 9163, "None", -2],

The very first one, I had no clue as to how is was going to be. I am not trying to be funny here by any means at all. I thought that they had a funeral like any body else did. I saw the soldiers with the guns, had no clue that they were going to shoot them off. It scared the tar out of me, I jumped like I was shot. But when they started playing the taps, now I cried, don't know why. Then the flag was handed to the widow.  But then after that one, I knew what to expect.

There will always be poor among the population, but why would we want to make everyone poor?

What I have purchased with what I worked for should be mine.
