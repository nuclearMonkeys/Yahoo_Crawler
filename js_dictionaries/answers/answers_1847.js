Officers typically make more money and are more seriously considered for better jobs when they get out. You will also get paid more by the Army. As a reservist, to be honest, you probably will be less skilled than active duty, but that's OK. It's not a big deal. You also need to understand that the Guard and reserves are deploying a lot. If you are serious about joining, be prepared to deploy. You may not, but chances are good.", 9638, "WWY7Iy4iaa", 0],

	98091 : ["You are not over weight and your too young to be worrying but I understand where you are coming from. Having a tummy is uncomfortable. I'm still working on that. First. Get a little exercise. You can even just walk 30 minutes a day (and you can break it up and do 3 10 minute walks). Walking up hill is even better then running, believe it or not! Luckily I live on a hill. As far as eating. Limit candy and things that are high in sugar. Sugar turns to fat. Limit white stuff, like white bread and pasta. Switch to whole wheat. It takes a few months to get used to, but then you don't even notice. Whole wheat spaghetti. Yum! Eat two apples a day, it will make you more full. Always have a serving of veggies with your meals to eat less of everything else. Also, drink a BIG glass of water before all meals and you will eat less as well. When having dessert, eat it soon after dinner so that you are still full and don't want so much. Things in moderation are okay. Treat yourself sometimes. Get enough sleep and drink plenty of water.

Senator Obama, as a brilliant, highly-educated and well-read man, addresses all the issues that are important to Americans who are struggling in a bad economy.  These are the Iraq War, lack of jobs, Veterans benefits, college-tuition assistance, high price of gasoline, mortgage foreclosures, big corporations and lobbyists running Washington, high food prices, and more.  Please go to www.barackobama.com and meet online some of the millions of supporters, young and old, who believe that Obama is the one and only person who should be President.

You must drink about half of your weight. If you have weight of 200 pounds then you must drink about 100 oz of water.  2) The interval between the eating is very important. If you eat once, then you must eat next after 4 hours. You must take breakfast regularly. In the night eat your food three hours before going to bed.  3) Walking is very good. You must walk as much as you can. Walk everywhere you can. Use of elevators and escalators must be reduced and instead of these you must climb stairs more often.
