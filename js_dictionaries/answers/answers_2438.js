	127734 : ["You have a degree in SCIENCE?  I find this hard to believe, because if you did, you would recognize that the word \"theory\" is not an idea that hasn't been proven. That would be a hypothesis.  A Theory is a hypothesis for which significant and verifiable evidence has been found. A tested hypothesis, which has been repeated, or has a great body of evidence suporting it becomes a theory. A theory is a working model based on significant evidence and testing. \"Atomic theory\" is one such \"theory\" which is used today. It is a \"theory\" that if sufficient fissionable material is compressed into a small area, that it will explode. As this is simply a theory, would you dare to sit beside such a device as the counter goes down to zero? It is a \"theory\" that polarizing filters at the correct angle will polarize light by aligning the polarity. It is a theory that liquid crystals will act as this sort of filter. This theory is used to create liquid crystal displays. If you've got an LCD monitory, you're simply watching a \"theory\". I have a science background as well. My last job was as an engineer developing test equipment for MEMS \"micro-electro-mechanical systems\". I worked with \"theories\" that are used to deploy airbags in automobiles. I worked with \"laws\" and \"facts\" as well. There is little difference between the three with the exception that \"laws\" have been proved for thousands of years. If the \"law\" of gravity had been found perhaps 50 years ago, it would still be called a \"theory\". The hypothesis came about when the apple fell from the tree. After many expirements, it was called a \"law\". You won't hear of an \"atomic law\" as the word \"theory\" is its modern (almost) equivalent. Your understanding of evolution is flawed as well. In saying we don't see creatures evolving, you are missing the point. We are ALL evolving. No theory of evolution claims that humans came from monkeys, but that humans and monkeys had a common ancestor. And further back, humans and monkeys and dolphins, etc. all had a common ancestor. Creatures existing now didn't come from each other... they had common ancestors that were different than each. If you have a degree in science and chemistry, please let me know what school so that I can keep my kids out of it. This is getting ridiculous! No partly developed apendages or organs...? Appendix.

	127735 : ["Absolutely NOT! I can not agree with your logically flawed argument from ignorance. Simply because there are different theories of evolution do not make them mutually exclusive. It might simply means one of them might be incorrect. Evolution really has nothing to do with breeding dogs. Breeding dogs is done under human stipulations and not a slow process dealing with numerous climatic problems over eons and a multiplicity of other stimuli. I suspect you have a religious bias which leads you into this diatribe regarding evolution. Many religious fanatics believe the world is 10k years old, well science rebukes this quite easily. So therefore dinosaurs and humans did not simultaneously exist. These facts I believe started the RELIGION VS EVOLUTIONARY THEORY WAR. At least the Evolutionists are working to a scientific standard, whereas the religionists are working with the fairytale standards, where anything goes. PLEASE out yourself and your true purposes and stop hiding behind words and flawed thought processes. How can I have an \"axe to grind against god\" if he or she does not exist? Don't get me wrong I'm not an Atheist (and believe they are logically perverted - you can't prove a negative).

	127747 : ["It can't be anything but a theory. It is not something that can be repeated in a lab environment. In the real scientific community, of which I used to be a part, we are taught that all science has to be confirmable. By confirmable, you must be able to set the experiment up in exactly the same way and get exactly the same result. That cannot be done with evolution, so it has to be a theory. Some people think that it is science if they say it is, and it cannot be disproved. That is called a farce.

	127749 : ["Yes, evolution is just a theory.  But so is creation.  Nobody can testify as first hand witness who saw everything when it happened.  But it demands more faith to believe the theory of evolution.  In less than 300 years since the first book of Darwin was written it has gone so many revisions, additions and corrections.  But the Bible is almost 2000 years old since the last book, Revelation was written by John in 96 AD, but it does not need any correction to the satement: In the beginning, God created heaven and earth.  It is believed by more than 1.5 billions Christians and 1 billion  Muslims.  Besides that in the Chinese language, spoken by more than 1 billion people worldwide, we can trace the story of creation as it is narrated in the Bible and the Quran. Like the word \"zao\" (to create) consisting of \"breath\" + \"earth\" + \"mouth\" + \"walking\", is a very accurate account of the creation of Adam.   While the word  \"yuan\"(garden) consisting of \"frame or border lines\" + \"earth\" + \"mouth\" + \"one man/person\" + \"another man/person coming from the side of the first person\", meaning: After putting the first man, Adam, in the garden of Eden, God took Adam's rib from his side, and created the second man.

	127759 : ["A scientific theory.  A theory in the sense that relativity is a theory, or gravity.   People who talk about evolution as 'just a theory' generally don't understand that there is more than one meaning of the word theory.  There is a separate scientific meaning which relates to an observable or testable idea which is supported by all known data.  That's evolution. As for the transitional fossils, we do have some.  There are gaps, but that makes sense since we haven't dug up the entire planet looking for them.  I can't really tell if you're joking about the whole \"if we evolved from monkeys why are there still monkeys\" bit.  I'd like to think you are, but a lot of people are genuinely that stupid.  So in that spirit, the ancestral apes we evolved from have been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years. As for the thermodynamics bit, evolution does not suggest the creation of matter or energy.  And the laws of thermodynamics are theories, in the sense stated above. Life didn't just spontaneously appear from non-life.  It was a long gradual process from inorganic to organic material and finally to life.  And again, there's no creation of energy or matter involved. A 'part fin' would be extremely useful for a fish that otherwise had no fins.  How can you say there are no patially developed appendeges?  Have you been a million years into the future and found all the animals look exactly the same? To question the fact that Earth's conditions support life is just stupid.  Firstly, people have evolved for these conditions.  If there were more oxygen in the atmosphere we would have evolved differently.  Secondly, and more importantly, if the conditions on earth weren't suitable for life then we wouldn't be here to observe them.  The probability of any given planet supporting life is very low.  But the probability of the planet we live on supporting life is 100%, since we wouldn't be living on it if it couldn't.  The same goes for the Earth's distance from the sun. And now I've exhausted my patience, sorry.  I'd like to spend the rest of the day systematically refuting all your claims about evolution and abiogenesis, but you clearly have very little understanding of the subject and you appear to be looking for converts rather than answers.  If you want to question evolutoin, go ahead.  But please do some research first.  Walk your bridges before you burn them down.
