	113885 : ["Wow! That's and extensive and well-articulated question. I hope my answer does it justice. The Lord did create perfect beings. We are made imperfect by our sins. Had God not given us free agency, we would never sin. But then how would God show His love for His creation if He controlled our every thought and action? We must look at the situation and admit that with freedom comes responsibility. We fail to live by God's Law. You are absolutely correct when you say it is our nature to lust (sin). And God knows this. Paul admits that he has no control over the sin nature ... \"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.  \"And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.  \"I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.  \"For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.\" – Romans 7:14-20 Paul is saying God's law is just but he couldn't follow it. Neither can you or I. The bible says the wages of sin is death (both physical and spiritual). But sinful man cannot pay the price for his own sins. The requirement is for a perfect sacrifice. That's why God's own Son gave up His throne in heaven to be born of the flesh. He became the perfect atoning sacrifice for all our sins. Now we each have a choice to make. We can \"trust in God\". Here's how Paul puts it ... But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \"Abba, Father.\" So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.  Galatians 4:4-7 And again ... That if you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.  Romans 10:9-10 God is looking for more than mere intellectual assent. He wants us to believe in our hearts that Jesus can and has saved us from eternal damnation. If we do He takes full responsibility for our eternal joy. If we reject Him, He has no choice but to allow us to take full responsibility for our own eternal future.  It's not a test. Scripture says it's God's desire that none should be lost and that all should come to repentance (literally – change one's mind about the need for a savior). Those who trust in the Lord still sin, because we will have this sin nature until we enter heaven. But 1 John 1:9 says: \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\" To be purified of all unrighteousness is to have God look upon us as if were are as perfect as His own Son.", 10368, "None", 0],

You can try to wear clothes that accentuate attractive features and also to hide unattractive features, but weighing more than what is proportional to your frame or less than is proportional to your frame is not attractive however you dress it. I want to recommend swimming to women. I'm telling you whatever your heredity swimming will make you look as sexy as you possibly can as a woman. Try it. I guarantee you will be turning heads. As far as a voluptuous large framed,but in proportion, woman- I could be as turned on to them as a tall slender small framed woman.
