I actually know someone that had a baby shower for both of her kids, they're both boys, and only like a year and half apart, I think something like that is ridiculous. But you also have to realize that most baby showers are thrown for people. If you were having another child, and your family throws you one, why would you say no? I had a second baby shower, my children are 10 years apart, I had a boy first and we were trying for quite a while before we finally got pregnant, and it was a girl. My mom threw me the shower, and it was nice, and I don't think any one was bothered by it. So in a case like the one you mentioned, I don't think there is anything wrong.", 9354, "vvvFvyPKaa", 3],

I feel bad for the animals there but until they change their methods I will not have anything to do with them. My last dog was found at a shelter that is 100 miles from where I live. I chose that shelter because it is a no kill shelter that will keep an animal it's entire life if it's not adopted out. It's a great shelter where the dogs have a huge area to roam free and mingle all day and then are put in a kennel only at night or if they are recovering from surgery. They have two cat rooms also. One room is for kittens and cats under a certain age while the other room is for older and senior cats. The rooms are filled with things for the cats to do and is more cat friendly then some houses I've been to. If only more shelters could be more focused on the animals like that one then we would have no use for high kill shelters. I did a lot of research before I adopted from them. I went and visited on numerous occasions to make sure that they were consistent in their care. I talked to others who adopted from that shelter and it was obvious they weren't a byb because of their licensing and such.", 9352, "AA10283080", 0],
	90126 : ["The breeder of my current female strongly advises owners to allow dogs she produces to go through the normal stages of mental and physical development and deal with any pushiness that can go hand in hand with puberty, with leadership and training and delay removing the reproductive ability as the earliest opportunity, because it can make males less of a handful to keep in line and they avoid the three week heat cycle. When the breeder discovered an owner had a four month old puppy castrated for showing “aggression”, nothing more serious than undisciplined nipping, she made it known in the breed – including rescue - this was someone to avoid. Nothing in the contract that states an owner cannot castrate or spay early, but it would be flying in the fact of what I consider to be sound advice with a medium size/bone breed. Speak to the breeder and as others have said be honest in your dealings with them, explaining that ideally you would like to leave the dog intact and they may see your point of view and agree, but if not perhaps you could vary the agreement if they sell on spay/castrate contract for the procedure to be postponed until the dog was two years old or thereabouts.

They MIGHT extend it to a year - IF they could see where you would have the dog - and I wouldn't be surprised if they insisted on retaining co-ownership until the proof of the neuter was submitted. While you yourself might just want to wait until maturity - most people would breed, either intentionally, or by \"accident\" when the dog escaped from what they were sure was escape proof when a neighboring female came into heat.  And no good breeder wants to feel they were even partially responsible for that, What you MIGHT be able to do if you're open to getting a year or two old dog is checking for a breeder's potential stud that didn't QUITE come up to snuff, and is now being neutered and sold as a pet.  They're left intact while they still have show potential, or through maturity - so that might be another option for you.", 9352, "8sQLjGN2aa", -2],

	90150 : ["It used to be that baby showers were really only for the first baby and only thrown by the friends of the mother to be, with perhaps some family involvement, but not generally hosted by family.  It was also common practice to have a baby shower for someone who had a number of years pass between the two youngest children. My mom's friends threw her one when she was expecting my sister, who was nine years younger than my other sister.  Nowadays, it is proper that if someone wants to throw you a baby shower, that you certainly accept and are grateful for their generosity, even if it is your Mother in Law ( which really is faux paus, but I am fairly certain Miss Manners would overlook that, if the Mother-to-be shows the appropriate amount of gratitude and bites her tongue over what is and what is not proper in the way others behave.)  However, for someone else to throw themselves a baby shower....or worse yet, a bridal shower, is COMPLETELY tacky no matter if it is a first baby or a 10th....it is NEVER EVER proper for one to throw their own shower. If parents wish to have a \"welcoming baby\" party, after the baby is born, where it is made clear that no gifts are expected, then that is perfectly fine.  Of course, if people bring gifts anyway, then a certain amount of, \"Oh you SHOULDN'T have, really. But it's just lovely, thank you eversomuch!\" followed with a prompt thank you note in the mail within a week, two at most, is also perfectly fine.", 9354, "None", 0],

When I adopt out dogs, I have the owner sign a contract stating that the dog MUST be neutered/spayed when of age (and I always recommend to spay/neuter a dog when they are fully mature, and considering the newf is a giant breed, the recommended age would be 2-3yewrs old) and pretty much all breeders of large dogs do the same. I keep a close eye on my dogs that is adopt out, and so do all reputable breeders - so don't request a show dog, if you're planning on having it as a pet - you'll be caught out and as you would not be going by the rules of the contract, the dog could be taken off you - so, don't think about pulling a fast one. Unfortunately, I doubt (unless of course your planning on showing the dog) you'll get a dog off a breeder without a spay/neuter contract - there are simply far too many BYBS/puppy mills/irresponsible dog owners out there, we don't want our dogs falling into the wrong hands and adding to the already growing problem of unwanted dogs - but I'm sure you'll be able to negotiate with the breeder about letting the dog fully mature before having him neutered.

Chrysler generally calls them \"Gold Plans.\" There are so many gadgets on those, you don't want to run into a lot of problems if you keep it for a long time. Another choice, which I think is an excellent vehicle, is the Ford Flex. Great for families, loads of interior space, and a more modern type of vehicle.

But, if you look around, you will find this is becoming fashionable from several manufacturers (the Nissan Murano, as one example).  It is a question of ergonomics and accessibility.  The pull-towards-you-then-pull-down motion we are all so familiar with is mechanically complex and difficult for many folk (elderly, handicapped, etc.)  [As an interesting historical side note, the shifter in the 1967-72 Honda 600 also protruded from the dash, and that car had a manual!] You should ask yourself WHY you don't like this before making it a deal breaker.  Would you walk away from push buttons, or voice command, or a shift selector on the floor? It is definitely unfamiliar, but I suggest that you may be more satisfied if you ignored this particular feature and focused on other attributes of the vehicle.  Try all competing models and compare whatever is most important to you (comfort, room, sound system, styling, acceleration, handling, quietness, warranty, whatever).  Make your selection on those things that are most important to you. You can easily get used to a non conventional shift selector.  Getting used to poor passenger accommodations or inadequate acceleration is quite a bit more difficult.
