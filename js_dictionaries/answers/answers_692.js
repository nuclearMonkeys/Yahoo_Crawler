I understand it is hard to get a job when you have no experience, that is something we usually deal with out of school. It is unfortunate that this issue has cost you so much time.  You have not told us much so it is hard to know what to say specifically what your problem is. Maybe you are looking for a job when you should be looking for a career. Can you attend a trade school?Do you have a family you are responsible for? What country do you live in?  What are you good at or enjoy? Productive ,not holding down the couch .Can you set goals? Are you willing to do anything no mater how hard if they start to move you toward those goals. What can you do that is difficult for other people. Have your teachers or parents told you something about you that was a compliment? You dont have to pick the path of a life time, just get moving in some direction.
