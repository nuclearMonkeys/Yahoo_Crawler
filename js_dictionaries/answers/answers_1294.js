	70243 : ["Okay, I'll try to answer all your questions. First question: No, she just hate people who OTHER people think are more beautiful than her (which is impossible because she is the most beautiful goddess ever, with exception to Hera)  Second question. Cupid is Roman, the Roman equivalent of Eros. Eros is the son of Aphrodite. Third question, people love her because she is what you want her to be. If you have a thing for, let's say, blonde hair and blue eyes, she'll appear that way. She's gonna be really appealing to anyone.  Fourth question, Nope, you can't exactly look in a god/ goddess' eyes without disintegrating (unless they are in disguise) and that's not how her 'powers' work. Fifth question, yes, she does control her powers.  Sixth question, yes and no, she is the goddess of love, beauty and sexuality, it's normal of her to be 'skanky' although I wouldn't use that term exactly. I'll give you an example, she is originally married to Hephaestus, who is the ugliest god in greek mythology (Zeus intended this to happen to avoid fights on who gets to have the most beautiful goddess as their wife) but she usually has affairs with other men, notably, Ares, the god of war and bloodshed and Adonis. I've got more info, but I'm only going to answer those that you have asked. If you want to know more just message me or just add it in the additional details part. Hope I helped :D", 8541, "UdXPBo3waa", 1],
	70244 : ["No she didn't hate beautiful people. But she did get jealous and vindictive if some one thought they were more beautiful than her. Cupid is her son and his is a love god. Depends sometimes she would blow a kiss to make two people fall in love. As for looking into her eyes nothing mentioned on it. Yes she controls her powers all gods/goddess do. She's a little skanky and she's very attractive and yes people loved her.", 8541, "PSHV5tE9aa", 0],
	70245 : ["Lets see.. She was very vindictive and jealous, if someone said you were prettier than her you probably got killed for it. (This is how the Trojan was started.) Cupid is the Roman form of Eros, who I believe is actually her son. There is a very interesting myth about a girl who everyone claims is prettier than her who Eros actually falls in love with. But because Aphrodite is the jealous sort she makes it so Eros is ugly during the day and pretty at night. I think she may have had a girdle that made people fall in love with her, but I could be thinking of the Norse myth instead.", 8541, "rQP6OlZTaa", 0],

	70272 : ["Don't get an iPad.  They're worthless bits of junk and in a year there will be something far superior to that sad excuse for a big iPod Touch.  Just because it's brand new and just came out is a terrible reason to get one.  Not everyone wants one and having one will not make you superior in any way, shape, or form. An iPhone is not a bad idea.  From what I've seen and heard, they're fairly reliable and have decent apps.  However, they are NOT INSURABLE.  If you have a tendency to break cell phones, don't get an iPhone. As for the Nintendo 3DS, I think I would wait for it to come out and buy only it instead of spending money on both it AND the DS XL.  It would be a waste of money if you wanted to get rid of the XL afterwards because no one would be buying them and everyone else would also be selling theirs. As for buying the Xbox Elite, I think it's a waste of money.  (Then again, I really dislike the Xbox, sooo...)  The Elite really isn't any better than a regular 360.  You are NOT going to use up all of the space on a regular Xbox unless all you do is play games.  I hope you're better than that.  If you really want to have an Xbox now, I would suggest finding one on eBay.  As they're somewhat old, the prices on eBay are lower than what you might find in stores.  Hopefully, if you decide to buy online, it would leave you with enough money to shell out when Project Natal comes along.  IF you have enough games to tide you over until the next gen comes out, you might consider just doing that, unless you simply CAN'T wait to play Fable and Halo. As for how absorbed you can become into the DS, I don't know.  It varies from person to person, although you sound like the type of person who might be done with it in a month or two.", 8548, "None", 0],

	70290 : ["A Nintendo DS is a system that you won't find yourself playing very much. I didn't and the only game i know that makes people play it, is of course, Pokemon. The Xbox 360 is one of the greatest consoles out there. With a line-up of huge 360 only franchises, I don't see why it's not a clear winner here. You said you are afraid the price might drop some more? Don't count on it. The ONLY reason they did the price cut was too smack Sony if the face for price cutting the PS3. The 360 is a console i play ever day of my life, i spend quite some time on it daily, and i've made great friends on it. And on your ps3, ds, ipod, iphone, you'll never get to play Gears of War, Halo, Fable, Army of 2, Left 4 Dead, and of course your missing out on the xbox live arcade. Which is one of my favorite things about the 360. With a large listing of some old and new arcade version games, it destroys the ps3 store by far. Also, the 360 has more titles for it than the ps3 can hope to have. I know a few PS3 only gamers, but once they got a chance to play my 360, they were very quick to change how they felt about their gaming. You'll never really feel like a gamer until you play a 360. The ipad is dumb to get if you have a PC. Really unneeded.  The iPhone is cute and very fun, but it's just a phone really. You don't need 1000 dumb apps man. Plus it's a ridiculous price. IMO get a 360, but good luck with this decision.", 8548, "FmadU4jnaa", 0],
