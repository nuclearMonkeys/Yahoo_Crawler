Depending on your ASVAB scores you will have your job options, degrees don't matter, i had a masters in Russian history and served 2 years as 11b and three as 18B. I can tell you that you will have problems obtaining a security clearance because of credit and drug issues, just be sure not to lie, it may get past your initial assessment, but you will get burned later down the line.  I would recommend choosing a job that requires nothing more that confidential or secret at the most.  And remember, almost everything can be waived these days.  Marijuana is no longer a big deal, especially considering how long it's been since your last use; i cant say the same for your other drug use because i simply don't  know. As far as being in DEP, you didn't get on the plane so technically you shouldn't have a problem, but again it will probably come up in a background check, and it may make recruiters a little afraid of you. I am not sure about the age, your are not prior service since you never went to basic, but you are still qualified for Army and Navy, forget the Air force, your right about past drug issues.  Also the Army may be your best bet to pick a job that will allow less problems from a clearance standpoint.  Since you have a family, if you think navy, you may want to ask about support positions. As  far as your physical conditioning, you have plenty of time to get into shape.  Its your basic, and you can make it as easy or hard as you want, just please don't sign as 11b (infantry) without some level of fitness. As far as your wife, she will have the same obstacles because of credit as you.  Again a degree doesn't matter past getting you promoted, the service could care less. And please, if you are able to sign, go this time, backing out is a slap  in the face to those of us who have served.  Remember, we all have the same problems and give up the same things, and for people like myself, serving my country was a true honor.  If you aren't 100% commited don't walk in the office.

Most people don't have masters and you are already almost done.   You have work experience, and life experience and an educational background.  Even though some people who join have that, many don't.  They(some, not all) wouldn't be able to have your same options in the civilian world that you do without military exp.  You, and your wife are clearly a highly intelligent couple.  You really have to consider how much time are you willing to spend away from your child/future children.

	66369 : ["I wonder if you mean the size of the actual testicle or the size of scrotum and testicles overall?? because it is normal for testicles to rise and lower from day to day, week to week depending on mostly temperature. Since testicles need to be a little lower than body temperature, they are kept further away from the body. So on warm days, in warm clothing, being active (like sex) can cause your testes to drop, giving the appearance that your scrotum and testes enlarged.  The opposite happens when temperatures are cold. The testes are pulled closer to the body. However, if you mean the actual testicle size keeps changing, then this isn't normal and could mean there's something else going on.  You may have what is called a communicating hydrocele, which is when fluid from your abdominal cavity enters the tunica vaginalis, a pouch that holds your testes within the scrotum.  Fluid then leaves the same way and the cycle repeats throughout the day.  So your testes get larger and smaller.  Normally, the tunica is sealed off from the abdominal cavity within a year after birth, but it can persist beyond and would require surgery to get it closed off. It could also be a hormonal problem.  Taking steroids and other drugs can affect your testicular size, mostly shrink them because it conflicts with its natural hormone cycle. Since you have seen a doctor, there may not be any problem that's too serious since he didn't say anything.  But for your peace of mind, get a second opinion and check for hydrocele too.", 8331, "3dcf970bfeee9b5095b51cf05b1e82d5aa", 0],
