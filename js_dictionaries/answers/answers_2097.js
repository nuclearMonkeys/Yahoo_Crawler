According to my opinion \"cleanliness\" is very important to everyone especially here in India. in foreign countries people are very much awarded about cleanliness. If you make your city or place dirty in any way you are fined. So there its very strict that you must your place clean. Why cant we do this here. If our government does not take any responsibilities then we must all take responsibilities and teach everyone about the importance of cleanliness. If cleanliness there then no diseases would be spread and people can save their life. We are the same Indians who when traveling/living outside India would take utmost care not to drop even a toffee wrapper on the roadside. We are the same Indians who would blindly follow traffic rules in other countries but while in our own country would jump traffic signals and blare horns at no-noise zones (Ok, some part of this concern does come from the fear of the huge fines such acts may result in). We are the same people who can stand patiently and silently in long queues to get a bottle of whisky but grumble and fight when caught in traffic jams or have to wait in queues for getting any paper clearance done or certificate made. We are the very ones who love to keep our own house and surroundings clean but wouldn't mind dumping our wastes into our neighbor's compound. This is the irony of Indians. But the blame cannot be entirely put on the general public. The lack of amenities like public toilets and waste bins is also partly responsible for all these misdeeds. But it still needs to be seen how much Indians would adhere to these new systems and take a bit of extra pain and trouble to drop the waste wrapper in the dustbin. Despite such facilities provided in some places we can often find people who prefer to relieve themselves in the open than pay a rupee for the use–and–pay toilets. Most of the bins on the roadsides are full and spill over due to either lack of regular disposal by the civic authorities or due to the general trend of the public to throw waste items around the bin than in it and proudly (but falsely) proclaim that he/she is a good citizen and dumps waste only ‘in' the bin. India is our country, our home and it is our responsibility to keep it clean and tidy. Carrying a chocolate wrapper half a kilometer with you till you can find a dustbin to dispose it off wouldn't cost you much of energy or trouble. Just like one doesn't spit on the walls of one's own house, it is our moral duty not to spit on the walls of our country. Our surroundings and our way of life is the impression foreign tourists carry of India. Let each one be the other one's guide and together help keep India clean. lastly it is our responsiblity to keep our country clean . :)", 10149, "None", 2],
