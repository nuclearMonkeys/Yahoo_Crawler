So they still got to celebrate with these people but it was expected that there were no presents involved and the bride DID NOT throw it herself. It's poor etiquette to throw your own shower, invite people to shower and not wedding unless they already knew that's the way it was and then EXPECT money as a gift. I'm sorry.

Also, ask your current company (the one that cancelled) if they will reinstate if you agree to have payments escrowed through your mortgage.  And, find out what the \"cure\" period is.  Usually, you can only reinstate within 30 days. If your car insurance is with another company, see if they will write you a house insurance policy. Try GEICO or another provider. Last resort:  figure out what is the absolute minimum insurance you can pay for in full for the year, get that, and as you get more money, increase your coverage.

Because, there is a limit, to the consumption of the rich, And for many, that limit is well below thier yearly income levels. Forbes magizine, had an article, where they contacted the 500 richest people in america, about 300 responded. And they averaged spending around $250,000 a year, to maintain thier lifestyle. So a consumption tax, would in essense, mean the first $300,000 of your income, would be taxed, but nothing over that. I haven't seen the numbers, on just what a consumption tax would have to be, to replace the revenue from the income tax. But it would probally be somewhere between 10% to 20%. A better idea, would be to just recalculate the tax rates, and eliminate all tax deductions.

But most models when set to convection use forced hot air to cook foods.  Also, microwaving foods isn't what's hurting your stomach. It's that you cook them too long and they've lost any real food value. And to #1...you're parents are WHACK!!  Microwave ovens cook by using radio waves, they're completely safe. You just have to know what you're doing and how certain foods will react to the extreme heat they're being exposed to. Microwaves tend to cook from the inside layer of a product out. It's not recomended to use non-microwave safe plastics because they can release noxious gases into your foods.  It may be that your stomach gets upset because of the cheep plastic containers you're using. Try cooking in terra cotta or glass containers.  Also, don't try cooking meats in the microwave. It totally overcooks them and destroys what food values they may have had.  Some foods that do really well in microwaves are veggies, potatoes do really well. Cakes simply don't brown properly, nor to they rise well...so thats a lost cause.  Bacon does really really well in a microwave, but you have to watch it so that it doesn't get over cooked. AND NEVER TRY TO BOIL PURIFIED WATER IN A MICROWAVE!!

Just stop sleeping like that with each other. I don't think it's anything else except her faith that has her behaving this way. You could ask if its something else like childhood abuse if you want to make sure it's not something else keeping her from doing it. I think the sleeping arrangement is gonna make not having sex much harder. Just try and not go past kissing until marriage. It's not easy but if you respect her faith then I believe the relationship will become stronger and longer lasting.  Just know that as the man, as the one intended by God to be the leader, you are responsible for making a change.

This means that those who are ill or have a child or other family member who is ill are far overtaxed AND the ill (such as those disabled by illness) already earn far less than other groups of people. As people grow older, their earnings capacity drops and usually their med bills rise. So you will have folks forced into bankruptcy, on welfare, and Medicaid as well as Medicare. So you lost any potential for supporting the government by this short-sighted change in the system. The system does stink, but the Forbes' flat tax makes far more sense.
