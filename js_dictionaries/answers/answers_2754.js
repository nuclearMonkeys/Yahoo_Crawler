	143558 : ["I remember writing my first poem at 5. Not sure where I learned to like poetry. It's like music. It has a rhythm so maybe it's just built into a person. I came in 14th place out of 100 poems submitted in a contest at middle school. Then I wrote a handful of poems at 17.  I too have an April birthday and there seems to be a lot of April poets. Besides, it's in my genes too. On my father's side, I'm related to Francis Scott Key and F. Scott Fitzgerald. They're my great great uncles.  I went to college, learned a couple of languages, got married. Now at 30, after getting laid off from the pharmacy, I got bored staying at home and no job, so I started reading poetry, lots of it. I've read nearly all 1800 poems of Dickinson, I reread Poe and discovered Longfellow and Robinson. Then I wanted to write my own. I wrote about the desert cause that's where I'm at. I collected 100 poems, then published them in a chapbook.  I usually have something precise I want to say. Either I figure out a message I want to say or there is something I want to honor or beautify. Sometimes I just want to evoke a certain mood and leave the poem open-ended. My new goal is to write a cinquain or ghazal which I've never done before. Am saving poems for a second poetry book.", 11591, "Lnxak8Pzaa", 0],

Like this one: Anyway, I was a sci-fi story writer in grade school, won a couple of awards, and I knew every nursery rhyme my mom told me before that. That whole time,m however, I was being psychologically and sexually abused by my stepfather so my poetry came out when I ran away to stop that from continuing at 13. It was emo before there WAS emo. I used to only write dark poems, every one had either death or blood or black or a combo of the three words in it. I used to think they were really good poems. I look at them now and think OMG,LOL But coming to this forum changed my writing and helped me heal from that long ago abuse like I never could any other time in my life.There are a lot of problems in this forum but never ever will those outweigh the good that my contacts have done and are still doing me.

One day I was in a place with a lot of heavy stuff on my mind that could have affected my life for a long time and all i had was a pencil and 2 or 3 sheets of paper . I don't know why but I started to write and I just kept on writing and I would write all day . I couldn't get enough paper . I was actually using up a lot of peoples paper . It didn't matter but when I was writing so much I would watch the ink run out of the pens and people wouldn't let me use their pens and they would be like man all you ever do is write.And I have always had a need to write from then on until now . I quit using pens though . They really don't last long any of the pens you can buy. A computer is a life saver especially for trees.  .Well writing took a lot of stress off of me and things just worked out . God did it. I think He may have led me to write I am not sure but He is the reason any good happens to me I know it is true . I was changed and I was not the person I had been .When I got back to my life again I was different. . I was better and I stayed out of jail .I used to be mean and I have done crazy stuff . Writing takes emotions out of me that if kept in would destroy me . I don't know how well I write . But I don't write to get peoples approval . If I did I would still be hurting a lot of people . I write for me . And sure I would like for my writing to touch people I think we all would . That is not always the case . Sometimes you just have to settle for having your writing piss people off at least on Yap . . At least you get a response and I expect this reaction the most .
