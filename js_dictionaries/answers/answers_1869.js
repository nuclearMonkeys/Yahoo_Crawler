I certainly do not know and I don't know if any provisions have been made. Personally, I don't think this particular Pope was up to the task and he has finally come to realize that running the world's largest Christian denomination isn't all he thought it would be.  He's faced some real challenges, especially with regard to the pedophile scandal and subsequent cover ups that have continued to plague the Catholic hierarchy. His involvement, as defensible as it may have been, with Hitler's Germany has also plagued him.  I think he's come to recognize that the Papal position in Roman Catholicism is very political in nature. It will be interesting to watch what happens next with regard to selecting the next pontiff.", 9685, "LuN1unJ3aa", 1],

	99190 : ["Spiritual Heavens. The same original-language words used for the physical heavens are also applied to the spiritual heavens. As has been seen, Jehovah God does not reside in the physical heavens, being a Spirit. However, since he is “the High and Lofty One” who resides in “the height” (Isa 57:15), the basic sense of that which is “lifted up” or “lofty” expressed in the Hebrew-language word makes it appropriate to describe God's “lofty abode of holiness and beauty.” (Isa 63:15; Ps 33:13, 14; 115:3) As the Maker of the physical heavens (Ge 14:19; Ps 33:6), Jehovah is also their Owner. (Ps 115:15, 16) Whatever is his pleasure to do in them, he does, including miraculous acts.—Ps 135:6. In many texts, therefore, the “heavens” stand for God himself and his sovereign position. His throne is in the heavens, that is, in the spirit realm over which he also rules. (Ps 103:19-21; 2Ch 20:6; Mt 23:22; Ac 7:49) From his supreme or ultimate position, Jehovah, in effect, ‘looks down' upon the physical heavens and earth (Ps 14:2; 102:19; 113:6), and from this lofty position also speaks, answers petitions, and renders judgment. (1Ki 8:49; Ps 2:4-6; 76:8; Mt 3:17) So we read that Hezekiah and Isaiah, in the face of a grave threat, “kept praying . . . and crying to the heavens for aid.” (2Ch 32:20; compare 2Ch 30:27.) Jesus, too, used the heavens as representing God when asking the religious leaders whether the source of John's baptism was “from heaven or from men.” (Mt 21:25; compare Joh 3:27.) The prodigal son confessed to having sinned “against heaven” as well as against his own father. (Lu 15:18, 21) “The kingdom of the heavens,” then, means not merely that it is based in and rules from the spiritual heavens but also that it is “the kingdom of God.”—Da 2:44; Mt 4:17; 21:43; 2Ti 4:18. Also because of God's heavenly position, both men and angels raised hands or faces toward the heavens in calling upon him to act (Ex 9:22, 23; 10:21, 22), in swearing to an oath (Da 12:7), and in prayer (1Ki 8:22, 23; La 3:41; Mt 14:19; Joh 17:1). At Deuteronomy 32:40 Jehovah speaks of himself as ‘raising his hand to heaven in an oath.' In harmony with Hebrews 6:13, this evidently means that Jehovah swears by himself.—Compare Isa 45:23.", 9687, "XcloDvaUaa", -2],

	99194 : ["I'm speaking to you as a non-religious lapsed Catholic. There is no proof, and there isn't supposed to be.  God is about belief and faith, not proof. It's right there in the Bible: Hebrews 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. And the athiests have the same problem; they cannot prove the non-existence of God. Because proof requires direct observation, testing and vaildation. There is no valid way to do that. Therefore, because God is a faith-based entity, I feel that God exists only for those who have faith that He exists, and does not exist for those that do not have faith (and/or require proof).", 9684, "None", -1],

The source packages are here: Then run the following in the directory you extracted wine to: tar -xvjf wine.tar.bz2 ./configure make Caveats:  If you're using a 64-bit distribution (to find out, type uname -p in a terminal), installing Wine with CentOS is a bit tricky.  The gcc compiler, even with the latest CentOS release, is not sufficient for installing Wine for 64-bit architectures.  If this is the case, you'll need to upgrade gcc and the dependencies from source (requires root).  Plan on at least an hour or so of trial-and-error. You won't be able to use \"make install\", unless that is the permissions on the /usr/local/ directory are insecure.  You can add the path of the wine binary to your PATH variable so that you can just type \"wine <executable>\" instead of the full path.  In a terminal, type: export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/wine/binary/ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/wine/binary/' >> ~/.bashrc You'll most likely need to use an old version of Wine, mainly because due to CentOS's stability goal, they use old, patched scripts/libraries/etc, so there will be a lot of dependency fixing if you want to use the newer version(s).", 9688, "mMKS2KmGaa", 0],

	99198 : ["No. Windows Programs cannot be used on FreeBSD. Nor can FreeBSD executable binaries work on Windows or any other UNIX based OSs. You CAN run windows on *nix operating systems, including FreeBSD, with a package called Wine. I should point out that it is NOT an emulator or Virtual machine, but a complete re-implimintation of Windows API (Programming Interface...the foundation Windows programs are built on top). That means you don't have to have any sort of \"Windows\" installed anywhere, however it's all third party code. I find Wine works great with many small programs. Although, to get most stuff running, you will need to go hunting for a couple DLL Libraries which a program might assume you already had... this is expected though, and quite common installing any program in Linux. Wine even re-impliments DirectX (The Windows game engine), but that part is still buggy. Also, as far as web browsers, mail clients, graphic design, word processors, other office programs, etc... there are excellent freeware alternatives for the *nix world that are FULLY compatible with formats you are used to using with Windows. OpenOffice for example  Finally, I want to point out that FreeBSD may not be the best introduction for somebody completely unexperienced with UNIX operating systems... It is very popular with technically minded BSD enthusiasts and tends to follow more hands-on conventions. There are Linux Distros specifically designed for new people switching over from Windows, like XandrOS, Linspire or Ubuntu. This website reviews, rates, and links to all the popular Linux distros: And remember, most Windows users who are trying out a *nix keep a Windows partition around anyways.

	99205 : ["Does God exist? Theologians, philosophers, scientists, and atheists have debated the existence of God for hundreds of years. Theologians affirm His existence, even though they debate about who He really is. Philosophers ponder the ability of knowing God and if He exists at all. Scientists don't find Him under a microscope or on a scale. So they largely ignore and often define Him out of existence. Atheists, of course, deny Him and many of them try to prove He does not exist.  Yet, God exists. He does not exist because we say He does; He is independent of our proclamations. He does not exist because we want Him to exist; He is independent of our desires. He does not exist because in our ignorance, we insert God in order to explain the unknown; He is independent of our ignorance. No. God exists because He is. We Christians have experienced Him, felt Him, and know Him. We can see His hand in our lives. We see the circumstances of life move and be moved to bring us to answers that we know are from Him. We sense Him our prayers and our lives. We see Him work in the lives of others. We watch as He answers prayer and confirms in our own hearts His love for us. We know He exists because He exists. The Bible speaks of God and does not defend His existence. It simply asserts it. Sometimes there are simply things you cannot prove to someone else, but you know.

Jesus fell on his face and prayed to God in the bible..so how can he be God? moses or noah or abraham or any prophet didnt think of Jesus as God when he prayed u know. john , luke ,mark etc are pen names of historians that was not with jesus or knew him and only wrote hearsay over 40 yrs after jesus.

Quran says no man will be born in sin or inherit sin and is ONLY accountable for his own actions- personal responsibility! makes sense?  if jesus was sooo willing to die for your sins then why did he say to God; why have you forsaken me on the cross??
