When I first left school, I did school-at-home. I did it willingly, but it was always just a chore to get through, something I did because my parents said I had to. Then, we realized it just wasn't working. I was hardly learning anything, my sister was just fighting with my mom, and it was getting pretty expensive. So we just stopped 'doing school'. For about a month and a half, I didn't do anything. I was nine years old. I read a lot. I wasted my time outside. I watched TV. Then, I realized something. It was really, really boring, not doing anything. I started going to my mom and saying, \"I want to learn about [blank].\" But, by the time my mom did all the research on [blank], planned the museum trip to the exhibit on [blank], printed assignments on [blank] off the Internet, I knew more than she did. Now, I'm 15. I'm a happy, self-motivated learner. I'm taking an online AP class in US history, I'm a 'grade level' (what a weird concept) or two ahead in math, I've read at above college level for a long time. It's nothing special about me. My parents didn't hire tutors, or anything, they just gave me a library card and told me to get out there. Your son wants to learn. Nobody objects to learning. However, you will do it much more efficiently if you can learn to let him go on his own path. It can be frustrating for a parent at times, because his own path could be one that doesn't involve a certain subject for months -or even a year or two- after he 'should' be covering it. However, I can guarantee you that he will be fine. This year, I'm taking my first science class since I was in school in third grade. So far, I'm doing fine. I'm not all that interested, but I need it, so I'm doing it, and I'm learning. Keep playing games with him. Leave the books around. Get documentaries out of the library. Both of you should take a learning styles test. My family used 'Discover Your Child's Learning Style' by Victoria Kindle Hodgson. My mom is a Producing type, and a text-based learner. She's the model school kid. She likes workbooks, learns well from reading, is orderly, likes lists and has a place for everything and everything in its place. My sister is an Inventing type, and a hands-on learner. She's the polar opposite of my mom. Both of them are intelligent people, but they just work differently. One way of thinking is not superior to another. You may also find that your communication is easier. I'm a Performing type, secondary tied with Inventing and Thinking/Creating, and a visual learner. That means I have a lot of energy -physical and mental- and am always thinking about, and trying to build, new things. I get completely absorbed in what I'm doing. In school, that was considered disobedience. Also, I think that if you treat video games like this ultra-awesome reward, he's just going to covet them. My parents used a \"No games until your work is done\" policy. (I signed up for classes and stuff, self-directed =/= nothing happening.) Stock his room well with books and puzzles. Last night, I had my DS -which I spend plenty of time using- next to me, and I had a copy of 'The Age of Reason.' Because I don't think video games are this awesome forbidden fruit, I went with the Paine. There are plenty of times I go for the video games, but I see them as a form of recreation, not the reason to get through my stuff. Sorry if I sounded like an unschooling evangelical.", 10660, "None", 1],

	121370 : ["Well, there are probably as many ways of homeschooling as there are homeschoolers :-) but here are some of the main models: School at home - This is where you read the books, do x amount of worksheets, and call it a day.  This is usually the most comfortable method for new homeschoolers. Classical - There are two methods of this - Greek/Roman Classical and Hebrew Classical.  Both are based on the same model, but have different philosophies.  Greek/Roman is very much based on knowledge for the sake of knowledge (as their culture was based on education in order to gain knowledge or further the strength of the state).  Hebrew is more based on truly reaching the heart of your child in order to help them understand their world, their place in it, and their religious beliefs.  Both lend themselves well to worldview studies on the middle and high school levels.  Greek/Roman can be either secular or Christian, Hebrew tends to include Christianity or Judaism fairly heavily.  Here are some sites: Greek/Roman:  Hebrew: Unit Studies - This is where pretty much everything you do is based around a common concept or theme.  Take, for example, ocean predators: you can read about them (reading and comprehension), research and write a report on them (language arts and writing), perform experiments to show how a shark moves so quickly through the water or how the tentacles of an octopus suction onto their prey, or how different animals use advertisement and camouflage to stay safe (science); you can research a couple of famous marine biologists and their discoveries (history, language arts); you can make word problems based on the animals and their environment (math); you can research the different layers of the ocean, what their characteristics are, and what animals live there and why (science, language arts); you can do artwork based on the different animals, the biome, the plant life, etc. (art, science); you can find and analyze/memorize poetry based on different aspects of the ocean and the marine life (poetry, literature); you can do a study of the different layers and how they affect life (geography); and the list goes on and on.  Here are some sites that give info on unit studies: Charlotte Mason - this is very literature-rich homeschooling, and in its truest form is very structured.  It is also done in a looser, close to unit-study type of format.  It is based on the trivium (like classical homeschooling) but generally has short (20-30 minute) class periods and plenty of extras.  Here are some sites to give you info:  (free K-12 curriculum for CM) Eclectic - This method combines a bit of everything to tailor a curriculum specifically for your child.  If your child needs a very structured math curriculum but is a voracious reader and creative artist, likes hands-on science experiment but likes to notebook and timeline through history, this is for you.  It's just what it sounds like - pieces of everything.  Here are some sites: Unschooling - this method allows the child to study at their level and according to their interests, but allows the child to choose their own studies.  The parents act more as facilitators, supplying their kids with the opportunities and resources, helping them to locate answers when necessary, but otherwise letting them go to learn.  This works very well with a motivated student and a confident mom; there are unschooled kids that have gone on to become CEO's of very successful businesses, etc.  However, if you have a child that is unmotivated to learn, or is not at all confident about searching out information, this may not be a good idea.  Here are some sites: Homeschoolers use any and all of these, or even a combination of two or more.  You have the freedom to use whichever you would like, based on your free time and teaching style, as well as your student's learning style.  You will most likely find that your methods develop over time, as both you and your son become more comfortable with homeschooling and his abilities develop.  And it's fine to do that! Hope that helps :-) Edit...I just realized I didn't put down what we do!  Sorry about that.  We're pretty eclectic.  Math: Math U See, which is taught by DVD and very concept and manipulative based. Language Arts: Learning Language Arts Through Literature, a workbook that interrelates all areas of LA and ties them into literature. Bible: We do a family Bible study every night, and he reads a specific amount each day.  He also does tons in his AWANA books and studies up further on anything that interests him.  He also takes an OT History/Biblical Feasts class at co op. Science: We use Apologia, he goes through about 2 elementary texts per year.  He's starting 5th grade right now, will be moving into the jr. high program sometime next spring.  We also do unit studies whenever the interest pops up. History: We use both a textbook and a lapbook/notebook/hands-on study for history.  We're in American History right now, so we're using All American History, which he does pretty much by himself.  He also reads historical fiction and biographies at grade level.  We then do a study either from   or   to get more into it and nail down the ideas, people, places, events, etc.  We keep a general timeline in his notebook, and he does a specific timeline in his notebook or lapbook with each event that we study. Writing: IEW, which is integrated with his other subjects (generally Bible, science, and/or history.) Spanish: The Easy Spanish Greek: Elementary Greek Geography: Right now we use continent and studies from   we will be moving into a more literature and research-based format next year.  We also integrate geography with history. I think that's it...other than that we read, cook, go on field trips, make projects, and discuss.

	121374 : ["My birthday is December 30th 1991, two days premature of the day I was meant to be born on, January 1st 1992. And all my life I have sort of stopped, taken a beat and considered this, wondering how my life would have been different if I hadn't have chosen to come out when I did, but rather just two days later. I would have had a totally different circle of friends, different classes, different memories, different boyfriends. And everyone else I've ever affected would have been changed too simply by the lack of me being there to influence them. It gets me thinking about fate and my place in the world, like would two people have still gotten married if I hadn't introduced them? How much would they have changed, what's the range of my influence? What would people be talking about without me here to amuse them? And then bigger questions like would they miss me? Would their lives feel emptier, would they sense the lack of something even though they didn't have me to miss in the first place? The enormity of the weight of that moment hits me occasionally, and I have these musings, and this was the inspiration for my book. My book is a YA science fiction about a girl who lives in the world until upon her untimely death finds herself ripped from the world and stuck into an alternate earth where the only difference is that she was never born, and now she's walking around as a total stranger to everyone she knew. She feels like she is in a dream, that what's going on around her isn't real, so she's not afraid to act recklessly, becoming whoever she wants in the process. She discovers what it is that causes things like this to happen, not to mention the weird consequences of it, and is trying everything to return to her old life.  My interest in my own birthday isn't what made me come up with this story, to explore the possibilities in full or whatever, but when I did come up with the idea, because of my own soft spot, I just couldn't not write it. @Cody Hey, that song's kind of... great :) Not sure what made me search it, but thanks!

He's dying, and has to go back to his past to rectify mistakes before he leaves - it's about finding happiness and the true meaning of relationships. I'm also going to be soon working on the second draft of Anwen Knight and the Trolls, which was inspired by B&A (Beautiful Nightmare, Lily White, trolls and other users to be more specific), and it's about a young girl who leaves her tribe to fight the trolls on her own as everyone else is fleeing away and on the way makes an unlikely friendship with a beautiful by lost siren, Lilith White, and just a bit of fun with the Waki siblings (Lyra, Luthien, Chlover and Kelly!).

The buldge or build-up of water moves as the moon orbits the earth approximately once per day. This causes approximately two buldges (high tide / low tide) per day.

	121383 : ["Tidal forces in general are caused by the difference in gravitational force experienced between different parts of the same object.  When there is a large difference in the forces between the different parts (either because the object is very large or the gravitational field strength changes very rapidly with distance) then there are pulling/stretching forces experienced within the object as well as the overall gravitational attraction the pulls the centre of mass. In the earth/moon system, there is a large distance between the side of the earth near the moon and the side farthest away. This creates a stretching force - so the earth is pulled into a sort of bulging ball shape Of course, the oceans are free, so they also respond to this tidal force - they flow toward the point of maximum gravitational force which is the point where the moon is overhead.  That's high tide! On the far side of the earth, the solid planet has moved toward the moon but the tidal force on the water is much lower so effectively the ground falls downward - creating another high tide! That's the very basic idea - the tides are actually very complicated and controlled by things like shape of ocean floor, funnelling in river estuaries etc. The relative orientation of the sun and moon also plays a part.
