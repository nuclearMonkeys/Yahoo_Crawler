	63797 : ["Can i ask you how you would draw the line between macro-evolution and micro-evolution? If enough small-scale (micro-evolutionary) changes accumulate within a population, then the population will obviously become very different (macro-evolution) than the original population. If I step an inch a day, I will eventually walk a mile. The example of nylon-eating bacteria, which you scoff at, is an obvious, large-scale change. Nylon didn't exist until the 1930s - so there cannot have been any gene already existing in the bacterial population capable of digesting it. But such a gene has evolved into existence since then. You also ask for an example of bacteria evolving into a \"higher species\". By what criteria are you defining a \"higher species\"? What does \"higher\" even mean in this context? There are more E. coli in just *your* intestines than there are people in the world - so by numbers, they are much more successful than humans. Is that \"high\" enough for you? > \"Show me how slime turned into DNA\" This is a question on the origin of life - which evolution does not attempt to address (see \"Abiogenesis\" for the field of science exploring that). So this is not an obection to the theory of evolution. It is good that you accept the theory of the Big Bang. It is even better that you don't confuse it with the theory of evolution (as so many creationists do). Don't make the same mistake with Abiogenesis. One thing worth pointing out is that there is much, much more supporting evidence for evolution than there is for the Big Bang. If you are rational enough to accept the big Bang, there should be no reason why you cannot accept evolution.", 8202, "aaC2Qx1Uaa", 6],

It is only in their own sinful nature, where they can not seek God, or do any good, pure unselfish deed.

Why can't I use any of my other senses to experience him?\" Over the years, I tried looking for physical evidence of gods existence. I still have not found any. From the start of my first science class, I listened specifically for things that could prove that god exists. And throughout my school days, I found none. Recently, I looked into how the Bible contradicts itself and whatnot. Through the church, I learned that the Bible says that man should not lean on his own understanding. However, leaning on our individual understandings of the Bible is how many religions developed branches that can and do contradict each other much of the time. I thought about how many people in history have used god to create and fuel war and conflict. I thought about what gods ultimate goal is and the point of it. I don't see the point in giving your creations the ability to not believe in the Creator. If the Creator wanted people to believe in it, and it really had the power to make the people and their personalities and beliefs, why not make them only able to believe? It does not make sense.

The fact that scientist confirmed that there is proof that the continents were once one big land mass (Pangaea I think that's how it's spelled)  and now we have separate continents. Where do you think the mountains, ocean trenches, and under volcanoes came from? By fast rushing water. Finally, people have discovered shark teeth and fish and whale bones up on mountain tops. How else could they have gotten up there (thousands of feet high) and died if there wasn't water that covered the mountain tops at one time? (And NO....

	63818 : ["I'm Agnostic, but I'll answer your question anyways. I was brought up in a very strict pentecostal household. I wasn't allowed to wear anything other than skirts or dresses that went past my knees. Couldn't wear jewelry or make up, couldn't cut my hear, couldn't read Harry Potter, and couldn't do a handful of other things that I logically know to be absolutely harmless. In Pentecostal churches they believe you have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Spirit in order to go to heaven. So when I was 11 years old, I was baptized. Then the entire congregation came around me and prayed that I would get the Holy Spirit. They laid hands on me, told me to ask God to forgive all my sins and make me clean. This went on for about 45 minutes. And do you know what happened? Nothing. Know what I felt? Nothing. My only option was to fake it. So I did. I faked it. I pretended to speak in tongues and I jumped around like an idiot and afterwards they were so happy, but I knew the truth. They were idiots. After that, I tried going to other churches of different religions. I still felt nothing. When I was 17 I decided to read the bible from cover to cover and do you know what I found? It's a book full of hypocrisy. I do not confirm nor deny the existence of some sort of greater being, but the bible and organized religion are nonsense.", 8208, "Xp3H6n2Qaa", 0],
	63819 : ["I was born and raised in a Christian fundamentalist household. My parents so Republican that, if they were birds, they'd have two right wings. As a child, what your parents tell you usually have a big affect on you. They let me make my own decisions in regards to religion: they pushed their notions on me very early. My parents are very obnoxious and hypocritical. They're completely intolerant of people whose beliefs vary from theirs, and I knew that wasn't a good thing despite them telling me the contrary. By the time I was 13 years old I was an agnostic theist, but I still prayed if I wanted something, and I still went to church because I had a lot of friends there (and I was forced to go anyway). It wasn't until I was 16 years old when I really started questioning the existence of God. So, in an attempt to restore my faith, I decided to read the Bible cover to cover. If the Bible is truly divinely inspired by God, I should have no doubts regarding his existence when I read it. Instead, my doubts were confirmed. I recognize the whole thing was logically impossible from the start, but then it got worse. The Bible condones the murder of gays, witches, and anybody who refuses to believe. It also condones slavery and the beating of slaves, which is why Christians have murdered and enslaved people by the millions. I went from being a theist to an atheist in less than a day. Since my parents were fundamentalists (and still are), I couldn't tell them I was an atheist while I was still living with them. I would have been kicked out. So, I had to tough it out until I could live on my own. I told them I was an atheist over dinner, and they don't talk to me anymore. It's not easy losing relationships with most of your family and some of your friends, but it's not healthy to pretend to be someone you're not. I have a great life now, and I'm much happier being nonreligious compared to when I was religious.

	63826 : ["The first thing that comes to mind is the Miller-Urey experiment. Look it up on google! Diagrams will help show exactly what the setup is but basically, adenine, one of the 4 bases that make up DNA, was created, in a closed system laboratory experiment, using only the basic known elements/compounds present at the beginning of the earths creation. This shows that over time, in the right conditions, new compounds can be made, and the way these compounds interacted with each other is what created DNA and was the first stepping stone to life. If even one factor had have been different, such as temperature or the introduction or removal of another element everything would have been different; life may not have been made or something new and totally unfathomable could have occurred. a good example of evolution on a 'macro' scale is the phenotype (physical looks) of a moth. Moths are nocturnal creatures, so during the day they need a method of defense against their predators -there defense is their ability to blend in to particular surroundings. Grey moths blend in very well on birch trees making it difficult for brids to see them. A mutation in the gene coding for the color of the moth caused a moth to be black. This mutation, though not advantagous, can be passed down to the proceeding generation so long as the moth survives long enough to mate. So more and more moths may emerge into the population, however they are selected against because they stand out to predators during the day. In one particular area a factory was erected and because of the factory all the trees in the area were covered with soot turning the white birch black. Now, the once selected against black phenotype of the moth is no longer detremental but rather, has be come advantageous; the black moth now blends in on the tree during the day. So in this particular area the black moths flourish and thrive and are now the dominant color of their species in that area. Meanwhile in another area somewhere else in the world birch trees remain white and the original gene -the 'white gene'- is the gene selected for in that environment. This is an example of how a simple mutation of a gene in DNA can have a huge impact on a given species. However, this mutation is not one which lead to speciation - the creation of a new species. It is important to remember that evolution is not something we can observe in a lifetime. Evolution is a series of mutations that occur over time which get passed down to succeeding generations; each of which prove to be advantageous to the environment in which the organism lives. Most mutations result in detrimental affects to the individual. It is an extraordinary event when a benifical mutation occurs. Evolution occurs as a result of environmental stress and beneficial mutations. Due to the fact that humans reproduction rate is extremely slow (9 months for Homo sapien vs 20mins for escherichia coli) as well as the fact that, as humans, we alter our environment to suit our needs rather than adapt to our environment based on environmental stressors, some argue that further evolution for humans not likely. However, some individuals have extraordinary capabilities, such as the case with individuals having \"synesthesia\". Synesthesia is a condition in which one type of external stimulation evokes a sensation of another. For example, for some people having this condition or 'ability' different sounds allow them to see different colors, or, in more rare cases, specific tastes or smells cause the individual to see specific colors. How is this advantageous you ask? Well in an evolutionary sense it may not be. We do not need this ability to survive in our environment, and because of the society we've created it does not give us an advantage for life over another person who does not have this 'ability' but you've got to admit, it's a cool ability and hard to fathom. Studies on individuals with synesthesia have shown some benefits to having synesthesia. When read a list of items and told to recall them, initially the synesthesia-capable individual does no better than the average person in recalling the items, but, when asked hours later they can recall the majority of the list; more than they initially remembered. They have the ability to not only associate the items they are hearing into the schemas for which they have created for them, but they also have colors associated to each word. It is a possibility that in the future we will be able to 'induce evolution' by manually applying specific genes to the genetic makeup of an individual. Not only will it be possible to select hair color, eye color, and even gender, but it is also possible to include genes such as the one(s) for synesthesia into the unborn individual - a true act of \"playing god\"; although it doesn't seem at this point anybody is really \"playing\" anymore.", 8202, "27bf67894cbc5cfa304dbe2b01a0b7a3aa", 2],

If you're praying to show off you're not praying, you're making a political point. And yes, a reliable cite would be nice.  Most of these stories turn out to be completely different from what the agitators claim. EDIT:  Just checked five pages worth of Google results and found no such story.   What a surprise.  Or not. EDIT 2:  Every time a story like this comes up, it turns out that the kid involved was not just praying.  One of the supposed \"child got suspended for praying\" stories left out the fact that the kid had gotten into a fight just before that.  Another one involved some really insistent proselytizing of nearby kids who really didn't want to hear it. What's the real story?", 8213, "4sUek7ugaa", 1],
