I didn't notice the dead squirrel in the middle of the road, but she did. She stopped and rolled in it, completely ignoring my yelling at her to get up. We backed up traffic for a good five minutes. Another time she was laying down on a quilt. When she got up, a loose thread was caught on her collar. So she kept walking and dragged it around the house. When she was a puppy, she went into the bathroom, grabbed the end of the roll of toilet paper, and pulled it out of the bathroom and around the house until it was gone. One day my other dog, a Jack Russell mix, climbed on top of my Lab when she was laying down on her side, spun around in circles a couple times, and then curled up on top of her xD", 10382, "lMVLMOH2aa", 1],

Though it ended in horribly- those animals were owned by a self-proclaimed \"wolfdog owner expert\"- uneducated nut case- wolf, wolfdog or doggy dog- that was an accident waiting to happen. As for some fun positive stuff, my 2 rescued wolfdogs have been wild with the colder weather.  So wild in fact that my one young female climbed into my fig tree and got stuck trying to eat the last bit of figs that didn't drop.

	114186 : ["you Do NOT want your vagina to be \"tight\"!   Why does this Ancient MYTH still get Believed?? Please ladies Educate yourself on your Own body Being \"tight\" is a good thing. WRONG! Absolutely,  >>>. When a woman is aroused sufficiently, her vagina actually loosens and her cervix pulls up to allow for comfortable penetration. That is just the way that sexual arousal works for women, thank goodness. >>>> So you should be looser when attempting vaginal penetration, not tighter. >>>>> In fact, feeling \"tight\" is usually a pretty good indication that a woman is either not ready for penetration or simply does not want to be involved in penetration (or sex, period) at that point.  Being \"loose\" means you've had lots of sex/had sex recently/etc. Again, absolutely false >>>>. Being relaxed and well lubricated means that you're into whatever sexual activity is going on. It is important with this as well to understand that the vagina is a muscular tube. This means that the vagina will conform to whatever is inside it. So when there is nothing in a woman's vagina, it is closed in on itself (in other words, the walls will be touching). Essentially, it goes back to exactly the way it was prior to penetration. Immediately after sex, the vagina may remain relaxed for several minutes, but it will return to its prior state very shortly. Certainly, like any muscle, there are variations in muscle tone, but for most women, especially younger women, there's just no reason to worry about a lack of tone with the vagina and >>>. You could have intercourse everyday for a year and it still wouldn't change a thing. >>>> Similarly, you could abstain for a year and it wouldn't change a thing either (assuming that when you do have sex again, you are aroused and relaxed).  Penetration permanently changes the \"tightness\" of the vagina. Strike three! >>>  Penetration does not cause any permanent changes in the vagina. As I said before, the vagina is a muscular tube, so it stretches to accommodate and then returns to its previous state. Even vaginal childbirth results in very few changes to the vagina. In that case, the changes to the internal configuration are extremely minimal. Some change may be noticed in the vaginal opening if serious tearing occurs or if an episiotomy is done, but again this is generally fairly minimal. So if the passage of a baby does not permanently alter the vagina, it's not even logical that intercourse would cause changes. I haven't heard of a penis that's the size of a full term baby, have you?   So in short, worrying about being \"tight\" is a pretty pointless and actually counter-productive thing to do. Having sex will not make you looser. Not having sex will not make you tighter. There's not anything that is going to make you permanently \"tighter\" that is healthy or a good idea. And if you are feeling tight, that's a good sign that you don't want to be having sex right then", 10380, "2kpr2arRaa", 1],

If she is drinking at 12 just think what she will be doing in a couple of years.  She is also way too young to be out on her own at night,especially late at night. You have every right to be concerned about her safety.  Check with your town and see if they have a curfew law.  If she is out after curfew call the police and have them write her up.  It might not do much good right now but if you have to try to get into family court in a couple of years it could be very useful.  It would also show her that her behavior is not acceptable and you will report it to the authorities. She is your husband's daughter, not yours. He is the one who should make the rules and enforce them.  With your input and help. He is the one who should give her consequences.  It is not your place to be the sole parent.  That will only build resentment between you and her. You have to get your husband on board somehow.  I am so glad to hear you are seeking counseling for yourself.

Any of our counselors would tell him he is has to participate in parenting her, that she is not your  sole responsibility.  What kind of parent is he going to be to your three other children? You are also always welcome to call our hotline for support.  Take care and good luck. Mardee Crisis Counselor", 10378, "None", 0],
	114193 : ["agencies lie to get candidates on their books and then they can go to employers and say they have all these candidates.
