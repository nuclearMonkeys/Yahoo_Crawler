What you do with the cards is up to you, the card dealer has unlimited cards and deals cards one at a time very fast! You are the only player (apart from the dealer), so you get the cards dealt to you a top speed! Then someone else joins the table, and the dealer now has to deal to the both of you (one card at a time), the speed that you are receiving is now cut in half! The dealer is still dealing at the same speed! Now lets say 8 more people join the table, you are only receiving a tenth of the cards in the same time as you would if you were alone! Now take into account that you are not the only person in your area on the Internet, you may find it faster if you use the web at, say, 3am, than it is at busy times.

This is why the facebook, twitter, and other social networking apps are invasive and unsafe. There is zero reason facebook needs access to *control* a phone or tablet's camera. Access to photos so people can share them, yes. It doesn't need to have control over the microphone and camera so users can share photos and audio but it does. And people just click by giving it permission to invade their privacy when they install or use those apps.Â  Use a web browser instead of the app if you insist on supporting cancel culture social networking. It's best to not participate on those networks at all.Â  If you use a laptop or tablet or have a smart TV with a built-in camera put a piece of electrical tape over the lens when you're not using it.
