We still won't be able to use any words other than English. Besides, we have all kinds of questions as well that belong under different categories. Darth Father has a brilliant idea. But how on earth will we get our own sonkolletjie site if yahoo doesn't have staff in SA? Besides, some of us do browse in other categories, having contacts from other categories too. That will make it difficult for us. Boikotting sounds like a good idea, but it won't help... would they even miss our questions and answers in this section? We would miss it more! A petition won't work either, as it has already been tried. The link Vango gave looks like a nice sonkolletjie for us within yahoo, but somehow I don't think it's the same. The links Cakes mentioned also look nice, but somehow I don't think that's the same either. We will all keep coming back and yahoo knows that. So do we. The idea of having our own 'sonkolletjie' sounds like a great idea, but if we think about it carefully, this is in fact what we want. Just like it is. We know that the rules are there for a reason. All we need to do is play it safe. If we want to use words like  'sonkolletjie', perhaps explain it under source the way I just did. I feel, this gives us the freedom to perform our own individuality, yet it is not completely out of line, anybody who understands English can follow it. Then also, if we want to ask a poll question for example, go ahead, post it in the poll section, most of us are connected anyway and we will find each other's questions easily. Sure we can stick together in other sections too! Besides, we will get more answers that way.", 10609, "AA12129729", 2],

The easy way is to start with the canned biscuit dough, like \"Poppin' fresh,\" you know.  My grandmother always made her own biscuits, my mother used Bisquick, and I have further degraded the recipe. Anyway, peel a couple of nice tart Granny Smith apples and cut into narrow wedges.  1/16 of the whole apple is the idea, so give yourself about 32 of them from the two apples.  Sort of.  More or less.  No; more, rather than less.  They shrink. Grease a baking dish generously (including up the sides) and put the apples in a layer on the bottom of the pan.  Usually, you put them in rows, with the narrow edge of one covered by the broad edge of the next, like shingles almost.  They will shrink when they bake, so you overlap them about halfway.  Make a nice tight layer of apples.   Now take your Pennsylvania Dutch Spice Mix [4 parts cinnamon, 2 parts ginger, 1 part nutmeg, 1 part cloves] in a shaker bottle and dust those apples until you've pretty completely covered them in spice blend.  Then drizzle about half a cup of dark Karo syrup over them.  (It beads up on the powdery spices and looks cool; let the kids do that part.)  Dot the whole surface with little bitty dots of butter.  Use maybe two tablespoons of butter, but distribute it as well as you have patience for.   Now pop open the biscuit dough can and spread the dough out until its about the same size as the pan you have just prepared, or maybe a little larger to give you some slack, and put it down on top of the apples.  Make the dough totally fit the pan, right up to the edges, to cover the apples neatly.  If \"poppin' fresh\" didn't already do it for you, score the dough into small (2-3\") segments, and bake it at 375 F for about 30 minutes, or until the biscuit is golden brown and the smell of it baking is driving you all crazy.   As soon as you take it out of the oven, put a large plate upside down over the pan and turn both upside down.  Let the pan sit on top long enough for all the syrupy stuff to drip down, then lift it off and serve your Apple Pandowdie warm, maybe with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you're really not concerned with calories.", 10616, "AA10235908", 0],

	120378 : ["Yes it is against the law. Obviously Mom's credit is ruined, or Mom would just apply in her own name. People don't change their money habits usually, so the obvious effect is this will destroy your girlfriend's credit as well. This is not your problem unless you plan to marry her. If so, then you DO have a stake, and this could really mess up your family's finances, since the effects last 7 years after it stops. You must face a reality: Most children learn all their money lessons from their parents, and turn out like their parents... so you should assume she's going to be exactly like her Mom unless she really works to change that. A start would be positive steps to shut this down and make sure it never happens again. The first time it happened, your girlfriend could get the fraud undone. But since it keeps happening, your girlfriend may be seen as \"allowing it to happen\", and she may become liable for Mom's debt. The costs and bad credit will make it even harder to move out, so the cycle continues. How should SHE get out of it? I'm going to write this advice as if speaking to her. #1. Go to a different ZIP code (next town over etc.) and find a provider of a \"Private Mail Box\", such as The UPS Store. Those have a street address (not a PO Box), that is very important. Your address looks like Lisa Simpson 1234 Main St. #567 Shelbyville RI 12345 Make sure your mom couldn't talk them into handing her your mail. Also ask about a front door key so you can get mail 24x7. This will be your new, permanent business address. Ouch I know, but you have no other choice short of reporting your mom to the police. #2. Contact your bank, debit card, DMV, IRS, and everyone you get or pay money from/to. Give them your new address as if it was your only address. If the company insists on having your physical address, it's OK to leave it the house, but change the BILLING address to the mailbox. Every company will allow you to do this. Don't tell them it's a mailbox. Do NOT tell the Post Office or use one of their \"kits\". That would re-route all your mail, and you do not want friend mail, packages, magazines, junk mail etc. filling the box. Now you never get a bill at home. Any bills coming to your home address are fraudulent. #3. Apply for a credit card using the new address. That will a) get you a credit card while you still can, and b) guarantee that all three credit bureaus get your new address. #4. After #3 has cleared, put a fraud alert and a freeze on your credit report. Do not put any statement on your report, because you can't remove it later. #5. Run your credit report, and find out how bad the damage is. The credit report should go to your new address, of course. Figure out what to do from there. If there's a card with no/low balance, and you're willing to take it on as yours, then you could always change your address with them, and report the card lost/stolen to shut off her card,, and have a new card issued to you. #6. Every time you pick up your mail, open and read all of it, BEFORE you get home. That way items don't go \"missing\" in the night.", 10612, "None", 0],
