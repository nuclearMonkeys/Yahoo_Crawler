Extremely close. However, I know my place. There are just some things you don't do. Especially if he has a girlfriend.  It sounds like, to me, you have a case of the jealous best friend. I think she does like him, a little TOO much. It's okay to have nicknames for your best friend (I have some for mine), but hers are a little too girlfriend-ish for me. They sound like the nicknames that only you should be calling him. Also, all the physical contact..., un-huh. She's stepped out of her place. It's a little much for me. In your position, I'd be pissed. I'd say that you don't necessarily have to be worried, but you should be a little concerned (these are two different things!) Honesty is important in a relationship, so I think that you should bring it up with your boyfriend. It's extremely important for him to know how you feel, and that you want him to address that. Don't forget, however, that trust is part of a relationship, as well. So, if he tells you that you have nothing to be worried about, let him know that you trust him, and don't stress the issue. DON'T confront her, either. That would just make you look like a jealous *****, and ultimately, give her more of a chance, as it would push him in her direction. However, if nothing seems to be changing, and if you keep bringing the issue up, and nothing makes a progress in the opposite direction...maybe you should rethink the relationship. -hugs- Good luck :)", 10002, "None", 1],

Perhaps where you are from you can turn a guy around from not wanting you to marriage in a relatively short space of time.  Here on Earth, that can't be done. The guy has grown away from you and is displaying it over and over and over.  He is now down to telling friends you are not attractive enough for him.  That's a slap in the face and I'd like to know where your pride is or don't they have pride on your planet? Yes there was spark...WAS spark when it started.  Now there is NO spark.  The mistake you are making is in thinking the spark stays there and that it doesn't burn out.  It does.  He doesn't want to be in a relationship and NEVER has.  He might very well be into a relationship but it's just not with you.  You cannot play your cards right.  The cards have been dealt and he has the winning hand.  When someone makes it that clear he isn't in to you there is no changing their mind and if you had any pride you wouldn't want to go begging.  He doesn't want to love you or be in a long-term anything with you.  It's hurtful but that's what happens in relationships both single and married. If you moved in with him then the lease is in his name and you can move any time you want.  If  he moved in with you then you can't move but you can give him 30 days to get out because the lease is in your name.  If it's in both your names you can give him the money for the 6 months and move, get a receipt!  Or you are stuck in an icky situation and if you were smart you'd try to stay busy and away from him and sleep on the sofa if you have to. It's done sweetie.  Move on as soon as you can.

Until I decided to tell her what i felt, she said she also liked me but she was afraid to ruin our friendship. So maybe one of you should make the first step. Anyway back to the msg,  that one sounds nice, but you might eliminate \"kind\", cuz thats like i miss you... maybe... You can be more direct.
