Make sure you send a nice thank you card for gifts, and buy gifts ONLY for the occasions that you can and feel compelled to buy for (compelled by the spirit of giving, not the obligation to do so).   Here is a way of looking at this situation that may make you feel better.  You've let them know that their presence is gift enough, yet they CHOOSE to buy gifts.  If you don't accept them, or don't ALLOW gifts when someone WANTS to buy one, you are depriving them of the pleasure of giving.  While it is kind of you to think of their financial situation, surely you must realize that unless your relatives don't have any sense at all, they won't spend more money than they can afford.", 11350, "TXddP0uxaa", 0],

If they are giving for the right reason, they will not expect anything back and just your presence at those occasions [ , birthdays] will be a gift to them. If they buy clothes or shoes for them, make it a point to dig them out and have them wearing it when you know you will see them. There is nothing sweeter than seeing a child excited and in something that you bought for them! You may just have to get creative, remember, children do not expect much and will be happy with a simple bag of m & m's and are easily entertained with big boxes!", 11350, "lLCxEyQOaa", 0],

Some of these children are most likely printing two spaces high, but you will get some good sentences, although some will write more. They have already put in a full day of school and may have spent a lot of time writing earlier so some may write less. To get them focused, first brainstorm together some ideas about your topic.  You print some of their  words on large chart paper or a wipe off board to make a word bank so they feel the need to ask about spelling.  Then have them create an illustration first to get the ideas flowing.  Encourage them to think about what they want to say as they draw.  They can pull some good adjectives from their illustration to expand their sentences.  After the stories and pictures are mounted, be sure to have each child read the story aloud and show the picture.   It is a lot easier and faster to staple the pages on 12X18 construction paper.  This is also easier if the child writes more then one page.  Remind them to only write on the front and the you can staple them at the top of the sheet so the top sheet can be lifted to reveal page 2 (or 3).", 11353, "56YkWIAdaa", 0],

	137415 : ["I had a wonderful relationship with my son's kids up until about a year ago. He was the happiest little boy. My son has issues with me and so he has decided to terminate me as grandma. I am the only one. The others are all deceased. This has devastated me and my six-year grandson. We only get to see one another every 5 or 6 months now, but the relationship has suffered because it hurts so much when we have to say good-bye. We both cry because we don't know when we'll see each other again. We used to go camping together, have sleepovers, go to the park, bake cookies together, etc. Now I can only spend a few hours together at a time at the parent's house only. It's very hard on the two of us. The younger grandson never had these experiences so I don't know if he misses it or not. He does realize that his brother and I have a special bond together. Will this be harmful in the long run? I don't know, it saddens me that their parents don't put any value on their kids having a loving grandma. They don't want to invest the time or energy to maintain the relationship. I think this trend of thinking the nucleus family unit is good enough is destroying our family values in this country. People are just too busy and think primarily of their own wants instead of giving their children the bigger gift of family. P.S. I had a small family but did have a loving relationship with my grandparents. I am so thankful now that my parents gave me this gift. I will treasure my memories always.", 11353, "s6oNl53Daa", 0],
