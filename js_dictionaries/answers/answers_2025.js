	107017 : ["This is quite an event developing upon itself.  Judging from what you've put down on here, it surely sounds like that is something of a spark between the two of you.  However, I've noticed that there was no mention of going out casually outside of school.  (But then again, you could also both be busy after school as well) It wouldn't be considered a simple friendship since there's a little bit more to it than that given the circumstances.  Nor is this all that complicated either.  I can read here that you both have done something that resulted in the two of you admitting to each other that you're interested in each other.  But here's the thing, she seems rather shy and there's the possibility that you might be the first (and maybe only guy) to compliment her in such a way.  So if that's the case, then it goes to show that she may not be used to it.  But that does not mean it's a bad thing! All girls/women like a good compliment every once in a while. My advice? Continue to be nice to her for starters, and give her some compliments every once in a while, try to identify any changes she may do.  It subconsciously shows that you're paying attention to her, and if that's what she wants/like from you (like if she smiles and giggles/blushes at that), then she'll most likely be cheered/brightened up from that small attention.  Whether she changes her hair, has new shoes, etc.  But nothing too analytical.  You don't want to go overboard with it considering how shy this person sounds as well.  Try to balance it out, I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out. The next thing I think you should try to do is see if the two of you can get together outside of school.  Get to know each other and see if there's something else you have in common next to school and classes.  Because the person you see inside school may not be the same person outside school.  Who knows? Maybe you'll find some more commonalities between the two of you.  If at any point when/if you hang out with her outside of school you are introduced to her parents, consider that a major step forward as well.   All in all, just be yourself, be nice to her, don't rush things, and look for any signs from her.  Don't pressure her, and don't have her do things she disagrees with initially.  I'm sure you'll do fine with this, you certainly sound considerate enough for this person and I hope for the best for you. Good luck! XA", 9976, "vYLWumZsaa", 1],
