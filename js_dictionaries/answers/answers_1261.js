	68604 : ["As a trauma doctor I see a lot of patients come in with serious injuries and the primary reason for most of the cases an altered Reticular Activating System (RAS). RAS is responsible for altering your conscious state of mind so that you can sleep. Sleep by definition is an altered state of consciousness or reality. When you continuously lack adequate sleep then this system will become altered in response to your bodies conditions. Your body will then alter normal and healthy processes in order to compensate for your lack of sleep so that you may still be able to be conscious and react to things.  5 hours a night is not going to be detrimental to your health as long as it is not chronic. Your body absolutely requires sleep in order to repair itself and recharge its batteries. You can never really \"catch up\" on your lack of sleep. Sleeping at night at least 7 to 9 hours is recomended. The best hours of sleep you get based on sleep studies is the hours prior to midnight. That is when your REM (Rapid Eye Movement) cycle is most effective and in stage 4 of the cycle which means a deep sleep. The more sleep you miss out on the more vulnerable you are to fighting off infections as your immune system never has time to rest and overworks itself. Cardiovascular problems are another issue because your heart will overwork itself as well which can lead to Congestive Heart Failure, Renal Failure or another common problem of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy.  Your body needs sleep and taking naps can help but won't cut it. You need to sleep more than 5 hours a night. Talk to your physician because it could be a medical problem that is causing you to lose sleep at night. If not then you should really prioritize your schedule to fit more time in to sleep.
