They were Americanized. They were believers of our constitution, not the emperor.

For example, grandparents are given most respect with 'grandad surname'. aunts and uncles being one generation above get some respect, so 'auntie forename'. Cousins and siblings are equals, so forename only but sometimes preceded with 'cousin', bringing us to the distinction hypothesis: My father's brother is John, who has a son John, while I also have a brother John. Adding the relationship into the name distinguishes who is who (from your point of view) Uncle John is my father's brother, cousin John is my uncles son, our John is my brother.", 7611, "IXUtYqhyaa", 0],

	54755 : ["The fact that you enjoyed writing it is a good sign. I encourage you to keep following your joy. That said, on with the constructive criticism. There is an overuse of descriptive words. It becomes more redundant then imaginative. There also doesn't seem to be a clearly defined purpose. You may know the reason you wrote it and the meaning behind it, but your poem should be able to convey that to your audience. I have no clue what you are talking about and why. You sacrificed a lot of impact to use those big descriptive words. You missed opportunities to rhyme. The structure seemed to be you just going from one short description to the next, without adding to an overall picture. Meaning it's hard to see how each line connects. So my advice to you if poetry gives you joy is to work on ways to serve the audiences understanding of what you are expressing, rather than just speaking from your own secluded perspective. Make it relatable. And work on rhyme schemes so that there is more flow to your piece. Make the structure of your poem more progressive, so that each line adds to the last, enhancing the overall meaning and potency of the poem. Also prioritize what you use descriptive words on. Highlight what is important to the meaning, and let what is not assist the flow and structure. Finally, study the art of poetry in depth, and apply what you learn. There are many ways to make your work more creative. Wordplay, metaphors, and various other ways to keep your poem from getting stale or repetitive.  Aside from all that, don't let anyone discourage you from doing what you love, and keep love as your inspiration for all you do, for nothing can be mastered without it. Not yourself, and not your gifts.", 7634, "cVUPGMJgaa", 2],
