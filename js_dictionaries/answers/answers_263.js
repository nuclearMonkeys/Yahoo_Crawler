	13173 : ["I think it's part of a fukked up baphometic agenda if you noticed the elite are trying to disrupt the energy of masculinity by decrease a masculine traits increase  feminine traits in men while on the other hand for women to decrease femenine traits increase masculine traits and also causing gender tension between men and women (aka feminist movement and toxic masculinity) but no matter what... if we look at it from a scientific view point a woman could never be genetically compatible to a man and vice versa there are only 2 sexual identities that exists (male and female) but there are probably at least 50 gender identites as of now so what if women are able/allowed to do things men can/should do? Well the result of that is reverse gender roles example man get pregnant by woman stay at home dad and the mom goes out and work and there is a transgender couple right now trans man (female to male) and trans woman (male to female pre op) who just naturally produced a child so that's just an experiment of what's to come in the near future ", 2197, "None", 0],
	13174 : ["\"What do you think of the feminist claim that laws advantaging women are needed create an equal, level playing field?\" I think that specifically shows how feminists now believe that equal Rights, Opportunities and Freedoms are no longer good enough for their idea of \"gender equality\".  Another aspect of this is that it shows how feminist actually disrespect women's ability to compete against equal men by demanding that women be advantaged.  Then they have the gall to call that condition a \"level playing field\". We are more than half a century into full legal equality for women now since the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Most women alive today have never suffered any type of legal inequality.  Women have mostly retained their traditional female privileges as well in the social vein.  But while most women notice the lesser and lesser double standards that still affect them socially, almost none see the privileges that still exist for them. Meanwhile, men are still burdened with their traditional social responsibilities while being dragged down with legal discrimination under this strange idea the equal women simply cannot compete against equal men without being advantaged somehow.  If I was a woman, I wouldn't be happy at how feminists view my gender in such a disrespectful light. .", 2197, "aSm9xSn3aa", 3],

Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 2204, "None", -3],

	13180 : ["If your novel is following the classic three-act structure, it's not what chapter number you're at or how far into your word count you are, but what's happening that determines where you are in that structure. Your first act sets up who the main character and supporting characters are and the world in which they live. Your MC has a need or problem and their attempt to deal with it leads to a turning point, an inciting incident which changes the direction of the plot and ends the first act. In the second act, your MC's efforts to resolve the issue of the inciting incident are the meat of the novel. In rising action, their efforts are ineffective. They react to what happens. Here the antagonist is better developed while the MC's situation worsens, often with a turning point of a serious life-or-death situation that will change the MC forever, no matter how it plays out. The MC needs and makes allies (who are not necessarily faithful) and changes from reacting to circumstance to acting to affect them. The second act ends with an all-or-nothing push to overcome the antagonist's efforts. The third act, usually the shortest, is the climax and resolution. This general structure, which sounds like an action novel, can apply to romance, erotica, coming of age, magical realism, fantasy, and other genres you wouldn't classify as action.", 2205, "dYA8AerXaa", 2],
