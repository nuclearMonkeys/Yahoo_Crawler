	108610 : ["The most important thing to do here is to bend down in the water and wet your hands before you handle the fish, as the fish will always have a protective coat of  a slimy like substance on it, and this coat protects them from bacteria and disease and as long as your hands are wet with the river water this coating will not be disturbed, this is extremely important if the fish is to survive.   The next advice I will offer would be to use the circle hook on these fish as these hooks will catch the fish on the way OUT of the mouth and will rarely \"guthook\" a fish, therefore allowing a much easier release, and with these rules followed, you may very well catch that very same fish a couple of years from now plus a few pounds.", 10060, "AA12322123", 2],

	108624 : ["Well first you need to wet your hands with the same water that you are fishing.  This will help keep the protective slime on the fish.  All fish need this to survive, and if you take it off of them it could hurt the fish.  Now with plain hooks, I would suggest using a pair of needle nose pliers, and grab the hook at the bottom on the bend of the hook and push down and out. This will push the barb of the hook away from the opening of the wound and when you push out this will let the hook slid out of the entrance point.  Now if the fish have swallowed the hook and you cannot see it, cut the line as close as you can to the hook and release the fish DO NOT PULL THE HOOK OUT OF THE GULLET This will most likely KILL the fish.  With a lure you can usually hold the lure and use the same technique, however it is still good to use the same technique with a pair of needle nose pliers... For handling the fish, it depends on the species of the fish... You best bet would be to research the species of fish that you are catching on a search engine you can type (how to handle a blue gill) for example... If you have any questions about a specific fish please feel free to visit my forum and ask myself or my pros a question.  Hope this helps ", 10060, "None", 1],
	108625 : ["The best way to do this without hurting the fish is always set the hook correcly. Set it so the hook sets but not so hard that it rips it out also when your reeling in keep the line tight and dont jurk it or let it loose. When u have it in you grab it by the lip if possible and if not grab it on the back . Then you grab the hook and then push down then pull out pushing the hook down wards un hookes the barb and doesnt rip the skin as much. and dont be scared to put some force into it Another helpfull thing is than you can flatten the barb with pliers or go buy hooks without barbs this is also important that you keep the line tight because you don't have that barb from keeping that hook from slippen out", 10060, "Jyo8LyOfaa", 0],

	108630 : ["Stalin was born in 1878, the son of a drunken cobbler and a devout seamstress. His early life was marked by extreme poverty, sporadic violence and religious observation. As a young man he was a bank robber, extortionist and professional revolutionary, and as an adult he was a master manipulator - something he learnt on the streets of Tiflis and at seminary school - and a voracious reader with a phenomenal memory. He left school and became a professional revolutionary - organising bank robberies and extortion across the Caucasus region. In 1905 he meets Lenin for the first time at the Bolshevik conference in Tammerfors in Finland. He quickly becomes a leading Bolshevik - through his writings and his willingness to act as enforcer for Lenin. When the October Revolution takes place he is either at his desk at the party Newspaper - Pravda, or at the Petrograd Soviet, depending on which biography you read.  His job was to provide Lenin with a safe-house and passage out of the country had the revolution failed. In 1917 becomes the Commissar for Nationalities. In 1922 he becomes the General Secretary of the party. After Lenin's death he vies for position with several rivals, notably Trotsky, he defeats them all by 1928, becoming the undisputed ruler of the country. Main policies: Five Year Plans: The FYPs came as Stalin was busy destroying opposition to his rule in the Party. The Left Opposition of Trotsky and his supporters had been defeated, expelled from the party, exiled or executed as had the United Opposition of Kamenev and Zinoviev and their supporters. The FYPs were Stalin's chance to mold the party and the country in the way that he wanted. He was able, through them and through the political climate that they engendered to push through social and economic changes that enabled the Cult of Personality to flourish. Collectivisation: Farms were taken over by the state, farmers had to hand over their land, livestock, grain reserves and machinery. They then were paid wages and became workers. WWII He organised the Soviet armed response to the Nazi invasion of the USSR, his armies push the Nazis back over 1000 miles from the Volga to Berlin. Post War Organised the countries that his troops liberated on Soviet lines - creating the satellite countries. Established the Warsaw Pact as a response to NATO. Organised the Berlin blockade to try to force West Berlin to merge with East Berlin - failed. I haven't covered his death toll, as that would require a much lengthier answer.

	108643 : ["OK assuming you don't know the background: From 1613 to 1917 Russia was ruled by the Romanov dynasty. They were the Russian royal family and exercised autocratic control (meaning basically the masses weren't represented). They were overthrown in February 1917 and replaced by a provisional government who ruled until October 1917. This is when the Bolshevik government (communists) came to power, led by Lenin. I`ll just give some basic outline stuff: Stalin grew up in Georgia, trained as a priest for a while and had a fairly troubled childhood- his mum was beaten by his dad most days. In 1903 he joined the Bolsheviks (headed by Lenin), they were technically an illegal group of political activists. He was involved in bank robberies, handing out pamphlets and so on. Lenin (Russia's leader) died in 1924, but he didn't say who should follow him as leader of Russia. This left several possible successors ( eg Trotsky and Zinoviev if that's important) but no one managed to become the head of state (immediately). Stalin, through his positions within the communist party (being its general secretary meant he could choose who to appoint for certain posts for example) changing alliances as and when it suited him and other means was announced 'Vozhd' (meaning 'boss') in Pravda, the official communist party newspaper in 1929 (on his birthday-historical footnote). The most important thing to remember about Stalin is his absolute paranoia, he trusted no one. He has been quoted as saying 'Death is the solution to all problems. No man - no problem.' and  'One death is a tragedy; one million is a statistic.' another one I remember reading but can't find the source for along the lines of 'there is nothing more satisfying to lie in bed knowing your opponent is taken care of' (meaning a political 'opponent' killed). This and also his desire for power were his motives for killing so many people. He launched the purges 'Great Terror' in the 30s which left millions (precise estimates vary) of his own citizens dead, took control of peasants farms which turned Russia in to more of an urbanised and industrial society (people put in towns to work in factories and so on). All this terror and cruelty reduced the citizens to slaves (worse than the Tsars ever did). Ultimately, it made Russia a superpower because it had so many workers being used to increase the state's power. try:  wikipedia might have some good info as well?", 10062, "pZYnoMnZaa", 0],
	108644 : ["The view of Mr. Poom (above) is a little one-sided to say the least. Stalin was dictator of Russia and First General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922-1953. During World War 2  he witnessed the deaths of 20 million of his own people , primarily from invasion by German Nazis. At war's beginning he was allies with Hitlerite Germany. Before  World War 2 he adopted the false agricultural science of his geneticists  rather than Western geneticists who base their knowledge on science. This caused widespread famine from 1932-1933. In the late1930s the Great Purge or (Great Terror) began.He then proceeded to kill 60 million of his own people with forced deportation and mass murders , or sending them to gulags or prisons where the famous book by SSolzhenitsyn\"Gulag Archipelago\"  was written.  During world war2 he ordered the invasion of  Poland, Finland, the Baltics and Bukovina. His successor, Nikita Krushchev denounced his legacy as have others This is a very brief overview.

	108654 : ["Stalin, a political name adopted when he was 34, meaning Man of Steel, studied for the priesthood under his real name, Dzhugashvili. Son of a shoe maker, he joined the Social Democratic party after being expelled from a theological school for insubordination. After the RSDLP split in 1903, Stalin became a member of the Bolshevik party. After the October Revolution Stalin was elected to the post of commissar for nationalities.  Throughout the following civil war, Stalin ascended the ranks of the government through extensive bureaucratic manoeuvering and in 1922, received the majority vote to become the General Secretary of the Communist party. In the same year Lenin called for his removal, explaining that Stalin had amassed to much power, in what was to become known as Lenin's last testament. Following Lenin's death in 1924, a wave of reaction swept through the Soviet government. Stalin introduced his theory of socialism in one country, where he explained that Socialism could be achieved by a single country.  Unlike former inner-party debates, where the positions of either side were written in newspapers, talked about in public meetings and soviets; the reaction and practices of the long and devastating civil war, caused a 'debate' that was completely hidden from the public, in order to 'establish the appearance' of a healthy, stable, government. In 1927, after years of bureaucratic manoeuvering, the members in the government that were part of the Left Opposition were deported on a wide scale. Immediately following, Stalin announced his theory of social fascism, describing that the theories of Social-Democracy and Fascism were essentially the same. Following this new theory, members of Social-Democratic organisations (of which Bolsheviks were once a part) were arrested or deported. In 1929 the right-wing of the Communist party, led by Bukharin, was removed from the so-called \"soviet\" government by the Stalinists.  In late 1928, Stalin introduced methods of productively advancing the Soviet Union via forced industrialisation and collectivisation. These efforts were tasked out in five year plans, the first of which included a widescale campaign of mass executions, arrests, and deportations of the kulak class. Russia advanced tremendously from the draconian measures implemented to ensure that \"socialism in one country\" could survive. Russia moved from complete devastation and destruction after WWI and the Civil War, to become a nation that was one of the most powerful in the world: achieving such goals that 30 years previous would have been viewed as wholly impossible.", 10062, "5HDFJjptaa", 0],
