Depending on his fur (which I am guessing is rather short and curly) you should buy him a jacket to keep him warm. He may get too cold other wise. If you go out in conditions with freezing rain or wet snow, consider booties because snow can get stuck in their paw pads and if it freezes it becomes very painful.

I meet my husband who had a 6 year old pit, who from the min I meet her loved me to death. To this day that dog would lay down her life for me if needed. She is not a bad dog or mean, a big baby. I had a 4 month old daughter at the time, When my husband and I got married even thought I loved his dog we both were scared to have her around the baby, as she had never been around one. When my daughter started walking the dog took to her right away, loves my daughter with all her heart. She stood up to my husband(the guy who had been with her since she was a puppy) because he was going to spank my little girl . So yes I think it is all how you raise a dog that makes it good or bad. Those bad should not own those sweet babies...... Ashley who said.....Well there is a reason pit bulls are not allowed anymore. And anyone who breeds them will have their dog put to sleep. So I am not sure how you have a pit bull anyways.... Pits arent allowed where? I dont know where you live but where I live there is nothign that says you cant have or raise pits. Here look at this!!!!!! I bet if you go take the test you will not even know what a pit is!!! If every single dog bite was reported, you'd be surprised to see that American Pit Bull Terriers would not even be on the list.  The American Temperment Test Society tests breeds every month of every year and comes up with percentage scores out of 100%.  The American Pit Bull Terrier scored an 84.1% - The Golden Retriever, America's most loved breed, scored an 83.8% !  Hmmmm.....That's interesting isn't it?  How did your favorite breed score?  Check it out here:  Another interesting tidbit: Majority of domestic violence cases in the United States are caused by MEN. Are all men considered dangerous?? No! So then why would all American Pit Bull Terriers be dangerous because of a few bad owners? If you want to see some more interesting stories and those that were corrected due to incorrectly identifying the breed of dog - actually, the news people always know what breed it is, but they know it gets more attention if the term \"pit bull\" is used - so they're always more than willing to retract it later - the news has already been run and the American Pit Bull Terrier's name already been dragged through the mud! Most of the time, the headline will read \"Pit Bull Attack\" and then the story will say it was a Lab mix - what the news people will do to drum up some interest.So take a look at the 20 pictures and click on the one you think is the American Pit Bull Terrier! It's fun. Found another one too.", 11060, "14a951e7c179e3e12fed8aef9fe9e9eaaa", -1],

The proper motions of galaxies are not very large and therefore not in the relativistic realm of consideration. It is the cosmological that accounts for most of the speed of recession we see and it does not effect the mass one would observe for any given galaxy. Suppose I am in my galaxy and another goes flying by at 99 percent the speed of light. In order to get going that fast a lot of energy would have to have been pumped into it to accelerate it to that high a speed. And there is an equivalence of energy with mass so the mass I measure for the galaxy would be much greater than the rest mass of the galaxy. However if space is doing the expanding then no energy need be added to the galaxy to have it moving away from me. You can use the old dots on the expanding balloon.
