	16769 : ["Just replace it yourself, it isn't hard to do. Download the parts manual, which should show you how things go together.  Remove the pull start housing and carefully remove the damaged cord - I say carefully because the rewind spring is in there too, and lots of people have no experience getting that thing back in there.  I've done it enough times that replacing a cord or even the spring is nothing to me anymore, just a bit on the messy side. Getting the old spring out is pretty easy, get the cord pulley off and often the spring comes too - a bit violently.  Be warned.  If that isn't a problem then you can carefully extract the spring one coil at a time, retaining the rest with a thumb as you let the tension off what is extracted. If the new spring has retaining wires on it, leave them on until you've tucked it into its new home, and then carefully clip the retainers and wiggle them out of there while holding the spring in place.  Then you can lay the pulley back in and get the cord back on. What you do to add tension to the cord is this: either wind enough cord on that you can then pull it out and install the handle at that point, leaving sufficient tension in the starter, or else wind on what you have, pull the cord out until you can pin the spool in place (some have a pinning hole right in them for exactly this reason, just poke a screwdriver or something through them to hold them still) and then wind the cord you pulled out, back onto the spool by wrapping it around the spool while the spool stays still.  Then install the handle and boom, done.

I was in somebody's bathroom once and they left a book of matches on the top of the toilet I guess so that you could light one and it would get rid of the smell. Personally, I think it's kind of ridiculous but it might be better to try that approach than to burn your house down. Or just go out and buy some Glade mist aerosol spray at the store or something. Open the window maybe? Put on the ventilation fan? Don't leave the bathroom until you're sure the smell has dissipated?I don't know. It just seems like There are more pressing concerns in this life and in the world at this moment.But I know how self-conscious people can be about human odors. We really don't like being human. You have to sanitize the sh*t out of everything so we don't have to deal with our humanness.

Of course he got a lot of heart attacks when he got older but that was from doing too much cocaine. That's another matter. They also did a study and they found that the people in India who live in the lowest class where they live in filth and they eat dirty food and they're generally unclean are also the ones who have the lowest incidence of Covid I guess because there immune system's are stronger from dealing with all those germs and bacteria all the time. Something to think about. And there was another study in Sweden where people who did their dishes by hand instead of sterilizing them in the dishwasher, their children actually had fewer allergies because their immune system's are also stronger.
