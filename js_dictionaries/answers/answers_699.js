	38789 : ["1) US has no universal healthcare.  Aussies can rock up at an A&E at a public hospital with a bad accident, heart attack, broken bone etc and voila, treated.  In the US?  An appendectomy and it's $30,000-$60,000(+) 2)  Because a lot of people (like 50 million) have no health insurance, and a lot don't enough insurance, they can't afford a doctor (and free or cheap health care is hard to access) so conditions that could be treated are left a lot longer and often with more catastrophic results.  Here in Australia, a person with diabetes for example, can access (preventative) health care whilst they just have diabetes.  If there are issues rising from the diabetes, they are often picked up at a way earlier stage and can be treated.  Whereas in the US, because people can't get to the health care, something like skin discolouration (the first sign of say circulation issues) is missed and people aren't getting treatment until they're losing a limb instead of getting preventative treatment which in Australia may prevent a huge number getting to that stage and delays it for years and even decades... 3)  Drug, food and similar standards are higher in Australia than the US...", 5696, "None", 2],

Both Charles and Diana had reservations about their marriage. They had not seen each other much and really did not know one another. Diana hoped that the marriage would work out, as did Charles who had ended the affair before the couple married. What doomed the marriage was incompatibility and insecurity. Diana's constantly accusing Charles of having an affair when he wasn't didn't help matters.  Charles and Diana just weren't suited to one another.", 5705, "Iqp3ZUAlaa", 1],

(Even in the bush or the outback!) It's the 'Drop Bears' that you should be afraid of the most...Just don't go walking under gumtrees at night! That's all I say about that one, you've been warned! :/ 2. Canberra. Many areas/suburbs have resident kangaroos roaming around/living there, or you can see roos, as well as koalas and emus in the wild in the surrounding national parks. Tidbinbilla specifically. (Great tourist/picnic location) Or, go for a drive to Mt Ainslie. Huge views of Canberra and the region and lotsa roos. And is only 10 mins drive from the city! Canberra IS known as 'The Bush Capital' afterall.. ;) Near to Tidbinbilla is Honeysuckle Creek. Home to several huge radar dishes and the space observatory which assists NASA in ALL thier space expeditions, including the 1st landing on the moon and tracking/communicating with the ISS (International Space Station) etc. Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide all have large zoos also, or if you go to Brisbane and drive north an hour to the Sunshine Coast, you'll find the home of STEVE IRWIN'S 'Australia Zoo'. Where you'll see a few crocs as well..!! ;) I don't like your chances of coming down here for a while yet though I'd say, due to Covid, but at least you'll have lots of time to plan your trip..!?

With the possible exception of Northern Queensland where it's advisable to take great care because of jellyfish and crocodiles.  Unfortunately you didn't mention the duration of the trip.  Because of the vast distances that can be involved it really does make a huge difference.  One city in particular may suit your bill is Canberra the Capital.
