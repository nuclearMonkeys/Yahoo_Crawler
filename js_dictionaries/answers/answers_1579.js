He is part of the tribe actually. Don't believe the McCain misleading name. He will protect the banking and investment community. Only the U.S. Congess has any power to stop this takeover.

	84632 : ["Speaking God's word to the lost is rarely popular. Occasionally it brings some to repentance and that is the goal. Jeremiah wasn't exactly well liked for his warning the Israelites of their judgment to come. It was so hard for him that he wanted to shut up and not speak of God anymore but the Word of God burned within him and he could not. It is not optional to tell others that God has given us each a way to escape the punishment for our sins, because he loves us. And, no, it's certainly not popular, especially to tell people that we are all sinners and that sin leads to hell. But it is the truth and everyone needs to know it.The decision is up to them. America and other modernized counties are no different than those in the past. What we see today is much the same as when Israel drifted far from God and fell into immorality and corruption. The question is whether we are trying to be popular or please and obey God. God bless!!", 9174, "721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa", 0],
	84633 : ["Jesus said the world would come to hate those that spread His Fathers word, because He knew that there would come a time when non-believers would far out number believers and followers.  None of us are perfect, nor or we expected to be, but we do have to be responsible for our own actions whether it's Gods word or man made laws involved.  People have always been better at telling others how they should  tend their backyards when they were never able to tend their own. Christians are no different, nor are Atheist, nor any other denomination.  I have made mistakes, sometimes acted in a manner that may not have been becoming to the status  of my beliefs based on human wants and human needs or feelings.  But that in itself is what makes me human, for I would rather cut off my right arm than to offend anyone.  And if there are those out there that I have indeed offended by the human failure to practice with perfection that which I believe, then I humbly and sincerely apologize.", 9174, "None", 1],
	84634 : ["A couple of things. First, I think we often forget that what we were told to spread was the good news. Not the good opportunity. Not the once-in-a-lifetime offer. News. Which may mean simply that we're supposed to tell people what we know, but that we're not responsible for convincing them of anything. Second, some of what passes for evangelism now (and ever since I was a child) is just...well, rude. Let's pretend for a minute that the good news we're spreading isn't about Jesus. Let's say we're spreading the good news that people don't have to die of heart disease if they'll just eat right and exercise every day. Does that make it okay to walk up to people who are overweight and say, \"Hey, do you realize if you don't stop being a fatty you're going to die of a heart attack in about six months?\" But that's what I see a lot of my fellow Christians doing. \"Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior? Because, if you haven't, you're going to burn in hell.\" I wouldn't respond well to this approach--would you? Christians end up being a lot more persuasive by not trying to persuade anyone of anything. Live an honest, loving, peaceful life. Eventually the people around you will begin to wonder what you know that they don't. Wait for people to invite you to discuss your faith.", 9174, "PTAfLQBOaa", 1],
	84635 : ["i do no longer locate Obama electable in any respect through fact all he has gained somewhat is the democratic primaries. he's lots too imprecise and does not somewhat answer a right away question with data, only greater skirting around the project. i've got no longer heard the guy supply one unmarried plan for action on those adjustments he tricks at. So, how can he somewhat win the final election if he's not telling anybody what he might somewhat do. That harm John Kerry badly through fact, no count number if or no longer you like him, President Bush has consistently only mentioned what he might do some specific project and has caught to it as terrific he can with Congress giving him one among those stressful time. I see a considerable landslide this autumn with the republicans triumphing no longer basically the white homestead however the congress and senate through fact the final public of people are unwell to death of ways the democrats have behaved the previous 4 years with the final 2 being the worst behaved congress and senate I even have ever witnessed. they have whined and moaned and only oftentimes shown their behinds of their movements and function held up significant law which could have been straight forward through fact they needed to grant the President a stressful time through bitter grapes over the final 2 elections. so as that map you maintain bearing on with the blue and pink states won't count number this time.

	84636 : ["while I'm a Clinton supporter too, I love both of them, as I've accepted Obama will be the nominee, I am not sure he will win, but not sure he will lose. I think he has a popular vote edge, in that he is a Democrat, and is a better campaigner. He is also very charismatic. However, I do worry his color, name, and pastor will hurt him in the key battleground states. This is all offset by his lackluster opponent. While you may think, and one may think McCain is a good opponent, he is really REALLY old, and he looks it too, unlike Ronald Reagan, who had hair and colored hair. McCain also wants to run an honorable campaign too, which hurts him, because Republicans only win when they do that, except for Reagan in 1984. He will call out 527s, as he did in 2004. I think that because when asked if Obama was qualified, Mccain was the kind of opponent who was dumb enough to take his major talking point away and say Obama IS qualified. This really is McCain's campaign to lose, simply because he doesn't have the baggage, or at least visible baggage yet, Obama clearly has with Rezko and Wright. I think us Dems got shafted with candidates this year, as we have no sure win. I wanted Gore from the start because I thought he was that. But he knew better than to wreck his reputation by getting the race card played against him like the Clintons have now, so I chose Hillary because of experience, Bill, and she deserving it. But now, I don't think she could win, because of the bad blood blacks have now, and we need them to carry us in November, as they did in 1992, 1996, and the 2000 popular vote. Also, she is so hated over this primary fight, even by Obama supporters, there is a facebook group with a million hillary haters, and she's just so old to the scene, McCain could try to hit her \"dishonest\" image. Obama may, sadly be the more electable one. We'll see how this goes. I hope racism doesn't keep the GOP in the White House this year.", 9170, "None", -1],

Here is a link where you can get answers for why evolution is hogwash:  I know you're not going to go there and if you do you won't believe it, but I figured I'd throw it in. And Huckabee is in this race to stay. He is #1 in SC, #2 in FL (behind by 2%), #2 in MI (behind by 1%), #1 in GA and #1 in Texas. Those are only the states I know about; I'm sure they're plenty more.

I, for one, do not appreciate being told that I am leading a sinful life when I know for a fact that I am leading a much more moral lifestyle than many of my college-aged, Christian peers.  I don't smoke, I quit drinking, I don't sleep with random guys, I help out in my community, I create art, and I love and respect my parents.  I try to be a good role model for my younger brother, and I work hard to do well in school.  Not because the Bible or the Ten Commandments or Jesus tells me to - because I want to do the right thing. So, what right does someone else have to tell me I'm going to burn in hell when I do everything I can to be the best person I can be?  Whenever I am preached to, I know it pushes me further and further away from ever returning to Christianity ever again. I don't understand why people feel it is their personal duty to inform people of what God they should be worshipping.  Let people find God themselves - why do you think they need you to help them along?  I know that my God is more loving, compassionate, forgiving, and understanding than any of us could ever begin to comprehend.  He/she/it is kind of a hippie, like I am.
