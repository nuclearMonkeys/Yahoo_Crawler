It is a major fault with the human species.  It takes a lot of work for a person to stand against that internal drive to blame others.  Lots of people fail, if they even try.", 7676, "WbVE1cXKaa", 0],

Example, Darwin, during his time on the Beagle, observed many facts. He put them together and formulated the theory of natural selection. This theory has probably been tested more than any other theory in science and has never been disproven. That is as close as you can come to proof (outside of math and logic).

So are there more recent theories with the same level of confidence? As far as I'm aware, there is nothing recent that would be classed as a theory. Things like the detection of the Higgs particle and gravitational waves are not theories in themselves, they are details within otherwise well established older theories. And all the other theories (\"proven\" or not) that come to mind are old too. In fact it is the nature and definition of a theory to tie together several ideas so as to explain a general phenomenon. And really there are very few new phenomena at all, and even fewer that need a new theory to explain them. Usually they are just explained - or not.", 7664, "jB2Z6uxhaa", 1],
	55101 : ["There is so much wrong with this question it is difficult to know where to start. A theory is in science something that is widely accepted and is supported by a preponderance of evidence. I think the concept to which you refer is what science would call a hypothesis. This is an explanation for observations that is currently being tested. For a hypothesis to be 'promoted' to theory requires evidence not proof. You could look up their differences because evidence and proof are different. We deal with the former in science. That does not completely deal with this question but hopefully points you in a more correct direction.", 7664, "kz04oBhsaa", 1],
