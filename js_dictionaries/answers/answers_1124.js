	61688 : ["I believe 100% that racism is alive and well in America. That said, if you whip out the race card on every little thing, especially for something as insignificant and dumb as a summer sci-fi film, then you are simply going to perpetuate the very racism you are attempting to fight. You know the story of the boy who cried wolf, don't you? Keep crying racism every time a movie doesn't have a black lead in it, and no one will pay attention when racism does, indeed, rear its ugly head. This movie had nothing to do whatsoever with race.", 8128, "4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa", 5],

Thinking about it now, you might want to go with a nice dress and a cardigan over it. I don't know if you've seen any but for the senior portrait itself your shoulders are bare and they give you a black wrap that goes across your shoulders. That's how the shot comes out. So I recommend, wearing a nice necklace (and some nice earrings, if you want) and just making sure your hair/makeup looks good.  I'm guessing you're planning on taking casual photos too and that's why they told you not to wear crazy prints. The shirt you've chosen is fine, just know that it doesn't matter for your actual senoir portrait, because all girls will essentially wear the same thing.", 8135, "7b4e1f441947487d12ce068889cb53f2aa", 0],

And no use of playing Ojha. India must go with B. Kumar, Dinda, Harbhajan, Ashwin & Sir Jadeja. India will need two real pacers in Mohali. A dummy like Ishant won't work.

You're right about wondering why they're hanging out for pretty much a week straight. Your girlfriend might not know it but he is DEFINITELY flirting with her. He might like her intellectually, but he did ask if she had a boyfriend. Your girlfriend needs to be confronted, but confronting her the wrong way might cause you to lose her. And don't beat up or hurt the guy. Then she'll probably empathize with him for you being emotionally disconnected with her needs. Compete for her love!!! Show her what she's missing and how much more of a better lover you are. If your girlfriend said no twice and then said yes to going out to see a movie (at night... romancing the stars!) then your girlfriend might not have a lot of self control. Otherwise, she might just need more stimulation in her relationship. Spark your relationship up a bit! Don't get jealous though! Jealousy isn't love. Be understanding and emotionally there for her. Surprise her with something from the heart this Weekend! It doesn't even have to cost anything. It has to be from the heart. Do what your heart tells you! Trust her, respect her, and be her lover! :D Romance her heart! 0_o ----- Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dude!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D I just read the last part that you updated on, \"Additional Details.\" You have NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT! Your girlfriend loves you. However, if this last longer than her school project then you might have an issue. Next time you see her just be yourself! Love LOVE, LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOT! WOOT! You're looking into this a little too much. If she said that she doesn't like him then leave it at that and trust her completely! Love isn't a liar! :D However, still make sure to do something extra nice for her! :D You never know, he might be an expert of persuasion! :P And, anyways! She's your girlfriend!!! You're supposed to let her know that you really love her once in a while!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Otherwise, where is the love?!?!", 8133, "PdKajVqVaa", 0],

Giving chances to a guy when he ask you out definitely gives confidence to them. It's like you felt the same way and enjoying their company as well. Better hold on to your gf. Us girls are easilly carried out to what the guys are showing us.

If she says yes, get his number or email and send him a message or text or whatever, and tell him to back ! I hope that everything works out!", 8133, "fLoFMhDMaa", 1],

	61709 : ["I would suspect that straightening your hair would be kind of an iffy thing-- something you haven't done very much, if ever at all? So, you're treading on new territory with that, and taking a risk that it isn't going to work as well as you think.  That could be a disaster. Your senior picture is quite likely going to be still around 30 years from now, or even longer.  The hairstyle in that photo should be very natural, the way your hair really looks.   I do think that it would be nice if you could find a way to tame the frizz, though... and there are some very nice products out there for that.  One is simply called \"No-Frizz\" -- it is an oily product that smells fantastic, and you just put a tiny bit on your hand, rub your hands together, and just evenly cover the surface of your hair, to tame the frizz on the outside without killing all the body underneath. My own hair tends to be somewhat frizzy, and one thing I've found that works pretty well is an electric, heated curling brush.  If you take a strand at a time, hold the curling brush sideways, wrap it around carefully, hold it for about 30 seconds, then brush it out, that will usually leave you with waves that are not too curly, and it does help tame that frizz.  BE CAREFUL, though, not to wrap it too tightly, or catch hair underneath, because it is easy to tangle that brush in your hair and have a real problem! Practice doing this well before picture day, so you will know exactly what you're going to do before you get down to the wire.  If your Mom is good with hair, I'd suggest asking for her help.  After all... who's paying for the pictures?  They should be nice for you, but also for your Mom.  Good luck!!", 8135, "03b0148713f2aafe7bebae49d5dfaf32aa", 0],

It is your hair your senior pictures you should wear your hair the way you want. The pictures while I understand I think your mothers' feelings regarding your hair should let you wear your hair the way you want. now for the curly hair part I have the curliest hair. It is also the frizziest if the humidity is over 1% I wear my hair straight ALL THE TIME. It is how I like me!! And it is reflected in the way you carry yourself and boosts your self esteem and self confidence. Only someone with the same type of hair could understand. There is NO WAY in the world I would want pictures with frizzy hair. I hope it works out for you hun!", 8135, "AA11460851", 0],

	61716 : ["I am 15 and I LOVE Halloween Horror Nights!!  HHN is amazing! I went last year and it was awesome. The haunted houses are awesome. Most of them are dark and people pop out at every corner. The haunted houses are usually themed and this year, the Carnival of Carnage, is centered around Freddy Kreuger, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface, the main characters of the horror films, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There will also be a haunted house centered around the movie Dead Silence. The park atmosphere is made scary by the various scare zones around the park. These are kind of like an \"outside haunted houses\". It is extremely scary but fun at the same time. I strongly suggest going. And if you go, I would look into buying an express pass to cut the lines. Hope this helped! p.s.
