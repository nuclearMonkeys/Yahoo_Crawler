Going along with your family may be in their best interest. A person is required to vote and think and a manner to which is their best interest. That's what freedom is. The fact that your own father yelled at you for being an adult and your own person, shows his level of maturity. But I'm not surprised as most liberals will yell when they have no other means to defend themselves. Well you do have a responsibility to vote, you also have a responsibility to your family because they are paying for your schooling. So in the future, Vote and don't tell them. Instead infer that they aren't respectful to you for your choices thus you will not enter into these conversations with them. BTW you are right, Republicans don't hate Spanish people, or any other people for that matter. Republicans welcome an encourage immigration, \"Legal immigration\" as those here legally work and add to our tax base. Democrats will use hate mongering as a guilt process in order to brainwash people into doing their bidding. I.E. voting for more democrats so they can gain the political upper hand to promote their agenda. The only Agenda Republicans have is to increase the prosperity of all US Citizens through their belief that independent hard working people provide jobs for other independent hard working people. The socialist agenda of today's Democrat is a kin to what has happened in Greece. More people working for the government, and more people on the dole of the government means less taxes collected by the government. The more benefits the government pays out the more people insist the government pay out. This leads to the collapse of all economic structures all times it is tried.

	85946 : ["No.  Not as you have defined it.  Most agree that the Bible, including the New Testament, condemns homosexuality as a sin.  The idea that some people are born with innate sin, which cannot be changed, implies that these people cannot be saved.  That no matter how much they wish to rid themselves of this sin, not even God can help them.  That goes against the fundamental teachings of Christianity that all who desire to come to Christ can come to him, that he will heal them of all their weaknesses and sins, and the sins they repent of will be forgiven them, and they can go and sin no more.  In a word, the idea of innate, unchangeable sin makes God look bad. I'd like to point out a distinction between a same-sex attraction and homosexuality.  Homosexuality is a behavior, not an inborn feeling or desire.  I don't think any behavior is innate and unchangeable.  But it seems to me that we all might be susceptible to a certain amount of same-sex attraction, and that some of us may be more susceptible than others.  If we are all susceptible then events or experiences could fan the flames of this attraction, or diminish it, depending on the nature of the experience.  We are not all born alcoholics, but some seem to be born more susceptible to alcoholism than others.   To the argument that no one desires to have a same-sex attraction, so it cannot be by choice, I disagree.  Given an increased susceptibility to same-sex attraction, and given an occurance of child molestation, it is reasonable that such an individual could identify himself as a homosexual.  Once this self identity is fixed in his mind, it becomes nearly a death experience to forsake it.  You hear self-proclaimed homosexuals talk with pride about their sexual orientation.  They don't like the social disapproval, and they fight against that, but they enjoy their homosexual experiences, for the most part.  More importantly, they cannot imagine being who they think they are without it.  If they give up that self identity they are lost, and have no idea who or what they are. In a sense, an alcoholic does not choose to be an alcoholic.  He doesn't want to be dependent on alcohol.  But he became an alcoholic by choosing to drink often enough that he became hooked on it.  Suggest to a self-identifying homosexual that he try to change and you often get vehement denials that it is possible, and often assertions that being gay is a good thing.  He can't want to give it up, in many cases. Once a person has identified himself as a homosexual, and practiced it often enough, it is very hard for that person to change.  Some want to change, and some try, and some succeed.  But some who try just cannot seem to manage to escape the same-sex attraction.  It seems to be a particular burden they are forced to carry, and they may have to carry it into the next world.  But our actions are under our control, and our thoughts are under our control.  We will be judged by our thoughts and actions, not according to our temptations, trials, or burdens.", 9209, "AA11460171", 2],
	85947 : ["I don't think a Christian could promote this kind of view. AA has a statement that once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic, and you are never cured, just learning to resist and cope. I disagree with this. Everytime you are tempted to do something wrong, that does NOT imply that you are that person. An alcoholic can be totally set free from God, and for a Christian to say that a person can NOT be set free from their sins simply does not understand all that Christ's sacrifice bought for us. In other words, applying this to your question, a person is NOT a homosexual if he does not practice it if he is resisting temptation and saying \"NO!\" to sin. Furthermore, everyone who ever has a sip of beer or wine is NOT an alcoholic, and there is no such thing as a \"latent alcoholic\" you either IS, or you AIN'T. The same is true with homosexuality. Furthermore, I can fall into a sin, but that doesn't make me a sinner. I need to ask God to forgive me and get up and wipe my feet off (proverbially speaking). That is true of ANY kind of sin. If a Christian falls to a temptation, \"we have an advocate with the Father\", and \"if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" So, if being tempted to follow homosexual interests makes a person a homosexual, then using that same logic, if a person is tempted to have a beer or a glass of wine (with their dinner, for instance), the implication is that this person is a raging alcoholic!  That's nonsense! He doesn't have to go to AA and \"come out of the closet\" as an alcoholic! I believe these homosexual claims are full of rubbish and worse. I believe they belong in the toilet and flushed away with the rest of the filth! It's total garbage, and I believe they want any excuse they can find to justify their behavior, even to the point of changing the definitions and pointing fingers at others so they don't look or feel so bad about their own life choices. (I trust my illustrations using alcohol makes sense.)", 9209, "AA11849917", 2],
