	49754 : ["A quick way to find out is to go to eBay and search for these kinds of cameras and see what their current sale price is. The price fluctuates, depending on whether there are people looking for cameras. Right now spring is approaching, and people are more likely to buy cameras than during the winter months.  The AE-1 is quite common and it is not autofocus so it has very low retail value. It has the Canon breech lock mount, which has been obsolete since the late 1980s. The Nikon N4004 is autofocus, but it is not a camera intended for serious amateurs, let alone the pros. It does have the ability to accept practically all Nikon mount lenses made so it is more valuable than the Canon AE-1. if you are looking to sell them you are unlikely to get more than $100 for both of them. If you are buying them, then look for the cheapest prices and you can return them if they are not working. ", 6996, "None", 0],

	49758 : ["A large part of sensor performance is its ISO performance.  Based upon dpreview.com's Studio Tool, they both have the same ISO performance.  The tool doesn't have test results for the D5200, but it does have it for the D5300 which is the same as the D5200 with some non-sensor upgrades.  Here's a link to the comparison:  Now, since we know that the image quality (as a result of sensor tech) is the same, that is not to say that you won't get better images from the D7200 vs the D5200.  What I mean is that the D7200 has some capabilities that the D5200 does not. Check out this side-by-side comparison:  The D7200 does have a higher ISO limit than the D5200.  This is irrelevant because the image quality is unusable at ISO levels well below the highest ISO setting.  So who cares if the camera has a top ISO level of X if the image quality is unusable? The D7200 is designed for those who shoot sports/wildlife & fast action more so than the D5200.  Features like 51 focusing point vs 39 (D5200) can help the camera attain focus quicker and more accurately in fast-action situations like sports. The D7200's viewfinder shows 100% of what the sensor sees vs 95% in the D5200.  This can help you avoid having unwanted things like tips of twigs and light posts in the shot. The D7200 has a top shutter speed of 1/8,000th vs 1/4,000th in the D5200.  Technically speaking, this will stop action better.  However, in real-life situations, a much more common usage for such a fast shutter speed is using a large aperture (e.g. f/1.4) in bright scenes.  Based upon the Sunny 16 Rule, on a sunny day, your exposure will be 1/100th at f/16 @ ISO 100.  At f/1.8, your shutter speed must then be 1/8,000 to obtain an equivalent exposure.  Using a D5200 in this situation would require the use of a filter like a neutral density or polarizer to cut the light down to avoid overexposing the image. The D7200 has High Speed Synch (HSS) tech.  This allows the use of any shutter speed just as long as you have a speedlight that also supports HSS.  The D5200 doesn't have this feature.  HSS is critical for those who use flash as a fill flash in bright situations. The D7200 can shoot at 6 fps vs 5 fps on the D5200. Not much, but it could allow to get that one extra frame that best moment. The D7200 has +/-5 stops of exposure bracketing.  Often beginners will use bracketing to ensure that they get the exposure right.  However, a lot of landscape shooters do high-dynamic-range (HDR) which takes a bracket collection of frames (between 3-9 frames) and combines them into one image with extended dynamic range.  Having the ability to shoot 5 frames vs only 3 makes this process much more convenient.  You can do this manually, of course, but having the process automated is nice. Video performance on these cameras is rather poor, but at least the D7200 has a headphone jack so that you can monitor the audio quality during the recording as opposed to finding out your audio is bad after the fact. So while the D7200/D5200 have the same image quality, the D7200 could allow you to get the shot in situations where the D5200 could miss it.  It really depends upon what types of photos you want to make.  If these additional features don't matter to you, then put the money saved into a better lens to get better image quality.", 6988, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],
	49759 : ["According to the DxOMark web site, both sensors used in  the bodies have nearly the same performance.

	49761 : ["The Leica M is a rangefinder camera. The early ones used film and the latest ones use digital sensors. Rangefinder cameras do not have a reflex mirror, which is standard equipment on DSLR and SLR cameras. Rangefinder cameras use a separate optical viewfinder to focus. They do not focus through the lens on the camera. SLR and DSLR cameras allow the user to view the scene and focus through the lens they will use to take the picture, so the photographer sees exactly what his picture will include. Rangefinder cameras, because have a separate focus and viewfinder, do have what is called a parallax problem, meaning what the photographer sees is not exactly the same as what will be included or excluded from the final image. Some photographers prefer the M series because there is no moving mirror and no sound coming from the moving mirror. That allow the photographer to remain unnoticed, so they can take candid photos. For example, official White House photographers of the past would use the Leica M series to take photos inside the White House, and the photographer can remain relatively unnoticed while world leaders talk. ", 6989, "Z4palWQcaa", 0],

	49777 : ["It will depend on whether you have your own inkjet printer and how large a print it will print. If your printer can only print out 8x11 inch prints then that would be the maximum. Some professional photographers who do their own printing have inkjet priters that can handle much larger prints than 8x11. They are expensive though so if you only print out a few of them then you may as well take your file to a commercial photo processing facility and pay them to print it for you. You may have a camera with lots of small pixels crammed onto a small sensor that is capable of producing large files, but it would not produce large prints that are sharp. There is a reason why professionals use medium format cameras that cost an arm and a leg. They do it because these cameras have large image sensors so they can produce sharp prints that are large sized.  Because Olympus boxed itself into a corner by betting that its smallish 4/3 sensor can remain competitive, it has pretty much gone out of business by selling its camera division to a private equity firm. IOW, it lost its bet.

	49793 : ["No. If image quality is what interests you, no APS-C camera can produce images as good as a full frame camera. The 90D is a marketing gimmick. It is loaded with a lot of bells and whistles, or features that are often found only in the top of the line cameras but it comes with a cheap APS-C sensor, and the sensor is the most important part of a camera when it comes to image quality. The larger the sensor, the fewer line pairs per mm a lens has to resolve, and the fewer line pairs per mm a lens has to resolve, the better its ability to recreate the contrast of the original scene. The higher the contrast, the sharper, crisper and cleaner an image will look.  It is the main reason why Ansel Adams used a 8 x 10 view camera and why he rarely ever used a 35mm film camera. The 8 x 10 camera has a film size that is 8 inches by 10 inches. No enlargement is needed when one makes an 8 x 10 inch print. In contrast a 35mm camera would have to be enlarged 8 times to make the same print. The difference in sensor size between APS-C and full frame is not as great as that between 35mm and 8 x10 cameras, but the same principle applies. The Full Frame 6D MKII will give you sharper, crisper images than the 90D.  The 6DMkII is not going to allow you to shoot as many frames per second as the 90D and so forth, but the pictures you do get are much better in image quality. You have a choice of buying a 1D-X or buy the 90D if you want the bells and whistles of the 1D-X and the image quality of a Rebel series camera or you can buy the 6D and get the image quality of the 1D-X without the bells and whistles, such as a better autofocus system or the ability to shoot more pictures per second. .", 6999, "None", 0],
