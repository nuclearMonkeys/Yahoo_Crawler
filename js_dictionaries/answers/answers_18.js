As M said, a hybrid is neither one thing nor the other. If I have a hybrid that is half X and half Y, then categorizing it as either X or Y is inaccurate. It is a hybrid - that's why we have the damn word. We use language in science to describe reality as accurately as possible. Also, you do not have a clue what a \"subspecies\" is.", 154, "AA10317096", -1],
	915 : ["A hybrid is a hybrid. A hybrid is not a subspecies. For example is a male lion and a female tiger were mated and the female gave birth to a live infant it would be a lion-tiger hybrid and given the scientific name: Panthera leo X Panthera tigris. If an individual were a subspecies of tiger and, say, it belonged to the Sumatran subspecies its scientific name would be Panthera tigris sondaica. First, a species must have at least two sub-species (although some may be extinct) but never one. Suspecies are populations of a species living in different areas of the species' range and which differ from each other by morphological characteristics. A hybrid is an individual organism that results when two individuals of different species mate and a viable offspring is born. However, hybrids are infertile. UPDATE: Then make your question clearer. I described a hybrid correctly. If you misused the word that is not my fault.", 154, "kz04oBhsaa", 0],

In a room completely black, its not likely they could see, just as animals today cannot see in a completely dark room.  Even nocturnal animals (cats, owls, etc.) need some ambient light to see, even though to us its pitch dark. There is no evidence T-Rex could see infrared.", 158, "cyIPEOLYaa", 1],
	926 : ["Hunting animals for sport is cruel. Destroying and fragmenting habitat through habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, etc. is cruel. Good zoos, and I must emphasise the good because they are not all good, keep animals for three primary purposes. One is to play a role in their conservation because without zoos populations some species would now be extinct. Secondly, to learn about the animals so as to better understand their biology and that informs conservation efforts. Thirdly, to educate zoo visitors about animals and their plight and hopefully to changes mindestes and behaviours. Good zoos (and remember it is good ones) breed animals in captivity from tjose already in captivity. Things have moved on light years from Victorian times when animals were caught in the wild, brought into zoos which did not know how to care for them, and which did not care if they died because they could very easily be replaced by more wild caught ones. Modern breeding programmes are coordinated to maintain genetic diversity and prevent animals too closely related from breeding. Occasionally it may be necessary to catch a wild animal and bring it in to the zoo population. This is done if a need to increase the genetic diversity of the zoo population is necessary. Otherwise most animals in zoos were born/hatched in zoos and know no different. Zoos are also often involved in field projects to protect habitats, restore habitats, re-introduce animals and to educate the local population to live alongside animals without over-exploting them. Many communities have discovered it is far more profitable to have wild animal populations than to kill them through over hunting or because of competition or to drive them away because of competition, the humans want more land for agriculture or the built environment, or to prevent danger to their domestic animal stock.", 159, "kz04oBhsaa", 1],
	927 : ["In some instances, zoos are the only reason that certain animals are alive. The California condor and the whooping crane come to mind. Animals in zoos eat regularly. Those in the wild do not. Zoos have veterinarians; wild animals do not. Zoos have breeding programs to prevent inbreeding; wild animals take what they can get. (Sort of like college students) Is it any wonder that the longevity of animals in captivity exceeds that of wild ones? That said, there are roadside zoos that have, at best, only one benefit that they share with the major zoos, that of education and sparking interest. I grew up a long walk or (mostly) a short bus-ride from a major zoo and it might have had something to do with my becoming a zoologist.", 159, "DVdX6I4kaa", 0],

	930 : ["People assume that a bat is a mammal because bats are mammals.", 144, "DNN5BnHhaa", 1],
	931 : ["It is not an assumption but a scientific classification based on lots of evidence. \"Looks\" can be deceiving and so scientists do not rely on looks alone. They rely instead on unique anatomical traits that are shared. For example, bats share many traits with other mammals such as hair, a mammalian jaw joint and mammalian middle ear, mammary glands, live birth and mammalian hip joint, and these traits are absent from birds and other animals. In order for a bat not to be considered a mammal, one must explain why these mammalian traits are found in bats, or how bats evolved all these traits on their own independently of mammals. It is certainly possible that a non-mammal can have many mammalian traits, but the question is how likely would that happen. The answer is extremely unlikely. For example, all birds lay eggs. Therefore if the bat is a bird, then why does it not lay eggs but instead give birth to their young like other mammals. Why do bats have 5 fingers but birds have only 3? Why do birds have feathers but bats do not? The answers to these questions help us figure out that bats are not birds, even if they fly just like birds. Their wings are very different also. Bat wings are made of a solid membrane of skin but bird wings are mad of many flight feathers that are not solid structures but linked together will hooklets. These differences between birds and bats, and the similarities between bats and other mammals lead to the conclusion that bats are indeed mammals, and not bats. ", 144, "None", 2],
