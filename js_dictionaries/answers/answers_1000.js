	55504 : ["The anthropic principle can be used to explain why intelligent life is rare. However, given that life on Earth immediately emerged after the late heavy bombardment period, it's statistically probable that intelligent life is common. If anyone disputes the vast data that intelligence is an evolutionary arms race, then they're akin to a creationist. There is more evidence suggesting that intelligence is an evolutionary arms race, than there was evidence to support the theory of evolution in 1920, when the Scopes trial mandated that evolution be taught in public schools. The most plausible solution to the Fermi paradox is that the risk of humans killing them is too great. Abraham Lincoln, JFK, MLK, Malcolm X, and John Lennon are a few examples of why it would be too risky for aliens to overtly contact humans. While most humans would be in awe of aliens, it only takes one assassin to deter first contact. Aliens can't be certain that humans won't use laser weapons to kill them even if they're in orbit around Earth. 10 billion years ago there was 10x more star formation than today. Therefore, the probability of intelligent life emerging was 10x higher 5 billion years ago than it's today. Plenty of time to colonize entire galaxies. There's a correlation with aggression and a high rate of reproduction. It seems aliens prefer quality over quantity. They seem to not be interested in spreading their own species everywhere in the galaxy. Proficiency in genetic engineering would tend to have this effect. The understanding that life is suited for a particular environment would have this effect. Intelligent life cannot desire to make copies of itself in every star system, because the environment will not permit it. However, it would be possible for life forms that are genetically engineered to be suitable for a particular world. Why this hasn't happened on Earth, before humans existed, causes somewhat of an existential crisis. Intelligent design would create intelligent life much faster than evolution can. It would be suicidal to have any belief system other than the belief that the sooner intelligent life exists the better. The Fermi is paradox is broad. A more troubling paradox is that humans exist in the first place. Intelligent life should have colonized Earth, Mars, and Ceres 3.8 billion years ago, at the end of the late bombardment period. Even Venus can harbor high-altitude life that lives in balloons. Mercury has water ice in equatorial craters. With large enough solar panels, life on Jovian moons would be viable. Therefore, we live in a computer simulation. There's no other logical explanation why humans exist. If so much as one intelligent species emerged in the Milky Way 4-6 billion years ago, they would have created intelligent life all over the galaxy, including the solar system. Humans can colonize the entire galaxy in well under 4 billion years using existing propulsion methods. The James Webb telescope will make people arguing for the rarity of intelligent life look foolish. Though there's already sufficient evidence to assume intelligent life has a high statistical probability of occurring several times in each galaxy. Therefore, the simulation theory is only the plausible explanation. If it took 1-2 billion years for life to emerge after the late heavy bombardment period on Earth, then it would be worth considering that life is rare. The immediate emergence of life right after the late heavy bombardment period suggests life is inevitable. Over billions of years, the length of the genetic code progressively became longer. The genetic code stopped becoming longer with warm blooded animals. The switch from cold to warm blood required thousands of different mutations and it accelerated the intelligence arms race more than any other event. Paraves first emerged 200 million years ago. Over tens of millions of years, it shrunk at a rate 160 times faster than other dinosaurs increased in size. Evolving to be warm blooded and more intelligent occurred simultaneously. Warm blood allowed brains to prevail over brawn. Social insects, though not warm blooded, were also forced to become more intelligent either directly or indirectly by Paraves. Ants and termites are remarkable for building structures which for their size, are comparable to the greatest structures ever built by humans. Ants can also kill elephants if their movement is restricted. Humans killing whales isn't as impressive a feat as ants killing elephants. It wasn't till 1846 that humans reached peak sperm whale oil. It wasn't till then that humans could be said to have surpassed ants. Especially since consequently, geology supplanted biology as a source of fuel. Nevertheless, ants weigh more than all other animals combined. There's strength in numbers. A smaller size is more effective with increased intelligence. Increased competition from Paraves forced small animals to become more intelligent. To answer your question, it's inevitable that humans will meet aliens. 100% chance. The story of Earth is a story of ever increasing intelligence. That story will extend beyond Earth. Simulation theory or not, the rapid emergence and improvement of life is undeniable. Lastly, it's unlikely humans will go extinct. That's a cold war era mentality. Even nuclear war wouldn't cause humanity to go extinct. South Africa and New Zealand would survive. Laser weapons might lead to increased mass murder, but it poses no threat whatsoever to the perpetuation of the human species. Nor does a.i pose a threat, as it will always be much less energy efficient than human beings. There's a small risk antimatter poses an existential risk. Though right now, there isn't enough anti-matter to worry. Antimatter will also make it more viable to colonize other star systems, making concerns of extinction moot.", 7730, "E6IgnT59aa", 0],

But the reason we can live on earth is that we have a 20% oxygen atmosphere.  And that oxygen comes from a period, long before even animals existed, when the earth was covered with thick vegetation.  For a few hundred millions years these plants lived and died and piled up, in a CO2-rich atmosphere that we couldn't have lived in!  They converted much of the CO2 into oxygen, which made possible the development of animal life. So if we found a 'goldielocks planet'--i.e. just the right distance from a star, not too cold or too hot, just the right amount of atmosphere, water, etc.--what is the chance it would have had thick vegetation for millions of  years to produce the oxygen we would need to live?  I'm thinking probably not much.", 7727, "55XWsWHsaa", 3],
