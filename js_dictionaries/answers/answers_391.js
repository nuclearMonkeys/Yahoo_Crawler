	21277 : ["Giving speakers more power at lower frequencies, than they can handle, will blow them out. Deep bass pushes speakers to their longest excursion. It isn't just watts, but frequency, that plays into wear and tear.", 3453, "EMC7JwVBaa", 0],
	21278 : ["Take it to an Autozone store. They have the equipment to run it up and test the output. The test is free.", 3454, "fWi3ksG7aa", -3],
	21279 : ["You will have to place an amp gauge in between a battery post and it's cable to find out. NOT a multimeter. And if the battery is fully charged, it will show minimum amperage output. Turn on all lights and accessories get a higher amperage output. The best way to see if your charging system is operating right is to simply use your multimeter across the battery while the engine is running and it should read 13 volts or up. Turn on the AC and all lights on and it should show around the same.", 3454, "b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa", -5],
	21280 : ["A drone is a pilotless aircraft according to the FAA. Which includes fixed wing and rotating wing aircraft that is unmanned and controlled either remotely or by programing. I am pretty sure the FAA regulations apply for lighter then aircraft that is remote controlled. In the RC industry the difference is different. There are RC helicopters, RC airplanes, RC dirigibles, RC non-dirigibles and drones. With drones having three or more rotating horizontal wings. The FAA bans any drone which is not flown by line of sight by a hobbyist. They are to be in sight at all times. It does not matter what the hobby industry calls it! To fly a remote aircraft with other then line of sight control demands special licensing for the pilot and the aircraft.", 3455, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 2],
	21281 : ["For the purposes of this question, a drone uses a computer to interpret the control inputs from the remote pilot but does not allow direct control. So even a cheap quadcopter with no ability to follow a pre-programmed flight pattern and appears to move in three dimensions according to the pilot inputs is still constantly self-adjusting the exact power level to each rotor and typically has one or more accelerometers to allow the drone to remain both flyable and stable.  An RC aeroplane or helicopter is directly controlled by the pilot. Moving the controls on the remote control *directly* acts on the appropriate servo motors and they *directly* operate things like control surfaces, throttles, and on helicopter directly controls the swash plate and collective controls.  Many RC helicopters do have a gyroscopic controller for the tail rotor. That means the tail  stays pointed where the pilot intends with the gyro making constant tiny automatic adjustments to the the pitch of the tail rotor. But it only affects that one control and just makes the heli easier and more forgiving to fly. But it's still a long way from turning a regular helicopter model into a drone. Military drones are simply any pilotless aircraft, regardless of whether they are directly remote controlled or use computers and accelerometers to interpret remote pilot inputs.", 3455, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],
	21282 : ["Yes.   You can set it to optimize the descent to get maximum glide when your hands are off the yoke.   The factors that would require you to change it is weight of pilot,  amount of ballast (water) you might be carrying,   rain, dirt or other factors that reduce the \"smoothness\"  of the surfaces,  etc.  ", 3456, "54wo5oZhaa", 0],
	21283 : ["At least elevator trim, any change in speed requires a change in pitch trim. Flying for hours without the ability to trim would be tiring.", 3456, "AA11195233", 2],
	21284 : ["all gliders have control for yaw, pitch and roll.  Otherwise, it would go anywhere it wanted.", 3456, "AA11424005", -3],
	21285 : ["Some do, some don't (such as hang gliders and some basic trainers). If you wanted a specific answer then you needed to specify a particular make and model.", 3456, "gjUpsUZAaa", -1],
	21286 : ["It was NOT without a trace. Some floating debris were recovered months later and positively identified from their serial number to be from MH370. Since one of those is a nearly complete outboard flap, then there is no doubt the plane was wrecked. My theory is that you have no idea what you are talking about.", 3457, "None", 6],

	21293 : ["Electronics................", 3448, "9Bgq39vlaa", -6],
	21294 : ["Cell phones used to have extendable \"whip\" antennas too. What changed is: antenna technology. Huge, important advances in such technology (primarily: in the GEOMETRY of antennas) have allowed miniaturization, so that the antenna can be installed entirely INSIDE the cell phone or car \"nub\". Interestingly, for some reason most of the technological advances do not seem to have been useful in TV antennas. In fact, with the advent of HDTV I need an even huger antenna and a pre-amp to get the TV stations I used to be able to get without such things.", 3448, "g9g3fOYyaa", 10],
	21295 : ["Mostly comes down to a matter of personal technique, style, and availability. Both have specific advantages, and both are used. Manual has a clear advantage for descent control, auto has an advantage in deep mud... clutches hate mud.", 3465, "tSnHgRn0aa", 1],
	21296 : ["Better low speed power control. Try it.", 3465, "EMC7JwVBaa", -1],
	21297 : ["You shouldn't ask questions like this. Yahoo answers is full of poorly educated, unintelligent morons who have never driven a manual transmission, and dont understand why they are better than automatics in many areas. I dont know about off-roading but I would rather have a manual because they are more durable, and I can choose what gear to be in. An automatic might upshift or downshift at the wrong time, causing you to lose traction or get stuck. I imagine that if I was off roading I could just leave it in 1st or 2nd the entire time and not have to worry about a computer up-shifting into 3rd or downshifting into 1st when i dont want it to.  The flip side is, there are surely certain situations where an auto would be better. Like in rock crawling or whatever, it would be easier to gently and slowly get moving from a stop. With a manual that's impossible because once you let the clutch out you have to get to a certain minimum speed (like 2-3 miles per hour) otherwise the vehicle will stall. ", 3465, "None", -2],

	21300 : ["A person doesn't need to be from the Middle East to have desires to hijack a plane. Ex: the Columbine shooters were American and they wrote down thoughts of hijacking planes from Denver International Airport and crashing them into NYC skyscrapers (and this was BEFORE 9/11). Also, airport security doesn't just protect planes from being hijacked. It also protects planes from being blown up, people from smuggling illegal stuff (ex: drugs) to other locations, etc.", 3459, "826q1Fbjaa", 0],
	21301 : ["Police stop you at checkpoint to check if you're chipped (aka vaccinated) Police check the car; let's say 4 people car but signal only from 3; so, police stop it to chip the notyetchipped; signal from 4 now and police let the car go.

Police do it on highways or when you leave your city... basically, you can't leave your city unless you're vaccinated; but vaccine = mark of the beast; so, escape now while your city doesn't have these rules; forgive me. Gov't sprays chemtrails so that people feel symptoms of flu 5G will kill vaccinated; just read Georgia Guidestones' commandment of 500 million max population on earth; it fits with Orthodox Christian prophecy of 7 percent of people left Russian Orthodox prophecy also says that there will be unbearable stench in winter. So, there you go. Russian winters are cold.

The rest of the people will be secretly (or even openly) chipped when they sign up for food in closed stores AI (artificial intelligence aka demons) will post on your social media as if it were you doing it while you're on vacation; it will even make phone calls on behalf of you; no one will notice that you're missing in action.", 3466, "None", 0],
