If the hedge clippings are woody then you should put them through a shredder first.  Again - grass cuttings are ok in small quantities, but not a whole lot of them.  Never put meat or cooked veg in.  Also, I dont recommend putting melon seeds in - they turn into a slimy mess.  I dont put on orange or lemon peel either.  They dont break down very well.  If you are putting in egg shells, crush them up first.  The smaller the pieces of stuff you put in, the quicker it will break down.  Tea leaves and coffee grounds are good to.  And from time to time - especially if your compost is too dry, take a leak in it.  Apparently it helps with the composting process !!!", 11199, "None", 6],

Hedge and grass clippings are good, In addition I would recommend using vegetable remains from your kitchen, they are excellent nutritional sources for your compost.  Paper products, such as shredded newspapers can also be used to balance things out.  Balance is key, there should be a balanced mixture of green and brown components.

	134006 : ["Well, I can say that I am for the advancement of the technology of nuclear power - technology that would make nuclear power safe, efficient, and allow waste to be reused, not just thrown away. Future technology allows this. Arguments saying that nuclear power is dangerous and waste disposal is costly can be countered with the idea that new technology will make nuclear power less so. Not only that, but nuclear power plants produce no carbon dioxide, therefore clean in that respect, and creates the most energy per mass amount of fuel. Look up Generation IV nuclear power plants. We currently are at Generation III, which are just advanced versions of Generation II power plants. Fukushima Daichi, commissioned in the 70's, is one example of a Generation II power plant. Generation I are just prototypes. What I would be against is building more nuclear power plants using old technology. Also imagine a nuclear power plant that can convert nuclear reactions directly into electrical energy, unlike the steam turbine conversions we have today. Steam turbines rely on heat, and is very inefficient (efficiency rate of 35-40%). Also, fusion power is also something interesting to look into. They create much more energy than fission reactions. The nuclear material used in fusion reactions, such as tritium, are lighter and have a much shorter half-life than uranium (like 12 years vs 250,000 years). Unfortunately, essentially all, or almost all, of the nuclear power plants in the world use fission instead of fusion.", 11200, "YFUiszvMaa", 0],
