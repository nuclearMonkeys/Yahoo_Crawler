Once they start to grow, wait until they are 1-2 feet tall.  Then select the strongest plant to plant out in your garden or in a larger pot. Remember that wisterias grow huge and they need a very strong support to grow on.  You can keep them under control if you prune every year.  They will stay smaller if put in a pot and you can even grow them as a standard tree if you wish.  A rose pole is ideal for them to grow up.

	92529 : ["Just to add ref. the careful pruning of Wisteria - Prune once or twice a year, the later summer pruning being the most important. Pinch back those long new shoots to about a 1/3 of their length, or around 12'' long, then the same with the side shoots that come from these.  This slows the sap and induces more flowering, as it does with many flowering plants.  It also helps to thicken the shortened stems,  which is part of the way it encourages flowers to form for the next year.  Plus it lets the sun ripen the shoots so that they get more woody. Major pruning may be necessary with old died-out thicker woody parts too, or where protruding into areas where not desired. Do this from late autumn to around February.   And get a sunny position for its growth, as the more shaded parts will probably flower less.  You can train Wisterias to grow into gaps caused due to pruning or poorer growth spots. Good luck!
