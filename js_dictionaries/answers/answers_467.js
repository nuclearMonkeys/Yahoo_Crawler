They know you so well and learn how to enjoy life more by relaxing taking in the sunsets before they come in for the evening. Don't  think for one minute they can't protect you if needed. My old Mastiff would have given his life for us until the end. Thank God he never got any cancers, etc.  he just died of old age and lived twice his life span. He just stopped eating the last few days and passed naturally.  I had a border collie that was so smart also that lived to 16, she was almost blind and had started staying in at night the last year before she had a mild stroke   Eve but knew the family came for   so she spent time with the family. Everyone loved on her and she was happy. After everyone left , she was so happy but we found her the next morning, she had passed. She wanted to tell everyone good bye. They all gave her even more attention; we all cried knowing she didn't have much longer. She passed knowing she was loved by many. She lived exactly like she choose. She took care of the cows, horses chickens, swans and even the camels. She liked staying out to keep an eye on things,  if she needed enforcement she would start barking which set off my Maltese barking to let Tank our Mastiff know. The smartest dog we have ever had! It might sound crazy to some but; I have mourned my dogs just as much as humans in my family. We have a couple Aussies now, very protective as well as Maltese. They don't have to bark but once and our Maltese let's us know they want out. I am looking for another mastiff as well. Our male Aussie likes to stay out at night to keep an eye on things when decent weather. Angel trained him. We have bobcats and other wild animals who visit sometimes. Tank took on a bobcat and didn't get a scratch. He was trying to eat our chickens. We had an aggressive male swan that would attack. My husband would go into the pasture to feed the animals and Tsnk was always with him. One day the swan tried to attack my husband from behind but before he could Tank caught him and was carrying him off about to eat lunch. My husband saved the swan and he never tried to attack him again and would never come out of the water when Tank was around. ", 4088, "iihlG9iUaa", 0],

	25891 : [" • \"My dog stares at me a lot when I'm eating. How to train him not to do that?\" Why bother? You don't HAVE to look at him to see whether he is watching you. But when you DO look at him, he should be praised if he is behaving, or commanded if he is misbehaving (followed by being praised when he obeys that command - which will presumably be a \"Rastus - DOWN!\" or a \"Rastus - PLACE!\" if his call-name is Rastus). 💥Q1: What AGE and BREED (or breed-mix) is your dog? And how LONG have you had him? 💥Q2: How MANY weekly sessions at a reputable training club or group have YOU spent getting COACHED with him? • \"He is not supposed to eat table food like pizza or sandwhich.\" 💥Q3: Maybe - but does HE know that? (MOST dogs will eat ANYTHING that is tossed to them.) • \"And I know he is always fed on time.\" 💥Q4: And at WHICH time or times are that/those feeds? What food is in each meal? • \"How to train him not to watch me continuously when eating.\"❓ That was your original question. But THIS time you didn't put the question-mark. So I did. 💥Q5: What HAVE you trained him to do on-command? Proper trainers provide enthusiastic PRAISE and a REWARD (usually a pat on the ribs, or a rub on the croup or between the front legs - but in some clubs/groups a pea-sized taste-treat is the reward). • \"Sometimes he will even produce a bark while watching.\" THAT is BAD - it shows that he thinks that HE is the commander. Over the decades I've had 51 pooches: 2 \"Fockers\" (Fox Terrier x Cocker Spaniels) + 48 German Shepherd Dogs + 1 Cairn Terrier (she was my wife's), and spent a few years as class instructor for a city dog-training club before we moved back into a farming district. My dogs quickly KNEW that, once they left the car-shed used while they were too young to be away from their dam, they got their meals while IN their pen, or while on the top terrace (of the 3 terraces above & behind the house), or in individual corners of the kitchen. I used to take a GSD with me when I went shopping; and quite often I would buy a packet of fish'n'chips on my way home. The GSD on the front seat KNEW that it wasn't allowed to sniff that pack that was lying between it & me. When I got inside the house with my fish'n'chips & groceries, as soon as I packed the groceries away the dogs that were in the house that evening would eagerly precede me to the den and choose a corner each to lie down in, then watch me, each willing me to:   \"See what a GOOD girl I'm being? Gizza chip, please, Dad!\" GSDs are one of the 3 most intelligent dog breeds - which means that either you demonstrate ROUTINES that they can understand and predict the result of, or THEY will out-smart you. Even with 3 GSDs in a 16 by 10 feet room that contains bookshelves, a parliamentary desk, a printing machine, plus me on my chair, none of those 3 GSDs would attempt to steal the chip I had aimed at one of the other 2 - UNLESS the intended recipient clumsily bumped the flying chip away, of course. But that was a VERY rare occurence!

	25892 : ["It sounds more like he wants to play with the other dogs. Look up: Dogs playing rough, or Dogs play fighting. Dogs often bark at other dogs to elicit play. They will also growl a little, jump around, possibly \"bow\", and just act silly. It is highly unusual for a GR to be aggressive. Look at these videos: In play fighting, a dog will often: growl, bite at each other and especially on the shoulders, jump around, roll over, jump on the other dog, run under the other dog, knock each other over, snap their teeth, and more. This is common behavior in dogs while playing. Learn what this looks like so you don't say your dog is aggressive, when he is not. But, do be sure to properly socialize your dog by taking him places where dogs are allowed such as walking on the sidewalk; going to dog parks when you understand dog behavior; going to pet supply stores; taking him to dog obedience training; taking him to other stores such as home supply stores like Home Depot or Lowes (they allow dogs inside these stores). Teach your dog proper behavior such as how to sit on command and expect your dog to sit when a person or other dog passes. Do not allow your dog to just walk up to another dog you do not know because this can lead to problematic behavior. Always keep your dog in control. If your dog is truly barking and growling in aggression or fear, then teach him to sit when peopls or other dogs are near. Teach the sit command and use it often. Praise for sit, give a treat. This is a good way to develop desired behaviors and good control with your dog. Practice it each day while in or out of the house. Practice it while he sits in front of you on the couch, and basically anytime. Also: Dogs live for praise. Use praise often to encourage wanted behavior.", 4082, "p7ZdohGTaa", 0],

	25897 : [" • \"How often to Chihuahuas live to 20 years old?\" Almost never.    lists just ONE Chihuahua, among the 20 dogs that made it to at least 20 years old. • \"My Chihuahua is 14 years old now and only just now showing signs of slowing down in the last year or so. It scares me though because we love her so much. So my question is how often do Chihuahuas reach the 20 year mark or close to it? 12 - 20 year life span is such a large range. \" I can't help you there - my only connection with Chihuahuas was when one of my GSD bìtches acted as the guard for a Chihuahua breeder's kennel. But always remember that thesmall ones are TOO tiny for good health, and their bones are so small that they have very little strength. I would guess that the smaller your Chihuahua is, the lower its chances of reaching 20. If your pet is registered with your nation's ONE kennel club (only the AKC, if you're a Yank) and you know the registered name of its sire and its dam, you could search for their owner's (your kennel club might help you) e-addresses or phone numbers, and asked how long their Chi lasted. Each MIGHT help you find the owners of THEIR stud's or brood's parents and tell you how to contact them. But never forget that each pooch is an INDIVIDUAL, each one exposed to different stresses and injuries, and so \"averages\" are a very unreliable guide.

	25924 : ["You dont say if this behaviour is when he is on or off the lead. Dogs on a lead that show aggression to other dogs are acting from fear and uncertainty as they are  restricted from showing natural body language to other dogs and so they panic and try to warn the other dog to stay away from them.  Its called Leash Aggression and is very common behaviour.  Also if YOU tense up when holding the leash, it will convey to the dog that there is something to be worried about. More info:  If he showing aggression when OFF the lead, it could still be from fear , but can in some cases be caused by the dog having such a dominant nature it wants to wade in and fight with other dogs to prove itself as higher in status, although a REAL high status dog can show its dominance by the way it stands and its body language including a direct and forceful eye contact, and usually has no need to show physical aggression, as other dogs understand its status and do not provoke them..  So...without actually SEEING how  your dog reacts around other dogs and observing its body language, I can only give a basic answer to your question. Also it would help to know if you have had the dog since 8 weeks old and how much socialising you did with it during the period from 8-16 weeks old. Unsocialised pups tend to show a lot more fear related  problems than one that is well socialised and also a confident natured pup will always be a lot bolder and take things in its stride than a more nervous / anxious natured pup.  I suggest you seek the opinion of a hand on good experienced dog trainer/ behaviourist who will be able to help a lot more.  To Add: Your dog is now an adolescent and not yet fully mature and may be trying to see if he can intimidate other dogs by exhibiting aggressive behaviour, but as I said, it`s only possible to guess at things without a lot more information about your dog and also what training you have done with him and what his basic temperament is like. Its not easy to just diagnose a problem like this over the internet.  You say he is gentle and calm usually, but that does not mean he will act the same when other dogs are around, and possibly seen as a threat to him.", 4082, "gGQssXS1aa", 1],
