	62737 : ["While I do agree with The Dragon's answer, I will say something else I would change, particularly with the WWE: I would make Womens Wrestling, well....Womens Wrestling. I'm sick of the low-class modeling rejects that WWE has been hiring, and I'd personally be fine with seeing females that are actually trained and skilled enough to be in a Professional Wrestling ring to begin with. I'm sick of \"ring rats of the future\" being hired and then thrown into ring attire as if we're supposed to accept them as anything exceptionally talented or skilled in anything they so. This trend should've died a long time ago. People can get interested in Womens Wrestling if WWE actually put emphasis on the division and made it about being the best wrestler amongst the women rather than the most photogenic. There is a fanbase for Womens Wrestling, and TNA has proven that. Why can't WWE follow that idea and make it worth watching rather than treat it as either masturbation material or an obvious bathroom break?", 8175, "None", 4],

Give the Diva's their own 1-hour Wednesday night show so that they can really furthur themselves. 3. Dump the gimmick PPV's. Just Have 6 PPV's: Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, Backlash, Night of Champions, Summer Slam, and Survivor Series. 4. Put Orton and Cena in mid-card feuds and give others a shot at the WWE title. 5.

Many really really nice houses by the lake and rivers are very expensive, so you might want to live outside of Seattle, in places like Bellvue, Issaquah, or Redmond (Home of Microsoft). There are many nice and affordable houses, and it's a quick drive to Seattle. There are also many things to do in Bellvue, Issaquah, and Redmond, such as malls, resterants, parks etc. You may find it a lot like Austin.", 8179, "None", -2],
	62742 : ["I made the opposite move about 4 years ago, and yeah, the cities are pretty similar - they're both liberal tech cities with a good, lively scene (both cities attract the same kind of person).  Seattle is about 3x as large as Austin (but they both have the same level of traffic, Seattle just has a much superior public transportation system).  The weather is a lot different, personally I prefer Austin, but then again I prefer heat in general.  The summers in Seattle are great, but the rest of the year is pretty overcast, drizzly, and forgettable.  The mountains, sound, and national & state parks there are incredibly gorgeous, so if you are into the outdoors, that alone can make it a great place to live.  The other downside of Seattle is the cost of living is higher, and buying a house might be out of your range (it was out of mine, until I moved to Austin). Even if you don't end up staying there forever, it would be a really nice city to live in for any period of time.", 8179, "G59cfwwIaa", 1],

As far as the question about what is \"un-Christian\" - there are far too many ways Christians interpret Christianity and what is the \"right\" way to think.
