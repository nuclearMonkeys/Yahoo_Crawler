	96836 : ["I understand some people are attracted to people who are different from them, and think it's OK as long as they are mature enough to understand they WILL have numerous differences...and respect them. I have always admired women who leave their family, friends, job and country to marry a man from another country or culture. I think they really must be in love in order to do such a sacrifice! (Unfortunately, not all of them end up being as happy as they thought they would be.) Love is blind...and sometimes naive. People who expect to live happily ever after in relationships where important issues - like religious beliefs, upbringing and education, values and child rearing- are too different tend to not last. Many times the inlaws and the country itself may be too much of a change for them to adjust, and they end up really stressed out. Personally, I go by what my grandma used to say...\"Each sheep with its equal.\" I consider myself a strong, educated and independant woman...so I would never consider marrying a man who thought I was inferior or less of a human being just because I was born a woman.", 9601, "None", 0],

Being tolerant of others' religion is one thing, but letting them fill the heads of your children with that nonsense is another matter, and they feel the same way from their perspective. For example, I'm very not religious, while my wife believes in God, but doesn't go to church or pray or otherwise 'practice religion'.  At some point, our son and daughter are going to ask about God.  Even as I'm typing this out, I'm realizing that the answer will be that mom believes and dad doesn't, and it's up to them to find out for themselves.", 9601, "AuKKjaxaaa", 0],
	96838 : ["well i bet i have more rabbit experience than anyone who has replied. I have had rabitts all my life. I show them and breed them. i have has over 100 rabbits at a time.  Rabbits do make good pets if you know how to take care of them. First of all you should get a wire cage that has a tray under it to catch stool and pee. Or if you get a big enough cage you can train your rabbit to use a litter box. Make sure you have a place to put a blanket of something the rabbit can sit on so its not on wire all the time. It can get sore hocks. Make sure it has water 24/7 . You should only feed it rabbit pellets and nothing else. That means no veggies. This is because domesticated rabbits will get diarreah. Since your rabbit will be inside clean its cage out at least every 3 days. What smells is its pee not stool. O the stool makes great fertalizer.   Rabbits can also be very cuddley if you handle them often. They can also be ok around dogs. I have 3 myself and they really dont mind each other. Hope this answers some questions.", 9598, "nETbDWdBaa", 0],
	96839 : ["OK, I also have a rabbit. Rabbits are a really good pet, but they take a lot of responsibility. You will need to clean out there cage at least three times a week. You will need to use a water absorbent bedding.  I like critter care brand.   If you don't clean there cage, you will get a really disgusting smell. Rabbits like to have a little space to feel confined when they sleep. Once you get a cage, cut a square hole and wire in a  basket were the hole is. (make sure you use a plastic box, or they'll chew right threw it) You should put the cage somewhere where the dogs could never get into, only if your dogs are breed for hunting, or if there really big (Such as beagles, hounds, etc.) My rabbit acts as a dog when we let him out. Be aware that they poo about every two minutes (just little pellets, not like dog poo) Chinchillas die very easily, and require a lot of special care. Rabbits live for 10-15 years and we have had our rabbit for about 7. I would definitely recommend a rabbit!", 9598, "None", 0],
	96840 : ["I have bunnies and they are great pets.  I agree that three dogs, especially if they bark alot and one that is all over the place is not a good enviornment as rabbits are very sensitive to loud noises and frighten easily and cannot be left alone with other pets.  Their primary diet is supposed to be Timothy Hay and a limited amount of pellets and very limited amounts of select \"greens\" and fruit.  Please go to the House Rabbit Society website and read the information on what they eat, etc.  Each rabbit has their own personality and some are cuddly but you should know that most of them do not like to be picked up.", 9598, "fcfbovy9aa", 0],

Despite all the international traveling we did, it was STILL cheaper than what we would have gotten if we got a eurail pass. Plus, since you are only doing two countries, there is really no point in getting the eurail pass, especially since Greece does not really have a lot of places where you could use the eurail pass. Train travel in Italy is fairly cheap, and you can get student discounts if you get an ISIC card. The ferries between Italy and Greece are reasonable, and ferries within Greece are fairly reasonable too. Usually you can buy the train tickets the same day you want to leave, except I would suggest buying the ferry tickets in Greece at least a day or two in advance because it can fill up during heavy holiday traffic.

All you have to do is check if they have food and water every morning and clean their cage when it gets dirty.
