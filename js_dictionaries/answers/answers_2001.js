	105842 : ["I recommend you to use Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner.  Also when showering start out with hot water.  Hot water opens up your hair follicle, and also your pores on your skin, Then apply your shampoo and rinse with that hot or warm water you like, then when you apply your conditioner, your water temperature should be luke warm, almost cool.  What cool water does is that after you have washed out all the dirt and shampoo out of your hair, the conditioner needs to be locked in your hair follicle, so that it can give it nice feeling to it, and helps the hair follicle to close and keep in the moisture.  The Tea Tree Shampoo helps a whole lot with Dandruff.  As long as you don't use hot hot water.  Usually these products can be found in Beauty Salons, or if you got a friend with a license they can probably find this stuff for you.  Maybe Sallys carries something similiar.  Probably anything that has Tea Tree in it can help a whole lot.  The smell to it is minty fresh.  And it leaves your scalp tingling fresh.  My husband when I first met him he had this horrible problem.  I studied cosmetology and learned that this happens to people with real oily skin, or really dry skin.  Hope this works out for you!

	105843 : ["No. Lying is when you are asked for the truth and you do not give it. Withholding the truth is simply not telling the whole story.

I met some who looked like their picture and some who used 10 year old pictures, none of which were good.  Early on I started meeting who I met face to face within 1-2 weeks to see if there was a face to face connection.  She did it because she felt more men would say hello with her friends picture there, then after meeting and knowing her she thought the wrong picture would not matter.  I know there are good honest people online, I was one and my new husband was another... so keep looking and good things will happen.", 9942, "wI3AAkIoaa", 1],
	105848 : ["Well that's always a danger when dealing with online or phone related relationships as opposed to face-to-face ones. First of all, you don't know what they actually look like and they could be hiding information like their gender or age if you don't actually hear their voice. Second of all, their are many facial cues you can pick up on to see if someone is lying or stressing. It's more difficult to pick these cues up in verbal conversation alone and even more difficult in text based conversation. Really, let her know what you found out. Ask her to clarify and assure her you are not a shallow guy, but you need to be able to trust her. If she sends you another picture, make sure you make it specific or a live chat so you can be certain it's her (i.e., tell her to touch her nose with her ring finger and take a picture) That way you can be more certain she isn't lying to you. After a setback in trust like this, just take your time. She might have just been insecure and not meant it to mislead you. Take your time getting to know her and make sure you know her well. If she tries to rush you, back off and don't get to close so that you know it's for real. And try not to get too attached in the off chance that she was just toying with you. It happens, even to the best of us when we are the most sure. BE CAREFUL. In a Nutshell: - Make 100% CERTAIN she's who she says she is - Take things slow - Be honest and show empathy, but be smart and CAREFUL about what you do with her - Again, make SURE she's not lying to you, I can't stress that enough Hope this helps! Good luck!", 9942, "None", 0],
