Camber and caster are the only angles that will cause a pull.  Your car will probably need an adjustment or shim kit to adjust the camber.  And, don't pay for a four wheel alignment, because there probably aren't any adjustments that can be made to the rear wheels on your car.  They will just print out the sheet that says \"no adjustments\" and charge you for it.", 9945, "8505b18994d56ff12c6e1d97247ad064aa", 0],
	105888 : ["You are never going to know what it is without xrays and an mri.  I hope you are seeing an orthopedist and not your regular doctor.  You need to be referred to an orthopedist.  I have had 13 knee surgeries, so I know a lot about knees.  My best guess without seeing any films of your knee is that you have cartilage damage.  You probably have a defect of the cartilage that covers the underside of your patella (kneecap).  But like I said you need to see and orthopedic doctor who will take pictures of your knee and give you a diagnosis and then you can go from there with a treatment.", 9944, "sx7fqojEaa", 2],
	105889 : ["This may be a case of patellafemoral syndrome, where the articulation between the knee cap and the end of the femur is not congruent.  This is usually more prevalent in women due to our structural differences.  Yet, it can also be caused by weakness in one particular part of the quadriceps as well as tightness of the iliotibial band on the outer part of the leg. Pain usually occurs when the quadricpes are required to be active...going up and down stairs, getting up and down from a chair, etc. It also sounds like you need further evaluation to make sure there is not any structural damage such as a torn meniscus.   If it is either of the above, your next step in care should be physical therapy where more hands on examination can be done in order to attempt to correct the problem and decrease pain.", 9944, "5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa", 1],
