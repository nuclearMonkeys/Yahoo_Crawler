	41090 : ["You're absolutely right that a pre-nup could seriously disadvantage a full-time mother and homemaker. If you're being asked to sign a pre-nup, I strongly suggest that you run the pre-nup by your own lawyer, who's being paid by you, before you even think about signing it. Your boyfriend's lawyer works for your boyfriend only; he isn't required to consider your best interests. The only justifiable reason for your BF to have a pre-nup is to protect significant assets (such as a business) that he owned before marriage. But even with those assets, the pre-nup should consider your contribution to their appreciation during marriage. For example, if you contribute to the upkeep of a house that he owned before marriage, and the house goes up in value, you should be entitled to a share of the increased value, and the pre-nup should reflect that. But if the idea of a pre-nup really, really bothers you, then perhaps this boyfriend isn't Mr. Right after all.", 5987, "qTWBK61Kaa", 0],
	41091 : ["Like others have told you, a prenup covers and assets accrued BEFORE marriage. After marriage all assets gained are shared, so if you did stay home raising kids, you would still get 50% of any assets gained, even if you didn't contribute a penny.Â Â  So, in a way YOU gain. You get to keep all your assets you had before you married. You marry, don't work for years but get to take 50% of the post marriage assets. Win win situation for you. Lol", 5987, "lIO4uiJmaa", 1],

	41094 : ["False! I do not see why 2003 was chosen! The loss of Winston for the series hardly seems worthy of suggesting that year.NASCAR used to be a bunch of moonshine runners strutting their stuff. Then the manufactures got involved and rules had to be written to keep the sport competitive.I would have to suggest 1993 because the cars no longer had any \"factory sheet metal\".Remember NASCAR means National Stock Car Racing! 1993 was the last year the body could be considered stock!Â But it could also be argued that 1966 was the last year NASCAR actually had a stock car on the track. After that the chassis had to be built to fit stock bodies because of uni-body construction and safety issues in a crash.So any way,Â  my nomination is 1993 because there is no way cars on the track after that could be considered \"Stock\"!", 6009, "QpP1xJ4Naa", -1],

	41104 : ["It's a different style of racing. Despite what some may say, Oval racing requires a lot of skill. Driving a car at 200+ mph and doing it safely is really hard to do. Get yourself a game and try it you'll see the difficulty level. As for why? Oval tracks dont require as much space as a conventional race track. They can be built quicker and cheaper. They also are very specator friendly. As a spectator you can see the whole track from one seat. Also Americans tend to be obsessed with power. No better way of showing that in racing than with oval racing. Each to their own on what you prefer, but NASCAR and indycar take some serious skill to do well. Both disciplines (oval and street racing) require a different skill set. Both are equally as valid and entertaining. However if you want the true form of skill when it comes to car control, in my opinion nothing beats rallying", 6013, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],
	41105 : ["Some do. There are different tractors for different purposes. Also has to do with the size of the land a tractor is supposed to cover. Some are VERY comfortable because you may sit there for 5 - 8 hours. Air conditioning, a stereo, air suspended seat. Those have seat belts. Smaller tractors more for one man operations do NOT. The reason I would say is because you are on and off the machine so often, may have a reason to shut it off, jump off and fix something that mucked up the works. Also as YOU observe, the terrain may be rough, uneven ground. You may want to bail off the high side if the tractor rolls over. A Tractor IS a dangerous machine if you are NOT very careful what you are doing. That PTO (power take off that runs the implement being pulled) has grabbed many a Farmer.", 6014, "DarKpQUaaa", 1],
