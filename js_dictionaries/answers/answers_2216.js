You could also use a smoothbore barrel with an improved cylinder choke tube if your shots will be around 50 yds. or less.  The key is to sight it in so you know where you're hitting regardless of what barrel you go with.  It's hard to say that your first time out you won't get a good shot. This past season my friend asked if his 16 year old son could hunt with us. His second day deer hunting he got a 7 point buck at about 40 yds. It all depends on if the deer are bedded down, moving, or if you have enough people to drive them to where you have other hunters on point. A lot depends on luck, plain and simple. If the deer aren't there to be driven towards another hunter, or other hunters aren't in the area to drive them towards you, you just don't have a chance to shoot.  The Maverick 88 will be a fine deer gun. Just pick your barrel, find the slugs that shoot consistently through it, and wait for a deer to come into range.

Tottenham - Even if they don't get 4th spot this year, I seriously doubt they'd fire Redknapp for the job he has done with the club. Could only see Jose taking over if 'Arry went to manage England.

	116621 : ["You are looking for: 1.  A location past the Arctic Circle to the North, or the Antarctic Circle to the South.  Obviously, the Northern Lights only occur north of the Arctic Circle, and you see Southern Lights south of the Antarctic Circle.  It's really the same thing, though. 2.  A location with good, clear weather.  You won't see them on a cloudy day. 3.  A location with little light interference.  Big cities are full of light pollution, and will dull the effect of seeing the Northern Lights. 4.  A location that also has other things to do.  This is directly in contrast with #3, since big cities have more alternative activities.  They don't show up every night, and you get different levels of lights from day to day.  Plan at least a week to guarantee a good sighting, and plan to look outside every week.  Be sure to let waiters and other service staff know that you're in town to see the Northern Lights.  It's actually common enough that they may not mention a mild display or even a brilliant display to their customers, but if you let them know ahead of time (and especially if you hint towards tipping extra for viewing), they'll definitely mention any sightings to you and give you time to stand outside in awe. 5.  A time of year that's appropriate.  The darker the skies, the more time you have to see the light's.  However, the darker the skies, the colder it is!  March and late September are actually the best viewing times for combining dark skies and decent weather for the Northern Lights, but bundle up! I saw them plenty of times as far south as Juneau, AK, when I grew up.  They were rare enough before 10pm (my typical bedtime) that I would still call my friends so that they could run out and see them.  Anchorage and Fairbanks are good locations in Alaska to expect to see them during a short stay, and both are large enough cities to provide other entertainment. For world traveling, try the Scandanavian countries.  Norway is most commonly recommended, with the addendum that you should view them from high in the mountains to avoid the mountains getting in the way.  Sweden is often not recommended due to the lack of civilization in the extreme Northern regions.  Finland is a good alternative. The Southern Lights are more elusive because the continents are farther from the actual poles, so it's harder to get close enough to be sure that you'll get a sighting.  Southern regions in Australia, New Zealand, and South America all get Souther Lights, but it's simply less sure that traveling to the North, and you'll probably get less of a show. Keep in mind:   1.  The closer to the winter solstice and the farther north you go, the better the display and the better the chances of seeing any display at all. 2.  The closer to the winter solstice and the farther north you go, the more uncomfortable you'll be while viewing them outside.", 10474, "None", 52],
