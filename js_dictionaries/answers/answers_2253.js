	118438 : ["Your two batteries are tired out and not able to hold a charge after coming off of a charger. When you measure the battery voltage in isolation it may read 12volts but as soon as any load is put in it the voltage drops to a much lower level. It only needs to drop to 10 volts before it's effectively useless. The \"click\" is just the starter solenoid trying to engage, but it cannot work properly because the voltage is too low. The red light indicates that your alternator/charging system has a fault. It may be a loose drive belt, or a fuse blown due to trying to charge a clapped out battery, or it may be more serious. You should get it checked at a garage with proper test equipment, a small domestic volt meter isn't good enough. When you are running the ignition system doesn't take much current and the car will run with no alternator and a crappy battery. But as soon as you switch on anything else the drain on the battery becomes very noticeable. A weak battery will soon fail when under electrical load, which is what you're experiencing.", 10544, "ovwIaDlFaa", 0],

Beyond that, I would suggest anything else by Clancy, Start with The Patriot, then go to The Hunt for Red October, and so on.  Michael Crichton has a number of thrillers out there that do not deal with the CIA like Clancy's do.  Such titles as Andromeda Strain, Terminal Man, The 13th Warrior, Congo, Timeline, are all really good.  Those should give you a good start.

	118448 : ["One main cause of such problems can be rust , corrosion throughout the charging system , battery , starter , alternator , engine block ground posts, so be sure to have them all cleaned.  Another thing is if you're having starting problems never hold the key in the start position longer then about 10 seconds otherwise you'll not only drain the battery , you'll also over heat and possibly damage the starter.  To me it sounds like you kept trying to start it and drained every battery you tried in the vehicle.The clicking noise can come from two possible things one is the starter solenoid and the other a very weak battery but most of the time it's the solenoid.  I'd try either to clean the contacts I mentioned myself or get a friend or reliable mechanic to clean them bec for sure on any vehicle that age it's bound to have rust and corrosion.  A starter new is quite expensive so I don't recommend buying a brand new one bec it will run you about 200 bucks.A re--built starter runs about 100 or so from a starter re-builder shop or you can do as I do and buy yourself a used one from a auto wreckers for about 30 to 50 bucks, but if you're going to get a mechanic to install it for you I would recommend either a re-built one or simply take your starter off , get it tested and have them re-built it.  Labour costs vary but any good shop should charge you about 45 mins to an hour labour fees and maybe 30-45 mins extra fees for cleaning the posts I mentioned.  I highly recommend though that if you've a friend handy with cars that you start with cleaning these posts and connections throughout the charging system that I mentioned , then be sure the battery is fully charged and try starting it again bec it's quite possible the problem is related to rust and corrosion.Once you've tried starting it and if it don't start try replacing the starter solenoid and while you've the starter off for sure have it tested by a starter re-builder shop.If it's only the solenoid they'll probably charge you about 40 to 50 bucks if they replace it for you.  Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way here in Canada Ontario the labour fees are about 60 to 90 bucks an hour at most mechanical garages.", 10544, "8ifKojOXaa", 0],

Yes, I am a girl, and I hate Tom Clancy's stuff (not big on tactical military stuff) but my sister in law loves him! Books don't come bearing pink or blue covers ;P Okay, so anyway... I like Sci-Fi.  The Dune series....  (what wiki says about them)  The Dune universe, or Duniverse,[1] is the political, scientific, and social fictional setting of author Frank Herbert's six-book series of science fiction novels which began with 1965's Dune. Dune itself is considered by many to be the greatest science fiction novel of all time.  Herbert himself died in 1986. Beginning in 1999, his son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson produced a number of prequel novels, as well as two — Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007) — which complete the original Dune series. These, like the prequels before them, are partially based on Frank Herbert's notes, discovered a decade after his death. I love The ones by KJ Anderson.  I also love: Anne Rice, and laurell K. Hamiliton. All of the books.  happy reading!!!", 10543, "uVLMjLKTaa", 0],

I have no doubt that you will love this book. Definitely a must read! Here's some more info on it (as well as a review by yours truly - Hiddenmastermind): Another one that I'm sure you'll like (mostly if you're a guy) is The Way of Shadows by Brent Weeks. It's the first book in the Night Angel Trilogy about an accomplished assassin. It's an awesome series that you won't regret reading. Here's the summary: For Durzo Blint, assassination is an art-and he is the city's most accomplished artist.  For Azoth, survival is precarious. Something you never take for granted. As a guild rat, he's grown up in the slums, and learned to judge people quickly - and to take risks. Risks like apprenticing himself to Durzo Blint. But to be accepted, Azoth must turn his back on his old life and embrace a new identity and name. As Kylar Stern, he must learn to navigate the assassins' world of dangerous politics and strange magics - and cultivate a flair for death.  Here's more info on it: Or, if you were looking for a fast-paced government operative sort of thriller, then I would suggest \"The Fifth Profession\" by David Morell. Here's the synopsis: Savage, a former Navy SEAL and American state-of-the-art security specialist. Akira, Japan's most brilliant executive protector and a master of the samurai arts. Their mission: the retrieval of Rachel Stone, a beautiful American woman whose ruthless billionaire husband is out to destroy her. But quickly Savage and Akira realize they are trapped in a mission more far-reaching than the protection of one person. For they are bound together in a common nightmare, a set of horrifying memories, a terrifying past that never happened, but is somehow inexplicably real. Only together can they confront the mystery. Yet when they do, an even more chilling scenario awaits them — one with the power to shatter not only their world but ours as well. Here's more info:", 10543, "None", 0],
