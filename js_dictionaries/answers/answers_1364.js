I expect it probably doesn't take her longer than ten minutes to do but i think that is a reasonable rate. I make sure i clean out the rabbits before i go away and i'm not away for longer than 5 days so she has no cleaning of them and the cats are house trained with cat flap so they can come and go as they please.

	73803 : ["You should not have to be pumping a tank twice in 4 years. I lived in one house for nearly 20 years and never had it pumped. Sounds like you could have a problem with your drain field. Are trees and bushes growing up and around it. Could roots be growing into it.  At the end of your main tank dig around and find the pipe that is exiting the tank and feeding the drain field. Go to where you can open it up and see if water flows out of it. If it does your drain field is stopped up and needs to be replaced. If it doesn't snaked back thru the pipe into the tank and see if there is something blocking it.  Hope this helps.", 8749, "s28NO1Y1aa", 0],
	73804 : ["the bubbles just sound like they were coming from air trapped in the pipes and pushed out from water draining in the shower.  That's not uncommon for some home plumbing.  If you can reproduce this by draining your tub and see bubbles coming out of your toilet, that's likely what's happening. as far as your septic tank goes, it sounds like you guys have a small tank that gets heavy use.  Going to a larger tank is one answer, but that's very expensive.  Also, the tank drainout might be clogged by tree roots.  Are there trees growing near and around the tank and its drain line?  (the drain line extends past the tank away from the house and is how the excess waste in the tank is drained into the ground). Cutting away some of the trees near the septic tank will often help...as the roots die, the septic line will clear up, though I never like cutting down trees unless I have to.  You could also try cutting away the roots from the tank, especially if you notice root growth near the septic system. Of course another way to help your septic tank problem is to try and ease up the load on the system.  Use less toilet paper and avoid flushing unneeded things like paper and hygeine products.  These take a very long time to degrade in a closed septic system like this and will just contribute to filling up the tank. Good luck!", 8749, "HYnd4044aa", 0],
	73805 : ["The present problem is not in the septic tank, it is in the drain field which runs from the septic tank.  The only solution now is to have the entire drain field replaced, andthat can get to be expensive.  The problem starts when undigested solids leave the tank and flow into the drain lines, where where it forms a thick, blark, tarry sludge that is waterproof.  This clogs the pipe and the holes in the pipe, and will eventually cause your system to back up into the house. While the backup you have now is not being caused by the septic tank being full (they are normally full, up to the level of the outlet pipe) it was cause originally by inadequate breakdown in solids in the tank,  You can prolong the life of a septic system by regularly adding enzymes, in the form of a liquid that is poured into the toilet or drains on a regular basis.", 8749, "None", 0],
	73806 : ["Nay!  Manufactured Houses on leased land are a depreciating asset and you may not be able to sell it when you need to, as financing is difficult on those type units.  Also it is possible that the landowner will raise your monthly fee during the next 7-10 years.", 8751, "xJURuHtSaa", 0],
	73807 : ["If you plan to be there for a seven year period and is contemplating selling it after then, you might have a problem recouping your down payment, closing cost of your mortgage loan and other cost of the purchase of this property. Normally you would use the services of a real estate agent. Most real estate agents would charge a commission of 6% of the sale price of the house. Then there might be things necessary to repair or paint in order to sell the property. You would need to check the figures to find out if this is a viable purchase and you would lose or gain financially in the selling of your house after the seven year period. Manufactured homes normally don't appreciate as fast as a brick and mortar house would, as a matter of fact they might depreciate in value, thus your investment for seven years would not be a sound investment when you decide to sell in seven years.   You might would want to inquire of a local mortgage lender the requirements of a land lease in the purchase of a property. Normally there is a minimum number of years a lease would have to be in order for a mortgage lender to consider approving a mortgage loan for this type loan. You might also check with a mortgage lender about if they would consider an approval for a manufactured home. Also there is the age of the manufactured home, apparently the one you are considering is 15 years of age. This might be considered old for a manufactured home.   You should contact a local mortgage lender to seek answers to a variety of questions involving your purchasing of this manufactured home. It might be that you would not be able to use a conventional mortgage lender and would have to use one that specialize in manufactured or trailer lending.  I hope this has been of some benefit to you, good luck. \"FIGHT ON\"", 8751, "4MypYVHYaa", -1],

	73818 : ["Monetization is the process of converting or establishing something into legal tender. It usually refers to the coining of currency or the printing of banknotes by central banks.

Though rarely the case with paper currency, even intrinsically relatively worthless items or commodities can be made into money, so long as they are difficult to make or acquire. Monetization may also refer to exchanging securities for currency, selling a possession, charging for something that used to be free or making money on goods or services that were previously unprofitable.

You can buy enzymes to add to the tank (through the toilet ) that will activate the digestion processes.  Another thing to look at is the septic bed, the outflow from the tank. How old is it and is it still draining. If it is not draining properly the overflow from the tank is blocked resulting in backup.

	73828 : ["Our other house is under the jurisdiction of a homeowners association, and unfortunately I know quite a bit about dealing with them.  Rule number one is the rules do not apply to everyone.  The rules apply only to the people the HOA president chooses to apply them to.  Rule number two is, if they hate your guts they will make your life miserable just because they can.  Rule number three is you cannot win, no matter what.  I repeat, once you are targeted, you cannot and will not win.  Selective enforcement does not make the rules unenforceable.  The bylaws are written such that homeowner is always wrong.  I actually received a letter from our HOA president, addressed to me, not my husband, telling me that if I would stop complaining about the six foot pile of dog shet in my neighbor's yard the community would be a better place, and that my nosiness was a violation of federal law.  That did it for us.  We got a lawyer.  That took care of the problem, and I mean instantaneously.  They were afraid of us after that, and they left us alone and made our neighbors comply as well.  I took advantage of the protections afforded to us by our attorney and told our HOA president to go F herself, which was very cleansing and healing for me, but very embarrassing to my dear husband.  Anyway, a lawyer is the only answer, and you gave your friend the best possible advice.  People who live in communities like this exist at the pleasure of the HOA.  Or not.  If he is fined he will have to pay them because all bylaws have clauses in them requiring the payment of interest and collection fees if the fines are not paid.  I could go on and on, but the bottom line is your friend is screwed.  Before he calls a lawyer, he should take pictures and make a paper trail.  I wrote letters every single day, and they were accompanied by pictures, all of which I kept copies of.  Bear in mind, nothing changed until we got a lawyer.  I am sympathetic to your friend's financial situation, but if his quality of life is important to him, he will find the $100 to $500 a consultation with an attorney will cost.  Most likely the attorney will review the bylaws and send a letter.  That should put a stop to everything, which in my opinion is worth every penny.  Most attorneys take credit cards, by the way.  If you have any other questions, you can email me.  Like I said, I know more about this than I want to.", 8751, "3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa", 1],

Complaints are discussed at board meetings so we can make decisions.  That's probably what the President meant by signing what they put in front of her.  I do that to.  The management gives me a paper to sign and I ask what it is and what for, and usually sign it. My guess is your buddy has a neighbor that is generating the complaints.  If nobody is complaining about the other neighbors, it's because they probably aren't as much of a nuisance, or their neighbors don't think so anyway.   It's likely that the board of the HOA does not draw any salary for this.  We don't.  We are volunteers and we do it because nobody else wants to.  We're lucky if we can get enough people to vote in the annual election to make it official. Encourage your friend to run for election the next time the board has it's annual election.  Odds are a current board member would be relieved to get off the board.  It is a thankless job. This idea of \"well they are doing it so it's OK for me to\" is not a valid defense.  Your buddy agreed to the rules when he moved in there.  If your buddy feels put upon then he should file a complaint about all the other neighbors and their issues of non-compliance.  Something I'm sure will endear him to his neighbors.  Then all the problems will be addressed by the HOA and eventually fixed. The appropriate solution is just to comply with the rules.
