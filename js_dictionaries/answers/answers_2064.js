And my mom actually works with the guys mother. That's how I found out. He was married and had a great life with a 9 month old boy with his wife. She left them alone one night so she could get things done she needed to and while she was out her husband ending up killing the child because he would not stop crying. He straggled him to death.

On the other hand I have never seen anything in my child's  school dress code that bans political statements on his clothes. Children's minds are very open to the beliefs of there parents and will usually back their play regardless of whether it is wrong or right. So be careful what you say in front of your children because it will mold their political and social views in the future. *Badash  by putting a statement like this  on a shirt with a presidentual nominee on it pretty much makes it a political statment.

You may have a change in the spring.  Take him outside for a while before his nap..go to the park, go for walks, let him walk, just being outside in the fresh air makes them happy and gets them really tired.  then take him out again in the late afternoon or after dinner for a while.

	108986 : ["The Aurora Public Schools released the following statement:  Aurora Public School staff members understand and respect the rights of students to free speech. We thoughtfully and consistently administer student discipline when needed on a case-by-case basis, but we do not suspend students for exercising their first amendment rights. As a district, we are concerned about the educational process and not whether students hold liberal or conservative viewpoints.  Our students wear hundreds of shirt designs, including political shirts, without interruption to the school day. In fairness to all students, we would review a situation that is distracting or that interrupts the environment where students are learning. The concern would be based on whether or not the article of clothing disrupts the learning environment.  Parents and students are made aware of the APS dress code in the parent/student handbook, which states: Any type of attire which attracts undue attention to the wearer, and thus causes a disturbance to the educational process is in bad taste and not acceptable. While preserving the individuality of our students is important, we also see the importance of preserving the educational process. When a students message disrupts the educational process of the school, we have the right and obligation to take action to stop the disruption.  In this case, response to the students shirt resulted in a very loud argument on the playground before school. The student was screaming and loudly arguing with other students. When students went to class, the discussion continued and disrupted learning in a math classroom.  On the same day at Aurora Frontier K-8, the student's sister wore a shirt with an anti-Obama message, which did not disrupt learning and no discipline was imposed in that case. Students at this school and throughout the district, have been wearing endorsement shirts for both presidential candidates. Because these shirts have not caused disruptions, students have not been asked to remove them.  In a situation where a students clothing is believed to be disruptive, we would offer the student options such as: turn the shirt inside out or change into another shirt. Because the shirt did cause a disruption, we offered the student these options.  We respect the free speech rights of our students, but at the same time we must also respect the rights of all students to learn without disruption.  And, for your entertainment, here is a story about a student wearing an anti-Bush t-shirt:  (courts ruled against school and say political shirts are allowed). If the boy's father presses this, he will win. Just for the record.  I support Obama. ", 10072, "1AdzD6bmaa", 3],

	108988 : ["My son is three and he naps about noon. I make sure he eats lunch early (about 11:30) because if he doesn't go down by noon hes very cranky. But the thing is my son is up about 7 - 7:30 I've found about the 5 hour mark is when they are ready to nap most of the time. Plus if your daughter takes a 2 hour nap she'll have 5 hours before bed. One thing I like to remember is, if taking a nap during the day means they are happier then pushing bed time back a little (an hour or so) isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think your right though 5 is a little to late to take a nap. My sons cut off is 3pm if he hasn't gone down for a nap by then I just put him to bed a little earlier to avoid the hysterics that come from being overly tired. I think if your daughter take a 2 hour nap I would lay her down by 1or 2pm and let her lay in there for the 2 hours even if she doesn't sleep. after a few days of establishing a routine, she should start falling asleep by then.

If Obama gets elected President, is it possible that the kids who saw this t-shirt might be a little scared...of course!

It's been a few years and I did smoke for about eleven years so it wasn't easy. The first two days will be the worst but you can get through it. You will be tired, irritable, nauseaous, and many other symptoms can happen but they will most definitely pass. You just have to find something to take your mind off smoking and I wouldn't try to do too much right now. If you are religious then praying really helps. Just keep the goal in your mind and you can do it; you will be so proud of yourself. It is something that you must take moment by moment but know the cravings will pass and the irritability will go away when the nicotine is completely out of your body. I did have to quit my antidepressants when I became pg and that was really hard. Although I didn't crave them per se, I had horrible symptoms and you have to talk yourself out of it. Just know you are doing what's right for all your kids as well as yourself. It's just the drug wearing off so try to stick it out. You really can do it; just keep talking yourself up.

I know that being pregnant is a big emotional roller coaster and quit smoking it another big transition.. and your frustrated and your body is going through the withdrawal's..but something that might help stabilize your mood to help with dealing with your kids you have would be to eat or take a supplement that is high is all your b vitamins, like b6 b12 and such because they are natural mood lifters among many other things that they are good for you and your baby.. Most prenatal have these in them, but not enough to see a difference so go to walmart or something and get some b vitamins plus they are safe to take just find out what milligrams you need while pregnant and stay with in that guideline..
