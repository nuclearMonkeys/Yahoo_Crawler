	138181 : ["My take is that it's not ruined wrestling itself, but the way we actually watch it. However, it is still pretty simple, if you don't want to know about it, you don't read it, remember, this is not a sport, this is high impact theatre, sports entertainment, and should be treated as such. Everyone knows what happens in Hamlet, yet people will sit and watch it all their lives, it has nothing to do with results, spoilers, crap matches, internet, etc, its all about the emotion, the spectacle that is wrestling, and it is not mean't to be taken so seriously. Granted, since being involved on the 'net, it has taken some of my passion away, but I choose what to look at. So if the net affects your viewing in a negative way, choose not to allow it. In addition, the IWC has certainly had a big factor in how the average fan view's the product (whether that product be TNA, WWE, ROH, etc) today. I know I can't speak for those who have watched it for 15 - 20 years (or even more) because I've only been watching since about 99 ish. But the opinions that many \"fans\" have compiled for every single factor of wrestling at the moment has caused the average fan to look into the product too much. And, because of that, we are abliged to conform to other people's opinions and therefore we are forced to like or dislike the product accordingly. Thanks to the internet, I miss exactly what others miss about wrestling, like sneaking up early to watch a taped PPV and being mad when your favourite wrestler loses, etc. Back when it was fun, who really cared about how bad a wrestler was in-ring? Does anybody remember the Rock vs. Bossman and Bull Buchanan in a Cage match? Nobody cared how bad the other two were in-ring, everyone just wanted the Rock to win 'coz he was the good boy and the odds were stacked against him. If that happened today the internet \"smarts\" will go \"-**, terrible match, I don't know why they bother\" but back when no-one cared about the actual quality of the match, everyone would shout \"YAY, ROCK WON\". It's nowhere near as fun anymore, because the fun gets drained by these people who call themselves reporters, like that Dave Meltzer, everyone gets excited about his star ratings and no matter how good a PPV can be he will pull out all the bad points and all his loyal readers will agree and start off a massive chain that will go on and on until everyone on the Internet agrees. I think today, the wrestling business has to cater to the internet in many ways because it has become such a big part of the industry, whether anyone wants to admit it or not. It's been proven that WWE and TNA can still swerve the internet at times and keep spoilers unknown, but they just have to go that extra mile and work harder to do it. Sadly, the days of when wrestling was presented as a legit sport are gone, in part because of the internet and in part because of Vince McMahon telling us its scripted So to answer, the IWC hasn't \"ruined wrestling\" as the actual quality of the product hasn't declined over the past 3-4 years, but our perspective on it has.Somewhat, in general the internet has ruin the element of surprise and shock and the world of pro wrestling, and the thing that really grinds my gears is that people expect WWE and TNA to be unpredictable, but when most people read spoilers and plans for the future, now does that make any sense no it does not, but I do not blame it all of fans, because wrestling companies should have there information secure because it seems that people that work for the companies or an inside source leaks the information, blame it on the internet and the internet wrestling community.", 11381, "X9iZA9svaa", 1],

	138190 : ["Sheamus vs Triple H - Winner Sheamus:  I Think Sheamus will win his first legit victory at Wrestlemania going over his mentor. Im hoping to see respect between the two at the conclusion of this match. Triple Threat - Winner Orton:  At one point in the match Orton will let both legacy member's battle it out and swoop in for the win in the final moment's. Money in the bank - Winner Shelton Benjamin:  The WWE need's to shed Jack Swagger's Rookie/ ECW image and give him a major push like Sheamus. He has all the potential in the world and the physical attributes to boot. However i think tonight is Shelton Benjamin's night. He has been through it all and deserves his shot and WWE immortality. It's only right.  Bret vs Vince (No Hold's Barred) - Winner Bret Hart.  Tonight will be the Wrestlemania send off Bret Hart has always dreamed about. There's no better way to say good bye to the WWE Universe by making the boss tap out to the Sharp shooter. This wont be a classic calibur match but it will suprise with many twist and turns hense (No Hold's Barred) Cena vs Batista - Winner Cena:  Expect alot of boo's tonight directed at Cena, however Cena will emerge victorious in a match based on the power and strength of both men. I expect alot of standoff's between the two and a high point in the match in which the referee gets knocked out. CM Punk vs Rey Mysterio - Winner Mysterio:  This is a revenge match for Rey Mysterio, revenge for all the thing's Punk has done and said directed at his family and himself. The stipulation is that if Punk win's Rey must join his straight edge society. I believe Rey will pull out the victory in the most suprising match of the night. After the match i expect CM Punk to get his head shaved by either Rey Mysterio or the rest of his straight edge society. Miz and Big Show vs Truth and Morrison - Winner's Miz and Big Show: I think the Miz and Big Show will prevail tonight in an ok match. Toward's the end of the match I expect Show will knock Miz out with a huge right hand by accident but will prevail in the end. The final image of Show carrying Miz to the back hung over his shoulder. Undertaker vs HBK - Winner Undertaker:  This is Shawn Michael's last match. I think they will go all out in this match taking as many risk's as possible. Since this match is (No DQ) I anticipate alot of blood shed, memorable use of weapon's and alot of reason's to chant holy ****. This match will be the hilight of the night with a heart warming send off at the conclusion of it. I don't expect this match to become and instant classic like last year's match considering the (No DQ) rule, but without a doubt bring the fans to the edge of their seats. John Cena to defeat the Undertaker at Wrestlemania one year. Edge vs Jericho - Winner Edge:  Edge will prevail tonight in what i think will be his best match ever. Edge's hardcore backround will mix well with Jericho's high risk taking ability. I expect plenty of reversal's, plenty of taunting and alot of kick out's. This match will end with one little mistake that turns into the biggest spear ever. The WWE has had Edge on a light schedule latley and most likley expect him to return the favor tonight with a great showing.  This will not be the main event tonight. Cena vs Batista is most likley to take those honor's right after Undertake vs Michaels. Thanks - Jon Gaffney", 11380, "2UKsFX21aa", 0],

	138197 : ["I respect your point and you back it up with some good Ideas but I think you are just wrong.   Wrestling has been destroyed by a LACK of competition.  There was a time in the 80s when there where over 50 independent federations many of them under the independent NWA banner and many others.  Vince Mcmuffin destroyed them all by taking their talent or buying them or using the law.   Only now is the sport beginning to recover from a lack of competition and basically an entire entertainment form held captive to one man's idea of what it should be like.   Monopolies in all forms of human endeavors inherently stifle innovation and drive up cost and charges to the consumer.   While Vince does deserve some credit for his part to bring wrestling to the highs in the 80s he also deserves the blame for what his multinational corporation has done to bring it to the under performing sport it is today with wrestlers who all look alike and act alike and who the general public are no almost unaware of as NAMES.  As the Hulk Hogans and Rick Flairs move out of the biz, there will be no public faces of wrestling left and that is a problem not of too much but too little competition and diversity.    The internet is the only hope for some of the many small town feds to build back up enough support to then jump to a small market tv station spot and then to a regional spot so they can begin to pay talent.
