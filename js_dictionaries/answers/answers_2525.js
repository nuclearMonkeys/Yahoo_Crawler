I would never lie nor would any of the Hillary supports I know about voting for Obama. Some of us will, and some of us wont. It does not make you racist if you chose to vote for McCain instead of Obama, (although some people may think that way) and you should not be ashamed of how you are going to Vote unless Race is the only reason you are Voting that way.", 11120, "7FBngkPjaa", 0],
	132071 : ["That's the good old media telling me what to do again.  No, I will NOT get over my frustration with the media, the Democratic National Committee, the Kennedy family, and all the others who jumped on the Obamawagon simply to heal the \"guilt\" of how African-Americans were treated generations ago.  That was more of a slap in the face for blacks than anything else that has happened in this campaign.  No one ever said that Obama was the better candidate (and to be honest, I don't believe he is).  But it was decided by the media that he was the \"perfect\" candidate.  No matter what Clinton said or did, it was wrong according to media standards.  She was trashed, made fun of, ridiculed and ignored.  For that reason, depending upon how I feel when I get into the voting booth in November, I will not vote for Obama.  My vote in the Michigan caucus didn't count at first, and is now only worth half a vote.  My vote in November will simply be one single vote against what the Democratic party has become ... a party that I am not proud of and which apparently doesn't want me because I am female, older, unemployed and am in need of better health care.  Shame on Howard Dean, Donna Brazile and the rest of the DNC and the super delegates for trying to force-feed Obama to us.", 11120, "fyxCEY6Maa", 5],

Yeah, I know it's hard when you quit something and more than likely you take up a new habit to replace the old one, but I hope you don't fall back. It seems like you are suffering from withdraw symptoms. I think you should have a cheer team like get your peeps on your side to motivate you. I think that would keep you going. Or like you can get yourself a reward or something...something you really want as your prize for going without weed for 2 months or something. I think if you are really serious about it then you would check yourself into rehab. I know it cost a lot, but they have stuff that can help you and clean you out. Well, anyway, I wish you the best of luck and I really hope you quit for good! Here's to two more weeks off weed! :)", 11125, "AA11865982", 0],

	132084 : ["I decided against Obama a long time ago, NH to be exact (before Wright, Ayers, and all the other stuff).   He's duplicitous as a con man (transcend politics, just used slim to get into them), and it's too basic a character flaw for me.  Plus lack of experience in his policies, no clue on foreign policy.  It was always Clinton or McCain.  Clinton supporting democrat positions had that edge.  McCain had the experience & grounded edge, and was still moderate and close to my views.  I would decide over time.  FYI, if you research McCain most of the stuff said against him is false (not truthfully told, like the vet bills were pork barrel additions that wouldn't have worked.).  McCain stood up to Bush, when Obama didn't! But now my choice is down to McCain or McCain. PS media's been condescending towards Hillary supporters all along- they didn't suddenly start knowing what her supporters are thinkking.  It's more of what Obama's compaign is saying without other positions represented.  (And I wasn't a diehard Hillary supporter - but I get it! )", 11120, "DTog0VZWaa", 2],
	132085 : ["Florida and Michigan were a travesty, as was the corrupt vote count in NW Indiana. The RBC meeting last Saturday practically handed the nomination to Obama,  but he still didn't have enough votes so Pelosi and Reid got on the phone and strong-armed the super-delegates to publically declare for Obama. They dragged Obama across the finish line. Hillary is the stronger, more experienced candidate! This is such a corrupt way for Obama to win that I could never unify behind him.

I trust McCain more than Obama, for sure, however a thought that haunts me is \"How much will you expect from McCain vs. How much will you expect from Obama?\"  With Obama I think most of America will expect more from him if he's in office.

(And yes, they CAN do this.) Doesn't matter if you live with him or not. If that's in the papers that the judge signs off on, that's how it is. Once the divorce is final, that temporary order no longer stands. If HE filed for divorce, he should also have filed temporary custody orders. He left the home, left the kids there without any custody arrangements. Divorce may take time, but it doesn't have to take over 2 years (if, in fact, you weren't around before the divorce was filed).

He won't divorce his wife, and if he does it'll take years, way after your child is born. If that wife of his is smart she will walk away with a big portion since she can get him on infidelity.
