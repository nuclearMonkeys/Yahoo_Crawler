	45865 : ["It is not about cruelty to animals at all for people that understand what many vegans are attempting to do for their body. Go look up Methylation and the human body. It is the cycle in your stomachs intestinal system and processing food. The human methylation process is not always completed correctly by certain people on different food types. The doctors during their medical training get some training on it, but it is becoming its own field of study. The vegans if they are vegans trying to take animal protein out of their diet it gets real detailed, real quick on what the vegans' diet protein and other nutrients, vitamins, and other elements in the vegetable do for your body as compared to animal proteins. For example if the methylation processes is not completed correctly, or fully with some foods for a given individuals DNA and and their body's intestinal system. The body's methylation incomplete process will leave too much homocysteine in your blood that did not get converted into the correct next step of your food processing. Go look for the methylation chart with circles in the diagram, and the explanation of the complete process. Doctors are just now learning a field of thought where by the homocysteine excess levels in some people's blood interfere with your brains cells replacement during your bodies natural cell replacement, and may lead to the Alzheimer's. This Alzheimer condition so many are now facing by the millions in our population. Hope this helps your understanding some folks are about the animals for vegans, but many are now about our remembering you get one body and how you take care of it with a little study will reward you ten times over. Good  health to you.   ", 6567, "AA11593107", -1],
	45866 : ["In general, it's a good idea to redesign your diet on a nutritional basis when you go vegan.  Pulses and peanuts contain more sulphur-containing amino acids than other plant sources of protein, but it takes a long time for this to constitute a problem and if you just have pulses sometimes and grains and seeds at others over a month or so, you should be fine.  Animal protein usually contains all essential amino acids.  But I hardly ever think about it nowadays.", 6571, "0GPMDJYKaa", 0],
	45867 : ["  Of the essential amino acids, only one can be difficult to get, and that's lysine. Yet even that can be found or gotten if a wide enough variety of foods are eaten. A bigger issue would be in the actual the absorption of any of the given essential amino acids, and that is something that can actually transcend any given dietary following. Even a person who eats meat or animal products three times a day, and still come up low or deficient for one or more. Which comes down to a malabsorption issue, that without proper diagnostic testing can go unknown. But not all people has a malabsorption issue with any of the ten amino acids, that can have an impact any of the other more than thirty essential micronutrients that we need.   Those who are a vegetarian or a vegan whose diet is planned properly, won't have an issue, that doesn't restrict other food types, beyond meat, and/or some of the other animal based foods, that's acceptable. Those who are more likely to run into an issue with any of the essential amino acids, as well as some other essential micronutrients, such as those who follow the fruitarian diet, or an all raw strict vegetarian diet. That all aside, those who also eats meat, and follows something such as the Paleo diet, can also equally at risk for creating a deficiency somewhere, in one or more of the fourty plus essential nutrients.   I've spent quite a bit of time over the years of my own time, learning about nutrition in general, and the more I learn, the more that my personal stance of there not being a single given diet that will work for everyone becomes stronger, along with the harsh realization, that the nutritional sciences as they are now, are still a soft science.", 6571, "MD1FznnXaa", 1],
