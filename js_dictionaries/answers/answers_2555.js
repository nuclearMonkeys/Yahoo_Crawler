I received a call from installers within a half hour, my husband told them what we did and they could not argue that job was not finished, not with us anyway. No call from manager as promised so I called again and spoke with Zack who said that since I signed that installers were there and completed job it was basically my fault. I insisted on still having a manager call me to take further, Zack told me that this would happen and that was 2 weeks ago. Now I will be trying to find a place that I can send a letter.

	133590 : ["Western narcissim, hypocracy, and proganda in order to keep the Turks in place;-  read a letter from an independent Australian Ambassador and I quote, Mr. George Karagiannakis's letter (2/6/94), making all sorts of incredible allegations against Turkey in regard to its domestic and foreign policies, should not be allowed to go unanswered. It is not possible in the space of a few lines to answer all of his allegations. However, in fairness to the truth, the following points must be made: The 'facts beyond credible dispute' to which he alludes are in fact based largely on fictions to justify unrealistic ambitions or failures in the past to achieve totally unrealistic goals. Whilst it is true and sad that many Armenians lost their lives in their own bid for territory, what is not recognized is that the Armenians themselves inflicted as much damage as others in the hostilities of that time, goaded on by some Western powers for their own selfish and geopolitical objectives. The Turks had no deliberate policy of genocide at any stage, only the removal of Armenians from the front line with Russia, where they were collaborating with the Ottoman Empire's enemies and were thus a threat to its security. The Kurdish issue is more complex. Two points are relevant: The PKK, like IRA, is a terrorist organization, SUPPORTED MATERIALLY BY THE GREEKS AND ARMENIANS, with the stated objective of destabilizing Turkey. It has so far assassinated over 10,000 people in Turkey. It has no justifiable claim to represent the Kurdish people. Most Kurds are integrated into Turkish society. About one-third of the Turkish Parliament is of Kurdish origin. This illustrates the absence of discrimination. As for Cyprus, if any genocide or ethnic cleansing has taken place, this has always been carried out by the Greeks. The abortive coup of 1974, organized by EOKA and Greek colonels, aimed at elimination of the Turkish Cypriots from the Island. Turkey intervened to protect them and prevent Enosis. Since that date, the island has been peaceful and free of bloodshed. Turkey has consistently supported a fair and reasonable settlement on Cyprus, but one that gives the Turkish Cypriots a secure future and equal political and social status with the Greek Cypriots. The real problem between Greece and Turkey is Greece's reluctance to give up its Megali idea, that is, the recovery of the territories occupied by the Byzantine Empire, which finally fell to the Turks in 1453. All the many conflicts between Greece and Turkey over the past two centuries have been initiated by Greece. Your correspondent's reference to bloodied Turkish history is therefore clearly wrong, except in the fact that in the past three Greek-initiated conflicts, the Turks gave the Greeks a severe hiding, which partly accounts for the large fall in numbers of Greeks in present-day Turkey. Regarding persecution. the Ottomans had one of the most tolerant policies towards non-Turks of any empire of its day. The three communities of Jews, Greeks and Armenians were virtually autonomous within the empire. P. F. Peters Former Australian Ambassador to Turkey (The Australian, June 9th, 1994) Further still ;- Americans and Europeans Know Very Little About the Turkish Republic's Rejection of its Ottoman Heritage  Arnold Reisman[1] “No nation that has maintained close relations with the United States for the last generation is so little understood by well-informed Americans as is Turkey. Even West Europeans, from their closer vantage point, are rarely better informed. In part, this lack of understanding may be due simply to limited contact. There is in the United States no sizable Turkish-American community, hence, no ready Turkish constituency in American public opinion. In western Europe, Turks are present in large numbers but as guest workers living with their families, apart and unassimilated in the more crowded parts of the cities, and eager to save enough of their wages for the ultimate return home to Turkey.” Dankwart A. Rüstow, Princeton, and CUNY Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Sociology, wrote this in a 1979 article that appeared in the prestigious journal Foreign Affairs. Not much has changed in this respect in spite of Turkey's bid for EU membership and the ensuing dangling of Turkey by “old Europe's” leaders. When Dankwart Rüstow penned those lines, his knowledge in this area was not derived from academic research or readings. The son of sociology professor Alexander Rüstow, who in 1933 was discharged from his Berlin position by the Nazis and saved by Turkey, Dankwart Rüstow received his undergraduate education while living in Turkey.  The Ottomans were great innovators in many areas during the 14th and 15th centuries. Unfortunately as time progressed their skills in science and medicine lagged at least fifty years behind Western Europe. In WWI the Ottoman Empire fought alongside Germany. They lost. In 1918 at the end of that war, the Empire became a chapter in history. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk led the Turkish people in a successful war of independence against the Allied powers and in 1923 the Republic of Turkey was founded with Atatürk its first President. Among historians there is little debate about the fact that Turkey's Republican fathers rejected the vestiges of their Ottoman heritage so they could institute many reforms to modernize and/or westernize their society and its institutions.  During the 1920s Turkey witnessed a maelstrom of radical reforms which included abolishment of the Sultanate (1922), the Caliphate (1924), Islamic educational institutions, and religious courts. The reforms introduced new dress codes, and a modern Swiss-based system of jurisprudence replacing the religious law in 1926. The new Civil Code recognized: legal marriage over religious marriage; monogamy over polygamy; gender equality in the legal and work arenas including divorce and inheritance; limitation on patriarchate authority over social and political issues; and the rights for women to be elected to parliament. The Western calendar was introduced in 1925, the international numeric system and a Latin-based alphabet which significantly increased literacy within a short time-frame were introduced in 1928. In 1931 the metric system was introduced and in 1934 personal titles were abolished and the surname law passed. The same day Turkey became a secular state with all its ramifications, another revolutionary law standardizing and secularizing educational institutions was passed. All educational institutions became part of the Ministry of National Education. In 1933 Turkey's system of higher education including medical education was thoroughly revised.  Turkey's only university the Darülfünun a medrese turned into a university in 1909, was closed and in its place the University of Istanbul using professors invited from Germany where they were being discarded by the Nazis was opened. Just a couple of decades after the Ottoman Empire had taken its last breath, the general exodus had so depleted Germany's premier higher-learning institutions of professors that the University of Istanbul was rightfully considered and sincerely called “the best German University in the world.” Today Turkey sports 72 universities many equal and some better than most universities in the US.  Modern Turkey is several decades ahead of western countries, particularly the United States, in terms of percentages of women working as physicians, (26%), engineers (27%), architects (33 %), lawyers (30%), and university professors (42%). This is also true at the senior level administration of universities, government agencies, and management of private sector companies. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk would have been proud of this outcome Since gender equality in the workplace was part of his vision.  With secularisation enshrined in its constitution, the new government recognized the need for modernization throughout Turkish society and established policies for bringing this about. Today Turkey is center stage in policy debates of many countries and in EU's enlargement. Unfortunately the country's image in these debates is often colored by perceptions of a society dating back to the Ottomans.  Istanbul is widely recognized as the name of Turkey's most well known city, but it was not always this way, and even today some confusion over its proper name exists. The confusion is rooted in the various names the city assumed under the Ottomans in the centuries after their conquest of the city in 1453. Atatürk officially renamed the city as Istanbul in the 1920s. Yet Germans still refer to Istanbul as Konstantinopel, the French and the British use Constantinople and the Italians, Constantinopoli. Constantinople continued to appear on maps well into the 1960s later to appear in parentheses after Istanbul. This is indicative of the Europeans' tendency to ignore the transformations which have taken place in Turkey since the days of the Ottomans. Americans and the Europeans base their perceptions of contemporary Turkey and its post independence history on tours, cruises, and on a few Hollywood movies. This type of ignorance leads to misunderstandings, uninformed and biased judgments, and affects policy debates. As the world grows smaller and the information highway becomes a freeway the West cannot afford to remain ignorant about a country that has been and is at the world's geo-political pivotal point.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [1] Arnold Reisman PhD PE, a resident of Shaker Heights OH is the author of TURKEY'S MODERNIZATION: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk 's Vision.

However as \"Mehmet K\" said; 1.Never bargain with terrorists or their supporters. To do so would just reinforce a negative act with the desired outcome. Then Terrorism wins and would be encouraged to use more of the same tactics to achieve more of what it considers positive results. \"Young Turk\" you may not that know Turkeys military and industrial complex has been working very hard to update and improve indigenous weapons design and manufacturing. In the not too distant future future Turkey may even become and exporter of military hardware. on the following link take note \"all 3 invited American manufacturers had abandoned the competition entirely\" But look where the PKK weapons are coming from; See who is even bidding on Turkish military hardware. Look at the GÖKTÜRK RFP and New Type Submarine Project responders in link below. So I do agree on one hand but disagree on another. But don't you think that the PKK wants more than ever to force Turkeys hand, and have it make an incursion into Iraq. Turkey is a soverign state and has to do what is best for Turkey. It cannot sit and wait to make a decision based on EU membership, NATO, or United States pressure. The United States cannot control its own borders how can it possibly give advice on controlling Turkeys borders. We all know that if the Iraqis/(USA) wanted to remove the PKK training camps and bases, they would be gone in one week. Didn't somebody once say;   “A nation which makes the final sacrifice for life and freedom does not get beaten” and “Sovereignty is not given, it is taken.”  how else can you have “Peace at home, peace in the world” A clear ultimatum must be given and severe consequences for it's violation.

It is horrible that so many lives were taken without the ability to fight back and protect themselves.  As Abdulmalik said though, it is the brutality of war.  War is never fair.  Innocents and criminals alike, die equal deaths during a war. That being said; any group or person who directly defiles a command from the Quran is not a Muslim person or group.  They cannot claim to be part of the Muslimeen because they commit blatant and direct disobedience to Allah and the Quran every day.  For instance: Surah 2:190- and fight in the cause of Allah, but do not be aggressors.  Allah does not love aggressors. Suran 2:194- The Sacred month for the Sacred month.  Sacrilege calls for retaliation!  Whoever commits aggression against you, retaliate against them in the same measure he has committed against you.  And be conscious of Allah and know that Allah is with the righteous. Surah 2:217- They ask you about fighting during the Holy Month.  Say, fighting during it is deplorable!  But to bar others from Allah's path and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent access to the Holy Mosque, and to expel people from it are even more deplorable with Allah.  Persecution is more serious than killing..... My point is that ISIS commits acts of aggression without being attacked first; which is against the Quran. They fight and kill during the Holy month of Ramadan; which is against the Quran. They kill people and fight them in front of the Mosques.  They bar people from entering Mosques to pray and worship in the way that Allah decreed.  There are numerous video and written accounts of such everywhere you look online; which is against the Quran!   I could go on and on with examples of how exactly ISIS goes against the God and the Book that they claim to be upholding but I don't have that kind of time.  If you want to know exactly what is going on and how wrong it is, look it up.  There are all kinds of online articles and videos.  And you can find a copy of the Quran online as well for free, that you can read.

Muslims persecute every minority in their midst. Their philosophy is convert or die. No minority has ever existed in an Arab country and been treated equally. The recent treatment of Christians in Iraq is an example. When the land was partitioned Jews from elsewhere is the middle east moved to Israel. Why didn't the Muslims just move to other parts of the middle east, after all the vast majority of the middle east is Arab and only a tiny part is Israel. The Arabs would rather leave those people in refugee camps for half a century than relocate them because they want to use them to stir up hatred against the Jews.

What role will Egypt play? - It might support the Palestinian State, if it would ever be created. What role will America play? - Of course it would support the Israelis and claim to help the Palestinian State when in fact it would be helping in preventing it. Where will the refugees go? - They are basically settled where they are living. Will the new Palestinian state accept the refugees and diaspora? - They would welcome and encourage the refugees back.", 11192, "uEjES9Q2aa", -4],
	133621 : ["I agree with Anlarm´s first two points - improving the economy, infrastucture and education of the population of the east will take away much of the temptation to join or tolerate PKK ideology. Also, supporting their practicing of their culture and language removes the \"us against them\" mentality, they run out of reasons to feel oppressed and underprivileged. This doesn´t mean to support their calls for a seperate state, it is just acknowledging them as a valid group within Turkey. Here in Germany, the Bavarians call their state (Bayern) a \"Freistaat\", meaning it is a seperate state of their own. It isn´t really, it´s just another province, like the others. But Germany humours their demands for \"special status\" to a small degree, and so they feel happy. It is a similar situation in Canada with the \"Quebec seperatists\" (the French part). Of course, niether the Bavarians nor the Quebecouis are attacking with guns, but granting a little special status to Kurds in exchange for peace may also stem too much further support for PKK or separatist ideals. Striking into Iraq seems very tempting at times, I agree. Certainly the Turkish army is very skilled and would do well. But this action would carry a lot of international and political consequences along with it, so it must be very carefully considered.  These are only my opinions but I do not live there, and I respect the other viewpoints! An interesting question! Bye!", 11191, "LuQMDjkRaa", 2],
	133622 : ["I think your view is indeed very narrow.  Turkey -as any other country- can enter any war. That's easy. Very easy. The question is how Turkey will exit from that in 20-50 years from now... Even more, PKK does not really have a base. An organized army. PKK is everywhere and recruits everyone. Anytime. PKK's power lies in the hearts and minds of its followers. Turkey cannot really fight or even win these feelings with a war. It will only ignite them. If so, Turks will loose because this war will be carried out inside Turkey and -trust me- will never end. The consequences of this war will be detrimental: 1. PKK might earn the sympathy of the west (see Palestine, Armenia): \"The poor and brave PKK fighters against the monstrous army of Turkey\". I see this coming fast. 2. Tourism will slow down affecting millions of Turks and unemployment will rise.   3. Political unrest will affect investments and growth and these will affect the economy and will increase the Turkish debt (or you thought armies are cheap?). 4. The war will divide the people once living peacefully together (Kurds will be united here). 5. International community will finally intervene and ask for cease fire and call for discussions between the...2 sides: This way, Turkey has just legalized its enemy! and Turkey did it all by itself! Unfortunately, Turkey will enter the war. But not for Turkey. For reasons that I don't have the time or space to tell. Anlarm's suggestion provides some solution to the problem. Edit to Fatih: I don't really use double standards. The whole world has criticized Israelis and Americans for their politics. I really think this war will not do any good to anyone and particularly to Turkey. You really need to increase the living standards in East Turkey, invest on and educate the people that live there! It will take time. But it will solve the problem in the long run. Your solution will bring chaos to Turkey. And unfortunately we will be all here to see this. You really think that an operation will change the minds of people? Will make them think otherwise? will eliminate them? they will wake up and admit you are right? This is somehow narrow minded. Don't you think? Or else give me one good example where such an operation has previously really helped any nation in the past...You will push Kurds to the limits and will unite them like never ever before. Not all. But many more than now.  USA still pays a heavy price = their economy goes down the last 5 years. So do Israelis. And you have not seen the end of it. Wait until the oil runs out and when nobody will care anymore...about Israel or the Arabs. Young Turk gives the reasons behind the \"who is really pushing for that war\" attitude. And as i said, no matter what, you will go to war! Not because you want it. But because westerners must sell. And sell and sell... Until your debt will go up in your ears for the next 50 years. This is a modern type of slavery. And there is no way out until local people will wake up.   Other than that, I did not mean to offend anyone...:)", 11191, "kHHM63aaaa", -2],
