Also, in regards to beating, yes I do that, but not hard so that it hurts me. I do it softly. But, yet again, beating is a sign of how much we care for Imam Hussein (as). It has also become a culture to do this since the day Imam Hussein (as) was martyred.

(but he's dead). my mom tells me.  my sister tells me. occasionally other family members do ........  or a freind does, but that kind of love is different than romantic love. And even in that cirumstance, i've not heard it often. I am not told \"I love you\" very often. I am not told \"I appreciate you\" or \"Thank You\" very often either. Hugs aren't common either.  And though i'm the kind of person of whom is somewhat secure and i don't need to hear it every day, every once in a while it is nice to know that i am cared about and appreciated. But I think the phrase becomes commonplace after a while and loses it's meaning if used TOO much or in the wrong context.  Like when i guy plays the \"I love you\" card just to get you to do him OR a friend or family member plays the \"I love you\" card just because they want something from you. Not everyone is like that, but some are. And the phrase does lose it's credibility and meaning after a while of being used improperly in such circumstances.  I try to let the people in my life know that i care about them often. I always say \"Love You!\" or \"I Love You!\" but that's just because that's the way that i am. I've always been like that. I like people to know that they are loved and cared about. And that it is genuine, as i expect nothing in return.  I am sorry you've had such horrible circumstances. I know the feeling, believe me. I can offer you a hug! ---> ♥hugs!!♥ And i hope it gets better. Just because SOME people in your life have treated you like crap doesn't mean that you are. You deserve as much love and respect as the next person. Don't settle for less than the best.  LOVE YOU!!♥ ♥♥♥♥♥", 9950, "None", 0],

As my advice to you, I would like to point out that you don't need to say authobillah every time you quote from the Qur'aan and my proof is that there are many ahadeeth where the prophet or sahabah quoted from Qur'aan, without there being a mention that every time, they said authobillaah.... I think this refers to when u actually recite the Qur'aan, when u say it, as Allaah tells us in the Qur'aan. please verify with your shaykh Also, I find it strange that u say the authobillah in arabic when u quote the Qur;aan in english translation, when that is not Qur'aan, and you say \"Allah says in the Quran: \"You will indeed find them\" etc etc.... whereas Allaah spoke in pure arabic.
