	13113 : ["Absolutely, and I still do. My fellow players and I have each made our own individual worlds that are based on D&D but are completely our own design with our own maps, races, classes, histories etc. We take turns running our own worlds for each other, and we each have a stable of characters that we run in each of the worlds we play in.  These are all campaign games, with epic adventures, political intrigue, world-changing events and deep, intricate plots. We barely use any of the D&D rules at this point. We have our own combat system, our own skill systems, our own unique religions, etc.  We stopped playing the the old style games like you describe with pointless monster killing and loot gathering long ago. Our games are all about plot lines and character arcs now. If you can find a group of like-minded players who are creative and willing to at least HELP to make an individual world or worlds to play in and willing to go outside the traditional D&D or Pathfinder formats, I think you'll find it EXTREMELY gratifying and enjoyable for everyone. During COVID, we've been playing on Discord which has voice, photo, video, and dice-rolling functions that are easy to use. If you'd like more info about how our games work and what kind of work we've done on them, feel free to respond to this with your email address and we can correspond.", 2190, "2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa", 2],

	13133 : ["So I was studying chess with my dad. Out of nowhere he decided to go to the bathroom. When he left, I had urges of putting pawns up my rectum. I was getting so hard just thinking about it. I remember hearing about a g spot up on my anal canal but I never abused it before. So I went shoving. I wanted to test the waters first so I grabbed a pawn and used it as a ********* to see how it felt (I used a black pawn so that no **** stains would show.) It felt amazing.No other sexual pleasure ever came close to this in my life. Immediately, I scooped up all the black pawns and individually pushed each of them slowly up my ***. Each shove gave me a *** sensation that I had never felt before. Now that I had all the pawns in there I wanted to try the mighty king next. As I was reaching for the tall thick juicy muscular black king, my dad came back from his toilet break. He questioned where all his black pawns were. I lied and said that I ate them all. Meanwhile, my asshole couldn't handle the pain and pleasure that the pawns were giving me. I tried to hold it all in but it was too late. My *** let out the biggest shart ever. My underwear was filled with diarrhea and black pawns. The feeling of them slushing in between my *** crack made me let out a moan. While the pawns were moving in between my *** crack however, it was letting out audible clinking noises due to the pawns crashing into other pawns. My dad noticed and yanked down my pants. All the pawns fell on the floor and my *** was leaking ****. for some reason, there was one more pawn up my ***. I clenched my anal canals to push it out and the pleasure that it generated made me moan so loud that I instantly came. After all this, my dad threw me out of the house and told me to never come back.", 2170, "cEp9BgPLaa", 2],
