Sometimes we act crazy and careless, but we know how to protect our inner world and meet danger with a 'clever smile'. When we deal with issues, sometimes a good fortune just steps in and the goal is reached. We are honest and protect truth which is the key for success (even it may not seem so in some situations). Generating right ideas and suggestions to the others is easy. Some think we are too blunt or optimistic/cazy, but lose miserably when we use our intellect and foresight. Exploring the world without being too sensitive and dreaming about stars is a great experience. :)", 8913, "nLHJIIOWaa", -15],

I ask Allah to show you the truth and help you to follow it, and to protect you from Shaytan and his doubts, and the misguidance of the enemies of Islam. The sincere believer knows that one of the things that Allah does is to test His slaves by means of various kinds of trials in order to demonstrate their patience and virtue, and to raise their status, to increase their reward for their steadfastness, and to test their sincerity in following the truth. Among the different types of test are the various means which the mushrikeen may employ to try to make a believer give up his faith, so they may apply psychological pressure to annoy him and make him go back to kufr. As regards your family, I hope that they will not try to stop you continuously for becoming a Muslim. Treat them with kindness and tell them about Islam in beautiful words - maybe they will embrace Islam too. If you are afraid that they may turn against you again and again and if they know about your Islam, then you do not have to tell them or discuss about it. Practice Islam in secret, and do as much as you can of your duties towards Allah. Allah will never forsake you; in fact, He will help you and support you, if you turn to Him. I ask Allah to help you follow the truth and adhere to it. I am prepared to offer any help that I can. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance I extend the warmest of welcomes to you, and offer my congratulations for the new direction you took. May Allah protect you from all evil. Hope this helps, Your brother in Islam.", 8921, "ymaYxD4raa", 0],

Melt the margarine in the microwave for 30 sec (2). Beat the egg in a small bowl (3). Combine the beaten egg, milk, melted margarine/oil and vanilla in a small bowl (4). Make a well in the centre of the large bowl and pour the contents in the small bowl (5).

	77832 : ["real numbers are any and every number between negative infinity and infinity.  The associative law tells us that the order we multiply or add real numbers doesn't matter ie. (a+b)+c=a+(b+c), and (ab)c=a(bc) *it doesn't matter how they associate*  where a, b and c stand for any real number, doesn't matter what you put in for them this law and the others will hold true.  The addition identity is 0, it preserves the 'identity' of the number so a+0=a, and for multiplication it is 1, 1(b)=b.  Transitive means that if you have x=y, and you say that x=3, then y must also =3.  another case of transitive is if a=b+c, and b+c=d then a=d.  Reflexive means a+b=b+a, distributive a(b+c)=ab+ac (in other words it doesn't matter how you distribute a)  and symmetric means a+b=c is the same as c=a+b.

	77844 : ["Tough call...  My first instinct was to say Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo.  I loved that game when I was growing up, then purchased it again as an adult at a flea market, along with a Super Nintendo.  At that time you could still get games for the Super Nintendo at EB and I bought Tetris/Dr. Mario, which I also loved when I was growing up.  Does Dr. Mario count? After considering those games, I moved on to Super Mario 64.  I was in high school when that game and system came out, and my college-aged brother brought it home for the first time over   break the year it was released.  I couldn't get over the scenery, the way Mario moved: crawling on his hands and knees, falling asleep and talking about Italian food, back flipping, wall-climbing, flying, swimming, drowning... I remember sitting up late at night all alone and playing the Jolly Roger level for the first time and being soo scared swimming in that eerily dark water, with that giant eel or whatever (can't remember at the moment) lurking near the bottom.  I can't tell you how many hours I spent playing that game with my then-boyfriend.  We'd take turns getting stars - getting mad when we realized the other person was deliberately taking too long to win a star just so they could play for longer...  Good times! My little brother traded our family Nintendo 64 for a PlayStation (which, by the way, he NEVER lived down) so when I moved out and met my husband we went to a used mart and traded two stereos, a moutain bike, a CD player, and an air conditioner for one used Nintendo 64 and one used Super Mario 64 cartridge.  As far as we were concerned, we made an excellent deal. My husband bought Super Mario Sunshine for the GameCube when it came out, thinking I'd love it as much as I loved Super Mario 64, but he couldn't have been more wrong.  In my opinion they killed the fun of the game by adding that ridiculous water pack.  I think I played it for a total of an hour before I put my controller down and never went back. I can't remember when Mario Kart Double Dash came out... if that was before or after Super Mario Sunshine, but my husband and I used to play that game for hours together!  I remember the first time we went somewhere after one of our Mario Kart marathons and the confusion that set in when we realized the absence of boxes we could drive through and the objects we could throw at other cars.  What gives?  Real life should TOTALLY be like that! Again thinking I would have a lot of fun playing it, my husband bought me the Mario 64 game for the DS.  It didn't stay true enough to the original for me, plus I couldn't really get on board with playing on such a tiny screen so the game was a big fat miss for me.  No worries, our kids enjoyed playing it because they never knew the original the way we did. We got Super Mario Galaxy for our kids for   the year it came out.  I fell in love with the sweetness of the game.  The lumas that you could feed star bits were absolutely adorable.  And the levels that were like candy/cakes: too cute!  Don't get me started on the bee level!  I remember the disoriented feeling I got the first time I walked over the side of a world and I didn't fall off; but instead started walking on the other side - or the world flipped over and I was still walking upright!  Who would have thought?  Amazing...  Mario had come a long way! We also bought Mario Kart Wii when it came out and I didn't like it nearly as much as Double Dash.  I didn't like the character choices, the vehicles, nor did I like the fact that when the computerized characters hit me with stuff, it took me forever to recover, while they recovered in mere seconds.  That made the game too hard...  Am I really whining about losing to the computer?  You bet your butt I am!  Gotta give a girl a little hope to keep her coming back... LOL So...  I guess this is long and I had no idea it would be, but  you asked me to choose my favorite and once I got started, I realized that I just don't think I can do it.  They were all something special IN THEIR TIME and I don't think that it would be fair to choose one over the other. P.S. I didn't really get into the Mario games for the original Nintendo.  The two Nintendos in our house belonged to each of my brothers and they weren't really into Mario when they were younger...  One of them loved Zelda, and all of the games in that series; the other liked games like Contra.  Mario didn't become a part of my family until the Super Nintendo came out.", 8925, "lO2Nvj81aa", 3],
