	98747 : ["“Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky. Those who lead many others to do what is right will be like the stars for ever and ever”. Daniel 12:3 (NIV) Just because we call ourselves Christians doesn't mean we always do the right thing. As long as we're here on earth we'll always face trials, struggles, and temptations. The enemy of Christ cheers for our demise. This enemy will set up opportunities for us to fail by tempting us to prosper through less than honorable means. he knows that our sin separates us from God and negatively impacts our witness to others. The book of Daniel says, “those who lead many others to do what is right…” To lead, we must be out in front, setting the pace, holding the bar high. As Christian Professionals, our role is not to run with the pack – the pack of today's culture, \"conventional wisdom”, or self-centered glorification. Our call is to resist the temptations to lie, cheat, or to act less than honorably, and instead take the role as Godly leaders in our businesses and communities.  When our focus is always on doing the right things for the right reasons, displaying integrity and character in all things, and then encouraging and leading others in the same manner, we can be assured of our place like one of the stars as we continue to put our trust and faith in Jesus Christ. w Jesus is the only way to heaven there is no other way.
