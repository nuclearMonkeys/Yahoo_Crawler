	3706 : ["If it was 30 milliamps through your body, yes, it would kill you. But it's not. The current depends on the resistance of the circuit. That figure of 30 milliamps comes from measuring whatever circuit you got that figure from.  If you added a human being in series in that circuit, the resistance of the circuit would be far, far higher, and the current would be tiny. A current of a few milliamps across your heart, can kill you. But it takes a much higher voltage to drive that much current through the resistance of a human body.  ", 621, "NpPGVqn9aa", 1],
	3707 : ["Most people can not feel 24Vdc. Skin resistance is about 10K Ohms so 24V can not cause more than 2.4mA through a human body. It would require about 30mA*10KOhms=300 Volts to cause a body current of 30mA. Safety depends on the fusing or breaker. An unfused 30mA supply may cause a fire if it is loaded/shorted to, say 300mA, while a 1 Amp supply can operate safely at that current. But in many cases, a low power fault condition like 24V*30mA=0.72 Watts can be safely dissipated without much protection. It's important to understand that the current rating is just the nominal operating limit and unlikely to be the actual current.", 621, "eU1B5khyaa", 1],

	3718 : ["No. When the circuit activates due to a change in temperature, the 555 output will start switching between 0V and near the battery voltage. The exact voltage cannot be known exactly as a nominally \"9V\" battery starts at that and gradually reduces in voltage as it is used, going down to around 6V before being considered totally flat. And the circuit does not give the specifications or current rating of the buzzer, so the current that takes is unknown - though less that 200mA for it to be driven directly from a 555, if I remember right.

That hasn't happened even in countries like Sweden that did nothing their infection rate was still too low and not even close to herd immunity.  The other part of that is that when lots of people get infected then the chances of mutations are more than likely to occur. The more the virus circulates out in public the greater the chances it can mutate to a more deadly virus or more infectious virus.  We need to take public health measures in order to buy time for the vaccine to be given.
