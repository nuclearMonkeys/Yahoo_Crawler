	91598 : ["The UK isn't having the coldest winter since 1683.  We're having the coldest December since 1890. The average temperature for the UK so far this year (provisional data to 29th Dec) is -0.6°C, this is some 5.3°C below the long-term mean, the previous record being –0.8°C.   We can safely say that this Dec will be the coldest since 1890 even though the month hasn't quite finished – it would require a heatwave to break out in the next few hours for it to be anything but.  However, we have to wait until the end of Feb to determine how cold the winter has been (meteorologically speaking winter is the months of Dec, Jan and Feb, chronologically it's 23:38 on 21st Dec 2010 to 23:21 on 20th Mar 2011). Whilst the UK has indeed been very cold it is something of an exception.  The bulk of the planet has been experiencing conditions that are considerably warmer than normal.  Here's the last full month of global surface temperatures from NASA   you can see that the yellows, oranges and reds that indicate warming clearly dominate. Ironically the reason for the cold weather in the UK may indeed be due to global warming, although we can't say with any degree of certainty. Here's a summary explanation.  Arctic weather is dictated by cyclonic and anticyclonic pressure systems that sit over Siberia and Northern Canada, the circumpolar winds blow clockwise and ocean currents in the Arctic also move clockwise. A consequence of global warming is that the Arctic sea-ice extent has significantly reduced, at the moment it's at it's lowest known level for the time of year.     Less ice coverage means that the reflectance of the Arctic is reduced, the exposed darker waters absorb more heat energy from the Sun causing the Arctic to warm significantly.  Here's a global map of warming over the last 10 years    The warmer conditions disrupt air streams causing a reversal of wind directions and ocean currents, an event known as an Arctic Dipole Anomaly and something that had long been predicted as a consequence of global warming.   The disruption feeds cold air down into the surrounding areas of the mid to high northerly latitudes resulting in some places experiencing periods of prevailing Arctic conditions with the associated cold weather. See this question and answers for more details about events in the Arctic…   Incidentally, whilst the UK may go on to experience the coldest winter since 1683/4; the world as a whole is on the brink of recording it's hottest ever year ", 9401, "AA10993476", 3],

If he does have antifreeze poisoning you have to induce vomiting. \"TREATING FOR CONTACT WITH TOXINS OR POISONS If you think your cat may have been poisoned, first try to identify the poison. Most products containing chemicals are labeled for identification. Read the label. If this does not give you a clue to the plant's possible toxicity, call the emergency room of your local hospital and ask for information from the Poison Control Center. Alternately, call the National Animal Poison Control Center at (800)548-2423 or (900)680-0000. This hotline is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There is a credit card charge for the consultation. The most important step in treatment is to eliminate the poison from your cat's stomach by making the cat vomit. In certain cases, induction of vomiting is contraindicated. For more information, see How to Induce Vomiting earlier in this chapter. HOW TO DELAY OR PREVENT ABSORPTION Activated charcoal is used to coat the bowel and delay or prevent absorption. In most cases it is difficult to administer activated charcoal to a cat without first placing a stomach tube. Mix one part activated charcoal to six parts cold water. Give four to eight teaspoons. Follow 30 minutes later with Milk of Magnesia, 1/2 teaspoon per five pounds body weight. Placing a stomach tube in a cat is not without risk. The best advice for a severely ill cat is to induce vomiting and then proceed directly to the nearest veterinary facility. In the less severely ill cat, coat the bowel with milk, egg whites or vegetable oil. The dose of vegetable oil is two teaspoons for the average-sized cat. It should be added to the feed, but not force-fed by mouth because this could lead to aspiration pneumonia. If your cat has a poisonous substance on the skin or coat, flush the area with copious amounts of water for five minutes. Wearing gloves, give the cat a complete bath in lukewarm, not cold, water, as described in the SKIN chapter. Even if not irritating the skin, the substance should be removed. Otherwise, the cat may lick it off and swallow it. Soak gasoline and oil stains with mineral or vegetable oil (do not use paint thinner or turpentine). Work in well. Then wash with a mild soap. Rub in cornstarch or flour. A cat beginning to show signs of nervous system involvement is in deep trouble. At this point, get your cat to a veterinarian as quickly as possible. Try to bring a sample of vomitus, or better yet the actual poison in the original container. Do not delay to administer first aid. If the cat is convulsing, unconscious or not breathing, see CPR.\"", 9406, "lvAEDKPBaa", -1],

It's not like we can do anything about the kids in the orphanages, we can't all go out and adopt them, and no matter what -- orphanages are always going to be around as long as there are unplanned pregnancies and mother's who are unable to care for their child. At least they are being cared for and not being abused. I still see a lot about anorexia and anti-abuse things around, and sponsor-a-child ads are still on TV all the time.  I, too, have had a drinking problem in the past, I've had anorexia, I've had bulimia, I've had depression, I've self-harmed, I've been a smoker and I've done drugs. None of which stemmed from being abused, I wasn't - I had a good home life, I just went down the wrong path and got caught up with the wrong people. If I didn't get the help that I needed, and if I didn't have the motivation to stop from things like ads, signs, texts, and so on. God knows where I would be right now, I had lost everything.

But, no, it's not something journalist write about because people like drama, and unless something crazy is going on at the homes, there isn't much of a story. They care about the teenagers smoking and drinking, because as you said later about your self, a lot of those teenagers deal with the problems you seem to think are being given attenchion, and use drugs as a way to cope with the abuse, or deaths, or bullying, ext ext. Also, people aren't doing as much human traffiking as they used to.

	91631 : ["First, make a decision if you want to believe \"blogo-science\" like Trevor saying \"The amount of warming we've witnessed as a consequence of human activities is a little under 1Â°C. When put into context this doesn't have a huge impact on the actual temperatures.\" compared to the scientists that study the earth and its climate. They are all worried stiff, because the amount of CO2 we are releasing is accelerating. And a few degrees on average makes a big difference- just like a few % makes a difference to your bank account or superannuation fund. All of the weather factors mentioned by Trevor are- in the opinions of expert scientists not an anonymous blogger- caused by global warming, and have been predicted for ages. Also, some of the pollution we create is cooling the planet, and saving us from all the effects of CO2 based warming. So, CO2 is pushing up warming, dust and gunk in the air is pushing it down a bit. Doesn't mean the CO2 is not causing warming! Some of the feedback mechanisms are \"positive feedback\"- sort of like a bushfire, heat causes a small fire, then that fire causes more heat which makes the fire bigger. There are some of these climate change feedbacks which could cut in and make things a lot lot worse than the 2-4 degrees C rise currently expected (e.g. Arctic ice never recovers, exposed water absorbs more heat, so less ice next year). Anyway, the whole thing about global wwarming is that it is *global*. Some parts of the globe will still experience cold snaps, while other parts are hotter. The cold snap this winter is because the Arctic winds which normally keep the Arctic's \"fridge door\" closed and cold air trapped over the north pole have shut down. So the fridge door is open, the fridge is hotter (many areas close to the N pole are 20C warmer than average), while in front of the fridge door it is cooler. On average it is warmer, and 2010 is going to be the 1st or 2nd warmest year on record. The cold snaps are predicted as the amount of ice decreases in the Arctic. The attached link to satellite map of temperatures shows that while there are small areas of colder weather (in an area that is highly populated, so gets disrupted a lot, and reported about a lot), that huge areas have also been a lot warmer at the same time (low population areas, so don't make the news as much, not a lot of airports and travelers in Alaska compared to London!).
