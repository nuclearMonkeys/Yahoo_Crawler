The problem is that in the last 100 years , people have been making their homes there in large numbers. For millions of year fires had no impact like this.What has happened is that by suppressing fires, the twigs and rubbish on the forest floor builds up and when it does catch fire, it's far more intense than nature intended and the big trees catch alight too, adding massively to the ferocity. All man made but nothing to do with climate change. Btw. Beware of cause and effect. Fires produce CO2 so more fires = more CO2, not the other way round.", 5973, "HdLKZwkyaa", -1],

Several times in Earth's history the whole planet was ice free, and diverse life flourished.Any time there is an alteration in nature, there are bound to be hiccups for the interim. Now if you believe that humans are the proximate of climate 'disaster', then what do you propose is the fix? There can be only ONE fix - reduce the world's obscene overpopulation. Less people = less CO2 generated. Less people = less methane generated too. Altering our habits just DELAYS any purported human caused climate change. And that is just treating the symptoms, not the problem. The Earth goes through natural climate change at certain intervals, usually every 25K years or so. We also have pole reversals that directly affect our climate. Not a thing we can do about either of those. Look up the year without a summer - one VOLCANO altered the planet's climate. Right now, there is one in Alaska spewing ash, CO2, etc 20,000 feet into the atmosphere.
