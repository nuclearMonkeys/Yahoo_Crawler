But the unluckiest injury story of the season as to be Bradley Dack(Blackburn Talisman) Did his ACL Dec '19 out for 12 months. He was making his third start v Brentford(March 12 '21) after scoring in his 2 previous starts(really finding form) When he did his Knee in the other leg, that will be 2 ACL op's for him.

	32875 : ["Two thoughts come to mind: 1) The 3.5 billion Euros each team will get to sign on is a huge factor. Period. It dwarfs any domestic and UEFA competition money. UEFA acting like they care about the game are having a laugh. They don't care; they came up with the Champions League concept in the early 1990's when there was discussion of something similar. 2) Those that don't learn from history repeat it. In the early 1990's rugby league in Australia was doing very well, and along came a 'Super League' concept that would form a competition with the UK league (now also named Super League, which is a joke since it's really a bunch of teams along the M62 and a couple other oddballs). Ridiculous money? Check. Financed by questionable people? Just the Murdoch empire, so check. Clubs being threatened if they left to join the runaway comp? Check. What happened was 2 years of two leagues running before the Australian teams were merged into a single NRL entity and a couple clubs becoming a joint venture. So assuming that the clubs threatening to leave do so. After a season or two, UEFA will work the the domestic leagues to re-absorb the clubs, and you'll see an expanded champions league comp. You might have a few clubs form a joint venture (Chelsea-Fulham, perhaps Crystal Palace-MK Dons, maybe Everton-Tranmere Rovers). The breakaway clubs will probably have to pay a fine and/or forfeit UEFA prize money for a season as part of their agreement to re-join. The Premier League and Serie A will have less promotion/relegation (can easily see the Premier League going to a one up/one down, or simply ring-fence).", 5008, "Pc0QjrQ4aa", 0],

Fried potato “chips” were a common staple food in Britain since Sir Walter Raleigh's time, when he first brought back the potato to Britain from the New World! Charles Dickens referred to them as “chips of potato, fried in a reluctant drop of oil”. The term “French fries” is a stupid American name, it isn't French and it describes very thin greasy things that no self respecting “chip” eater would even look at! As for “Crisps”, once again you have it wrong! A “crisp” is by its very name meant to be “crisp”! Not soft in the centre like a potato chip! It isn't rocket science you know! But then, what can we expect from a race of inbreds living in America who call small bread things they cook to eat with their meal (bread rolls in the sane, educated world) BISCUITS, when the whole world knows that biscuits are hard and may have chocolate on them. Or raisins. Stupid Americans of course (because they are a stupid race) have renamed these as COOKIES! Cookies indeed! They are BISCUITS! Get it right you inbred buffoon!", 5025, "IWG19RdDaa", 0],
