Apocalypse started because of abortions and mark of the beast documents. Antichrist Jew Lenin legalized abortion in Soviet Union. Social Security Number (Name of the beast that the beast gives you instead of your baptism name) was legalized by antichrist Jew Roosevelt. Antichrist Pope Francis approves microchipping and gays. Antichrist Patriarch Kiril of Russia tells people to listen to the antichrist Commie Jew gov't. His KGB name is agent Mikhailov. He sold alcohol and cigarettes. Jewish KGB's agent Mikhailov (Kiril) helped Jews with ecumenism (one world religion under the antichrist Jews). Now, True Church is going catacomb as the Last True Patriarch Irenaios of Jerusalem blessed a few years ago. Holy Fire stopped when Irenaios was unlawfully removed. Imposter antichrist fake Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophilos 3rd is faking Holy Fire now. Antichrist Bill Gates wants to chip you using vaccines. Coronavirus is a scam; 5G kills people and gov't blames on it COVID-19; gov't will kill people with 5G in November and will blame it on COVID and will mandate vaccines. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take plastic grey card World Passport with no name on it; but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk will press secret button to administer the unforgivable green triple six by isotope rays (according to last prophet Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov).

The machinery to do this has improved enormously in the years he's been doing this, but older fragile books and papers still have to be laid flat on the scanning bed with cotton-gloved hands, scanned, then the page carefully turned, taking care not to break the glue in the binding. Depending on the gutter (white space between the print and the binding) depth, the printed portion of the page may not be laid completely flat, the scan imperfect--but it's legible as  PDF.

	4794 : ["I'm in another country, and confused. Does the UK library system prevent patrons from borrowing certain books? On what basis (i.e., age, criminal record)? Do they do inter-library loans, so a book one library doesn't own can be lent by one that has it? If your complaint is that the library collection doesn't have all the materials you need to read about a particular subject in depth, that's not because they're treating you like a baby, protecting you from the Big Bad Ideas. It's because there's little demand for those books. Library buyers do amazing contortions to stretch the book buying budget as far as it will go, but they can't possibly buy (or shelve) everything a patron might want. University libraries often have more depth in nonfiction, but may limit access to enrolled students or those with special permission. That leaves you, the person who wants to read at depth, responsible for buying the materials you can't borrow. This has always been the case. It's not paternalism, just money.", 808, "None", 5],

Then look to the 5 senses smell, taste, touch, hearing, smell. Then think about you're character how does it make them feel? What would they notice about this night. My focus would be on the moon and lake because I love water and the moon always draws me in. I can just stare at it for hours. My Mum would would notice the plants because she loves gardening.
