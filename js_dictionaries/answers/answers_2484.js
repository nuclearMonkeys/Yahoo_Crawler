If he has a urinary tract infection then he won't be able to help it and all teh training and suggestions in the world won't change a thing. 2 -Lose the pee pads. This is a sure fire way to CONFUSE your dog because what they learn is that it is ok to pee inside. They do not udnerstand that there is something magical about the pee pads that makes it ok. 3 - Take him outdoors often so he has the chance to pee outside. When he does, praise him in a happy voice and maybe even give him a treat. If you can take the paper / throw rug / whatever that he peed on in the house and put it where you want him to go outside that will go a long way in teaching him to go outdoors. 4 - Do not leave him unsupervised in the house. Keep an eye on him at all times and if you see him sniffing like he is about to \"go\" get him outside. Play with him a little too, otherwise he will get the idea that he is being punished for peeing and / or peeing outside and that it the last thing you want. 5 - Never ever scold him for peeing indoors. If you do all that will happen is he will figure out it's a bad idea for you to see him peeing and then he won't pee outdoors when you go on walks. He'll also get good at being sneaky about peeing indoors so he can avoid the punishment. 6 - Be patient. Now that he has the bad habit, changing it won't happen overnight. Dogs don't suddenly \"get it\" and then act perfect. Instead what will happen is that there will be fewer and fewer accidents and he'll get it right more and more often until finally he'll be housebroken. It could take about two months. Be patient and consistent and good luck!", 11060, "EknAT5dBaa", 0],

One could say that the fact that our universe and every thing we know has signs of a divine creator, due to the complexity and extreme precision in which was needed for it all to exist.  But the most important thing is one would have to be willing to accept that all this is in fact proof of verification. One would have to be willing to look at it all with out prejudice and put preconceived notions aside to make an informed decision. A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. That means I can not make you believe you have to make up your own mind.

	130041 : ["Sounds like your dog is peeing out of dominance and marking territory, along with not properly knowing where to go pee. Bad combonation, and will make it hard for you. I would suggest crate training him, and letting him out to pee every couple hours. The max amount of hours a dog can stay in a crate is 8 hours. I wouldn't allow your dog \"free\" access anywhere in your house. When you allow your dog to have free access to roam where ever he wants, he will pee. Your dog should be in one of three places inside the house: 1.) In a Crate 2.) Leashed to you at all times 3.) In a puppy pen/ x-pen This will limit his \"free space\" and you can properly keep an eye on him, and take him outside and correct him when you do see him eliminating in an inappropriate place. When he's become 95% reliable with his potty training, I would then keep a leash on him but not attached. Let him drag the leash around. That way you can still grab his leash if he was to go potty and quickly take him outside. The idea is not to pick him up, because you want to make him \"think\" he walked outside to go potty. To answer your other questions: 1.) Dry food (as long as it's a high quality kibble) or even feeding raw are excellent to help keep your dog's teetch clean. If you feed wet food, sometimes it can deteriorate your dogs teeth. Biscuits, soft treats are always nice for training. If you decide to give raw a try, makes sure you do TONS of research!!!!! Research is very important in feeding raw! 2.)Yes you can use a blow dryer to dry your dog's hair. Make sure you have the dryer at least 2 inches away from their skin, as you don't want to burn them. 3.)Your dog should be walked every single day/ couple times a day, because you have a terrier. Terriers require more exercise to burn off their higher energy. You can walk your dog in the snow, but I would invest in dog shoes for their feet and maybe even a sweater to keep him warm. If you can't go out, let's say you have a blizzard or something, then walk him on a treadmill, if you have one. 4.) Use your best judgement! If you think the water is too hot, chances are it is. If you think too cold, chances are it is. ", 11060, "RZJ4nbT5aa", 0],
