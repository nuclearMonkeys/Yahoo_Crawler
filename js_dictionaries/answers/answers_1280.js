I think it's more likely a predator smelled the blood, stalked the foal and carried it off somewhere.  Do you have cougars, coyotes or wild dogs in your area? Was there stallion turned out with your mare or something?  And if so, why? _______________________ EDIT to your EDIT: You said: \"All my horses are in a field together,I can't keep them apart. There has never been a problem with this in the past.\" It's called a fence!  (Or a gelding, take your pick.)  Now you have a dead foal because you \"can't keep them apart\"...though I imagine you'll have plenty of foals to make up for it, since you are breeding indiscriminately.  YOU CANNOT PASTURE STALLIONS WITH MARES AND FOALS.  Ever.  Were you planning on keeping everyone together as one happy family if the foal didn't die?  It's probably a blessing the foal died so quickly...at least it wouldn't have had to been thrown in the air between your stallion's teeth for days before its neck finally snapped. Please either geld your horse or else educate yourself on a) proper fencing and stabling techniques for stallions;  b) care of a mare in foal  c)  care of a newborn foal  d)  stallion and mare-in-foal behavior. ___ EDIT 2 - So, you don't breed horses but you've had over 25 foals?  Did the stork bring them?   And as for not knowing any better, well, that is why we say \"educate\".  You have to learn this stuff yourself...then you won't need someone else to tell you. In some cases with well-adjusted horses and enough room, everyone can be \"one happy family\".  However, in general terms, it is not a good practice.  The majority of stallions nowadays are sadly anything but well-adjusted and besides, why take the chance of waiting to see if everyone gets along or not?  Minimizing risks, potential problems and accidents as much as possible..that is part of what good horsemanship is all about.", 8516, "cSqx1DxKaa", 24],

Face it, the way you run your horses is much more natural than hand serving or AI. Anyway the point is your foal has disappeared. So if your mare was full term where did it go? I would suggest that the foal was stillborn and a predator has taken it away. It will not necessarily leave hair especially if the foal was premature at all. This foals have little hair and are known as slinkies. Where I live stillborn foals are often taken foxes or wild dogs.  The other possibilty is it did get up and moved elsewhere on the property before dieing. If you breed long enough, you will have a few foals die for no good reason, let alone the ones that are born with immediately life threatening problems.  Better luck with your future foals.", 8516, "ZrxxCCEwaa", 1],
	69552 : ["Is there just one stallion in the field? If so, then perhaps the foal had some kind of problem.  It is instinct for the stallion to kill a foal who isn't healthy because it will not be strong enough to keep up with the herd.  Maybe the foal couldn't get up or was born sickly.   If there is more than one stallion, even if the other stallions are very young, one could have felt threatened that the foal was not his.  It's called infanticide.  They do it because they can't be sure if the foal is theres when there are other stallions around, and they only want their genes to pass on, so they kill the foal to be sure no other stallion's genes are being passed on. Also, was the foal by the stallion that is in the field with your mare? If not, then the same applies as above...the stallion can't be sure if its his, so he kills it.  But, if there is only one stallion, the foal belonged to him, and the foal was healthy, then I truly don't know why he would have killed it...it's really not a natural thing in a \"perfect\" herd situation...otherwise the wild horse population would rapidly die out because no new babies would ever reach maturity to reproduce. Edit::: I forgot to add, though others have already said it, that even if the stallion did kill the foal, the body would have been left...so likely something else carried it off.  We have coyotes in my area and will not let our mares foal outside, even if it is more natural.  It wouldn't take long for the blood to attract any predators. EDIT (again)::: I also have to agree with Lusitano....you've had 25 foals..you're a breeder...maybe not a good one, or even an ok one, which is sad because your animals are suffering for it...but by now you should know what's going on..responsible people educate THEMSELVES before they do anything, especially if it involves another life.", 8516, "None", 2],

	69560 : ["Mares are supposed to be separated during foaling for this reason. Sometimes other mares will do this too. Another thing that can happen is that the other horses can interfere with the imprinting process and the mare will not accept the foal thereafter. Simply put, separate the mare for foaling and get the gelding out of the pasture with the young foals. Some geldings can never be trusted around foals even at the two and three month stage. Oh and the gelding was not showing the foal who was boss. It is instinctive stallion behavior to kill all foals not sired by them. Thus the gelding moved in on the herd of mares, considered the mares 'his new herd', so now instinct is taking over and he will try to kill all the new foals. This reserves more resources for his offspring (and yes I know he can't have any but nature doesn't).", 8516, "YmigteDGaa", 0],
	69561 : ["Stallions can kill and will kill foals - under certain circumstances.  I believe what pony is talking about is on youtube.  It was not the father of the foal that killed the foal, but the stallion from a rival herd.  The foal could not stand up. Stallions can attack the foal that is not theirs - this is an instinct to preserve their genes and get rid of rivals.  They are much more likely to attack easy prey - weak or deformed foal. That being said, it is not common and highly uncommon for a stallion to kill his own foal.  Personally, I do not believe having your whole herd out together is a bad thing - it is how it is in the wild.   If the stallion did kill the foal, he would have just left it and you would have been able to find it.  It is very likely a wild dog or other predator took the foal away to eat.  Check around your property - I do not see any predator taking the animal to far, just far enough that he would not get stomped by a horse while he ate. Likely there would be some signs of a scuffle somewhere also, though - so check for that and for drag marks.  I do not think that mares will hide their foals, like deer and cow do, but this could be the other possibility, though unlikely.  a doe will have a fawn set somewhere and stay there while she wanders off.  This is helped by fawn camouflage and the fact that fawns do not have a scent - so I doubt this is the case with the mare.
