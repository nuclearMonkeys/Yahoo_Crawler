Newcastle have been the best team in the Championship by a mile and they'll stay up reasonably easily. Nolan, Colochini, S.Taylor, Harper, Enrique, and Carroll (w*nker) are all players that will fit into the Premier league with ease. And they'll be buying more players as well this summer. West Brom will be down next season. Dorrans is a superb player with tremendous skill and the ability to change a game in the blink of an eye. Roman Bednar's a magnificent striker and Chris Brunt's a very good midfielder. However they also have many poor players. Their defence will be exploited in a higher league. A quick return. As for the Play-off teams: Nottingham Forest: Would struggle. A very efficient attacking team, with a solid back 4, but very little Premier League experience. COuld stay up, but would need a lot of luck as well as investment. Cardiff City: Would bomb. Should they not go up they could fall into administration. Dave Jones would have no money to spend, and their defence this season has been one of the worst in the Championship. Plus their midfield lacks creativity without Peter Wittingham. They'd do terribly in the Prem. Leicester City: They've done really well to get to the play-offs, but they don't have a single Premier League standard player. The squad is a Championship squad, and they would come right back down should they get promoted. Blackpool: I love Blackpool. But if you take Charlie Adam out of that squad they don't have anything like a Premier League player. Great achievement, and I think they'll actually win the play-offs. But they'd do really badly in the Premier League.", 11488, "None", 0],

Just be aware - and make them aware - that if any of your bridesmaids are heavy or very tall that there could be extra charges for length or plus-size on top of the base price of the dress.  Example - - My girls chose different dresses and two needed plus size so their $208 dress became $260.  That didn't impact them directly because I paid for their dresses, but the add-ons can be significant for some designers. Another option would be for you to select the designer, fabric, color and length and let the girls choose their own dresses - that will give them a little more control over how much they spend (and do your best to choose a modestly priced designer not one where all dresses start at $300).", 11486, "caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa", 2],

If your wedding is 3 weeks away and your registry list is still devoid of entries, then let it go. Many people look at a registry but then do not tell the cashier that they are buying off the registry so the gifts don't get recorded. Some people look at your registry but they have a charge account elsewhere or can buy things lower price elsewhere. Other people don't like being told what to buy and by registering, they feel like you're telling them what to do. Some people prefer to give cash. Some people wait until the day before a payday to buy. Stop checking the registry. Stop concentrating on your gifts. Start thinking about gracious ways to be a good hostess to your guests. Start thinking about writing thank you notes as gifts begin to arrive by mail. If you haven't totally finished sending out thank you notes from your shower, do it NOW!! If I had attended your shower and taken a gift and you haven't sent me a thank you note yet, I would not be buying you a wedding gift. I'm not saying you have not done this. I am just mentioning things that are far more important than checking up on your guests to see if they've bought you a big present yet.
