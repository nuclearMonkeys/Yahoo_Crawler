But if you need financing for the equipment in your shop like cash registers, softwares, salon stuff we do financing for stuff like that all the time.

We get funding for businesses and franchises thru banks that have programs designed for exactly that so we get as good as deals as anybody. We have funded many of these deals, we are funding a guy right now that is opening a Taco Bell. Our office has a great support staff (processors) and we communicate help you every step of the way. We have an \"A rating with the BBB. The reason I bring up the BBB \"A\" rating is because you need to go with an honest company. People come to us after being burned by banks who are slow or bad money lenders that promise deals take down payments but then dont follow thru. If that happens people complain the to BBB and it will list the number of complaints. The last client that compared us to someone else found out the other company had 27 complaints. We had zero! Of course he went with us and we were proud to help him.  Here's a link to our Better Business Bureau rating: The first thing I need to do is get a profile of your business by asking a few questions to see what options you have, and how much flexibility you have.You can just write the answers in below and shoot it back to me. I know some stuff you dont know yet but just we can fill that part in later.Then when I get in the office tomorrow I will match your profile with some of our programs and get back to you with your best options.  1.

	138419 : ["There are a couple of ways to do this. The most difficult is to start from scratch with your savings and a loan against your collateral, which you would then use to find a place, buy fixtures and inventory, etc.  Second-hardest is to buy a franchise like Trade Secrets. The advantages to a ready-made business are the same as their disadvantages. In the beginning owners appreciate having so many of the details already settled, but some eventually outgrow the limitations on them. A franchise isn't very different from being an employee of the company as far as authority is concerned.  The easier way, especially if it's your first time out to the game, is to buy equity in an existing store or find a partner in advance and proceed as above to either start or buy a business the owner is selling. That way there's also a shared burden, someone to commiserate with, someone to watch the phones, etc. If the company grows and you decide to get out, what your buy-out is worth will be determined by the percentage of equity you hold in the business's value.  So. Check out the Small Business Administration at   and SCORE Small Business Counselors at   for more guidance and ears to bounce this off of. Both have financing resources to help you.

Just because someone is a Republican, it doesn't mean that ALL Republicans thinks the same way as that one person, and the same goes for Democrats, so there is bound to be a disagreement between people.
