	105003 : ["What Sharia Law means? is it law of Judaism the law of Talmud, Bible, Quran, Geeta (Hinduism)? Fake Patriarch Kirill and other fake church leaders signed a document in 2006 where it says that all religions worship the same supreme being; anathema. Last Orthodox Patriarch is Patriarch Irenaios of Jerusalem. Major heresy of the last century was that the name of the Creator doesn't have anything to  do with the Creator.  American pronunciation of the word \"God/god\" is \"gaad\" which means Satan in Ruski. Ruski words for \"English\" and \"angelic\" are very similar; Satan was an angel. Read only Bible that is translated by theologians. John the Baptist ate only carobs and honey. Eating bugs like locusts leads to demon possession and three stands of DNA. 666ed people eat GMO food (which is food with bug DNA).  Ecumenism has 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Roman Catholic icons are drawn from naked people.  Orthodox icons are inspired by the Holy Spirit.  When you look directly into the eyes of the figure depicted on an Orthodox icon, energy is coming your way, that is, you get healed.  If you look at Buddhist-Roman Catholic-Satanic icons, you get the passions from the person depicted.  There has been a study done by Ruski scientists. When an Orthodox Christian crosses regular water, it becomes better. When an Orthodox Christian priest crosses regular water, it becomes even better than if regular Orthodox Christian crosses the water. This is the usual.  Now, we are in the end days. In some churches (that have been infiltrated by the antichrist's minions), antichrist's blood is served. Also, scanners put 666 on foreheads at the entrance. Theotokos Virgin Mary pushed down the altars at these churches (invisible to humans). Icons in these churches are changed to Satanic-Buddhist-Roman Catholic type instead of normal. Water (instead of becoming better) becomes worse when \"blessed\" in these \"churches\".  Orthodox icons must have correct hand signals.  Correct blessing hand means Alpha and Omega  AND  Iesus Christous (Jesus Christ in Greek and Church Slavonic).  Incorrect hand signals are signifying the antichrist.  Also, do you see the scrolls on the Orthodox icons?  They will be opened when antichrist will be coming to town.  These scrolls will reveal everything about the antichrist.  Note also, calendar must be Orthodox, not Roman Catholic.  During the 8th \"wolf\" Council, antichrist will kill those priests who  disagree with him. Other priests will worship him when a bird dies at  his feet.  Pelageya of Ryazan said that there will only be seven churches left in the end days.  Vaccines, IVs, tooth fillings/implants, cosmetics, medicaments, certain foods and drinks, etc. contain nanochips and/or cells of aborted fetuses; intake of which leads to demon possession.  Give back your documents to the gov't and live in Ural Mountains or Alaska.  Heresy leads to loss of love. Rapture is a heresy. You have to hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666. Reject globalism, UFOs, documents, vaccines, ecumenism, cities, technology, etc.  The only true Christians are people who rejected mark of the beast documents and drink blood of Jesus.  Note, some churches serve antichrist's blood. So, choose wisely.  Read the Book of Revelation.  It's all clear now anyway if you have wisdom to  understand that 2 elongated lines on a barcode is a 6.  Each barcode has 3 double elongated lines.  Hence, it spells 666.  Barcode on documents leads to temporary hell.  Barcode on one's body by isotope rays leads to permanent hell.  According to Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov, 666ed people will  first hide the green 666 with durags and long sleeves, but then openly will walk  with shiny green 666 on their foreheads or wrists.  The Most Holy Trinity gives you a name during baptism.  Devil gives you an anti-name during anti-baptism.  Barcode is Druid black magic curse and a form of mark of the beast just like Social Security.  People who took any number (which is an anti-name given during anti-baptism by the beast) on documents or in computer go to temporary hell;  but those who receive green 666 (given with World Passport with no name on it) on forehead or wrist go to permanent hell.  How not to go to hell?  Give back all these anti-name anti-baptism documents back to the beast  by writing to appropriate authorities.  If authorities refuse to cancel these anti-names, then write again (up to three times).  If you wrote to the gov't three times about it, but gov't refused, then The Most Holy Trinity  will not send you to hell.  Don't take the microchip. If you already took it, get rid of it because microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take the World Passport (grey plastic card with no name on it).  Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Those who reject 666 will go to heaven. Also, their direct ancestors will be saved from hell.  All who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or sign themselves with sign of the cross during WW3 will be saved. War in Ukraine will last two years (2014 - 2016). Then WW3 will start. Then Tsar (revealed by resurrected Seraphim of Sarov) will come to power in Russia to protect people from the antichrist. Antichrist will allow all sin. Don't sin. The Most Holy Trinity  is merciful but 666 is not forgivable. 666 is given with grey plastic card.  Food stores, prisoners, and police will 666 people too. Don't get new documents. Don't get any surgeries. Don't eat meat. Don't eat fast food. Don't eat junk food. Pray the Jesus prayer.  Don't go into UFO to be healed by evil demons. Feed the pigeons. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael. Reject vaccines. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape mark of the beast; leave all electronics behind so that you can't be tracked.  Antichrist's next target is the Statue of Liberty.  One big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse.  You use your spirit to talk to The Most Holy Trinity.  Demons attack soul and body.  Demons live inside clones. Jesus died for all sins committed by all.  Jesus said that you have to drink His blood.  All people have soul, body, and spirit.  In animals, blood substitutes soul.  That's why you're forbidden to drink animal blood.  Animals don't have spirit.  You're forbidden to drink human blood (like during blood transfusion) because sins transfer.  You're told to drink blood of Jesus (because He's sinless) so that your sins are forgiven.  Dogs are not allowed in your home and your church because the Holy Spirit will leave.  One can receive mark of the beast because of cats; so, stay away from cats.  Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from hell. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Since antichrist (born to a 12th generation prostitute, flying, big-nailed, gloved, pale-faced, red-eyed, Satan-possessed since he's 12 years old, homosexual man from the tribe of Dan, who wears blue robe over left shoulder while red/pink robe is underneath just like Jesus, and is surrounded by demons but people see angels of light) is around, there is no need for disputes.

	105006 : ["What other posters say is partially true, but it all boils down to revenue. Astroworld was old, and revenues continue to fall from year to year. The park was not worth keeping. Two things killed the park, and one led to another. The first was the \"season pass.\" For the price of two daily admissions you could get in for a whole season. That led to a lot of working Mom's dumping their kids off there for the day while schools were out. Gangbangers hung out there as well, and the park became difficult to manage. Hell, they had METAL DETECTORS at the entrance. The park didn't used to need it. \"A\" led to \"B\" which lead to a lot of people staying away. In addition, the single day admission was too high for for Joe Blow to justify visiting from Katy or Sealy once a year. My wife and I went the last day it was open. The many coats of paint failed to hide the poor maintenance and the gritty feel. While we were there when the park opened that day, we could only stay for three hours until the hoodlums showed up and started pushing through lines, talking smack, and doing those stupid gang gestures at other people. I miss the Astroworld of old, but it is gone and it is never coming back. It truly pains me to say that, as I had a lot of great memories there in the 70s and 80s. I hear rumors from hopeful people that some other theme park owner (Disney, Universal Studios) is \"secretly\" buying up land here. The rumors are not true. If Houston couldn't support an established theme park, then they certainly won't support another one. It isn't worth the investment.", 9911, "None", 6],

When one performs his duty to God in a selfless manner for the good of all that is when he can forge a much closer relationship than when he only sits and reads scriptures or just does penance or rituals or makes donations. It is in reaching out to God when in the midst of fighting for what you believe is right, your Dharma that is when you can come closest to God.

So he decided to sell the property Astroworld sits on, telling everyone that the value of the land was far greater than the value of the park itself. Based on the fact he entertained no other offers, it is my belief that he had deal in place to sell the land before the announcement. Since the demo of Waterworld started pretty much immediately after the announcement, I think he had a very aggressive timetable to meet to clear the land.  Other than that, there really is no good reason. Burke was so desperate to keep control of Six Flags, he thought any infusion of cash would make the stockholders happy. He proceeded to put the chain up for sale, another desperate move. He then LIED to the stockholders saying he was getting offers when in fact we found out that was not true.  Burke was a pathetic man, a poor leader and had no business running Six Flags. He did more damage to the company than any of the previous owners combined.
