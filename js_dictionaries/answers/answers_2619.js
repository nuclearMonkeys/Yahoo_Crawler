	136788 : ["Because, he was basically being the puppeteer with our minds, using the fans inside the arena as his puppets.I'm pretty sure I've heard Chris Jericho refer to his fans as puppets before, people who will easily be controlled by him, unaware that he's turning them into a puppet.Personally, I see it as Chris Jericho mocking those fans in the arena, which will progress into a heel turn.We'll have to wait & see what transpires next week, because there's no definite answer as to what role Chris Jericho will be in, & we don't even know that Chris Jericho is coming back next week.That could have just been a one time deal, so WWE could permanently remove Chris Jericho off WWE programming.They have Chris Jericho \"return\" then immediately exit, without stating why he's there, or how long he's there.I doubt that it'll head in that direction, but remember, anything can happen in WWE.", 11330, "LY7vI8bnaa", 2],

	136798 : ["I'd like to see Lemmy Kilmister be the guest host, he's not directly a wrestler but he's performed live at two WrestleManias and I hate it when the celebrities randomly support certain wrestlers and you have no idea who ot why. Lemmy could be a one time member of DX because of his links with Triple H, and it would be logical and cool. Everyone knows him, and it is completely plausible that he would do something crazy like guest host Raw and screw with everything (I'm sick of asking who are you and why are you here?). Also I just love Motorhead.  There are a lot of people I would rather be in the walls of Jericho for two hours than spend the time watching them host Raw. Any kiddie media clones like Cyrus or Zak Efron (don't know or want to how to spell that) or Robert Thomas Whatshisface from Vamps R Us, I mean twilight. Also, just imagine if someone like (it just randomly occurred to me that Simon Cowell would be great too), I forgot what I was going to say so I'll pick one of many I would hate. Susan Boyle.

I gave each and every superstar a fair warning before the night began that someone was going to hurt. . . and it was decided that your team would be the ones we would target.
