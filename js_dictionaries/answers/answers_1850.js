Remember that diet and excercise compliment each other, and it should be a part of your life.  Many people get into unhealthy cycles of dieting, aka starving themselves, to lose weight.  Rather, you should eat a healthy diet and get adequate excercise.  Healthy does not mean you have to eliminate sodas, sweets, etc. only regulate them and be sure to \"pay\" for them with excercise. To tone your belly, you should try crunches.  There are two ways to do this- you can lay on the floor, flat, with your arms by your side and then lift your head, shoulders and upper back at the same time you lift your feet and legs.  Hold as long as possible, repeat.  Another way is to cross your arms over your chest and then bend your knees and bring them up to your chest, curling up.  Hold as long as possible, repeat.  See how many you can do today, and try to do more tomorrow.   Do you have any hobbies?  If not, take one (or more) up.  I have a 12 year old daughter (she turns 13 next month) who is also homeschooled, and three other children.  She enjoys baseball, basketball, swimming, riding her bike, etc.  You might like the Presidential Fitness Challenge- you can add it to your school day.  We occasionally set up obstacle courses.  And, the Wii is a great excercise resource- the Boxing on Wii Sports offers a tremendous workout (you do not need the Wii Fit to get excercise, though I am sure it is great).", 9646, "aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa", -2],

This is what has worked for me. Keeping a food journal really does help. It will give you a much better sense of how much you are eating, and when, and why. Make a few additional small changes - walk everywhere, always use stairs instead of elevators, walk on escalators, get up and move around at least once an hour if your work or your life in general is sedentary, walk every day, use a pedometer. Walking 10,000 steps a day is a really good idea. Build up to a long brisk walk everyday, or most days. Be more active and watch less TV and spend less time on the computer. Buy one piece of exercise equipment to have at home and be strict with yourself about using it. Sometimes you can find mini-steppers or exercise bikes at second hand stores and thrift stores for just a few dollars. Start a weight lifting routine. Join a gym. Possibly you can find one that has someone who specializes in weight lifting programs for beginners. Weight lifting will increase your metabolism as well as improve posture and appearance overall. Even if you can't get to the gym you can work out at home using things around the house. Invest in a good weight training book. The Dummies series actually has a good one.  In terms of diet, cut out or reduce things like junk food, pop, fat, fast food. Eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish. Particularly if you choose a vegetarian lifestyle include natural peanut butter, hummus, dried fruit and nuts. Pay close attention to getting the nutrients your body needs to be healthy.  Make your portion sizes smaller. Use a smaller plate - in our society we have become accustomed to thinking that we need a large plate of food at every meal, and we don't. About quarter of your plate of food should be protein and at least half of it should be veggies.  Learn to count calories. At your current weight and activity level, you may possibly need about 2000 calories or more to maintain your current weight. So you will lose weight at a reasonable and healthy rate if you cut back to about 1600 or 1700 calories a day.  Eat small amounts frequently, rather than three large meals. Never skip breakfast. Include some protein in your breakfast. It will help get you through the day. Drink plenty of water, at least 8 big glasses of water a day, and more if it is very hot, if you sweat a lot, or if you are exercising intensely, and eliminate fruit juices. Fruit juices have too many calories, so get your vitamins from fresh fruit, not the juice. You will begin to see changes in your body.", 9646, "None", 0],

	98276 : ["Regarding income tax in the US: Most disability income, if it's from the government, ends up being non-taxable just because the person's income is so low. For married people, or people on private disabilty insurance, it is often different.  Your spouse may have a decent job, and then your SSDI may be taxable (SSI is probably never taxable, because you have to be very poor to get SSI. Maybe there is some weird situation where it's taxed, but I can't think of one).  If you get disability income from insurance that your employer carried on you, that income is taxable. Most of those folks do pay taxes, I bet, because low paid workers don't have that kind of insurance, usually.  If you bought your OWN policy, that's not taxable income.  I get private disability insurance income, and when I was single, I paid taxes every year.  My SSDI was not enough to put that income under taxation. When I married, my husband and I ALMOST had to pay taxes on my SSDI, but we fell just short of enough income to pay taxes on the SSDI. We did pay income taxes on my private disability insurance income for 3 or 4 years, but with no cost of living increase on the bulk of my income, we fall further and further from our need to pay taxes, and have not paid in to income taxes for about 5 years now. And of course, don't forget, you ARE paying taxes. You pay property tax and sales tax and so on. PS if your income is so low that you owe zero taxes, you don't have to file a tax return year after year. I think maybe you file a zero return once, and the IRS will send you a letter telling you to please quit filing these useless returns (it's a polite letter, and I'm just kidding).  Most disabled people are so poor they do not need to file a return.

Start by walking / jogging / than push to extended running. Also swimming, biking, and weight lifting are effective. Yes, women should lift weights. You will not get ripped doing 3 sets of 10 reps on free weights. The more muscle you have the more calories you burn throughout the day, even when you sleep! Muscle is extremely important for losing belly fat. Also don't eat late night snacks before bed, your metabolism is working at a snails pace which allows the food to turn to fat. Eat plenty of fresh foods, poultry, fruit, fiber. Drink water, simply cutting out soda in a diet will DRAMATICALLY improve your body.
