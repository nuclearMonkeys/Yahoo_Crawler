	23052 : ["EVs and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but emissions may be produced by the source of electrical power, such as a power plant. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, PHEVs and EVs typically have lower emissions well-to-wheel than similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In regions that depend heavily on coal for electricity generation, PEVs may not demonstrate a strong well-to-wheel emissions benefit. Remember when President Donald Trump promised to revive the coal industry? When he vowed to “put our miners back to work” during his 2016 campaign trips to coal country? When he said he would end “the war on coal?” A half-dozen times after becoming president, Trump signed bills and executive orders that were supposed to save the industry, always with coal miners standing behind him, applauding his promise to bring coal back.It hasn't exactly worked out that way. 145 coal-burning units at 75 power plants have been idled during Trump's time in office, the fastest decline in coal-fuel capacity in any single presidential term. On average Americans travel 40 miles per person per day, charging the car in spring, summer and autumn from about 12 solar panels on the garage roof is totally possible and affordable in all US states.  Solar is so cheap, there is no reason not to cover all roofs in solar. In addition to city dwellers having cleaner air. (I dislike going to the city, don't you?  It really stinks right?) The benefits of driving electric isn't just environmental. Electric cars are quieter, accelerate faster, need less maintenance and you can charge them at home (even if you don't add solar and live in a state that does get the majority of it's electricity from coal) And I agree, the batteries contain valuable elements and they should and will be recycled when it is economic to do so or government steps in.  Likewise ICE cars would also be acceptable, outside of the city limits at least, if we recycled the materials and the fuel.", 3706, "None", -1],

	23079 : ["Renewable energy overtook fossil fuels for first time as UK's biggest source of electricity in 2020. Wind, solar, bio-energy and hydro (water) power generated a record 42% of UK power last year, while fossil fuels - mostly gas - produced 41%,. Very few countries can rely on just one green energy source because as you say the sun does not shine at night, but then water still flows and the wind still blows.  Which is why most countries have combined green energy supplies. Houses in the UK with solar panels usually generate around 75% of their household electricity needs.   At the moment around 900,000 UK homes have solar panels, as this number grows the amount of electricity needed from the national grid will continue to drop.  Presumably you know that electricity generated during the day is stored in batteries, it does not disappear when it gets dark? A company in Australia have just developed an ink which can conduct electricity, which can be printed onto thin durable plastic.  If their tests are successful, this would do away with the need for solar panels and make it easier and cheaper for more homes to install them. Then of course there are all the wind farms in the UK. On Boxing Day 2020, a record 50.67% of power used in the United Kingdom was generated by wind power. However, it was not the highest amount of power ever generated by wind turbines; that came earlier in December 2020, when demand was higher than on Boxing Day and wind turbines supplied 40% of the power required by the National Grid (17.3 GW). Those countries leading in the research, development and production in this area are the mega corporations of the future because whatever you think the whole world is moving away from fossil fuels.  Yes there are challenges and it will take the best and brightest minds to solve them, but they will as man has done in the past.  After four years America is back in the race to lead in the field and take a share in the money and jobs this industry will generate, which is up for grabs.", 3686, "AA12022384", 1],
