This is AWFUL advice but its what i did :) and im happy.  and dont listen to anyone if they say that this will make you turn out to be a drug dealing, punk a$s teen who is always in jail. ive never been to jail or even touched drugs. PLEASE dont kill yourself. you only get to live once, and if you dont enjoy your life now, you can make it better. life is so much better when youre care free and just go with the flow. again, i couldnt give any worse advice, but its better than sying you should kill yourself, even though you shouldnt.  Hope i helped! you seem really nice. email me if you want to talk! good luck :)", 9618, "nRT0cvc9aa", 0],
	97337 : ["A lot of people hated high school. They didn't like it but they had to go every day. I hated high school and I didn't go to prom either. High school success isn't the end all be all to life and towards being a successful person in life. I hated high school with a passion, and here's what's interesting, all four years I bought yearbooks, but I barely looked at them.  Once high school was done and over with I threw them out. I wish I had never spent money on them, in fact I don't even have my high school diploma anymore. I didn't keep that either. Lots of famous people hated high school, one example was Drew Barrymore. There are plenty more, but she's a great example. She hated high school and did something else with her life. I've realized that as much as I hated high school, I couldn't let the past dictate my future and you can't either. You have to realize that high school wasn't the best part of your life, it sure wasn't part of mine, but what you do now is what matters. There are plenty of high school queen bees that are nobodies now and the reason for that is because while they worked at being popular in high school, they didn't work at life once they got out of high school. Plenty of people hate or have hated high school, you're not the only one. You have to work at life in order for it to be good. As for your parents,  yea I hated the high school that they made me go to, but I understand that at the time this was the best they could do under the circumstances. Don't blame your parents for it forever, at some point you have to realize \"hey my parents did what they could at the time, they're not perfect, they're people that make mistakes.\" Just be glad that its over and done with and that you're in control of your life, we can only put so much blame on our parents, before we realize \"okay so I didn't have the best childhood and I didn't have the best high school years, but now my parents aren't in control of my life, I am and I get to decide how I'm going to live now and I'm going to live life to the best of my ability.\" To be honest with you, I moved out of state. It was hard to live in a city where I would bump into people from high school and where I was reminded of bad memories. I didn't keep in touch with anyone and I started over in a new state, most of them have stayed in the city where we grew up in. I have a facebook, but I only put people that I want on there, I don't feel obligated to put anyone just because I knew them back in the day.  I'm happy with my choice and I haven't looked back. I'll never go to a  high school reunion because there's no need to. You are the only one who loses out if you let the past dictate your future, so don't let it, if you need to move to start over then do so. I saved up some money, it wasn't a lot, but it was enough to get me out. I'm enjoying life in my new state. Its wonderful to be in a new place and not know anyone from the past. Oh by the way, my bf hated his high school years as well and he became a programmer. He's cute, smart and funny and he hated high school. We were friends before we started dating and it helped me out a lot that he didn't like high school either.  So don't feel bad if high school sucked for you, high school sucked for a lot of people and those that hated it would rather not talk about it. But one famous example is Drew Barrymore, she became addicted to drugs early on in life, struggled with being a child actor in school, kids can be quite cruel and jealous of child actors. Anyway she turned her life around.  Don't give up on yourself. Listen to the voice within.", 9618, "None", -1],

Uh, we're both white...and? That's it, other than that, we're two different ppl. I am amy own person, my own individual, and there is more to me than just my skin tone and what racial category I fall into. I have hobbies, interests, insecurities, pride, I am a complex and unique person, and so is everyone. No two people of the same race are the same. And to answer your question, no I don't feel ashamed. I think it's horrible, yes, what happened, but I didn't do it. People who happened to be of the same race as me did it, but I didn't. I was't there. My great great grandparents weren't even alive yet. And I also don't feel ashamed because I have had this shoved down my throat ever since I was a small child in elementary school, and to be honest with you, I'M SICK OF IT! I know what the white people did, I know I fall into the category of being white, but that doesn't mean I should be punished, or make ME  a BAD person!

If you wish to have a good life, you need to think positively, because that's what will lead you to do positive things. If you always think about negative thing, naturally you will be doing negative stuff. One last advice, when there's a problem or misfortunate thing happening to you, think what that you have done that caused those problems, unless it is really out of the circumstances. Blaming that there's a curse or someone else doesn't really make the situation better right?

Even very very average girls are beautiful if you ask me if they present themselves as a strong enough person and have a matching attractive personality. Being actually ugly can be considered a curse, so is being too beautiful though.  I am not just trying to be poetic either.  The average looking girls tend to be the most mentally healthy. Edit: Btw, i agree with aubergin.  It really does come off as sucking to have you as a sister.  You could be her only support, but you sound like you do not really care more than a Yahoo! Answer post.  You do not want to lie to her and tell her she is beautiful?  You, as her sister, i would hope could see the beauty in her and tell her it everyday.  Would it really be such a trouble to tell her she is beautiful even if you do not believe it?  Goodness gracious.  People these days.

I am dating a 45 year old gentleman who has never dated a black woman, he has 3 children by his ex-wife who is also White. I'm sure he expected certain things about me and I did about him as well, but once I began to know him I learned that he is not that person I thought he might have been. Totally the opposite, and I LOVE IT! I think that if you allow yourself to be open-minded and not as judgmental as we are brought up to be, then you won't see yourself as a racist and you'll be able to spot out potential racist people.
