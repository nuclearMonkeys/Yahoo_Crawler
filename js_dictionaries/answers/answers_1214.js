Do you mess around with the services in XP to stop the useless ones? If you know that stuff then definitely go for cs just do the best you can in the math.  Passing grades aren't so hard to get in math -- just attempt the homeworks, stay every minute in the mid-terms and finals and visit the prof a bunch of times and they're not gonna fail you. In the computer industry there are a vast number of positions requiring none of the upper division math that cs majors have to take.

There's obviously the basics such as binary, hexadecimal, and a small bit of octal(!), these are for obvious reasons because it's how a computer operates. There's also a major part in differentiation and integration (I can't remember what for), there's a major part, also, in statistics (for networking, the chances of a network going down etc.). Before I went to university, I had a B in mathematics at GCSE, I completed a BTEC National Diploma in ICT (which taught me little maths), then went to uni and that's where I am now (doing my exams in the first year), I've currently learned the maths required now, I'm just being examined on it. My advice: go for it; the worst that could happen is after one year (or even within the first few weeks of the course if you feel you're that bad at it), if you feel you're failing, you can change course (to perhaps a Computer Science related degree, that isn't so heavy on the computing and maths section (perhaps Business Computing).", 8321, "None", 1],
