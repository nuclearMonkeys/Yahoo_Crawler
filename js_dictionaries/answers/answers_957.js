I think I may have been more protective if I had a daughter. Probably because I know how I misbehaved us a female teenager . LOL My boys are in their 30' s right now. I have always had a great relationship with them both, and still do. As teens, I decided not to give them my opinion unless they asked for it. I picked my battles and let the small stuff go. I did as I said and I said what I did by setting a good example. I taught them honesty and compassion and manners, especially table manners. Compliments and encouragements are very valuable to one's self esteem. Teach your daughter self respect and to stand upfor herself. Let her know that she is capable of anything. Above all, communication is key to having a good relationship with your daughter. Listen to your instincts.", 7453, "9MJS6I6Laa", -1],

I'd take that declaration with a big grain of SALT, and not get bent out of shape over it. And I'd get rid of your daughter's phone, period. She doesn't NEED A PHONE at her age- and having one makes her vulnerable to abuse and to criminal activities.

Some notes: in the United States, certain spellings of Irish names may be pronounced according to English pronunciations.... so a person who sees that name might try to pronounce it as say-oh-reese, Sha-reese. People are who familiar with that name, will pronounce it correctly, just as they will pronounce Sean (as Shawn) and not as SEEN, because they are aware of Irish and English pronunciation differences.

Tell him no more excuses will be tolerated, and from now on you are only going to ask once for the chore to be done. If the chore isn't done, he loses something. Doesn't pick up the toys~the toys are gone until you want to give them back. Doesn't do homework, no tv.
