	99336 : ["I do not FEAR homosexuals. ...this statement in itself is a farce, and a 'catch phrase'  to brand on anyone, who has bible beliefs...Homosexuality is a sin, just like Adultry, fornication, lying, stealing cheating murder and everything else... But, because God is a merciful God...He will and can forgive all of us for our carnal ways... There isn't anything in the Bible about a black person marrying a white person... God wants marriage and loves marriage...but just not between two men or two women. I frankly am getting tired of being branded myself... There is no connection with the two things...many gay people always try to play the race card or anything else that can brand Christians as the 'evil' ones...From my experience, it is the forgiving Christians, that are the kindest to homosexuals... If they are fake Christians, and using God to spew their own personal hatred, I am sorry for them but they have to be forgiven to. don't worry I'll be in the religious sectioin next week when 'that one' wins if he does.", 9693, "b931753da53fa7c2b1a6ae8598d475b8aa", 1],

	99338 : ["What a great question! It made me think. As a history teacher, I've taught colonialism, but it never occurred to me that the Christian co-opting of Judaism was a form of spiritual colonialism.  When I taught in an upper-middle class high school, I would start the subject by telling the kids about an inner-city school I'd observed. I'd describe the inner-city kids as intrinsically flawed, and would insinuate that my students were superior. I told them that they were smarter, and more mature, and I would hint that their middle-class status bestowed them with higher intellectual and moral qualities. Then I'd say that, in spite of their inferiority, the inner-city kids often had facilities that were much better (this was a blatant lie). I'd brainstorm with the kids about ways that they could take advantage of the inner-city faciliities, and maybe mentor some of the poor disadvantaged inner-city kids, without being pulled down by the inferiority of inner-city kids. Of course, this talk made a lot of students uncomfortable. What was frightening was that a lot of students totally AGREED with this line of thought. Most kids didn't \"get it\" until I explained colonialism. Anyway, good question, and I'm looking forward to reading answers.", 9692, "Tr43d4tXaa", 2],
	99339 : ["Great post :) One thing I've been reading up about which may be of interest: We all know that there is a specific group of Christian Evangelicals who go round posing as \"messianic jews\" and MISrepresenting Jewish beliefs. They DO NOT represent all Christians and indeed, many Christians and Christian movements have openly condemned them. But now, those SAME Evangelicals are trying to do a similar thing WITH MUSLIMS - and insisting there are 'messianic muslims'!!! Here's a link or two:", 9692, "8I9uduIiaa", 1],
	99340 : ["Here's my own psychological analysis of this phenomenon.  The reason that Messianic Jews (Christians) hi-jack real Jewish culture, customs, etc. is because they have a guilt problem.  You see these individuals know that Christianity is plagued with the blood of millions of innocent Jewish people. And they don't want to identify as Christian because of the religion's bloody past persecutions and killings of Jews.  They feel that by hi-jacking real Judaism they will have less of a guilty conscious since they align themselves (falsely) to the group that's oppressed (the Jewish people). Now they feel that they can give them the “message of the good word” under a Jewish disguise. Because if they just gave Jewish people a straight Christian message then they would have to face the whole persecution fact that most Jewish people know of and that's a main reason why any Jew with good sense wouldn't fall for a Christian message. So they give them a Jewish look with a Christain messege that way they feel that they are doing Jesus' work by converting the Jew and they feel better about themselves because they won't have to worry about someone rejecting their messege because of Christianity's past. And by ripping off real Jewish beliefs they obtain an idenity for themselves that they hadn't had before.  The same thing applies with people ripping off Native American custums, religion, ideas, etc.  It's the guilt factor as well. People know what the U.S. has done to the Native Americans (they persecuted them and killed them) and so in order to feel less guilty about killing them off; they too hi-jack Native American idenity.  The whole idea of ripping off another culture is becuase of guilt and becuase the culture that rips off another one feels that it has no interesting culture of it's own to be a part of. So they hi-jack one so they can feel a part of a group and have a (false) sense of identity. ------------------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer: This is an analysis so if this seems like I'm being harsh or cold then I apologize. ------------------------------------------------------------ Thanks Cher; I agree with some of the points you've made as well. -------------------------------------------------------- Thanks mama_pajama; your question has really caused all of us to think about this issue with great concentration and vigor. This question is very interesting.  -------------------------------------------------------- To Paperback Writer AMYISRAELCHAIJPA: O my gosh how misinformed can these people be? Don't they realize that being a Muslim is a religious thing and not a racial thing? It's just like being Jewish, a person's Jewish through religion not by race.  Obviously they think that Muslims like Jews are a race; which is completely wrong because just as there are many different kinds of people who are Jewish there are also many different racial and cultural groups who call Islam their faith.", 9692, "B0GujA9Aaa", 4],

	99346 : ["Everybody is entitled to thier opinion. However, dislikng an individual based on thier bedroom activity is just PLAIN OLE IGNORANT!! I submit unto you, people that fear ANYTHING are those who are improperly educated on the subject matter or in your case lack of knowledge. My question to you, is why are you homophobic? Did you have a bad experience with someone who is/was gay? Is it something that stems from your childhood ie molestation by someone of the same sex or even more importantly is it because you, yourself,  have some personal demons of your own that your are wrestling with. In my own personal observation, I've found that those who are blatantly homophobic are either themselves gay and in the closet(and it's so much easier to divert the attention from yourself and onto someone who's openly gay) or just plain ole ignorant. Sad to say that society's perception of what a gay person is has become completely miscontrued and sensationalized by the media. We(and I say we because I'm an African American Male who is gay) have been projected as effeminate males, who over-articulate expressions by dramatic hand gestures, hand on the hip, miss thing this or that, when that is so far from the truth. Additionally, we've been portrayed as drug users and to be very promiscuous. While that maybe true for some, it doesn't hold true for all. What I recommend to you, is that you spend some time volunteering with an organization that deals exclusively with gay people(Like PFLAG- Parents and Friend of Lesbian and Gays or at a gay clinic). That way all the negative stigmatism or reservations you have, concerning gay people will be put to rest. Once you've had a positive interaction with a gay person, then perhaps your views concerning homosexuality, will change. BY NO MEANS am I attempting to force my lifestyle on anyone. People seem to think that we are somehow \"different\". We go through the same ups & down, highs and lows as our heterosexual counterparts. So why do you view us differently to the point where you are downright afraid? Again I say, lack of education, leads to ignorance, which warrants fear. Regardless of what the masses say, there's nothing blissful in being ignorant. When are you going to end it?  Be Blessed Al Green", 9693, "vkPiGRewaa", 0],
