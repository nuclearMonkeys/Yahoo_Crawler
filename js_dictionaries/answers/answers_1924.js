There is one opening-round game played between the 2 lowest-ranked teams in the tournament, with the winner completing the field of 64 that competes in the first round. 31 teams get automatic bids into the tournament. These are the Ivy League regular season champion, and the conference tournament champions for the other 30 conferences. The remaining 34 bids are \"at-large\" and are determined by the NCAA Selection Committee. This is done by comparing resumes of all the remaining teams. They examine RPI (a winning percentage that takes into account who your opponents were and which ones you lost to/won against), Strength of Schedule, Wins vs. teams in the RPI Top 100, Losses against teams with an RPI >100, road record, etc. With all of this information, they select the next best 34 teams to complete a 65 team field, and seed them accordingly from then on. Villanova is in as one of the top at-large teams based on their record.  Temple got in because they won the Atlantic-10 conference tournament. St.Joe's,Penn, and Drexel did not win their conferences and were not good enough to be considered as an at-large bid.", 9797, "c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa", 0],
	101958 : ["Your reference is Media Matters? Try getting the exact transcripts instead of using Hillary's front organization. It's readily available on Limbaugh's website to anyone that really cares to find it. Plus, I have heard the tapes as well. Limbaugh has done more for the military than you could ever imagine. And, FYI, Rush was not referring JUST about Macbeth, it was within the context of a larger discussion about \"phony soldiers\" who portray themselves as being soldiers (but aren't), and other soldiers who misrepresent their experiences within the military (including telling of \"atrocities\" that never happened). THOSE are the phony soldiers he was referring to. And speaking of spitting on soldiers. First the Viet Nam incidents are NOT myths. I KNEW military members who got spit on and otherwise harassed. AND, Project Pink just recently had members in an airport in California within the last month to harass, and yes spit, on Marines returning from the Middle East. I bet you won't find THAT on Media Matters. BTW, Answerer...Limbaugh gives 100s of thousands of dollars to charity every year and raises even more through his charitable works. Some of his charities include military charities, as a matter of fact. But he also raises monies for other organizations. So before you criticize the man, learn about the man.", 9798, "AA11593971", 3],

	101974 : ["There are numerous types of spreaders available and cheap.  As earlier posted you can get a back spreader for about $20.  There is a hand-held front unit even cheaper, however, the swath of spread is very small.  There is the conventional drop and cyclone types which cost a bit more but last for years with proper care.   I would suggest that you invest in the cyclone type of spreader.  Keep in mind that this is both an investment and a necessary landscape tool.  At minimum get a drop spreader.  These spreaders are essential.  Aside from the usage with seed they are needed to calibrate the dispersal of Weed Killers, Fertilizers, Pest Control, etc.  Next time you are in a store look on the back of the bag of any of the above and you will find the settings for various spreaders.  The information is crucial to optimize results and can only be had with a spreader!   Both the cyclone and drop are multi-usage tools.  Aside from the normal chemical and seed application consider, if you will, the winter applications!  Both are great for the spread of de-icing compounds.  At the proper setting they will save you money throughout the seasons by application of the exact amount of compound and seed needed.     Maintain your unit by carefully cleaning the entire unit after each use.  Make sure you allow the unit enough air and time to dry.  A simple solution of Ivory Soap and water, then a rinse will remove most residue.  Do not forget to pay attention to the spreaders bottom parts (Wheels and dispersal unit and shafts).  In the spring and fall follow the manufacturers guidelines for lube of the gear box unit.   This is kind of a no-brainer.  A relatively low cost tool that is multi-purpose, all year valuable, that saves me money, saves me time, and can last for years.  Good Luck.", 9801, "3dd7f94edfe549e48094a7d79426083aaa", 0],

I don't have the answer regarding Limbaugh, but I was witness during the Vietnam war to many soldiers being spit at, called all sorts of names, and in general, harassed as they returned home.    Once, when the airlines were on strike I was trying to make it back to Massachusetts to visit my mother in the hospital. I had to take a train that was full of soldiers on leave. I saw first hand, the spitting, etc. There was a great deal of hostility going on during that time period all over. The country really was divided. Some protested quietly, others violently.
