Does he at this partiular dispensatio use those methods?  No, we are too close to Armageddon and then yes whole nations will be destroyed for their wickedness.

If it were something along the lines of your question, then there is something about the situation that you do not know.. However, the main problem with this question, and with society is, that the earthly-bound world is so unconnected spiritually, that many will mis-hear the devil's words for God's. Saying \"God told me to do it\" when really it was the Devil pretending to be God.. but they don't know the difference.

It constantly mutates, and has morphed to a state where it could infect pigs, and then making the jump to humans. Because it mutates and evolves, we have to keep developing new medicines and vaccines. Would you be willing to take a flu shot for a 2004 strain? No, because the influenza virus morphs.

For bringing down the overpopulation of humans, to cull pigs to diminish our food source, or simply for his own entertainment. You've got to admit, if you were a God you'd find it hilarious that a disease that's killed less than even the common cold has caused such mass hysteria.  I'm not here to argue the existance of God.

	88012 : ["1) What did God do with himself before he created angels and the universe? Well, according to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, time is an integral part of the Universe - in fact, a dimension like length, width and depth.  Before the universe existed, there was no space (as we know it) and there was no time, either.  In fact, it's not really proper to use the phrase \"before the Universe\" since time did not exist until the moment that the Universe was created. This can be understood to mean that God is actually separate from time or unbounded by time.  In a sense, God acts \"outside\" of time (more exactly, unbounded by our space-time).  It's possible that for God time does not impinge on his existence, and that he sees time as, perhaps, we see a string or a piece of paper - something that can be viewed and understood but that does not define our existence in any way. The use of \"throne\" in The Bible is an anthropomorphism.  God clearly does not \"need\" to sit on anything, but the \"place\" (metaphorically-speaking) where God \"resides\" (metaphorically speaking) could only be described in terms and concepts that existed in the language used to describe it.  In other words:  what word other than the word meaning \"throne\" did the ancient Hebrews have to describe what it was that God was revealing to them? Jim", 9281, "None", 2],

God don't exist by birth or anything, He don't live by our ways. So, people will tend to lump God's existence with mankind, thinking too much.
