	139944 : ["TNA has had some financial problems in the past. Their support system was buckling from within and sponsers were pulling out left and right, but TNA has managed to keep it's head above water. The current booking has been questionable. As Samoa Joe had said there are guys who kill themselves day in and day out for a spot and then guys like Angle, Tomko, Christian, Booker T, Hall, and Nash come off the street and because of their \"status\" automatically get a top spot and the other guys who truly deserve a push lose it. - If WWE did buy TNA he would most likely just absorb the roster into his own instead of making another brand. The seperate brand idea is not doing the kind of business he intended and TV time costs money, so he'd most likely be spending more than he's earning. Wrestling is also not as big as it used to be, so not many TV stations would be too interested in having a program like wrestling in their prime time line-up. - In my opinion most TNA talent would be let go. The WWE is not interested in the smaller guys at this time. Guys like Senshi, Dutt, Shark Boy would be the first to go. Wrestlers like AJ, Lethal, Joe, and/or Alex Shelly could be picked up. The larger wrestlers like Hoyt, Roode, Storm, Harris, or Abyss would probably have a fighting chance. As for others, they're either unknown, been discarded by WWE, or stand no chance at all. - If the WWE released talent in place of TNA talent (I'd personally put the new TNA talent on the ECW roster) I'd imagine they'd release: Venis, Carlito, Super Crazy, Funaki, Dyskstra, and Yang. - At this time there is zero chance that the women will get any more air time than already what is provided. Vince is not interested in women's wrestling, just hot women. - If the released wrestlers couldn't make it in the indies they'd have to think about a career change. - Would the ratings go up? -- Only if Vince changes the product. His company and their ideas are in need of a major overhaul. Once the focus is back on the quality of the wrestling the ratings will improve. Until then, it's unlikely.", 11449, "3150d804df9d947ff8eb525404a2465eaa", 0],

I had no problems removing these right in windows.  I did not have to boot to a command prompt or safe mode. Then start/run/regedit and search for those filenames and delete the references to them in your registry. This annoying thing also probably disabled your Task Manager. To fix this: go here:   That is how I fixed mine after calling Symantec and being told they would charge me $100 to fix my issue.  I then found out (after fixing it myself) that they already have a fix, but have not released it.  I am still waiting for a callback from them about why the heck they have a fix (they told me they have one) and have not released it. It bothers me greatly that I fixed it in about 45 minutes with some good old-fashioned computer detective work and they wanted to charge me $100 to be a guinea pig and test a fix they already have... Hope this helps you.  It got rid of it (to the best of my knowledge) for me. UPDATE:  I have just finished speaking to my 9th person from Symantec.  She told me that this is not classified as a 'virus' but is spyware, and Norton does not deal with spyware directly.  Basically, I was told by 2 Symantec techs that they had a fix for it, but it had not been released yet.  I wanted to know why, if they had a fix, customers had to pay $100 to have a tech access their computer to remove the 'virus'.  At any rate, you can take this info for whatever it is or isn't worth.

	139960 : ["Eye contact with anyone male or female is a gesture of friendship and acknowledgment. It says, in the same as a smile might say, I see you and I recognize you as a fellow human.

Conversely,you can use it to dissuade someone from approaching you and/or talking to you. Hence, if you do not want guys to approach you or linger in conversation with you then it is up to you to 1)Look at them ever so briefly and smile back if they acknowledge you. That is only respect and being friendly which is not harmful. 2) If the come up to you and start to talk to you,you can either talk for a little while and excuse yourself or not exchange any contact information,or say something like excuse me but I see my husband.

	139965 : ["Money cannot buy everything. It is the best source we have for trading commodities and goods internationally. It is a measure of worth to the holder of the bills, coins, bullion or otherwise. It secures rent/mortgage, food, clothing on different scales.  Money is relative; if you have nothing in your pockets living on the street; then ten dollars is a lot of money. However if you have a home, food, good clothing with ten hundred dollars in your pockets then ten dollars is not much at all relative to what you have. So giving a sawbuck to a hungry man is nothing to you, but it sure as hell is a lot to the hungry man. The common man has a good living, good enough to borrow from the banks and buy a house, feed his family, clothe himself and his children. But a wealthy man can do the same only on a more larger scale. He can borrow more from the bank and buy a house with a lot more space, richer woods for floors, crystal chandeliers, lead glass windows and a four car garage. Top of the line clothing and fresh foods daily. Two cars or three and the best dental care and health insurance. He can also afford a better education for his children.  But a billionaire? Well money is not an issue with them. They can afford what they want and think nothing of it. Materially that is. This is what money cannot buy.  It cannot buy the love of your wife, nor can it buy the loyalty of friends. It cannot buy your health and it cannot buy your future. There is no amount of platinum, gold, silver or jewels that can buy your soul, nor God's grace. Money is a necessity for living. It is the best means of an international monetary system we have; and commerce would basically fall down without it. This monetary system we have throughout the world is mandatory for every man woman and child to live properly. It is what enables us to procure our food. It is what we use to barter for good clothing. It is the source of trade we need to shelter ourselves from the elements and seasons.  There are those who think money is evil and the source for all evil but that my friend is a misconception and a misquote from the bible. Money in the long run is the source of civilization. If we are to go to the bible and read it properly we will find that what the bible actually says is ..... \"The LOVE of money is a ROOT to all KINDS of EVIL.\" I hope this helps you in your query.", 11451, "94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa", 4],
	139966 : ["Money is technically a 'coupon', or 'voucher' system that is sybolic only, of what is actually going on being two or more entities, the 'goings-on', being BARTERING, which is the trading of one of these three things: 1. time, 2. means, or 3. talents. People assume the more 'coupons' means more of access to any of these three items, but the truth is, too much is to just be saturated and burdened, and too little is to go without actual needful things...   The ideal state of trade is zionistic, where no one goes without, because everyone gives of themselves with the expectation to be be given in return what their actual needs are, which includes things of joy and recreation for emotional health. This is called Interdependancy, as opposed to Codependancy where the trades are uneven, unfair, have inappropriate expectations, or involve threat, in essence, a 'sick support system', an example of this system being the 7-step 'pimp' formula. This formula is also the same one used for any thievery, like blackmail, the maphia, bullying, sexual abuse... The is the Golden Rule NOT being put into effect, where there is an enabling, threatened 'giver' who is not being given Fair Return. When money is used here, it just complicates the idea of what is wanted (security) and even the one seeking this method of getting gain doesn't have a real awareness that he of she is counter productive, committing self sabotage. Example: those who want to get out of the MS Gang understand this, but those who fight to stay in remain in ignorance of themselves. The thing that money cannot buy, is this 'security' through the wrong avenue, in other words. When we realize the appropriate way to trade, being mentors to others, and realizing we require being mentored BY others, that's when we finally have security, and if money is used for this means, it's fine, but this is the system that is truly tested as to whether it's really working or not, when suddenly, were the money to drop out of the picture, would the golden rule-bartering go on, continuing the security and perfect 'economy' that doesn't actually depend on money. We are all in need of mentorship outside ourselves--the true compassionate kindness of another with an access key, to have all that we need, because we each have much to share, but we don't have all perfectness and talent within us. To accept mentorship, is to reach the security we really are after.", 11451, "vQtUCXkYaa", 1],
