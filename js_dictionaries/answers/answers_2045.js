There is nothing you could ever do, that would be worth enough to give value to your existence. When someone rapes and murders your daughter and then they are executed, there isn't anyone with enough to lose that could balance out your loss! The death of the morally bankrupt attacker is not enough. Even if they consented to let you personally torture and execute the perpetrator, it would still not be enough to scour away your pain and loss. Jesus was ever the only one with enough to lose to give you back the value of your life! He re-values (redeems) your life and the lives of every man woman and child ever born.

	108026 : ["Fortunately, God answered that question for us.  In fact, He went to the trouble of writing a rather lengthy book to explain it in detail.  It's called the bible.  God created everything that exists to display His glory.  We can't help but marvel at His wisdom and power when we look at the universe, the world, and everything around us and realize how complex it is and how complex we are and yet everything works as it is supposed to and works together.  As He summed it up, \"The heavens declare the glory of God and the earth shows forth His handiworks\". Unfortunately, we human beings messed up by being disobedient and so, for a while, the earth and everything in it is under a curse because of us and our sin.  That's why we see the evil that we have today, the wars, the greed, the hatred, etc. Fortunately, God didn't give up on us and sent his son, Jesus, to pay the price that we should have paid for our disobedience so that we can still have the relationship with God that we were supposed to have in the beginning.   The good news it that God still has ultimate power and authority in the universe and His plan will stilll be fulfilled.  The day is coming soon when He will end this time of patience where He is waiting for people to seek a relationship with Him and will deal once and for all with evil.  He will restore the universe and the earth to the state in which it was created where there is no evil and those who have made the decision to seek Him in this life will be able to once again live in His presence. Many things in this life are confusing because we have limited understanding.  But God loves us enough to care about what happens to us every day.  Sometimes bad things happen because this world is evil, but God has the ability to make good things out of a bad situation.  He says that \"All things work together for good for those who know and trust Him\". So if you really want right answers, get hold of a bible and start reading.  Ask God to reveal to you the truth that it contains because it is His spirit working through the written words that enables us to understand His truths.  It may seem confusing at first, but stick with it.  It will get to the point where you just can't put it down.  The more you learn, the more you will be amazed. Find a good, bible-believing church and start attending.  Churches are not all the same and don't all teach the same thing, so check them out and see if what they teach agrees with what the bible says.  Since God went to the trouble to have it written for us, we ought to use it as our basis for everything else. We do have a purpose beyond eating, sleeping, and dying.  Our purpose is to get to know God and learn to glorify Him.  His purpose for us is to prepare us to spend eternity with Him.  We must not lose sight of that and get so wrapped up in the day to day events of living that we forget why we are here.", 10030, "775e6b66a5c2f6c463b50df6ce98bde9aa", 0],

	108047 : ["Where am I coming from, where will I go? What is the meaning and purpose of my life? What is death like? Is it certain that there is life after death? Do Paradise and Hell exist? What is the origin of life? Where is our Creator? What does the Creator demand from us? How can I discern between right and wrong? Where do I find the answers to these questions?… For ages, people have sought answers to these crucial questions, given serious thought to them and discussed them thoroughly. Yet, contrary to what is generally believed, in all ages, the most reliable answers to these questions have been provided, not by the philosophers, but by the \"true religion\" which is the revelation of God.  Many religions have attracted adherents throughout the world-Buddhism, shamanism and paganism to name but a few. However, none of these were the revelation of God. Therefore, they were nothing more than a philosophy or a movement. Some, having merely a symbolic or cultural meaning, provided no social or psychological solutions to problems. Those who developed these religions, too, thought over these crucial questions, yet they could never find reliable answers.  Nevertheless, there are some \"righteous religions\" which have to be evaluated separately from these false religions. The most important feature of righteous religions, which distinguishes them from false religions, is their origin: they all have their roots in revelation. God informs mankind in the Qur'an about the superiority of the religion of truth over all other religions, philosophies or sociological systems:   It is He Who sent His messenger with guidance and the religion of Truth to exalt it over every other religion, and God suffices as a witness. (Surat al-Fath: 28)  It is He Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of Truth to exalt it over every other religion, much as the idolaters may hate it. (Surat as-Saff: 9)  Judaism, Christianity and Islam are the religions which have their roots in revelation. Originally, they were all revealed by God, yet after their respective messengers, Christianity and Judaism were corrupted.  Man made countless distortions in the Old and New Testaments-making additions and deletions-and as the original books disappeared in time, various forged Old Testaments and New Testaments appeared. Meanwhile, the originals were completely forgotten. Hence, followers of these religions deviated from the original divine religion, and founded their beliefs, rituals, worshipping and life styles upon a wholly distorted understanding of religion fabricated by clergy and rabbis. Today, these beliefs and interpretations still persist. Thus, these distorted religions are very far from providing answers to the questions mentioned above.  After the distortion of these religions, God revealed the last divine Book, which will remain unchanged until the Day of Judgment, and He will be the One Who will surely guard it against all distortions:  We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption). (Surat al-Hijr: 9)  For 14 centuries, the Qur'an has remained unchanged, and free from corruption. Every single letter of the original hand-written copies of the Qur'an has a one-to-one relation to the current copies we have today. In every corner of the world, people read the very same Qur'an, which proves that the Qur'an is kept under the special protection of God.  Throughout history, God communicated His messages, either by His messengers or His books. The Prophet Adam (as), the first man God created on earth, was assigned the same duty by God. In other words, the first people who appeared on earth were fully aware of the existence of God. Then followed many other messengers and books all throughout world history. This fact is recounted in the Qur'an:  Mankind was once a single community. Then God sent out prophets bringing good news and giving warning, and with them He sent down the Book with the truth to decide between people regarding their differences… (Surat al-Baqara: 213)  As is also stressed in the above-mentioned verse, God communicates His messages to man through His messengers and Books. Messengers always warn their people against the Day of Judgment and an eternal Hell, while they also give them the good tidings of an eternal bliss-Paradise. God, the One Who created man, is also the One Who surely knows the proper conditions in which man would feel most comfortable in this world. That is why the life style and moral values God demands from His servants shape a comfortable life on earth, as well as in the hereafter. In brief, by the mercy of God, religion is the system enabling man to attain an ideally structured life, both psychologically and sociologically.  Although bringing different commandments according to the different environments and conditions of the time they were revealed in, divine religions present to man essentially the same beliefs and moral examples. All divine religions convey fundamental facts about the existence of God. They explain the attributes of God, the purpose in the creation of man and all other living beings, how to be a decent servant of God, the ideal attitude and behaviour praised by God, the way to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad, how to conduct one's life to earn God's approval and how to attain Paradise. From this standpoint, the truly righteous religion in the sight of God is Islam. The basis of all religions revealed to man since the time of Prophet Adam (as), is Islam, which means \"submission to God.\" This fact is stressed as follows:  The religion with God is Islam... (Surah Al 'Imran: 19)  Although righteous religions were attributed to their individual messengers and accordingly called \"Judaism\" and \"Christianity,\" the religions brought by these messengers were all the same righteous religion. In other words, in their time, they were all an Islam; …He has selected you and not placed any constraint upon you in the observance of your faith-the religion of your father, Ibrahim. In this, as in former scriptures, He has given you the name of Muslims… (Surat al-Hajj: 78) Those who received divine books (Christians and Jews), before the Qur'an was revealed, were actually Muslims. This fact is related in the Qur'an in the words of those who had true faith among the Christians and Jews:  Those to whom We gave the Book before this believe in it. When it is recited to them, they say, \"We believe in it; it is the truth from our Lord. We were already Muslims long before it came. (Surat al-Qasas: 52-53)  God rids Christians and Jews of their erroneous beliefs about this issue in the Qur'an, correcting them thus:  Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but a man of pure natural belief-a Muslim. He was not one of the idolaters. (Surah Al 'Imran: 67)  When we refer to the Qur'an again, we see that, all through the ages, every prophet communicated the same fundamental system of worship and beliefs. In the Qur'an, it is said about:  - The Prophet Zakarriya (as) that the angels called out to him \"while he was standing in prayer\" (Surah Al 'Imran: 39) - The Prophet Shu'ayb (as) that his people called out to him saying, \"Shu'ayb, do your prayers instruct you that we should renounce the gods our fathers worshipped or stop doing whatever we want to with our wealth? You are clearly forbearing, and rightly-guided!\" (Surah Hud: 87)  - The Prophet Isma'il (as) that \"He used to enjoin upon his people worship (to do salat) and almsgiving (zakat) and his Lord was pleased with him.\" (Surah Maryam (MARY): 55)  - The Prophets Ishaq (as) and Ya'qub (as) that God \"enjoined on them prayer (salat) and charity (zakat) and they worshipped none but Ourself.\" (Surat al-Anbiya': 73)  - The Prophet Musa (as) and his brother that God revealed His will to them, saying \"...make your houses places of worship and conduct prayers (establish salat)…\" (Surah Yunus: 87)  - The Prophet 'Isa (JESUS) (as) that he said: \"He(God) has made me blessed wherever I go, and directed me to be steadfast in prayer (salat) and give alms (zakat) to the poor as long as I shall live.\" (Surah Maryam: 31) - The Prophet Luqman (as) that he addressed his son thus: \"My son, be steadfast in prayer (salat) and forbid what is wrong…\" (Surah Luqman: 17) and \"My son, serve no other deity besides God, for idolatry is a terrible wrong.\" (Surah Luqman:13) - Maryam (MARY) (as) that God commanded her thus:\"Maryam, obey your Lord, prostrate yourself and bow down with the worshippers.\" (Surah Al 'Imran: 43)  These are examples of a few fundamental ways of worshipping and tenets of faith, and they can be further extended since essentially the same righteous religion was revealed to all prophets. The basic and immutable features of this righteous religion are repeated in the following verse:  They were ordered to worship only God, making their religion sincerely His as people of pure, natural belief, and to attend to their prayers (salat) and give alms (zakat)-that is surely the correct religion. (Surat al-Bayyina: 5)  Consequently, the religion with God is Islam. This incontrovertible fact is related in the Qur'an:  If anyone desires anything other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he will be among the losers.

A 401K is especially profitable to you if the employer will match. You may want to consider a ROTH IRA on your own instead of 401K. You are contributing to the plan after you pay taxes but paying taxes at today's rate will probably be less than the tax rates in the future when you go to withdraw money, according to the experts. Whatever you do... don't touch your money because there's more money to be gained from time. If you run short, find other ways to bail out.

As far as what to invest in, it will depend on your financial and investment objectives, and your risk tolerance.  If you want to invest in mutual funds for your Roth IRA, then I would suggest the following places to check out:  www.vanguard.com www.troweprice.com www.fidelity.com Vanguard requires an initial minimum investment of $3000 ($1000 for their STAR Fund). Subsequent investments can be made for $50/mo through their automatic investment plan. T. Rowe Price you can start investing with as little as $50/mo through their automatic investment plan. Fidelity has a SIMPLE Start IRA in which you can start investing with $200/mo through automatic investment plan. Research all three sites and go with the one that fits your needs the best.  State Farm is another option; however, they do not offer as many funds as the rest of the other fund companies that I listed. You can also ask your employer if they would consider offering a 401k plan in the future as you can put away more money than a Roth IRA.", 10033, "None", 0],
