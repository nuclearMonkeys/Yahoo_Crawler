And, if needed, to supplement the Army as a Militia.No where in the 2nd Amendment does it say a person must be a member of the Militia in order to own firearms. It does say, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed \".  So show me here in the 2nd Amendment that to own firearms, membership in a Militia is required. \"Well regulated\", regulated being the key word. Regulated by whom? Feds? State? Local? What would they know about military regulations? Performance? Tactics? Weapons and their uses? Back then, a local militia was usually commanded by a Captain, usually chosen by town leaders. Then, X number of local Militias fell under the command of a Colonel, again usually chosen by groups of town leaders. Our founding Fathers knew well the dangers of defenseless citizens. Monarchies all over Europe banned firearms except for themselves and certain members of their court. Abuses by governments was rampant since subjects were forbidden guns and they vowed that would not happen here. That is why the word \"PEOPLE\" is used frequently in our Constitution. We, the People are the government, We The People are governed by our consent thru our elected leaders, (even though, at all levels, they have forgotten who they work for). If our Forefathers had wanted firearms only in the hands of Militia members, they would have written the 2nd saying so. They wrote the 2nd giving \"WE THE PEOPLE\" the right to bear arms, and not be infringed. Government seems to not understand the meaning of \"infringed\" since they constantly mess with it. Lastly, the word \"infringed\" is only used in the 2nd Amendment, no other Right in the Bill of Rights contain that word. Kind of makes you go hmmmmm.", 3247, "gYIE7AQbaa", 1],

	19742 : ["In a kind of ironic sense, in the sense of “reverse logic” I guess you could say, he was in fact following his “training”. Why would I even say that? Because obviously the police dept. he worked for didn't seem to have any problem with his brutal and even homicidal techniques.  He had had 18 KNOWN complaints against him in his career,  those that were filed, had shot two people, one fatally,  and had used excessive and prolonged force on others in the past who Also claimed they were not able to breathe and he ignored them. They just didn't happen to die like Floyd did.  From my own experience with the police I know for a fact that even if he had 18 KNOWN complaints there were probably many other people he had brutalized since in my own experience with police I know that if you've been abused by them enough times and you see the results when you file a complaint you don't even bother anymore. Because nothing ever gets done.  These cops just Stay on the force and they continue brutalizing people just like Derek Chauvin did. Nobody does anything about it. Unless they happen to execute a handcuffed unarmed civilian like Floyd and there were bystanders filming it on their phones. And even then there will be plenty of people around to Make excuses for them. You see a lot of people coming on yahoo answers doing that. You see that expert witness who said there was “no excessive use of force involved” doing it. And so on and so forth. The police unions always have their backs. Etc. etc. And I'm sure there were others who were brutalized but didn't report it and nobody was around to video it.Some of the suspects he Brutalized were minors. There's so much information about Chauvin's brutality and cool, calculated sadism on the Internet that I don't even have time to provide all the links. Just take your pick.  But despite all the complaints he had against him, he was always allowed to remain on the police force and continue his sadistic treatment of unarmed human beings.The man is pure evil, One of the women he was brutalizing during an arrest made this comment to the rookie officer Chauvin was training at the time. And she was absolutely right. She called that one perfectly. She said he was pure evil And told the rookie cop to take notice of that.If you look at his face you can see it. If you look at the way he showed absolutely no emotion when he was choking George Floyd to death you can see it. Pure evil. The definition of a psychopath. He was and is sadistic psychopath who enjoyed inflicting pain upon other human beings.  The police departments and the police unions all over this country have always protected their psychopathic  and killer cops. In the days before cell phones how many times do you think this happened and nobody ever found out about it?  Cops got away with the most unimaginable brutality because nobody ever knew about it. They didn't even have body cams for a long long time. They could kill somebody and get away with it. No body cams. Nobody to video it on their cell phones. If they shot somebody who was unarmed they could always plant a weapon on that person to make it look like they did it in self-defense. These things happened all the time. Watch the old Al Pacino movie “Serpico” for example  if you want to see how corrupt the police have been historically in this country. That's why they keep doing what they do.  It's a culture of brutality and violence and it's always covered up and the “blue wall of silence” is always there. It's them against us. Just hope that you're never a victim. I have been and I'm not even black. And I'm older. I know what it's like.
