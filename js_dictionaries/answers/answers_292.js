The rest of the purpose is to find any obvious faults. Just be honest with the dealer; “I'm thinking of buying but I'm not sure I'll find this car will suit me”.  Dealers don't mind as long as you appear to be genuinely interested: if you don't like the car you're trying then they'll try to suggest other models they have in stock. But yes, they are under no obligation to offer anybody a test-drive so will often refuse if they think that you're just a joy-rider or a no-hoper. Some dealers insist upon a token deposit and a provisional sales-contract before allowing a test-drive. I always try to avoid that but it's not always possible, so I make certain that I get it in writing before the drive that my deposit is fully refundable without delay and in the same form I paid it if I change my mind for any reason at all. Also get a receipt for any deposit before the drive. Also “token deposit” means exactly that. £50 to £100 maximum.", 2465, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],
