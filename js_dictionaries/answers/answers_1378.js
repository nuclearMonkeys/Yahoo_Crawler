If you asked God (ie through the scriptures) you would find nothing to suggest you should remember His birth or a Jewish ceremony..  The way God asks us to remember him is found in 1 Corinthians 11:26 and it is to do with the Breaking of bread and the partaking of wine, \"For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lords death until he comes.\" This is how we are asked to remember him.

	74509 : ["I'm quite frustrated with Rooney wanting to leave Man United,but I wouldn't call him whore or give such similar abuses like those plastic fans.Rooney was my favourite player since he joined Man United.It's why I'm very shocked with Rooney's imminent departure,for I thought he'd played football for the game. First Glazers are villains for the United fans at Stretford End.Now that Rooney claims he had no ankle injury in public and the media publishes it a big hoo haa is being made,and now you all(the same Man United fans at Stretford End on Thurs morning Singapore time) treat Rooney worse than even Heinze and Glazers are heroes? For me two villains remain - it's the Glazer family who should take blame for Rooney's departure and the media hypocrites who stirred the fans against Rooney.What did Glazers do with the Ronaldo money?Nothing but interest payments instead of looking for players we need for the right positions. On the other hand Rooney is partly responsible for having had affairs behind his wife's back and contradicting Fergie's statements in public.If Rooney wanted to leave,he should've told Fergie after the World Cup in a way such that us Man United fans would understand him and Man United would look for a replacement.  However if Rooney wants to leave,it's fine by him.No player is bigger than the club,be it Ince,Beckham,Roy Keane or Rooney.I've witnessed players come and go,and Rooney's departure is nothing compared to those. As a Man United fan,as much as I'd feel betrayed by Rooney's wanting to leave Man United,I'd thank him for the six and a half or seven years he's contributed at Man United. My 12-year-old cousin,who's a Liverpool fan,also said Rooney needed to leave as Man United need the money to clear their debts.Even with the Rooney sale,you think Glazers would allow Fergie to find a quality replacement?No.Instead it'd go to Glazers' pockets as usual and Fergie and Gill would give their usual excuse of \"The market is being inflated\". Debt or no debt,Rooney or no Rooney,I'd still remain loyal with Man United throughout my whole life. Patel you probably didn't know Rooney enough,so STFU!", 8770, "Kibd6DSWaa", 3],

And the roots of   Claus are probably ancient Norse/Germanic religions, perhaps a connection with Odin and Yule. He has been Christianised by being identified with St Nicholas of Myra. Other supernatural beings and traditions of pre-Christian religions - such as fairies and elves - have also survived as part of   lore.

As such it should be up the HOUSE OF WORSHIP to issue a marriage license. Oh but what about the LEGAL form you'd say. Once again I have a solution. It's called CIVIL UNION, which is what a marriage for the Government is. No longer can people complain about who they can and can't marry, that would be up to the house of worship who they marry and it means nothing. No longer can the religious right say that marriage is a sacred vow to say who should and shouldn't be allowed to. No longer can couples complain they don't have the same rights, because EVERYONE would. No longer can couples complain about the TITLE as everyone is now in a Civil Union AND the Government can't do a thing about marriages. The religious right doesn't complain that Atheists can claim to be married, and that should be just a wrong if the real issue is that it's a religious thing.", 8776, "GAokOxaOaa", 2],

	74530 : ["You sound like a Messianic Gentile.  As to you Q, some Messianic Jews do   and/or Hanukkah and some don't.  It all very  much depends on what kind of environment a person is coming out of in their following Messiah Y'shua (Jesus, the Christ) and what G-d is moving them into next.  So, some still do Hanukkah and some do not. Same with  . Also, a lot of these things have to do with the believers in Messiah that are around us (personally).  For example, since we have no \"Christians\" in our family there is no pressure to \"observe\"  , as in the Dec 25th day. So we don't. That said, many Messianics DO have family that still honours as you do, a \"day\" for the birth of Messiah (Christ).  As for Hanukkah, the entire of Judaism observes (as a group) Hanukkah because it was a national day of observance even in Y'shua (Jesus') time. Messiah, himself, did not remove himself from a Hanukkah observance which can be found in the New Covenant (Testament) writings.  BUT we do not \"observe\" Hanukkah because Judaism has within it a whole myriad set of \"additional\" days in memorandum.  It is hard enough for us to keep the days G-d ordered to be kept in honor of Him.  That said, it is an abomination for anyone to neglect to help out a relative/stranger amongst themselves with needs just because it is not a day ordered in the Bible for honouring Him.  For that reason, though it is \" \" time, we give to orphans in need. That has nothing to do with  /Hanukkah, it has everything to do with being Christ (Messiah) like.", 8772, "o5Y6Agltaa", -2],
