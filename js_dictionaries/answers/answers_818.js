The thicker the skin, and the more pith there is, the less likely you are to achieve the texture that you are hoping for. Only thing you can do is to experiment with the tools and produce you have on hand. Start with a known, juicier orange with a thin skin.Â ", 6529, "pCTN3G3oaa", 1],

Vegetarians usually pay more attention to what they eat, and tend to avoid foods that are not healthy:Â  soda pop, chocolate, sugar, candy, fried foods, potato chips, ice cream, etc.Â  And THAT is what makes them healthy. The presence or absence of meat on your plate has no impact on how healthy you are or are not.Â  It is just that someone who does not pay attention to what they put on their plate is likely to not eat AS healthy. Regardless of whether you eat meat or not, HALF of every plate needs to be vegetables (not including potatoes or corn, since they are mostly just simple starches and not that good for you). I disagree with Robert S.Â  My sister was a vegetarian for 35 years, and taught vegetarian nutrition. You can be JUST as healthy being a vegetarian.Â  It is VEGANS who have to pay special attention to getting the proper nutrients that they need .. the lack of ALL animal products creates nutritional lacks that necessitate taking supplements.
