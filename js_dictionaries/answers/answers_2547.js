	133176 : ["Do you know the Syrian government delegation blamed the opposition for the \"failure\" of the Geneva peace talks? NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains. Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists want war between Russia and Germany over Serbia from June to October on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic).  Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high).  Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrecred after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8-10 months.   Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep.  Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist.  Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia.  Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer.  Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets.  Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light.  Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on highway. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell. Forgive me.                 ", 11174, "None", 0],

We must understand win or loss is the part of the game.  sportsmanship ★----------------★  In past cricket has been called as gentleman's game because they believed in courtesy, fairplay and sportsmanship. The spirit of cricket calls for honesty and good Sportsmanship. But this is ruined. It started with sledging went up to scolding & hurting the players mentally.  ☛ If there is situation where avoiding sportsmanship gives a win, I will go for the sportsmanship. ✖ If I avoid sportsmanship & my team wins the match, then our team may get an award. some of diehard fans will happy. But most of the my own nation supports will criticize me. ✔ If I show sportsmanship despite of the result of the match, then our team might loose the match. But we will win the hearts of the fans. Not only my own nation fans but also fans from other(opposition) will love us.  So many rules created to keep the sportsmanship(spirit of the game). Some of them are 1. Only two fielders are allowed in the space between square leg and long stop.   This rule was enforced to prevent the use of the outlawed bodyline bowling tactic, in which bowlers would deliberately bounce the ball into the unprotected areas of a batsman. 2. A maximum of 5 players may be employed in the outfield and a minimum of 2 to guard the off side throughout the match.    This rule was created after the one test match(searching for ref), where 6 runs needed in ball. Fielding captain set all the fielders at boundary. This is totally unfair. So max 5 fielders rule created. There are other rules for batsmen & bowlers. All these are created just to keep the spirit of the game(sporting spirit)", 11174, "R4DBpxQcaa", 0],
	133194 : ["Depends on what the thing is which you are talking about and also what the opposition has done in the match prior to the thing that requires the decision. If you are talking about the Ian Bell situation, well sportsmanship would have said you would not have appealed in the first place.  Everyone including Dhoni knew that Bell was walking to the dressing room for the break, so only a bad sport would have even attempted to stump him.  Commonsense ended up prevailing and as a result some consider it good sportsmanship, I consider it more commonsense. If you were to choose option 2, all it means is you know you have just made a break through.  What is to say that if you took option 1 that the very next ball you are not going to get the wicket?  Realistically all it means is that in an ODI or T20 you are 10% closer to getting all the batsman out or in a test you are 5% closer to having taking all 20 wickets in the match. I don't reckon too many people if they played in a world cup final would go for the sportsmanship option over winning the biggest match they are ever likely to plan in.  If your team needed two runs to win with one ball left and then on the last ball you took a tight single to tie.  The throw at the stumps hits you instead of the stumps and deflects far enough to run the second run safely and win the world cup.  I don't care how sporting you are, you would take the single even though it is not in the spirit of the game, just the same as I would.  If it was just any old game like in the round matches that would be different.", 11174, "zKMkkYWNaa", -4],

What we didn't know, was our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin', so we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know, it was kinda like old squares in the battle like you see in the calendar named \"The Battle of Waterloo\" and the idea was: shark comes to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark he looks right into ya. Right into your eyes. And, you know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be living... until he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all the poundin' and the hollerin', they all come in and they... rip you to pieces. You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand. I know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday morning, Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland.
