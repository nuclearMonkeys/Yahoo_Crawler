Before the \"current practice\" the pronoun used in cases of a sentence that was ambiguous or inclusive regarding gender was  the male pronoun which was a very long-standing convention in most Indo-European languages including even ancient languages such as Biblical Hebrew. That is to say: a sentence like this in modern times - A person should look both ways before they cross the street. was incorrect before around 1980-1985. (Why: pronoun does not agree in number with its antecedent.) The correct form was: - A person should look both ways before he crosses the street. In other words we've never used neuter \"it\" to refer to people. In any case, as far as I know the use of \"they\" as a singular inclusive pronoun originated about the time I mentioned, around 1980 or so. Notes: - in the late 70s I learned \"use the masculine pronoun\" in high school - about 1981 I learned at university that some people considered \"they\" to be more proper / politically correct in such cases", 6458, "g9g3fOYyaa", 2],
