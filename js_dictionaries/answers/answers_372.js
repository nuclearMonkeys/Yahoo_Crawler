	19987 : ["Now days the crew consists of two people, both of which ride in the cab of the controlling locomotive. The checking for hot boxes and other things that were done in the past from the caboose are either automated beside the track installations or controlled from the cab. So cabooses have been replaced with end of train devices. Which have lights and a pressure sensor that transmits air line pressure readings from it to the cab. The few times a caboose might still be seen are on local freights that are picking up or setting out cars on industrial sidings. With modern cabs able to hold the additional needed workers that even is not always the case. So no there are no cabooses to hold the conductor at the rear end of the train. The conductor rides with the engineer (and is the back up engineer), brakemen and firemen are no longer  job titles on mainline modern day railroads. Now if you to to say Durango Colorado, they might still need fireman and uses cabooses. But this is a running steam era railroad and often seen in films.", 3284, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 2],
	19988 : ["If you watch Virtual Railfan videos on Youtube, you will occasionally see a caboose. On one occasion, a train was hauling spent nuclear fuel. The caboose probably carried armed guards to make sure no bad guys stole the cargo.", 3284, "MJTeqJXDaa", 3],
	19989 : ["Cabooses are only used on tourist railroads (and not always), and on rare occasions freight railroads might use one for a special purpose, such as for publicity if the railroad still owns any that are in operable condition. Virtually all cabooses were sold or turned into scrap years ago.  A small number of them can be found in railroad displays and museums.  A handful also ended up in private hands for the owners to turn into housing or hobby uses.", 3284, "2EVoNHHbaa", 3],
	19990 : ["In Britain passenger trains tend not to have changes in their configurations. There is an motor unit with driver's cab at both ends, and a number of identical carriages in between.

	19991 : ["Traditionally the cars closest to the locomotive were not used for passengers. Mail cars, baggage cars would be there. If you have rode behind a steam locomotive on grade you will know why. Next the smoking car.

	19994 : ["-I spent my first 17 years very near the railroad tracks.  I grew up in a very small rail town.  I don't think I ever really paid much attention to them except when a cousin was there who was obsessed with trains.  Every time he heard a train he would take off for the station.  Of course, it became my job to follow him and drag him back.  My father was an engineer and my grandfather was a conductor. ", 3287, "8sbhZXuQaa", 0],

	19997 : ["The wheels on a train are tapered and flanged. This taper forces the rails to spread if there are no ties (sleepers). Just how many ties not being secure is not known to me. Once the wheel or wheels drop off, when they come to in gauge track- it rips that track up and sooner or later the couplers part. This results in a mess of cars and tangled rails.", 3282, "QpP1xJ4Naa", 0],
	19998 : ["If there were literally no ties, it would not be track at all, just two lengths of rail. Track is composed of two rails held in exact parallel to each other an exact distance apart by the ties. If some of the ties failed, then the weight of the train would force the rails further apart than they should be, causing the train's wheels to drop between them and so derailing the train.", 3282, "IY4QSajIaa", 1],

That seems like a pretty accurate range of damages.  Should be between those two numbers.", 3289, "2yFSkim8aa", 0],
	20003 : ["The RR can't simply \"bill\" the trucking company. In order to \"bill\" someone for something you have to have a pre-established business relationship. My cell phone provider, utility companies, and doctors can \"bill\" me for services because I signed contracts or financial agreements with them saying I'd pay for the services they give me. The train company *could* sue the trucking company to recover losses but they'd have to go to court. In court the train company would have to prove that the trucking company was negligent and that the incident cost them money. They could also threaten to sue in the hopes of winning an out-of-court settlement but the trucking company would only pay up if they thought the train company had a valid case. In my opinion its very unlikely they would do anything. Just get a tow truck out there to clear the truck from the track and then trains can resume service with a little delay.", 3289, "Jvx658HFaa", 2],
