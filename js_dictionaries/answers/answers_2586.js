Example: Studying the way the human brain transmits electrical impulses throughout the body in order to make it function. eugenics is the study of improving a species.  This doesn't necessarily mean through the encorporation of artificial additions.  It can be genetic.  Example: The idea of altering DNA in order to produce the desired results.

A Pararescueman must be MFF qualified and Combat Diver qualified. A Pararescueman assigned to a Special Tactics squardon will be trained and qualified with demolitions. Does that mean he now has the same mission as a SEAL?  No. His primary mission is still personnel recovery. Even when he's attached to a SEAL team, he's providing a capability to the SEAL team that they don't have. Same training .. different expertise and focus. I provice the above to explain to you that even though many SOF units and teams have the same training and qualifications, how and why they use them can be different and surround different circumstances. You will not see SEALs performing FID on any massive or indepth level. It's not their mission and they aren't trained for it beyond the baby steps. For Army SF, this is their bread and butter .. they live, eat and breathe FID and UW.  It has only been since the start of the Iraq war that SF has been jumping more and more into the DA mission. Have they always been capable of performing it and have they performed DA in the past?  Yes, of course. But it was never their focus as it has become recently .. so this is a recent trend with SF doing so many DA missions due to operational necessity. You can also assign the same exact operation to a SEAL team and an Army ODA and it will be accomplished in very different ways. I won't get into the details of that, but there are differences in mindset, application of tactics and how they each approach their problems. This is because they attract different types of people, as a general rule, when they are recruiting. Hope this helps.", 11263, "None", 0],

	135154 : ["Genetic engineering, recombinant DNA technology, genetic modification/manipulation (GM) and gene splicing are terms that apply to the direct manipulation of an organism's genes.[1]  Genetic engineering is different from traditional breeding, where the organism's genes are manipulated indirectly. Genetic engineering uses the techniques of molecular cloning and transformation to alter the structure and characteristics of genes directly. Genetic engineering techniques have found some successes in numerous applications. Some examples are in improving crop technology, the manufacture of synthetic human insulin  through the use of modified bacteria, the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells, and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse  (cancer mouse) for research. The genetic engineering of humans has raised many controversial ethical  issues. While negative genetic engineering (gene therapy) does indeed raise a debate, the use of genetic engineering for human enhancement arouses the strongest feelings on both sides.[5] Genetic engineering is tested on animals, often including primates. Some animal rights activists find this inhumane.[6] Genetic modification of embryos can pose an ethical question about the rights of the baby. One belief is that every fetus should be free to not be genetically modified. Others believe that parents hold the rights to change their unborn children.[7] Still some believe that every child should have the right to be born free from preventable diseases. Molecular Biologist Lee M. Silver believes that unlike Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where a totalitarian government controls all of the genetic enhancements (they actually use eugenics instead of direct genetic modification) in society, the use of gene therapy to design children will be spread through what he calls “free market eugenics” (Silver 315). Wealthy families will opt to design their child with genetic advantages because other families are doing so, and everybody wants to provide their newborn child with the best opportunities in life, with a leg up on the competition. The greatest fear for Silver is that we will design so many children with germline gene therapy, that the families wealthy enough to design their children, will pass down these enhanced traits to future generations. This gene therapy will obviously cost money, and the less wealthy families will be left to procreate naturally, and introduce their children into the world disadvantaged from their first breath. The impact on society will be a new alignment of classes, no longer will we separate people by their ethnic differences, the new division will be between what Silver calls ‘the naturals' and ‘the GenRich', or genetically enhanced. The major worry here is that the ‘genetic gulf' between these two classes will become so wide that humans will become separate species (Silver 313).", 11271, "None", 0],

The scripture in Deut 28:15-68 clearly explain the curses upon Israel for the breaking Yah's laws and worshiping other G_ds. There are several prophecy's throughout the old and new testament of Israel being scattered throughout the four corners of the earth. The temple that you see today in Jerusalem is prophecy fulfilled and it was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans, which has scattered all the 12 tribes of Israel into Africa and then in later time as per prophecy mentioned in Deut 28:68, the Israelite s were sold into slavery...According to the prophecy mentioned in Deut 28:68, the only race of people who were sold into slavery by ships (bond men and bondwoman) were black people, as per scripture are the true descendants of the biblical Israelite's The so called Jews and/or Israelis that you see in Israel today are not the descendants of the Biblical Israelites, however does make you wonder why they don't call them selves Israelites, becuase the truth is knowed that Israel became a state after 1948 through the assistance of the United Nations after world war 2. These so called Jews in Israel today are impostors who lie about being the descendant of the biblical Israelites. 92% of the white jews that you see today are Ashkanazi's from the khazar empire, from the European region. They also believe in the Talmud, which is to them considered higher than the bible. This Talmud (oral law of Moses) is nothing but a book of hate and immorality. The Talmud is no where where mentioned in the Holy bible nor is it mentioned in theTanak (Torah) The word Judaism is also not mentioned in any of the scriptures or in the Tanak. Judaism is a MAN MADE RELIGION that has adopted the laws of YAH Genesis 15:13,14  And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;  And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. Acts 7:6 ,7  YAH (God) spoke to him (Abraham) in this way: 'Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' YAH (God) said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place (Israel) Revelation 2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Revelation 3:9 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Unfortunately, there are today people caling themselves \"Black Israelites\" who are racist and are misinformed about the true message of the Messiah. It's all about showing love and teaching salvation to another human being. (no matter the what color the person is)...I have come across many white Hebrew Israelites that are aware of the truth (in America and in Europe) and I find that to be a beautiful thing.....Salvation is for everyone (Yah is no respecter of persons and he does not care what color the person is, as long as they aware of the truth and what he requires)....Also we do not tolerate evil or lies that is being taught from other religions or cults....The Jews that you see today in Israel is a lie and right now the truth is coming to the world about this lie....
