Psycho Dude injured my tag team partner and not even my built up rage could help me get the win last week. But that was then... It's time to move on and think about what is in store for me tonight. It seems that I am taking on the arrogant and cocky Charlie Scene. It was just a couple of weeks ago that you and I were opponents in a tag team match that ended in a no contest. But tonight I will ensure you that their will be a winner. And that winner will be me.  You want to really talk about what happened last week? If you didnt know, the match was not a Handicap Match nor even a Triple Threat Match because Psycho Dude cowardly pushed PAIB off the top rope hard enough to injure and making him unable to compete last week. The only superstars competing in that match was me and Psycho Dude. I gave it everything I had but I came up short. You may have been victorious last week but like I said.. That was then and you should start worrying about tonight.  And what gives you the right to call me a jobber? I give just as much effort as anyone to step in a YWWA ring and I am jobber? I put my body on my line for the entertainment of other and I am a jobber? Let me give you a little piece of information before I knock some out of you tonight.  *The Golden Falcon opens his locker and pulls out a dictionary and starts skimming through it* Hmmm it seems the word \"jobber\" is not in the dictionary. Therefore the word is pointless and has no true meaning. Some people around here use it to try to call people a loser. The only people that can be called a loser are the people who dont give any effort. And Charlie, you thinking that our match is going to end in 5 seconds shows that you have no intentions of giving any effort tonight. But if you really want to lie on the ground and let me cover you to let me hold the record for the shortest victory in YWWA then that is fine by me. Because I can ensure you that it will not be me who is going to be losing in 5 seconds tonight. You should already know that the Golden Falcon and short matches can't go together in the same sentence. So if you hoping this match to be as quick as you can then you got another thing coming.", 9571, "H7GCB0Dtaa", 3],
	95985 : ["The first & last names of the characters are: BOY: Spencer Reid -- Criminal Minds character played by Matthew Gray Gubler. Both Spencer & Reid are on my favorites lists, however, I started liking them both long before Criminal Minds. Reid is my favorite boy name. Spencer is in the top 6 somewhere. GIRL: Ziva David -- NCIS character played by Cote de Pablo. Ziva is my favorite girl name overall, so yes, I love it & would use it. This is a name I heard of from the show & I fell in love with it. I also adore the pet-name / stage-name of the actress, which I heard first from her: Cote/Coté. Coté is a nickname sometimes given to girls named Maria José in Chile (where she was born).  Overall, yes, I would use Spencer & Ziva. I love both of them. I also love Reid, which is the last name of Spencer.  Those are just my overall favorite character names--however, Criminal Minds is my favorite show, so I would add, for the girl, Penelope Garcia (played by Kirsten Vangsness). I also love the name Penelope, nickname Elle. It's on my favorite list. Garcia is on my guilty pleasure list & I would even consider it for a middle name on a girl.

I expect a big night for me and I will become the new YWWA Hardcore Champion. It looks like I'm not in a match again this week which is fine for me. I don't have to waste my time and effort with the big event coming up, but the best thing about not wrestling this week is that these hypocritical redneck fans can't watch me. It looks like 2 of my 4 opponents will be involved tonight and I wouldn't mind if they tore each other apart. I am the best YWWA has to offer right now and I will be mad if I don't walk into an arena without gold around my waste. This shouldn't be a difficult match since I got the advantage on all of my opponents, I already proved I can beat Flunking Punk, Straight Edge Puke and Justina are going be showoffs and face each other for another time and then once again, it is EC Connection. It seems like every time I turn around, EC Connection is right there, I have had enough of this and he knows he can't get anywhere in his career without my help. Hey EC Connection, 23 Connection is dead, you were the one holding me from becoming in the main event a long time ago. Sure 23 Connection was a fun tag team for the crowd, but who cares about the crowd. It is about becoming champion. Every night I wrestled as a tag team, I had to come out with a fake smile, and now that I am more ruthless than ever, I will end your career at the Survivor Series. Whether I win or lose the match, the second I heard you got into the championship match that I deserved to be in by myself, my number one goal was to splat your head with the steel chair.

	96003 : ["In most music, the people tend to perform for their immediate peers.  They tend to use the vernacular and mannerisms of that area. Since K-Ci and JoJo came out of NC there has been an influx of artists using country slang and exaggerated drawls.  ie,.. \"it's getting hot in Hur...\"  and other stereotypical miss-speaks.   The reason for the popularity is the beats, most of the music is very danceable, but I can't stand the words.  I started my DJ career right in the heart of NC when rap was coming mostly from New York and DC.  Yes I mean the 70s and 80s.  Even then people were asking \"what the hell are they talking about?\"  I know people that thought  \"White Lines\" was about driving too fast.  The point is that they were using local slang and mannerisms.   Also, you have to look at the number of \"one-hit wonders\" that come out of the south.  They are all following the \"country grammar\" model of rapping.  Why,... because it is proven and successful.  The reason you may feel a little dumber is simple,... lack of any real message, delivered with little or no production/polish.  There was a time when you had to have some real talent in order to get a record deal.  Today, I can record a quality album in my office , use the internet for distribution and I promise you, if the beats are banging, someone will buy it and you'll hear it in a club next week.

From Cleveland, Ohio!! Weighing in at 235 pounds! He is the greatest superstar to grace a YWWA ring, he is a future world champion, he is the next world tag team champion, and he is undoubtably the most handsome performer in all of the world! And he is the man who will prove to everyone why he is the BEST to ever wrestle. I am not overrated, I am rated exactly where I should be. The best. If you dont like it, your gonna have to get over it. Charlie Scene came to YWWA with a plan to take over, and thats exactly what I am doing. On Breakdown I lead my team to a victory, and I will do the same thing tonight. I will lead myelf to a win, and at Survivor Series and become one half of the new world tag team champions along with my partner CMP. Who is lucky enough to be called my partner and to be able to share this ring with me. Many wish they had that oppurtunity. But thats all they will ever do is wish. Mine and CMP's success as a tag team is only overshadowed by the fact that people say putting the two best togther isnt fair. See we get hate, which is what keeps us winning. We thrive off of proving people wrong. and at Survivor Series we will do that again when we prove everyone wrong and show them that British Connection is nothing near the best team in YWWA, and that they are not the next YWWA tag team champions. We are.  But as for tonight, tonight I face a new team. Atleast a member of it. Golden Falcon. Falcon, I have seen you around, and to be honest, im impressed. I am impressed with the amout of failure that one team has. I really didnt think you could more of a failure than BC, but you guys set the bar higher everytime I see you. I mean you had a shot to defeat the next world chamion PD last week in basically a 2 on 1 match, and he STILL beat you. Just like he will do to that loser Graduation Bear. Falcon, tonight when you face the quintessential stud muffin, the lyrical miracle, and the sexual intellectual, every womans infatuation, across the whole entire nation, they like the pulsation, but they love the penetration, and i can sense your frustration because all you get it masturbation, you can use your imagination, or I can give you a demonstration! Falcon, I am coming for you tonight, and you better hope Your partner doesnt get involved, I wouldnt want to injure a whole team by myself. Not that it would be that much of a problem with you.

I admit it PD, I have fallen short of winning the big belt multiple times. But big things don't just happen all at once, you have to go step by step. You see, unlike other superstars who kiss *** to get to the bottom, I earn my opportunities. Ever since me and Obama split up, according to PD, I've done nothing. Really? I may have not won championship gold, but I sure as hell have done ALOT ever since Obama left YWWA. Before when I was with Obama, I was nothing. I was just a small cruiserweight stuck in the tagteam division with no other goals to shoot for. Nobody took me seriously, nobody thought I could survive in singles competition. But I've proven those people wrong. I CAN succeed in singles competition. And I will prove that by winning some gold. And liek every rookie, I will start out by winnign the smaller titles. The majority of every main eventer always starts out on the midcard, winnign U.S and I-C titles. I for one am one of them.
