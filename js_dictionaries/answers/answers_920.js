	51252 : ["As the other answers said, your daughter needs to make a choice: Either to become a career woman or house wife. Med school is stressful enough as it is, let alone caring for a child. Most couples cannot afford to put their kids in daycare. There's usually a clear line between people who are well established (have a house, respected career, etc.) before bringing children into the picture. They're typically much more successful in life. It's frightening that this couple is going into the medical field and don't know about birth control.", 7195, "G73AFOZ2aa", 0],
	51253 : ["Your daughter wasn't smart to start a family while she was still in med school. That's my first comment. My brother is a doctor, and he didn't even GET MARRIED until after he and his wife (who was his classmate) graduated and started their residencies. How in blazes your daughter expects to be able to manage caring for an infant while doing her clinical rotations eludes me, as it should you- not to mention her husband, who I presume is also a medical student. People in medical school don't control their lives- the SCHOOL they attend does that. I saw that with my brother, and with other friends I have that have been through medical school. And if your daughter has completed her second year, then the most intensive part of her training is still in front of her. She's going to have days over the next couple of years when she'll be so exhausted from work that she can't even remember her own name, or what day it is. And she won't be getting PAID for being an intern- no intern IS EVER paid. Instead, SHE and your son in law will be the ones doing the paying- and not just in terms of money, either. And she's expecting to be able to take care of a nursing infant on top of all THIS? Is she out of her fricking MIND??? For that matter, are YOU out of YOURS?? Your daughter needs to WAIT to get pregnant again until AFTER she's through with her internship (the clinicals I just mentioned) and has at least begun her residency. If she's planning on entering one of the surgical specialties, she needs to wait even LONGER, because she'll have to do at least one or two surgical residencies in addition to the regular medical one. Yes, this will mean a long gap between pregnancies and the children's ages, but the alternative is her being so overwhelmed with work and family pressures that she ends up dropping out of school and wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loan money. Since that money is NOT dischargeable through bankruptcy, she WILL have to pay it back eventually. People who want to be doctors are usually smart enough and sensible enough to avoid situations like the one your daughter has now found herself in. It's unfortunate for her and for you that she couldn't, for whatever reason. This does not bode well for her future in medicine, because it's a sign of immaturity on both your daughter's and son in law's parts. It tells me that they weren't mature enough to use common sense (and contraception) when they had sex. That's not the behavior of adults who want to be professionals- it's the behavior of irresponsible TEENAGERS. I'm sorry that YOU are in this situation, Ma'am. Your daughter and son in law have acted like kids themselves, and they are going to pay a big price for doing so. As someone else on here said, it's scary to see two people (or maybe it's just your daughter) planning on medical careers who either don't know about or don't have the sense to use contraception when this is necessary. What could your daughter have been thinking when she and the hubby had sex? That she was Superwoman? That somehow, she'd be able to manage having a nursing baby at home while she was spending 16, 18, and sometimes 24 hours per day working at whichever teaching hospital is part of the med school? I get it, she probably thought she was invincible, and that this would never happen to her. WRONG. On so many counts. For your part, instead of encouraging them to have another baby, you might want to consider suggesting that they give their current one up for adoption, so that he or she will at LEAST have a chance of having a stable home to grow up in. Otherwise, I don't see good things on the horizon here for anyone- and the baby will pay the biggest price of all.", 7195, "None", 3],

	51258 : ["Yes. The truth is that death leads to heaven or hell, and the only way to heaven is through faith in Jesus Christ. The Bible is very clear that no one can earn their way to heaven since good works do not pay for sins. See Gal. 2:16, Rom. 3:23-28, 4:4-5, Eph. 2:8-9, Tit. 3:5. The only way to heaven is by believing in Jesus for His free gift of eternal life. Jesus shed His blood on the cross as the full payment for our sins. He did all the work; all He requires of us is that we believe in Him. Once you believe in Jesus Christ to save you, you are secure forever! Because we have all sinned against a perfectly holy and righteous God, we all deserve eternal separation from God in hell (Rom. 6:23). However, God loves us so much that He sent His only Son Jesus to die on the cross as our Substitute so we don't have to go to hell. Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose from the grave three days later (1 Cor. 15:3-4). He gives eternal life freely to anyone who simply believes in Him for it. No one can be saved by doing good works.

	51264 : ["the divine truth about them is they are a cult full of pedophiles, not to mention all the torture, burning at the stake non believers, the spanish  inquisition, their materialism  Inquisition Procedure At root the word Inquisition signifies as little of evil as the primitive \"inquire,\" or the adjective inquisitive, but as words, like persons, lose their characters by bad associations, so \"Inquisition\" has become infamous and hideous as the name of an executive department of the Roman Catholic Church. All crimes and all vices are contained in this one word Inquisition. Murder, robbery, arson, outrage, torture, treachery, deceit, hypocrisy, cupidity, holiness. No other word in all languages is so hateful as this one that owes its abhorrent preeminence to its association with the Roman Church. In the Dark Side of Christian History, Helen Ellerbe describes how the same men who had been both prosecutor and judge decided upon the sentence of heresy. Once an Inquisitor arrived to a heresy-ridden district, a 40 day period of grace was usually allowed to all who wished to confess by recanting their faith. After this period of grace had finished, the inhabitants were then summoned to appear before the Inquisitor. Citizens accused of heresy would be woken in the dead of night, ordered, if not gagged, and then escorted to the holy edifice, or Inquisition prison for closer examination.", 7207, "None", -1],

	51275 : ["If by \"we\" you mean Christians then it's in the Bible.  God refers to His own self in the masculine....Jesus referring to the Father.  I f you are referring in general like when non-religious people say \"God will help me, He always does\" then it's grammatical.  Masculine is the default gender when we don't know what gender something/someone is.  Referring to God as \"Goddess\" implies paganism and is not Christian.  Even the religions that ordain women (which is contrary to the Bible) do not call them \"priestess\" but \"priest\" or \"minister\".", 7211, "None", 1],
	51276 : ["Jesus revealed the Father. The Bible teaches that God is Spirit. A spirit, by definition, is invisible. It does not have any physical form. But, God the Son took upon Himself human nature, including a physical form when He came to the earth. The Father and the Son share the same Spirit. The Spirit is also referred to as “HE” -- can you see how nicely God's ‘triunity' comes into play. <Too much I think, for the carnal mind because it is super-rational> In the Bible, ALL pronouns used for God are masculine and never feminine. It is a simple fact that God revealed Himself to man in a masculine form. Yes, God sometimes used female analogies, but so did Paul and we all agree that he was a man. When God created Adam, He created him in His image [Genesis 1:25]. \"Man\" refers to mankind, not Adam individually [Genesis 1:27]. \"They\" indicates this generic meaning. This means that God created mankind (male and female); they did not evolve from a lower form of life [Matthew 19: 4]; [Mark 10: 6]. Adam and Eve were not like Siamese twins or bisexual. God formed Eve from Adam's rib, not from half of his body. He created them male and female---there should be no confusion unless we are trying to pervert God's Word. In the image of God' refers to personality, moral and spiritual qualities that God and man share (ie self-awareness, God-consciousness, freedom, responsibility, speech, moral discernment, etc.). It distinguishes people from animals who have no God-consciousness, although they have a conscious life.  Therefore, we can be followers of Jesus and pursue holiness. “In the image of God” also indicates “oneness” -- as a husband and wife demonstrate oneness in their marriage they reflect the unity of the Godhead. Oneness involves being in agreement with God's will and purposes. If “oneness” is essential for an orchestra or a team to achieve a common purpose, why should it be different for a family? In another sense man is the image of God in that he rules, creates (procreates) as God does, thus reflecting God. There is thus no basis for these bizarre allegations that God is a female or perhaps a bit of both. It is absurd and blasphemous to portray God as a sexual being. Get it? Good! But if some can reject God, and deny their spiritual composition, then it is not surprising that they will also reject male and female genders as the only two identities. Some are quite at ease with how they express their gender identity, whether that is “trans male/trans female/non-binary/assigned male or female/ OR another gender variation.” The mirror may not be particularly useful either… You are confined only by the walls you build yourself---our thoughts, deeds, and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy. Ever wondered what or who might be causing all this lack of certainty? Perhaps evolution… Does it not have the ability to produce more confusion than the planet can sustain? OR the serpent of old. >>Truth emerges more readily from error than confusion and we know who the father of confusion is, don't we?", 7211, "02nizFWwaa", 1],
	51277 : ["Yes, telling him would certainly be the best thing for both of you, because your relationship won't be based on false premises. If you are open to the idea of there being a God, just try this simple prayer: \"God, if you are real, please reveal yourself to me\". That's all it takes. Say it every day and things will begin to happen that you would never expect. God loves you, and no loving parent ignores the needs of their beloved children.", 7212, "2rxRSc6eaa", 1],
	51278 : ["Theism/atheism is about belief; gnosticism/agnosticism is about knowledge. If you don't believe that gods exist you are an atheist. That's it. You either believe or you don't, there are no shades of grey, no halfway point. The agnostic says that it is impossible to know that gods exist therefore whether they do or not has to be a matter of belief. Most atheists and many theists are agnostics. You don't believe in gods but are open to hearing evidence that they exist. That describes most atheists. Unfortunately no-one has yet provided any testable evidence for the existence of any of the many thousands of gods so it is likely you will remain an atheist all your life and, as time goes by, the possibility of the existence of any god will become weaker and weaker.", 7212, "80fd01eb6f2c0108807132e883d20ea5aa", 0],
