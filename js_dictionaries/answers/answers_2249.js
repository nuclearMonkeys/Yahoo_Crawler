	118242 : ["Michael means a lot to me. I grew up listening to his music and I've always appreciated him as a person. Michael reminds me of my childhood memories. When I was a kid, I was a big fan. I remember how I was keen on collecting his photos and searching for his albums which were released before I was born. I used to keep any magazine articles written about him. His posters were hung on every wall in my room and I used attack people giving negative comments about him.  Concerning the way his songs affected me, \"Earth Song\" has affected me to great extent. This song motivated me to try do anything to participate in protecting the environment . So, as a kid, I refused to throw any garbage in the street, unlike many other kids, just because Michael was an idol to me, though \"Earth Song\" is not about environmental problems of that sort. I just wanted to have any positive contribution to the environment out of my love for Michael. Now, as an adult, I am still keen on protecting the environment as much as I can just because it has become a habit thanks to Michael and because I am convinced that I am doing the right thing.  I almost stopped listening to Michael about five years ago and started to become interested in rock music though he was still one of my favourite singers. However, I don't know why I remembered him suddenly a few days before his death. I just felt that I have this urge to listen to him and kept on replaying \"Give In to Me\" again and again. I also watched many other songs like \"They Don't Care About Us,\" \"Man in the Mirror,\" \"One Day in Your Life\" and \"Billie Jean.\" Such strange coincidence makes it harder for me to overcome the sadness I feel. Michael was and will always be a great artist. May his soul rest in peace.", 10539, "QdEoNhwUaa", 69],
	118243 : ["The world has lost a true and rare star in the form of Michael Jackson. Never has there been such an amazing talent as him. His talent and fan base has been compared to that of The Beatles and Elvis, but i think its fair to say that he is a legend much bigger than any other band or artist. His songs were truly influential to the music world and set a standard so high that nothing since has really compared. There has been no other artist who has achieved such dizzy heights as Jackson.  For me, Michael Jackson inspired me with his dancing skill and his songs. There isn't a song of his that i don't love. I know most of the words to his songs, and could watch his dancing for hours on end.  Now i wasn't some super fan, but i believe he was a true idol and i don't think the world will see such a talent ever again. I feel he was misunderstood and his quirky (and sometimes a little off the wall) ways were taken completely the wrong way by the world. It saddens me that the world is such a judgemental and harsh place, and i wish he could have seen how many loyal and loving fans he had. RIP Michael Jackson.", 10539, "None", 4],

	118256 : ["I read that witnesses reported that Jackson was often dizzy and they speculated that he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. That even some medical professionals publicly stated their belief that the singer had body dysmorphic disorder. This is a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how he is perceived by others. Why didn't anybody around him do something about this? However, Michael Jackson, as with several other major pop celebrities, had a darker side. His obsession with surgery was always a source of fascination and sometimes amusement. His obsession with children on the other hand was somewhat disturbing. This may indeed have been innocent but if the reports are correct then we should definitely have been concerned about the behaviour of a man in his position and of his age. At the end of the day, there's no smoke without fire and if his antics behind the closed doors of Neverland were as innocent as he claimed, then why did he 'pay off' all of his accusers?", 10539, "None", -3],

	118263 : ["My two best friends are Capricorns I talk to them nearly every day and have known them for years. They have confirmed that the things I said about Capricorns are true for them.  know two Capricorns who want to please everyone, and are worried about what they will say to make everyone happy in any given situation. Is this a trait of Capricorns or is it a coincidence that they both have this personality? Well. As far as I know they do not want to hurt people, in order to not look mean themselves. They can be quite vain, concearned about their image or actually, their reputation. They do not want other people to talk about things you did wrongf. They can be perfectionists, in a lot of ways, and relationships is one of them. Thet want to be perfect at work/school, or perfect wives/husbands, perfect friends. On the other hand you have to watch out a bit because because capricorns want to be so perfect all the time they can become quite selfish. However, they do not want to hear this, because being selfish is not a perfect personality trait ;) I can live with them though, but sometimes all they do is atalk about themselves and tend to forget that other peoples have lives as well and problems as well. So they are quite vain - but I did not mean to say that capricorns do not care about other people. They really do but you have to let them onow that you have something going on in order to understand, they wont ever be able to guess it.  It is important for capricorns that others are happy and pleased because they want to be good people, I know I am kinda repeating myself right now but a short summary would be, that capricorns when they throw a party for example, want to do it correctly and want to make sure that everyone likes their party. They want to be good to their guests, just as they would expect to be treated in a certain situation. Also, I read somewhere that if a Capricorn realizes their \"true-self\" or something like that they will give up their need for work and money and realize what's truly important: the people they love. Is that true?  Yes, I think it is. Once a capricorn realizes what is best for them they will not just give it up. Once they have put their minds to something, they will be stubborn about it forever for they do not like to be proven wrong.  However, this true-self realization does not always means family. My grandmother is a capricorn and she is 88 and still works. Her work is her life, she is veruy dedicated to her work and wont stop until she dies. She refuses to find other hobbys and maybe she does all this because her husband started the bisuness (he died 20 years ago) and she wants to finish it properly and make him proud, or maybe she wants to make enough famil for her kids or grand kids, I dont know. But we do not think she has to do this, she herself does. She works like crazy. My friends will never give up their families anmd do whatever it takes. One of my capricaorn best friends, the bestest of them, has been dumped recently. She thought she was going to marry the guy and have kids with him and live happily ever after. Now she is really reallt sad, but, she refuses to give up her dream of living in a forest with a fireplace and no work, she wants to be a house-mom. And even though the guy she had in mind is not there any more she is determined to find away to make her dream come true anyway. The other friend is also really stubborn. Once they really like people, or love (like family) they refuse to hear anything bad about them. Here their stubbornness comes in. To family and true friends Capricorns are loyal their entire lives. I think my capricorn friends will be my friends until I die.  What else can I tell you about capricorns? Well. they are quite greedy, in a way that they always watch their money. They do not mind giving people their love and home-made stuff, but things that cost money are not easily gotten from them. This can be annoying, or handy (if it is your partner and you are a big spender) They also are very homey. Again, family is very imprtant for them, a safe environment. They do not like hasty decisions, and you need to approach them carefully. They kind of mistrust too outgoing people and prefer to make friends with the shy ones -- only when a capricorn really really trust someone, he or she dares to be outgoing and crazy with them. But overall capricorns are really scared of what people will think about them if they do something silly, crazy or impulsive.  I used to be very annoying with one of my friends because she used to be pretty crazy when we were together, but when other people were present too she suddenly became silent and shy and pleasing and I was like, WHY do you care? Why do you pretend to be someone else? But now I know that it is just in her nature to be very cautious and concearned about the way she looks.acts and I respect that (most of the time haha) I hope this story helps you a bit Cheers!
