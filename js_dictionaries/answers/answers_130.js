I have found that you really can kill people with kindness. Not that I'm a super nice guy, but I like to think I have the ability to win people over. Sometimes it doesn't work and I have to avoid certain individuals completely because they hate me no matter how I treat them.", 1063, "br6FtxjMaa", 3],

	6504 : ["At work?.... Cmonnn girl. In life you truly have to know when to just suck it up & roll with the punches. The work place is one of those times you seriously need to suck it up & as I like to say “kill em with kindness”.   I don't care who they are {supervisor or not} if someone asks you to do something you shouldn't ever just be saying “no” at work.  The adult thing to do would be to do what they asked & then later say something like “hey, I understand your under stress too but how you talked to me wasn't very kind”.   You talk about empathy.. yet have you ever thought maybe the person who was rude to you is going through something terrible & that's reflected in their behavior? Ever heard the saying “be kind to rude people, they need it the most”. I'm a nurse & can tell you people are rude to me DAILY, verbally & even physically abusive sometimes. I always have to remain professional & come from a place of kindness & understanding instead of getting worked up.   When people are rude {specially in the work place} it's usually not on purpose & nothing personal, people are stressed the heck out.   Girl empathy & compassion... I think YOU need more of it.  Life isn't all about you & Your “self respect”. If you actually want to get into self respect, it takes a stronger individual to be kind to someone who's hostile where as it takes a much weaker person to “pop off”, get angry & demand respect from others.   Self respect comes from YOURSELF.. not the validation of others including your coworker.  Woahhh there girly.. you clearly have some issues with your inner self you need to work out & reflect on bc you are just so defensive. Instead of being so defensive.. take a moment.. breathe & consider what others are saying. You're the one who asked for advice.. or were you just asking for approval of your own actions? You shouldn't need approval if you know what you're doing is the right thing. You seem to hold a lot of hostility in your own heart. Let me let you in on this... you really need to reflect because you being so focused on gaining others respect & “not being a doormat” is a defense mechanism. People like myself who are kind to others no matter how badly they treat me.. do so because at the end of the day, I know who the heck I am. I know I am respected & loved. Might not be by them but that's ok bc hatred only effects their heart.. not mine. Why would I ever let another human being rob me from the joy inside my own heart? Why would I ever even let them inside my head rent free?     Be carful girl.. you definitely have the spirit of defensiveness & anger in your heart & at the end of the day it will only eat at you. Nobody else. You think the person who was rude to you is thinking about you right now? Ask yourself that.   I also love & live by the quote “be so kind to your enemies that they feel ashamed for their way of treating you”.. that right there is TRUE revenge.  Ok I understand your point. I do. Instead of simply saying a cold hard no.. you could also explain why you said no. Specially if you have your own work & deadlines. Simply explain that to them.   You honestly just crossed a line by comparing ANYTHING in this entire situation to Hitler. Hitler mass murdered 6 million Jewish people.. that is not even close to the same as a coworker Rudely asking you to do something. I truly can't even believe you would make a comparison like that. If someone asked me to do something wrong.. Ofcourse I would say no. A coworker asking you to do something.. is in no way shape or form wrong. Also you say “these people”.. so I take it.. it's more than one coworker you have an issue with? Have you ever stopped to think.. maybe it's not them..  maybe it's you. You are the problem.   I couldn't imagine viewing the world in such a negative light, assuming that people are generally bad. You & I have a very opposing view on life & that's ok. I wish you all the best  & hope that you find true inner peace. A truly peaceful heart bc right now your heart is so uneasy. I choose to hold onto hope for every human being no matter what. Every human being no matter how mean or cruel.. has the ability to change. 💖 People who do me wrong.. that's on them. I will still live in kindness love & always remain with a pure & peaceful heart willing to help them and any human being who needs its... because at the end of the day justice is not mine to serve.. I sleep soundly knowing their is a God who they will one day face for their actions.   Bless your heart. ", 1063, "eW4ksnQEaa", 0],
	6505 : ["That's only part of it. A real man knows how to deescalate a situation if possible because no one completely wins a fight. Sometimes you have to fight to be a man. Often you need to be the peace keeper to be a real man. But a real man also knows he needs to be a good role model to his kids and their friends. He knows he needs to be a solid provider of a healthy home for his family. He knows his family comes before his own playtime and will often make sacrifices to put his family first. He'll teach his sons that manhood is not toxic and to ignore those who try to teach him otherwise. He will teach his sons to respect  girls the way he respects his own mother or sister, but also what the two different genders are for. He will teach his sons how to defend themselves and how to become responsible men to carry their world forward. He will teach his sons to not be deviants or criminals, to respect others and to follow the Lord. A real man will have a strong work ethic and instill that work ethic into his sons. Any male can start a fight or use his organ to impregnate a female, but that doesn't make him a man. If he is not there to help raise that child and be a provider as his father, and to provide for that family he is simply a sack of s---.   ", 1051, "2EddmzfAaa", 2],

Nor would they even be on yahoo answers.   For the anxiety you are suffering from.. go to the psychiatrist & get on a prescribed medication.
