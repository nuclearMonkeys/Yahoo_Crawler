Social couples (eg anyone married, engaged, or together long-term) get invited together.  If you didn't have a significant other at their wedding, then obviously they wouldn't have to give you a plus one (ie to bring someone they don't know to a party they're paying for) You're being utterly unreasonable.  ", 4596, "IIC9e3JQaa", 3],

Alcohol gets involved, strippers trying to get you to spend money on them, etc. strippers flirting their way to guys pockets. Honestly I would only trust my man going to a strip club, if he was going with me. If he isn't willing to invite you, then nope. Sounds like he's still trying to experience his youth. I'm going to estimate your relationship with him isn't going to last especially if he thinks a strip club is acceptable in any circumstance, aside from the fact that he isn't taking your unhappiness with it into consideration. I'm 23, and purely do not go for guys my age specifically for this reason. He is an immature one that hasn't experienced enough of life yet. ", 4587, "EJDVPc0Taa", -2],

If he isn't, then it's still inexcusable and you still need to break up. Healthy couples talk out their problems together. Communication was already terrible between you two, screaming arguments are not normal or ok. You also already knew in your gut that he isn't taking you seriously.

A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money).

Feminists claim it signifies the expectation that women are to be virgins when they marry. In reality, the white wedding dress was made popular by Queen Victoria when she decided to wear a white wedding dress instead of the popular colored wedding dress of the time. The common women of the time responded to Queen Victoria wearing a white wedding dress by wanting a white wedding dress of their own and just like that the tradition was born. Yeah, it has nothing to do with virgins at all.  2. Fathers walking their daughter down the aisle feminists believe signifies a transfer of ownership when in reality it signifies a transfer of responsibility and family.  3. Women taking their husbands name is seen by feminists as a loss of her past family and a claim of ownership by her husband. Of course, neither one of these things is true. The name signify the wives membership of her husbands family, while her maiden name signifies her membership of her born family. Nothing is lost and everything is gained. ", 4607, "15coUBsxaa", -1],
