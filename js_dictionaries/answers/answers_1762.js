It is interesting to me that Muslims (especially converts from Judaism/Christianity who have been warned) cannot see the obvious connections between the Islamic Allah and the pagan Arab moon god al-ilah (i.e. \"the deity\" and also a name for a phase of the moon). Allahu-Akbar (Allah is greatest) is an obvious comparison of Allah to his wife (the sun), three daughters (Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat-stars whose names actually appear in the Koran) and a host of lesser Gods which has carried over from before Muhommad. The fact that Muhommads full name was Muhommad Abd-Allah, his fathers name was Abd-Allah and his uncles name was Obied-Allah simply stands as more evidence that the moon God Allah was already being worshipped (along with Baal and Zoroaster-other pagan astral deities worshipped by Arabs) before Muhommad was even born and before Allah was supposed to have revealed himself to Muhommad. I'm sorry if you don't like my answer, but it's true. Muhommad simply did away with the other pagan Gods. The Arabs already believed that \"Allah was the greatest\" God of all their Gods...Muhommad just convinced them to believe that Allah was the ONLY God. But, he is not God! And, Muhommad was not a prophet of God! Allah is the false God which is often mentioned in the Old Testament...the one which the Jews (who are Arab) kept going back and worshipping (along with Baal, Zoroaster and many others). In fact, the bible records that Islam is an anti-christ : 1 John 2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Messiah? He is antichrist, that denieth God the Father and Jesus the Son.

	93840 : ["The real issue here is when does the spirit enter the body.  We really have no way of knowing this.  It is always better to error on the side of caution, so we must assume that it is at the point of conception.   Along with the consequences you have listed you should include the spiritual.  Physical, financial and emotional consequences are all temporal in nature.  The spiritual transcends this lifetime into eternity and we need to look at our choices in this perspective.  We will one day be confronted by the spirit that we denied the opportunity to experience life in the physical sense.   Rape is a terrible thing but life is not.  Nurturing the growing developing life inside of you can give new purpose and self-worth to a woman.  It is only 9 months after all.  After the birth this beautiful gift of life can be given to another who desperately longs for the opportunity to parent.

No, I would not let my 14yr old have an abortion, yes, those are awful circumstances but it is not the child's fault.

Interesting choice of words-  there are 2 bodies there- one the one that is in the womb that the woman is contemplating aborting cannot speak for his/herself.  My reasons for being pro-life is very simple.  God created each of us for a purpose.  And if you read Psalm 139 you will see how God feels about each baby.  I don't know what other explanation I can give, except to say, I am grateful my birth mom loved me enough not to take my life before I was given a chance.  If my 14 year old daughter was raped, I would be heartbroken. yes, it would be very hard for her, and for me to see her, carry that child for 9 months, but both of us have to remember that the baby does not deserve the death penalty for the sin of the man.
