I was living in Japan, and a Japanese friend of mine wanted me to get up before the sunrise, drive to the eastern-most edge of the island (Okinawa) and watch the sunrise on the New Year. So that night, a different friend and I, plus my husband, celebrated New Years Eve by getting trashed on champagne and wine and singing karaoke.  Went to bed sometime around 3 am.  My smoke detector went off for some unknown reason around 4.  Scared the crap out of me!  Fell back into a drunken stupor, only to be woken by the alarm clock at 5 am.  Got up, still mostly drunk, and drove for about 40 minutes to watch the frickin sunrise.  I've never felt worse in my life lol.", 9109, "None", 2],

The only task I had to do that day was deliver a pair of shoes to my former room-mate.  It took me until 9 pm to be able to complete the task. I had another where I was lying on the floor, trying to gather enough willpower to crawl into the kitchen for some water.  The TV set was on, and a commercial for Kool-Aid came on, featuring (for some reason) a fat lady singing opera.  The sound of her opera singing hurt so much it caused sudden, irreversible, explosive projectile vomiting - and I hosed down the entire living room and myself.  Closing my mouth didn't help, because it just came out my nose. After my friend's wedding reception, I was so hung-over that the next day during the gift opening, I literally could not comprehend English.  I could see people's lips move, and I was vaguely aware of speech-like sounds hitting my ears, but I just could not process it into language.  I wound up sitting quietly on a couch in the corner with my sunglasses on, clutching a drink someone gave me (I nodded when they asked, despite not being able to understand what they asked), and trying to keep from throwing up at the thought of drinking it.

	82691 : ["Mark Anthony, JS and evans are right, the choice was made to engage in the debate rather than just sitting on the side and saying no, since the media won't cover that. This is why Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders have joined the debate as well.  Does it mean we're heading for the catastrophe Al Gore and the Greens who think the IPCC is too conservative claim? No. We are adding CO2 which causes some of the warming we were experiencing. However, it hasn't gotten any warmer since it was in 1998, while China has been pumping record amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The link between CO2 and temp is tenuous in the real world and fraught with many complex interactions, but if we add enough it may continue to get warm. This does provide an ace in the hole when the ice age returns but it won't cause global temp to increase the way Al Gore and the Greens blather about. Neither will it cause sea levels to skyrocket. The only way either can happen is if some external force exerts itself here, such as much stronger solar activity, a solar flare or some other solar event. The Earth just doesn't produce enough heat on it's own to keep us from freezing solid, so it can't melt ice caps on it's own. CO2 levels have been as much as 20 times higher than they are now and the world went on as before, with temp less than 10C higher than they are now. I think we could endure that temp increase since our technology is quite superior to that used by the ancestors of dinosaurs. Having a debate isn't the same as losing a debate, which is what the Republicans were doing by denying CO2 could have any impact. Obviously it can, just not as much as AGW advocates claim. Overall, more CO2 and more warming will be very beneficial, but it is still time to move away from fossil fuels. When the ice age returns we'll need them since we won't be able to access oil thru miles of ice and in ice age conditions. It's also vital to give enough thought to any proposal. We'd do far better to subsidize and innovate LED lighting for homes than encourage everyone to turn to CFL bulbs which we know will cause problems once they fill up our landfills in 20 years, leaching mercury into the soil and water supplies. There are many other examples of half-****** but well-intentioned ideas that only worsened the problem they sought to resolve so a debate is needed, then action can be considered and only the best ideas implemented.", 9110, "FZmu6Pm9aa", 0],

In the morning, she found me shirtless and shivering ... when she was putting out the cat. She asked why I never knocked to come in.. but of course I never thought of that. What a great idea.
