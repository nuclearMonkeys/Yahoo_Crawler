	118689 : ["Thank you...Smokey ( previous answer).  Your answer--Theory of relativity was superb.  Yes I posted  point for that one! Next the \"initial\" question--has a gramatical problem.   Does is incorrect in the question.  Rather you should correct the question to read: DO insects fly faster on a moving vehicle. Now that grammar is corrected--we alas have come upon a second problem.  How can an insect \"fly\" if it is attached \"on\" a moving vehicle.  So the question is inaccurate. Continuing with the problem, we could substitute and make the question: Do insects fly faster IN a moving vehicle.  In this the response would of course be a resounding NO.  Because of course the insects would still \"fly\" at the same velocity, but would be inside a much faster bullet--therby creating a subuniverse with the same relative constants. So--in final answer   No, insects do not fly faster in moving vehicles.", 10552, "5feabf0d5fc3706106da9295a5570c58aa", 0],

If there was air let into the vehicle through a window, then the fly would likely not be able to keep up with the speed and the air would push it to the back window. SPLAT!", 10552, "AA11266578", 0],

I know that she would have a vested interested in issues specific to women.  On the other hand, I know that Obama has the unique ability to unite races which is extremely important.  Because he is bi-racial I think he is in a position to have both white and minority interests/perspectives well in hand and can make significant and positive change to improve the gaps that exist between races.

	118720 : ["Depends greatly on the mountain you are trying to deceive. If you are attempting to deceive the folks who run major, multi-location companies then they will most likely check when you apply for a season pass. Interwest, Vail, etc. will probably check. What they will most likely do is give you the pass, then check, find out you are not a student, and then contact the authorities. This way you will be held criminally responsible for theft of services. Once found guilty, then they have good standing to sue you in civil court. (At least that's what I would do if I were them.) A smaller mountain that is dependent on season pass income will also check, but most likely do so before issuing the pass. They would rather nip it in the bud than to have to deal with it in court. You are better off to pull your hoax off one day at a time and pay a student rate on a per diem basis. When I was in college and used my ID to get a discount on daily tix the ticket booth person  never called anyplace. Even now, a letter from my home mountain and my ID gets me a cheap ticket without any calling or hassle...usually.  It doesn't sound like you plan to rack up more than 100 days, because $10/day is pretty cheap. Personally, if you are not in college and still have enough time to ski enough so that it warrants a season pass, why don't you get a job at the mountain or in a ski shop that has shop privileges?  Don't get me wrong...I'm all for free skiing, but there are so many loopholes and deals out there already, hosing the resorts by stealing it is just pretty lame. I ski for free (or pretty close to free) legitimately. What you are doing might sound justified to you, but you are stealing from the lifties, snowmakers, and rental shop employees too.

Personally, I think voting may be a little biased whether a person is in favor of her or not. Think of all the people who probably didn't even give any of her debates and campaigns a second thought just because she is a woman. It goes both ways. If a lot of women are voting for Clinton because she is a woman, then I'm sure this goes the same for blacks and Obama. Logical? No. But, it's going to happen because this upcoming election may be exciting history in the making.", 10549, "KVCKt5rpaa", 0],
	118723 : ["Yes - good question.  Unfortunately, some women will vote for Hillary just because she is a woman, or they'll rationalize that she can \"empathize\" with their issues/concerns; thankfully, others will use their brains to a higher degree. Now, these women who effectively use their brains will see why Hillary is wrong for America: not wanting to ban the gruesome partial-birth abortion and wanting to \"use\" (\"confiscate\") Exxon-Mobile profits to use for \"health care\". Finally, she not only put up with her husband's philandering, she put up with known infidelity and criminal behavior (e.g. Juanita Brodderick and Kathleen Willey). Again, though, the main issues should be HILLARY and HER IDEAS: first, whether they are RIGHT or WRONG ideas/visions; second, whether she would be EFFECTIVE and EFFICIENT in implementing them.  I believe that the majority of her ideas/visions are wrong for America.
