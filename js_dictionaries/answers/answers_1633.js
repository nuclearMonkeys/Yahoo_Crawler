While we do not base our Christian walk on \"feelings\" but by faith alone, it is possible to \"feel\" His presence. But lack of \"feeling\" does not equal His absence. So do not rely upon your feelings to determine His presence. Learn about Him, His ministry to us and for us, and accept by faith that He is working in you what He has promised to do. We cannot see into our hearts, but we can see our changed lives, attitudes, speech, desires, obedience, and willingness to surrender, seek, and abide in Him.  Liken it to the wind.. we cannot see it, but we can see its results.. 8 The wind goes where its pleasure takes it, and the sound of it comes to your ears, but you are unable to say where it comes from and where it goes: so it is with everyone whose birth is from the Spirit John 3:8", 9258, "yugLcDE2aa", 5],
	87314 : ["Evolution has been proven. I guess you've never heard of \"microevolution\", currently Creationists are fighting for Macroevolution to be proven (there are multiple forms of evolution, and not all are biological). Besides Creationism/\"Intelligent Design\" puts out that something had to create something, and is giving out a possible false education (plus neglecting the first amendment right to any secularists in a school). Evolution does not say there was no creator, simply that we changed over time to what we are now. Hell, even Catholics have accepted it. But evolution is far from being a religion. It's a scientific theory. Look it up. Oh, and look up theory too (otherwise you might think a theory is a hypothesis).", 9260, "None", 3],
	87315 : ["In fact, evolution is well substantiated. When I was young, it was still possible to write it off as a \"theory\" (although many people who did so considered \"theory\" to mean the same thing as a \"hypothesis,\" and even then, evolution was far better tested than that!) Now, however, the DNA evidence leaves us with two choices: (1) All known species on this planet evolved from a common ancestry. (2) All known species on this planet were designed by someone who is not only intelligent, but absolutely determined to convince us that the theory of evolution is correct. This is the only alternative to evolution; the common DNA encodings from species to species(particularly of introns--portions of genetic material that do not code for anything in the current genome of the species) cannot be explained otherwise. So I have the choice of accepting the theory of evolution or flouting the will of God. There are, in fact, no such holes in evolution as you claim. There are certainly adjustments to the specific charting of evolutionary paths, but that is filling in the details, not undermining the fundamental concept. Science progresses by examining evidence and testing hypotheses. And that is where intelligent design fails. It offers absolutely no testable assertions of any kind. In fact, it offers nothing but opinion. That sort of thing passed for science five centuries ago, but under current standards, it does not. That is why \"intelligent design\" has no legitimate place in science classes.", 9260, "FY4cCjsOaa", 1],

I have been a Christian for as long as I can remember but I had fallen off the path. Three weeks ago I made a decision to get back on the right path and follow God instead of living how I want to live.  When I decided to take Gods path, a feeling of peace come over me.

	87321 : ["Evolution is a theory (just like gravity is a theory) based on a connected series of propositions which, while not all proven, are at least disprovable. What makes something scientific is that it has been proved but that it can conceivably be disproved. You cannot disprove God or intelligent design. That is why the existence/effect of either is a bad scientific hypothesis. No one \"believes\" in evolution the way people \"believe\" in a deity. If they do, they're bad scientists. That kind of belief is an emotional thing, a leap of faith that is separate from the rational mind. When people use the word belief in terms of scientific theory, they are referring to a conclusion reached through a logical process. You can't reduce faith to logic (nor should you), and you can't demand that logic adhere to faith. EDIT ON MACROEVOLUTION: I think you could find proof for the theory if you really wanted to and were willing to read from experts instead of the yahoo crowd, but here are five things to think about. 1. bird-reptiles and mammal-reptiles The fossil record shows examples of creatures between these classes of chordates. 2. fossil legged whales and seacows What use does a whale or seacow have for legs? None, which is why, though time and natural selection of mutations, they lost them. 3. ape-men Despite the ever-present discussion of the search for the missing link, and despite of the wealth of knowledge we have yet to obtain concerning our own origins, STILL there are an awful lot of links we have found between us and apes. 4.vestigial organs What is an appendix for besides bursting? Either it served some sort of purpose once upon a time (that jives with evolutionary theory), it's a strange mutation that simply hasn't been dangerous enough to make it maladaptive (that jives with evolutionary theory), or it was a mistake made by a creator (that decidedly does NOT jive with most people's understanding of \"intelligent\" design). 5. the giant panda Have you ever seen an animal more poorly suited to its life and habitat? Besides being pretty poor parents and possessing no interest in mating for 99% of the year, they eat bamboo, an awful source of nutrition and one to which they have yet to really adapt. They have the teeth for it, but their digestive system is still really that of a carnivore, and they can't really digest the cellulose very well. In any case, there's little nutritional value to be gotten out of bamboo, certainly not enough to provide a very active lifestyle for a large animal. So they have to eat like 25 or 30 pounds of bamboo per day.", 9260, "ZFBqnKNCaa", 0],

Because Jesus says we do not know the day or the hour and will be surprised at His coming, it is silly, and disobedient, for people and groups to predict His coming. We, instead, need to be about the business of growing in holiness, so that we are prepared for our Lord when He comes again, no matter when that will be.  2 Peter 3:8-15 – instead of worrying about when the rapture will occur, Christians should follow Peter's instruction to repent of their sins, live lives of holiness and godliness, be zealous and at peace, and wait for the Lord's coming with forbearance and joy!  Matt. 24:36 - many sects try to predict the coming of Christ. But Jesus says, \"no one but the Father knows the day and the hour.\" The sects that try to predict Christ's coming ignore these words. Matt. 24:36 - we should also note that Jesus' statement does not mean than Jesus does not know the day of His Second Coming. Jesus does know, because He is God. With this statement, Jesus explains that He chose to know by His human knowledge only that which He wanted to know for His mission of salvation. In other words, Jesus could have chosen not to know everything by His own human knowledge, but Jesus knew everything in His human knowledge through its hypostatic union to His eternal and infinite divine knowledge.  Matt. 24:44 – Jesus warns us that the Son of Man is coming at an hour we do not expect.  Luke 12:46 - the Master will come on a day and at an hour when He is not expected.  Acts 1:7 - Jesus says it is not for us to know the times or seasons which the Father has fixed by His own authority.  1 Thess. 5:2; 2 Peter 3:10; Rev. 3:3 - the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.

	87333 : ["1.  Evolution merely describes part of nature. The fact that that part of nature is important to many people does not make evolution a religion. Consider some attributes of religion and how evolution compares:           * Religions explain ultimate reality. Evolution stops with the development of life (it does not even include the origins of life).           * Religions describe the place and role of humans within ultimate reality. Evolution describes only our biological background relative to present and recent human environments.           * Religions almost always include reverence for and/or belief in a supernatural power or powers. Evolution does not.           * Religions have a social structure built around their beliefs. Although science as a whole has a social structure, no such structure is particular to evolutionary biologists, and one does not have to participate in that structure to be a scientist.           * Religions impose moral prescriptions on their members. Evolution does not. Evolution has been used (and misused) as a basis for morals and values by some people, such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and E. O. Wilson (Ruse 2000), but their view, although based on evolution, is not the science of evolution; it goes beyond that.           * Religions include rituals and sacraments. With the possible exception of college graduation ceremonies, there is nothing comparable in evolutionary studies.           * Religious ideas are highly static; they change primarily by splitting off new religions. Ideas in evolutionary biology change rapidly as new evidence is found.     2. How can a religion not have any adherents? When asked their religion, many, perhaps most, people who believe in evolution will call themselves members of mainstream religions, such as Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. None identify their religion as evolution. If evolution is a religion, it is the only religion that is rejected by all its members.    3. Evolution may be considered a religion under the metaphorical definition of something pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. This, however, could also apply to stamp collecting, watering plants, or practically any other activity. Calling evolution a religion makes religion effectively meaningless.    4. Evolutionary theory has been used as a basis for studying and speculating about the biological basis for morals and religious attitudes (Sober and Wilson 1998). Studying religion, though, does not make the study a religion. Using evolution to study the origins of religious attitudes does not make evolution a religion any more than using archaeology to study the origins of biblical texts makes archaeology a religion.    5. Evolution as religion has been rejected by the courts:           Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause.        The court cases Epperson v. Arkansas, Willoughby v. Stever, and Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist. are cited as precedent (McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education 1982).", 9260, "YZv8Ub3Haa", 10],
