That way, you will understand what the solution is (and why the tooth may have to be extracted). For example, if a tooth with a crown has a cavity under the crown, the crown may have to be removed. And since you can't see through the crown, there's *always* a chance that after the cavity is removed, there's not enough tooth to put a new crown on. Sometimes you can then do a root canal (remove the nerve of the tooth and fill up the space where the nerve was), rebuild the tooth, and then put a crown on. But sometimes there's not enough bone around the tooth to make it stable enough for all that work. Whatever you decide, make sure you understand what the solution is, and what the prognosis of the tooth is. Even if you CAN do all that work, what's the likelihood that the tooth will last?
