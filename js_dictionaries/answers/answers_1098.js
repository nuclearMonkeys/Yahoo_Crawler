Evolution is based completely on speculations which have NEVER been observed such as the big bang, abiogenesis, fossil transitions from one kind of life to another, beneficial information gaining mutations and observed changes from one kind of creature to another.

	60398 : ["Straw man fallacy. Your confusing Creationism with Intelligent Design. I'm not a Christian so don't believe in the Bible or Creationism. I'm a Deist so believe in Intelligent Design. ID is falisifiable. The facts of biological variation and development is one thing, the theory of evolution is another.  Gravity is a fact and a theory. ID predicts you will never find transitional species, oh look you haven't!", 8070, "AA11936409", -2],
	60399 : ["People often claim: “Evolution is just as substantiated as the theory of gravity,” and they like to play on that word “theory.”  But, everyone has observed an object falling at 9.8 meters per second squared.  On the other hand, no one has observed life come from non-life, or functional, complex design come from non-intelligence.  You are failing to differentiate between operational science (such as gravity) and historical science (interpreting evidence from the past).  And, by the way, gravity as a scientific concept (an attractive force between two masses) was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton who just so happened to be a creationist. You said, \"Evolution has NOTHING to do with the Big Bang or the origin of life.\"  Then you need to differentiate between cosmic evolution, chemical evolution, and biological evolution.  Many people like to ignore it or say it doesn't count, but before you can invoke natural selection, you need an organism that can acquire food, make energy, and reproduce itself.  Abiogenesis (or sometimes called chemical evolution) is very pertinent. Funny, but a lot of what you said about creationism is what we say about evolutionsim.  The general theory of evolution is so “plastic” that it can be expanded to fit any data.  Even data that is exactly the opposite of what has been used in the past to teach evolution is twisted as new “proof” of evolution. Just look at the Scopes trial.  Ironically, the very arguments used in Darrow's biology lesson to convince everyone that evolution is true have virtually all been discredited and thrown out by evolutionists themselves.  Since 1859 the theory of evolution has encountered a myriad of surprises and adjustments.  What scientists believe about the evidence frequently changes.  As Dr. Michael G. Houts has said, “This illustrates another key (non-scientific) feature of the theory of evolution. The theory is constructed in such a way that no matter what the evidence, evolutionists can claim it supports their religion. If a bird is brightly colored, it evolved vivid feathers to attract a mate. If a bird's plumage is drab, it evolved that drabness to provide camouflage. If similar structures are derived from similar gene sequences, it is because the two species share a common ancestor. If similar structures occur in species that are genetically quite different, it is because of ‘convergent evolution.' No matter what the evidence, in the eye of the believer, evolution is true.  One criterion for determining if a theory is scientific is if it is falsifiable. In other words, the theory must be constructed in a way that an experiment could be devised to prove it false. In the discussion of similarities between organisms, the theory of evolution is purposely constructed so that no experiment can prove it false.” And as Dr. Don Batten said, “...Darwinism never predicted anything, it was modified to accommodate the observations. In fact, because Darwinism is so malleable as to accommodate almost any conceivable observation, science philosopher Karl Popper proclaimed that it was not falsifiable, and therefore not a proper scientific theory in that sense.” \"God is trying to trick us to test our faith\" is a straw man and usually only said by trolls.  I have never heard it in real life and I am around Christians all the time.  If you really want to know what we believe and how we argue, you need to go to websites like these: And here is a brief overview of the scientific case for ID:  ================================= Here is our response to your lizard story: Creationists believe in natural selection and even “speciation.”  Natural selection is a logical process that anyone can observe and it was actually a Creationist named Edward Blyth who first wrote about it.  Blyth published some articles describing the process of natural selection in The Magazine of Natural History between 1835 and 37—over 22 years before Darwin published his book (he just didn't come to the same conclusions as Darwin).  I believe Dr. Terry Mortenson is correct:  “Natural selection is the God-designed method of preserving representatives of the original created kinds.”", 8070, "AA10471526", 1],

	60410 : ["Apple computers are about as good at running games as a low-grade sandpaper is at wiping ***. Personally, I would never touch an Apple computer, ever. In my opinion they are reserved for people who are unable or unwilling to learn the very basic steps of setting up a computer, and they pay dearly for that luxury. In most cases, you can get a \"PC\" equivalent to an Apple for about 2/3 the price. You can get a Linux computer for about half, if not less, than an Apple computer with very similar specs. Did you know Mac OS X and Linux are both UNIX-like systems? That means they are cousins, and share many of the same features, such as security, no viruses, etc. Actually, Linux takes a step up since it isn't bloated with crap no one uses. Furthermore, Linux is open-sourced and FREE! Windows and Mac OS, are both proprietary and expensive. As for Games, Windows is by far the best option (sadly) because they have the market Linux has some open-sourced games that run natively, and can mimic Windows games with WINE Apples have some games, but the selection is very limited. WINE is also an option. Music: It boils down to a preference of music player. iTunes is great because it has a store to purchase all your major artists, but it lacks features, and is god-awfully slow. Rhythmbox comes stock with most distros of Linux, uses less than 1/5 of the resources as iTunes, has more features (and plug-ins) and also features a store, however, it does not contain all the hit artists, but rather unsigned artist, most of their music is free. And there are other means to get music (legally), such as Amazon. Windows Media Player is just awful. It's slow, can't do anything without additional downloads, and is a resource hog. My favorite music player is Foobar 2000, however that is only available on Windows. It's ideal for the minimalist. I'd say Linux is the best for music because it's free. Videos: Same story, just comes down to a matter of preference in player. Apple uses bloated, slow Quicktime, Windows has god-awful Windows media player which can't even play DVD's without the download of additional codecs, and Linux comes with Totem, which works cleanly, and efficiently. Did I mention Linux is free? Photography... I hope you are getting the pattern here. Apple, you have there program, which is likely to be slow and bloated, Windows has there own photo-viewer, and Linux has thier own photo-viewer. Linux also comes with f-spot for managing photos. Again, I say Linux has the upper hand because it's free, and very functional and fast. As for Office, Microsoft Office is available for both Windows and Mac natively, and works with Linux though WINE (though not supported), and comes out to $150. All 3 platforms also have OpenOffice available, which is comparable to Microsoft office, bur free. Macs don't come with any free office solutions (iWorks is an additional $50), and Linux is already bundled with OpenOffice, so you don't have to download it separately. Oh and did I mention Linux is free? yeah, just choose you distrobution and download. I'd highly recommend Linux Mint 10. I use it personally. You can download here. Burn the image to DVD and install. Once you have installed and rebooted, it's all ready to go, as it comes with Flash, OpenOffice, Firefox, Rhythmbox, Totem, and more. It also comes with a database of software called the Software Manager, where if you do need another program, you just type it in, click install and it downloads and installs automatically.", 8075, "AA11834245", 1],
