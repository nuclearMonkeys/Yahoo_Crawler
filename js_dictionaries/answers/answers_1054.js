If you don't like that, you can leave their home, rent your own place, pay all the bills, and emancipate yourself that way.  You don't get to pick and choose the best parts of both such as being dependent on your parents for food and shelter, while taking whatever adult privileges you want in contravention of their role to protect and provide for you as a dependent.

The most obvious example is the Selective Service military obligation in which all men must sign up, under penalty of law at 18 years of age.  All women are exempt from this legal Responsibility.  There are a lot more of these types of things, including \"women's only\" programs and benefits that are denied to men just because they are men.  This is systemic discrimination. Remember also that legal equality was the originally stated goal of feminism.  But once they received that, the entire goal posts were changed, and now feminists don't care about men's equality .... they want to radically changed the entire society now because clearly, simple equality is no longer good enough for them. .", 8060, "aSm9xSn3aa", 4],

In some cases it could be because the dog was abused and in other cases it could be a lack of socialization with men.  Male dogs are also commonly aggressive towards intact males. I think its something to do with the hormones they release. Not sure why some are aggressive with neutered dogs. Maybe its also hormones.  Be careful. If hes scared enough he could bite someone. Take introductions with men slowly. I find it really helps if the men sit on the floor so they are less intimidating and have them talk in a softer voice. Offering treats might help.
