For Laptops, they would have a primary use cycle of 2-3 years & potentially a secondary use cycle (at reduced or more niche use) of another 2-3 years before considering replacing.  There might be a third, experimental cycle (where I might experiment with Linux or other special use stuff) while looking or AFTER getting the replacement system, but this is around the time I'm likely to pass the system to somebody else. This is mostly due to limited upgrade potential of laptops & the graphical components have reached the end of their mainstream usage. For Desktops, they would have at least 2-5 years of primary use with extensions depending on upgrade potential before hitting the limits of the motherboard.  Once upgrade potential limits have been reached, I'll look at replacement & head to secondary & tertiary cycles. Once a replacement is obtained & running, I'm more willing to pass the old PC off to others (like my mother, who doesn't need a high-end system for her more casual PC usage...  or friend / neighbor that could use as they're running what's considered an \"ancient\" system by today's standards...  like something that's over a decade old).  As mentioned above, I'm more willing to do more experimental stuff with old PC's like trying out other OS's or use it as part of a project that doesn't require a modern system to operate.  This can usually hit about the decade mark before seriously considering recycling or discarding the system as virtually nobody is interested in it at that point (as smaller & cheaper options, like a Raspberry Pi, have similar performance levels).", 6203, "5d801299a74e13682dc0885d3c2692a7aa", 3],
