I have an older brother, and sister who introduced me to a lot of different music.  My brother listened to groups like Humble Pie,  na, old J. Geils, Mahagony Rush and Edgar Winter, and my sister listened to a lot of R&B groups. So I learned to appreciate different types of music. I myself enjoy classic rock, but I also listen to Jazz, Smooth Jazz, R&B, Blues, Southern Rock, 80's Music, Metal, Heavy Metal, New Wave, Reggae and a little bit of country.

Copy the small circle 3 times sideways being tangent to each other by Pointing to center snap glyph and drag sideways without clicking. By doing this you should be able to snap the intersection of the circle's circumference. Polar tracking and OSNAP must be on to do this. Enter SE and enable the intersection(x) snap in \"Object Snap\" tab if you can't snap. 5. Use Polar array to continue and input 6 in \"Total no. of Items\". 6.

	111246 : ["The outside measurement of a circle is called the circumfrence. To calculate the circumfrence of a circle the formula is you multiply the diameter times pi (roughly 3.14). That comes to 75.36 inches. The only thing wrong with that is that works on a nice flat 2 dimensional picture of a circle.  You're talking about wrapping a item with bulk (garland) around another round item with bulk (wreath). So if you are just wrapping a piece of garland around the outside of a circle.. I'd add a few inches for the gap the garland bulk may cause - 80 inches perhaps? Also I am not sure how you are wrapping it. I would think simply around the outside edge would not give the desired result. You probably want to wrap it in a spiral around edge of the wreath and that is a totally different calculation. The easiest thing to get you close (and I'd still add a few inches) is to take a soft fabric/paper tape measure and wrap it the way you would wrap the garland around 1/2 of the wreath.. then double what the tape measure reads.

So, I have reputation (gained from my professional experience -- now doing something else) for always finding the root cause of problems on vehicles that other shops and mechanics have washed their hands of and walked away from -- I am sure that I have identified the cause of my problems and I will disclose it to you now -- problems are caused by wiring insulation deterioration due to exposure to excessive heat.  I believe that your vehicle (and countless thousands others) have the same issue.  It progressively gets worse with time and continued heating and cooling, for me the car became inoperable and is made worse with high humidity levels, the rainy season is here now.  With quality shops refusing to even look at issues, vehicle values plummet.  When manufacturers do not provide updated replacement parts (just try to buy an engine/trans harness that won't do the same thing, if there is even another bad one available to buy) they get the reputation that you mentioned before. My reasoning for this is: the disposable car is here, I have seen 1964 Darts still running fine in original condition, but for whatever reason (and this one is as good as any) if the car dies and cannot be repaired correctly, if the undocumented computer sensor substitution strategies used mask the real data that is being transmitted, professional diagnosis equipment is rendered useless, as well as the tech that never learned the basic repair maxim of KISS. Kiss stands for Keep It Simple Stupid, high tech solutions when applied to base problems like wiring deterioration cost consumers many thousands of dollars each and every year.  Components that fail prematurely (depending on your perspective, of course) are a current reality -- cost cutting manufacturing techniques cause issues like this, as well as unintended, uncontrolled acceleration, terrifying engine stalls and countless other issues, and only the noisy wheels are attended to, everyone else quietly suffers and bears their burden for buying (like you) I know i have a good car here I thought the same, and I still think the styling is being copied by other manufacturers even today. Feel free to email me, if you are interested, and I will let you know how this turns out.  I have not had the time to make the repairs, but am almost certain that this is the problem on my car.
