	139699 : ["Jesus came to earth as a man.  As a man he could be and was tempted and rejected the temptations!  As a man he could eat, die and as the son of God he could rise again and told his disciples to tell the world! Let's summarize for those like \"I speak truth\" ... that seems insecure with a name like that.... and she is wrong. 1) Jesus was born in year 0, died and rose in year 33AD 2) He was born of a virgin  3) He could raise the dead and perform miracles. 4) He was crucified,  5) He rose again and ascended to heaven 6) He was the son of God. 7) Faith in God, Jesus as Lord and repentance of sins are necessary for salvation. We are just lucky that God chose to offer a path of forgiveness and that forgiveness through the sacrifice of Jesus is the only way to salvation!  It is your choice to believe or not but it is a choice, forced conversions are some other religion! May you learn the wisdom you need.

	139700 : ["It is called accountability. Reconcilliation does not negate the sin, especially if the sinner is not repentant. And, Jesus will not pay for unrepentant sins. One has to be willing to experience that \"change of heart\" and turn to a life that at least makes an attempt to follow the commandments.

	139701 : ["Jesus paid the price for our original sin which is rebellion. This does not mean however that we cannot be taken in by our temptations. When this happens of course we will reap what we have sewn. If we don't suffer consequences then we will think that it's ok to sin and will continue to do so. This will ultimately bring us back to that first sin of rebellion. Rebellion leads to stubbornness and pride.Those are traits that the Lord hates most of all. Sin leads to death which is ultimate separation from God. He does not want us to be separated by Him and so He has placed that law in effect that we should reap what we sew. It is for our own good.

Jesus said \"My Father is greater than I.\" and Father, why have you forsaken me.\" also If he sittith on the Right hand of the Father then he was sitting on his own hand. Makes no sense materially or spiritually. Don't believe false teachings. Jesus was always the Son. The Son never becomes the Father. Jesus came to reestablish the truth that had been lost from the Jewish Religion. Not all Jews where lost- not the Essenes. Jesus followd an ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes.

He will continue to be weak. When Jesus was given human form, it is my own belief that he was able to be tempted as all of us are in this flawed state. The reason we are able to be tempted is because it was needed when God chose to give us the attribute of Choice. He didn't want to force us to seek him, but come from our own hearts to worship our father. Didn't anyone pay attention in Sunday school or was I the only one? LOL", 11434, "RxDZ4SN6aa", 1],

	139710 : ["I believe it is becasue many of us do not know that it has already been paid..   If you owe a man(The Law) $10000(sin), and your best friend(Jesus) comes and in an act of pure love, pays your creditor $10000000(cross) and says keep the change. It is more than a payment. It is an OVER-PAYMENT but your friend is unable to tell you due to the fact that he has to go for an urgent business trip...    If you do not know that it has been paid, you will have that debt on your heart. Especially if you are in dire straits. You will continue spending unnecessary hours worrying about that debt and will avoid the man. You might even fall sick due to stress.   But lets say your friend left a note(Bible), and it says the debt is paid(IT IS FINISHED!).  If you believe it , then all your worries are gone and you live free.  You will even have the confidence to be near the person whom you used to owe, and even ask him for a treat(blessing) because he has been made rich(glorified) on account of you!  The reason many of us are feeling the effects of sin is this. 1) we dont believe that it is paid. We dont believe that our friend loves us that much or we dont believe he is able to.  MYTH BUSTED!  Jesus is our Heavenly Boaz! Our Kinsman Redeemer!  There are several requirements for someone to be a kinsman redeemer. First, he must be a relative. Second, he must be able. Third, he must be willing.  Thank God Jesus chose to be born as a man, is able, and is willing to redeem us!  From who? From God? No! But from the Law!  Therefore be bold! The Bible says if anything is stolen from you, bring it to God, and He will force the Devil to repay you double!   Amen!", 11436, "FsX5VoXKaa", 1],
	139711 : ["The Lord Jesus paid for judgment of our sins by His Father on the cross so that Christians are no longer judged by their Father God for their sins.  However just because God has free us from His judgments for our sins it does not mean that we are free from the natural consequences of our sins.  If we murder somebody the court of the land will sentence us to life imprisonment or death for our vile deed even though God may forgive us for this act through our faith in Jesus.  So a Christian is not free from the natural consequences that flow from the commitment of any sin.  There is no licence for us to sin.

The expression \"power of the keys\" is derived from Christ's words to St. Peter (in Matthew 16:19). The promise there made finds its explanation in Isaiah 22, in which \"the key of the house of David\" is conferred upon Eliacim, the son of Helcias, as the symbol of plenary authority in the Kingdom of Juda. Christ by employing this expression clearly designed to signify his intention to confer on St. Peter the supreme authority over His Church.

He relatively replaced into tempted interior the comparable way we are, in that temptations have been placed earlier Him by potential of devil, yet remained sinless because of the fact God is incapable of sinning. that's against His very nature (Matthew 4:a million; Hebrews 2:18, 4:15; James a million:13). Sin is by potential of definition a trespass of the regulation. God created the regulation, and the regulation is by potential of nature what God could or does not do; consequently, sin is something that God does not do by potential of His very nature. To be tempted isn't in and of itself sinful. a individual would desire to tempt you with something you have not any desire to do, inclusive of committing homicide or partaking in sexual perversions. you in all probability haven't any desire in besides to take part in those movements, yet you have been nevertheless tempted because of the fact somebody placed the possibility earlier you.", 11434, "ZLKiIM3Paa", 0],

With emotions running high between you both, you can't really do that.  You, are unfortunatly, are linked with negitive experiences.  The only way for him to possibly see past the negitive is to get away from each other for a long enough period of time to not feel the intense emotions.  What I am saying, is that you all probably need to get the hell away from each other for at least 6 months to a year.
