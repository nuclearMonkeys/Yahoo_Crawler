After 3 seconds, put your right hand on the clasp of his collar, and your left hand on his rump.  Pull up with your right hand, push down with your left.  PRAISE.  Command 'heel' again, repeat.  Repeat. You should not need a 'choke' collar to train a dog to sit.  Train 'sit at heel' using a Martingale or a prong collar, the way I just explained.  It works.  Soon, when you stop on a 'heel' command, your dog will begin sitting before you even say the command.  Mastering 'sit at heel' will make a regular 'sit' (off leash, at home) easier for your dog to learn, and easier for you to train. Good luck.  Do not give a correction BEFORE you say the command, AS you say it, or immediately AFTER you say it.  Give the dog a chance to respond.", 8971, "6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa", 3],

A choke chain will almost always slip down to the base of the dogs neck which is not helpful when training. All the does is provide a tight squeeze, not a correction. I must admit I have used a flat, choke, pinch & a shock collar. I got the most consistant behavior from my dog when using a pinch, however, my dog knows what he can get away with no matter which collar he has used. Train with treats in your none leash holding had and direct your dogs actions and reactions with a treat, he'll stay by you cause you have food. Remember, when training use treats that are like eating out for you. Don't give your dog a dry old bisquit, give him a niblet of chicken or steak or sausage.", 8971, "avPSXpztaa", 0],

	79177 : ["Your trainer is incorrect. The choke collar doesn't encourage sit. It bruises the muscles and tissues (permanently) when used in ANY fashion.  If you want to teach your dog to sit, simply put the dog into a position where it HAS to sit. The reason your dog jumps is because the treat is too high above his nose. The treat needs to be at 'nose level' in order for this to work.  Find a quiet indoor environment with few distractions. Start by using a small piece of food to lure your dog's nose to point upward (toward the treat) and move the treat backwards over his head so that he naturally lowers his haunches to a sitting position. Again: Don't hold the treat too high or he may jump up for it. Be prepared: As soon as he sits, give him the treat food. Repeat the exercise, adding the word \"sit,\" so the dog can learn quickly what you expect of him; rather than forcing his body into position, allow him to discover what is required on his own. (Note: If your dog jumps at the food, you're probably holding it up too high). Once this exercise has been learned, take it on the road. When your dog has mastered the skill in the quietness of your yard, try asking him to sit in other places like on the sidewalk or in the garage. Then \"up the ante\" by having him follow the instruction in a busy, distracting place, like a park, supermarket entrance or a crowded sidewalk. As your dog proves he has learned the meaning of the word \"sit,\" taper off his rewards so that he only gets a treat every third or fourth time he sits. The goal of any reinforcement program should be to graduate to supplying rewards intermittently and on a variable schedule. By rewarding your dog unpredictably - but always continuing to offer rewards at times - you can best maintain his interest in the exercise.", 8971, "95dd4543a7692bee8e7b45167a768910aa", 1],

	79182 : ["I'm no trainer, but I don't see why you'd need a choke collar for this. Choke collars are for correction. When teaching to sit, you're not going to be using that type of correction [tugging on the leash], or at least you shouldn't be. The only function of the choke collar in that scenerio is to get the dog to pay attention to the word \"sit\", which you should be able to do without it. I taught both my dogs to sit without using leashes at all.. What I did: Have treats on your person, but not visible [in your pocket, etc].  When you want your dog to do something, pull out a treat, hold it next to your eye, and get your dog to make eye contact with you, call his/her name.  **eye contact is KEY for training your dog to do ANYTHING. If you say a command while your dog is staring at the treat, or is distracted, you are not training correctly.**  Quickly fold the treat under your hand--keeping it at eye level if your dog won't maintain eye contact if you move your hand away from your face. Say the command you want your dog to preform [sit, in this case]. If your dog has never had a successful \"sit\", then you will need to show the dog what you want by putting them in that position. Usually hovering the treat to the point where they have to arch their head back [and they'll usually sit at that point] to see it [while not close enough where they can jump and get it], while applying gentle pressure to their bottom does the trick.  This is what worked for me. By no means am I trying to suggest that your trainer is incompetent or that I know more than a trainer. I don't agree with your trainer's suggestion, but I'm not a trainer myself. This is just another way of doing things. Either way, don't reward failures with attention by scolding or getting upset. Reward success with treats and petting. Use every opportunity to reinforce this command. My dogs have to sit for treats, to go outside [they have to let me get infront of them and then sit behind me before I'll open the door to go out or come in] as well as on command. So now they've got \"sitting\" down very well. BTW, my dogs were having successful \"sits\" during the first session, though of course it took several sessions over several days for them to really learn to sit w/o the use of treats or without me having to correct them by forcing a sit. If your dog is not responding, it's not working.", 8971, "eEznnpnVaa", 1],

	79187 : ["You need a better trainer, believe me.   Any trainer who has to use a choke collar, or recommend one, is a pretty poor one. I've had several of my dogs for group obedience classes with an excellent trainer who trains dogs for the police and has the only cadaver sniffing dog in the county - she's the best there is around here.   She uses a \"gentle leader\" for training and that's what we all used on our dogs for the classes - it was great, every dog learned basic commands, sit, stay, lie down, come, etc. --- every single dog, no matter how hyper. What you need is to get a recommendation for a really decent trainer - no dog needs a choke collar if you are training the right way.  It's a nasty shortcut, hurtful to the dog and very shortsighted. Get away from that \"trainer\" and find one who knows what she's doing to help you and your dog. Go for group lessons, it's less stressful and also socializes your dog with other dogs and new people.", 8971, "p7swtBYzaa", -1],

	79200 : ["Hi hun, There's nothing wrong with you. NOTHING! Please don't feel that there is. Your family have a problem, but you certainly don't. Women are beautiful - I'm not surprised you find them attractive! I'm 22 and I am bisexual, so I completely understand how you are feeling. I knew I was attracted to women even before I did anything with a woman. Not that it didn't freak me out. It did. I also felt very depressed and weird for a long time. Then eventually something snapped inside me and I decided, fine, this is who I am - so what? I think it's great that you're realising who you are at 19. Lots of people don't realise they are bisexual or even gay until later in life, usually after being married for a while.  Don't push yourself to deal with your feelings in any set time frame. You have your whole life to explore who you are. Also, try not to label yourself too quickly. The only label you need to put on yourself is your name - everything else is personal, complex and individual; it all adds up to who you are. If you feel an attraction to men and women, you are perfectly normal. There's nothing wrong or disgusting about it. Look at it this way - you're lucky! You get more choice than the poor heteros who are only restricted to one gender! ;-) I'm wondering whether you actually are attracted to your boyfriend at all? If you cringe when he touches you, perhaps he's not the right man for you anymore. That doens't mean that you will then never be attracted to another man. There's also nothing wrong with feeling a strong urge to kiss women - you've said you would never cheat, which is brilliant, so you are doing NOTHING wrong. After 3 years with my boyfriend, I've had a major crush on a woman I worked with and often find myself missing that feeling of being with a woman. I'd never cheat on my boyfriend either, but whilst I initially felt extremely guilty about even thinking these things whilst being with my boyfriend, I now realise that this is who I am and it's a part of me that I can't suppress. And why should anyone suppress themselves or be something they are not? This is your life and you should live to make yourself happy. If there's nobody you can talk to, but you would like to talk to somebody about your feelings, look up a counsellor. You can even email therapists and have one-to-one chats online nowadays, if you are too embarrassed to speak face to face . One thing that helped me to figure out who I am is to get more involved in the gay community. Because you're in an environment (your family) where being bisexual is thought of as being wrong, it's extremely difficult for you to come to terms with anything. But if you perhaps read up on some information and go into a women-only chat room, where everyone's gay or bi, you will realise that you should be extremely proud of who you are. Explore your feelings in your own time, and perhaps consider taking a break from your boyfriend, as I think being in a relationship that physically makes you cringe whilst going through all these emotions must make you feel incredibly claustrophobic. I think you need a little freedom to find out who you are. As for telling your family, don't worry about that for the moment. I thought my family would abandon me when I came out to them, as they also made comments about homosexuality being 'weird'. But they love you and I bet that they would come round eventually. Besides, you don't need to live for your family - live for yourself.  I'm always here if you need to chat to someone who has gone through similar experiences, just drop me an e-mail. xx Emmie", 8976, "PeQ40WcWaa", 0],
