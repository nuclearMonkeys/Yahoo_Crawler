	2405 : ["To say a person cannot be a physician assistant (PA) because they have a learning disability would be unacceptable discrimination. There is a whole spectrum of learning disability. I have two nephews with diagnosed learning disabilities. One has very severe learning disabilities and could not possibly be a PA. My other nephew could most definitely be a PA. The important thing is whether the person with the learning disability can satisfy the programme's entry requirements, succesfully complete the programme and then undertake the duties of a PA.", 382, "kz04oBhsaa", -2],
	2406 : ["I'm sure that very much depends on what the disability is, and whether there are ways of working around it.  Typically a P.A. program will not admit you unless you already have a bachelor's degree that includes a year of chemistry, a year of human anatomy and/or physiology, a year of microbiology, and some introduction to statistics.  Some institutions require further subjects such as general or mammalian biology, and possibly psychology. Anyway, so the question is, can you complete college courses in these subjects?  If yes, then you would probably find a P.A. program that would work with you to help you around whatever other limitations you're alluding to.", 382, "Kf4PiubQaa", 1],

For example, if you go to google.com and type in \"scientific papers mask wearing\", you get all sorts of hypertext links to peer reviewed journals such as Nature and The Lancet. There is nothing wrong with argument from authority, especially when that authority is on the basis of expert knowledge. The point is tho, it isn't a logical argument. And typically when  you go to a doctor you want an opinion based on their knowledge, judgement and experience because you can't logically prove anything in medicine, you can only judge the evidence. So your best best is to trust their authority.", 383, "jB2Z6uxhaa", 0],

Bc you get drunk when your stomach absorbs the alcohol and your liver/kidneys filter it.Essentially your asking, if I constantly inhale CO or Nitrous. will I get high? Uh, yeah, and you'll pass out, and die if left on the respirator or whatever for long enough. Point is your body isn't metabolizing the alcohol, it's straight to ur brain, so it'll mess everything up. You'll be DAF, unable to puke as it's in your blood (heck, you'd die before your body even says, oh no, I need to rid this toxin!). There's an episode actually on a show called 100 ways to die? 1000? Idk, a million. Anyway somebody decides to, uh, put vodka into their rear end. Yeah they got hammered, but the colon absorbs everything as it's the, *pun* end of the line. Boop, drunk as, well, dead. Just drink, at least if ya get too sauced you'll pass out and have a hangover. If not, your body will wanna puke to get rid of the excess toxin/alcohol. Don't inject anything, bad news bears unless directed by a medical professional  Oh also I should mention alcohol is obviously made from sugar. Wine for example.

I also get sleep paralysis from time to time where my dreams tend to morph with real life which turn into visual/audio hallucinations during episodes.  Our brains are weird, and can play lots of little tricks on us, so I absolutely think it's possible to start dreaming while awake, especially as someone with sleep problems.

A huge amount of time, money and effort was spent finding a cure for the common cold, another viral disease, to no avail. A major problem with viruses is that they are intracellular parasites. Unlike other microorganisms in general, viruses are inside your cells. Therefore, \"killing\" the virus would also involve killing the cell, which is not such a good idea.

They are evidence based and they cite the evidence on that link which is the strongest proof to base recommendations on. You might not agree with the evidence or the recommendation but you don't the right to create your own facts invalidating the recommendations based on your own authority.
