I would open the RAW show already in the ring with a small brief introduction of myself, the rules of tonight and the matches.  Rules - Losing by count out or disqualification will cause a superstar/diva to be suspended indefinitely with pay. If you're a champion, you will be stripped from the title and suspended indefinitely with pay. No outside interference, which the penalty would be the same. Then I would do the favor of introducing the first match, after doing so I would go by commentary to call the matches with Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole. [Main Event(s) Stipulation - Randy Orton chooses John Cena's opponent from the ECW or SmackDown brand. John Cena chooses Randy Orton's opponent from the two other brands.] 1st Match - Four Way Elimination for the United States Championship Kofi Kingston (C) vs. Evan Bourne vs. MVP vs. Jack Swagger 2nd Match - #1 Contender for the Diva's Championship Gail Kim vs. Beth Phoenix (Special Guest Referee: Mickie James) 3rd Match - Tag Team Ted Jr. & Cody Rhodes vs. Triple H & Triple H's partner choice (Shawn Michaels) Pre-Main Event - Orton's Pick from ECW or SmackDown! John Cena vs. **CM Punk** Main Event - Cena's Pick from ECW or SmackDown!  (Twist) for the WWE Championship. Randy Orton (C) vs. **Christian** [Only 5 matches so all the matches are given time!] **Show ends with Orton going over Christian. Orton starts to attack Christian after the match. I get off commentary and get in the ring only to get hurt with Cena coming out for the save. Legacy comes out to take out Cena with Triple H and Shawn Michaels coming out. The show ends with the Raw brand coming out all fighting.** WA - In terms of wrestling and mic skills, Jack is better. Of course his amateur background helps him being the better wrestler. If this was a question on who the better in ring performer was it would of been Morrison. Swagger wins in mic skills because he can get a reaction easier due to his character. Morrison is alright on the mic, but Swagger wins even though he's a bit better on the stick.", 11331, "zOGL0R2jaa", 6],
