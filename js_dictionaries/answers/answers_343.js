There are well over a dozen different species of cherry, however, and the trees grown for their blossoms are other types of cherry, most often Prunus serrulata and Prunus speciosa, but there are a dozen or so species used in total.  Varieties with double flowers (that is, flowers with multiple rows of petals, rather than the usual one) will not produce fruit, as they are sterile. Inter-specific hybrids (produced by crossing two different Prunus species) are also usually sterile so will not produce fruit.  All other flowering cherries will produce fruit, but they are not eating cherries, and the fruit they produce are small, bitter and usually not fit for human consumption (some are even poisonous).  So basically, most flowering cherries will not produce the sort of cherries you are used to seeing (many will not produce fruit at all), but they are still legitimately cherry trees, not some other type of flowering tree. ", 2966, "pE3TAn5Aaa", 3],

	17363 : ["Its not that uncommon based on the time on job. How often do they give out raises?  How have your reviews been? Bringing up someone elses pay is not a great idea. When I was promoted, I was happy about the extra responsibility even though it did come with a ton of extra stress for the first few months. After that, it was pretty easy sailing.  I actually got paid almost twice as much and I was able to work fewer hours most of the time. (salary & bonuses). Supposed to work a minimum of 48 hours but they did not check or enforce that as long as I was delivering the results. Similarly I worked about 70 hours for the first few months for no extra pay. I had to prove myself. They kept saying it would get better but I was getting tired and kept thinking to myself...\"it better\". It did.  I think a lot of people would have quit if they were in my shoes the first few months. Our company had pay scales such that a brand new area manager could sometimes make less than a store manager in a high volume store who had been doing it for 10 years.  Longevity has a lot to do with it.

	17364 : ["Unfortunately, fair doesn't often enter into the work place. That said, it might be appropriate to have a discussion (not confrontation) with your boss about this. You do say that you were making $13/hr before getting promoted into this position at $16.30/hr. How recently were you promoted? Because the fact of the matter is, if you felt $16.30/hr was fair for you to accept when you took the promotion for the workload and responsibilities, to say you now find it unfair because you found out how much one of your reports makes isn't going to go over well. Yes, in theory a supervisor should make significantly more than their reports do, however, a relatively new and inexperienced supervisor might make less than a very experienced report who has worked there for a while and gotten nice increases over the years.  If you want to have the discussion with your boss, you need to prepare for it appropriately. The focus of your conversation needs to be about the responsibilities of the position and your contributions. The pay of your report has no place in that conversation at all, and could be counter productive to your goal. It would also be good to do some market research and find out what the average pay for a supervisor with your education and experience in hospitals in your area is. If you find the average rate of pay is $18/hr, then you would use that as support to your request for an increase. If you find that the average rate of pay is $16.50/hr, then you may decide not to have the discussion at all. Remember, if you accepted the promotion and pay rate relatively recently (within the past 6-12 months or less), you have a weak position to negotiate from, since this rate of pay was good enough then.", 2956, "KESlvKqQaa", 1],

Do YOU know why? Because they are judging potential candidate by appearance alone. No 'Judgey-judgey' at work.

But why do you say companies would make more money by paying for robots and electricity to run the robots while also paying the employee salaries? And what about the next generation of humans? Paying former employees a pension is one thing, but do your descendants go on paying their descendants forever? Will grandchildren of high earners get higher pay than grandchildren of minimum wage earners? There are three ways to deal with automation. One is to pay workers a living wage for fewer hours of work, similar to what you suggested but with some actual work still involved (though in different jobs, such as programming the robots). This would allow everybody to remain employed part time instead of fighting over the dwindling supply of full-time jobs. Another approach is to tax the profits from automation and use that money to pay for everyone's living expenses. When the money is distributed only to the people without income, it is called welfare. When distributed equally to all citizens it is called Universal Basic Income. And the third approach is for the former workers to own the company and thus get the profits directly. This is communism in its original form: Marx predicted that when workers were not paid enough to live on, they would seize ownership by force rather than starve.
