No longer will sin be to him like a dictator who gives him orders that he must blindly obey. He will not be trapped in a way of life that lacks purpose and that leaves him with a bad conscience. He will enjoy a clean conscience before God because past sins have been forgiven on the basis of his faith in the sacrifice of Christ. Sinful inclinations may try to assert themselves, but when he refuses to act on them because he calls to mind the clean teachings of Christ, he shows that sin is no longer his master.—Romans 6:12-17.", 10837, "DZbm3lVWaa", -1],
	125167 : ["Maybe you'd like to know what's wrong with the world, to hear it summarized in a few words. The fear of reduced circumstances will induce nearly anyone to live falsely. A threat to the paycheck will make most people pretend to believe every lie they ever heard. But though almost everyone puts his own social status first, it is a faux-pas to be seen as doing so, and therefore people are generally hypocrites as well as liars. As a consequence, every passionately supported cause \"just happens to be\" one that doesn't get the supporter fired, sued, foreclosed on, lynched, thrown into jail, or shot. And that creates the illusion that righteousness consists of supporting established norms and the powers that currently be. The reason that people don't call each other down for falseness and hypocrisy is that nearly everybody is playing the same game, and it is most socially profitable for each person to turn a blind eye, lest one accusation lead to another. As a man spends money that was created from debt and hopes to escape an accounting and dispossession during his lifetime, he also lives a lie and hopes to evade the dishonor thereof, at least until he dies. That's ironically true for Christians, even though Jesus himself was the sort of fellow who didn't mind doing what would cause himself to be spurned, harassed, impoverished, or lynched. I remind everyone that I am not religious. But I was raised so, and I know that one thing every honest religious person should acknowledge is that God will NOT ward his truly faithful against poverty, pariahdom, imprisonment, or a violent death. The social conditions that required Jesus to endure such things exist also today, and living with the kind of virtue that Jesus did will still, inevitably, have the same results. If you aren't poor, outcast, frequently in jail, and still alive, then you probably aren't anything like Jesus was, and the idea of explaining yourself to God on Judgment Day should make you tremble.

	125170 : ["First and foremost, there has to be a reason for the feud.  That can be something as simple as two guys jockeying for a \"number one contendership\" for a championship.  The championship is so important to both guys that the rivalry gets \"personal\" and becomes more than just trying to get a shot at the title, it's become a \"who's the better man?\" feud.  Or it can be something a little more complicated such as two Tag Team partners feuding over one of them feeling that the other is \"hogging the spotlight\", \"grandstanding\", \"stealing victories\" for the glory of himself rather than the Team.  Whatever the reason, it has to be realistic and believable.  Such as one wrestler \"sucking up\" to get title shots and another wrestler trying to earn title shots getting fed up with the sucking up. THE worst \"reason\" for a feud in ANY promotion starts with \"you lookin' at my girl?\", followed very closely by the accidental (chair or whatever) shot to the Tag Team partner; everybody in the world saw it was an accident.  The only person who doesn't believe it is the one who got hit.  I've seen that a million times and it's as contrived as starting feuds ever gets. Once there is a valid, realistic, and believable reason for the feud, the wrestlers involved have to be able to \"talk the talk\", that is, be able to deliver meaningful promos that get me interested in their feud and make me want to pay to see their showdown.  Trash-talking for the sake of trash-talking is pretty meaningless.  And if all they do is insult each other, that's boring. The physical part of the feud (the matches) has to be even.  Whether that be trading wins, or one wrestler coming up just a little short after a hard-fought match each time (but eventually getting the big win that counts), the wrestlers involved have to be seen as equals.  Cena vs Edge, for example.  Equals at the main event level.  Cena and Curt Hawkins, for example, are not equals in any sense of the word, and thus Cena is expected to dispose of Hawkins easily.  Nothing to get excited about.  The match-ups can't have obvious winners; both wrestlers need to be equal enough that there is never a clear-cut favorite to win any of their matches. An example of the \"perfect\" feud would be Ric Flair vs Dusty Rhodes in the 80's.  The reason for the feud: Flair was the World Champ and Rhodes wanted the title.  Flair cheated and had help to keep the title.  Rhodes fought fair and tried to win by his own skills.  On the mic, they both acknowledged the other's skills and \"greatness\", each put over the other as the \"best\".  Flair wanted the Title to help \"finance\" his extravagant partying lifestyle and did anything he could to keep it.  Rhodes wanted the Title to represent the \"common man\" (embodied by Rhodes himself), a symbol that anybody could succeed if he worked hard enough.  Flair and Rhodes promo-ing on each other was an event itself, as entertaining as anything Stone Cold vs The Rock ever did, but more based on \"who's the better man?\" wrestling promos. Rhodes vs Flair in the ring was awesome.  Flair as the \"cowardly\" heel made it seem as if at any moment Rhodes would pull out the win and we would have a new Champ, but Flair's confounded damn cheating and dirty tricks always managed to see him walk out still the Champ.  And that just fired us (the fans) up even more.  NEXT time Flair won't be so lucky. They fought in every type of match known to wrestling, alone and with various partners (Flair almost always with the other Horsemen).  One thing they NEVER did (and I hate that Vince does this all the time) is being forced to team up.  Flair and Rhodes were mortal enemies; they did NOT team up...ever.  Vince overusing that \"enemies forced to team up just before the big PPV\" gimmick is cheap and lazy booking and is very irritating. Flair and Rhodes were so talented and good at what they did, and so charismatic and effective on the mic, that they sustained their feud at the main event level, month after month (with a side-feud with other wrestlers here and there) throughout the 80's and the early part of the 90's, without their feud ever getting stale or seemingly \"forced\".  Flair vs Rhodes was always entertaining and fun to watch.", 10839, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", -1],
