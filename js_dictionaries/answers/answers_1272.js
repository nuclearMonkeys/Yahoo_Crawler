Then make darn sure they are well designed. Identify your area that you draw from. Upgrade your appearance to the public, not a bunch of hicks running old cars straight from the junk yard. But make yourself professional. Those are vintage car races, THE STOCK CLASS everyone, anyone can race. See be a business, make good out of what you have to offer. Right ? Bring in the local businesses, acquire sponsorship for your tracks activities. There are many sources of revenue. I can think of bunches.  There are so many things you could do that does not cost a cent, or very little. It is more putting the effort in to it. If you acquire sponsors you could do some special event purses for your late models. I would work the local car dealers, and the salesmen individually. Get them in a head lock, and haunt the place. You want trucks to use, cars for special events to show in the infield. AND MONEY. Let the salesmen work the infield for prospects, BUT they have to have the actual cars, and the dealership MUST put up CASH.  Better one GOOD night a week of racing then several that suck. Right ? See, you should have hired me. We could have been a long way down the road by now. Unfortunately the more behind the curve you get, the harder it is to make headway. Hit my email here if you want any more ideas. I have bunches. Kind of know the area, I have lived in Kansas, all my relatives are still there, going back to 1900. If you knew my name you would know right away where I came from. Heck my name is widely known by all world over, especially attached to that area of the U.S.  I can make a race out of anything.

	69140 : ["If the problem is just a weak wifi connection, you can buy a repeater/signal booster very cheaply to improve the signal coverage and strength. If you are competing for bandwidth with others, you will still be competing for bandwidth and this will always slow you down.  Gaming hogs most bandwidth. If boosting the wifi signal is not an option, you can use 4G mobile data over a mobile phone network.  It works out more expensive than a regular internet service but if you've got a mobile phone anyway, you may be able to add a data package at little extra cost. You use your phone to set up a wireless hotspot and then link your computer to it wirelessly. Even if you haven't got a mobile phone, you can buy a data dongle that requires a data SIM and that will either plug into your computer or provide a private wireless hotspot for you.   An advantage of having your own data service via the mobile network is that you can take it with you anywhere and, provided you don't give anyone else access, you are not competing for bandwidth. The downside is that data rates may be less than fixed-line broadband and the unit cost of data will be higher.", 8501, "gYPV2W02aa", 0],

I got 15 cats in to them, and all but one were microchipped, spay/neutered, de-flead, de-wormed, vaccinated and ear tipped.  The large, very aggressive 24 pound tom cat was FIV+ and it didn't feel right but I told them to euthenize, as I know he was completely feral, would not adapt to indoor living and he would continue to attack any cat within 10' of him. He was literally insane, I'd seen his actions around the other strays and nobody trusted him. We were feeding over a dozen cats for most of the past 8 years, but it's down to four regulars now. I have a heated dog water dish outside during winter as well.  I go through an 18 lb bag of dry food a month.  The squirrels and possums do get some of it, and during summer I really discourage the raccoons from eating here by taking the food bowls up at dusk. All the cats adjust to the new schedule very quickly. We've taken in two male strays, one who was hit by a car and was in bad shape (he's been indoors with us for 10 years now) and one who I had to take to the regular vets since I know for sure he was FIV+ to have a broken canine removed and him neutered.  He recovered in the basement that night, and screamed like a banshee to be let out at 5am the next morning.  Three days later something white zipped past me when I was bringing in groceries--he'd decided he liked sleeping out of reach under the stairs, he couldn't be attacked there.   By the end of 2 weeks we were letting him in and out 6 times a day.... he was made 'our' cat then and converted to indoors only.  We know he had his own plan of infiltrating out home, he did it all on his own initiative. I worry about the regulars on cold weather days. None use the sleeping box.  They have also worn a 'groove' in the lawn from the neighbor's back of the garage to the front corner of our garage.

Now that I am in high school and am on the school paper, people just better watch out! The school's bathrooms had no soap or water so I wrote a editorial in the paper, here are a few quotes from it. -  \"In the past seven months, it had become very apparent to me, as a new student at ** ****** High School, the administration needed to take a refresher course in Elementary Hygiene 101.\" \"When asked why there was a lack of soap in the bathrooms many teachers at *HS would say it was because students ripped the soap dispensers off the wall repeatedly. In my opinion, they should have been replaced repeatedly, no matter how many times it was needed. Just because some students would tear the dispensers off the wall, why would the school jeopardize the safety of its students by not replacing them?\" those are just the best things in there, I wrote this after talking to the principle about the issue, yeah no one got back to me on the issue and when I did talk to him, He was rude, so now everyone know, needless to say,teachers don't really say anything to me that they wouldn't want in the newspaper", 8496, "KDrztUEpaa", 0],

	69170 : ["I think any dog that can keep their tail should, If the dog will encounter difficulties because of it like the Doberman was breed in 1835 from many other breeds the result was a dog with a pretty stiff tail prone to braking and they tend to chew it a lot, which makes it worse. However if there is no medical reason and the dog is not being used for herding animals then there is no reason to and i think they should be allowed to keep it, it offers a great indicator of behavioral changes due to the tail position, and it is harder to observe with a stump. I personally like the Aussie with a tail and i understand they used to be herding but the vast majority aren't anymore, unless there is a medical reason i am unaware of.

	69171 : ["Without, for so many reasons.  For one thing, Aussies are a working breed with a docked tail for working purposes. The procedure DOES NOT hurt (an argument so many will try to use) and it's far better & safer than an amputation later on.  For another, I love the look so much more. I can distinguish an Aussie from a Border Collie by factors other than tail or no tail, but the general public cant--and I still think Aussies with tails look like bigger BCs.  Beyond that, I think a wagging docked tail is downright unique and adorable--all of my dogs make me happy when their tails wag, but my Aussie's wag just makes my face light up. Reminds me of Lady from Lady and the Tramp.  In the end, its personal preference, but I would NOT be happy if they outlawed docking in the US.  BQ: I like all of the colors, but maybe blue or red merle, since they're based on shades of gray, my favorite color. ADD: I would also like to quickly point out that it is impossible to distinguish show vs. pet quality at 2-5 days of age, when they must be docked.

No special instructions or software are needed from Iomega. There are several apps that you could use for backups. Which one are you using? Also, which OS version? If you are choosing to make a backup of all the data on the entire internal drive, that could be a lot of data. To \"prepare\" for such a large backup could take a few minutes. The software is making a catalog of all the files and folders before it starts coping, so it may be fine for it to delay a few minutes. Of course, if it delays an hour, something is causing it to hang. Your description of how long it takes (\"waited and waited\") doesn't tell me if that was a boring five minute wait or an hour wait. Not sure why you want to \"wipe\". Most people do that for no good reason, but maybe you have a darn good reason. Typically, wipe is chosen when the person hasn't a clue.
