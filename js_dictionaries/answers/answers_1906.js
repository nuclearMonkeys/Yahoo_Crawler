	101043 : ["Politics is politics.  'The West', that's us and the europeans are in the middle east because that's where the oil is.  If you remember your history, after WW1 with the defeat Germany and their turkish allies the old League of Nations issued a mandate allowing France and England to occupy what had been land belonging to the now defunct Ottoman empire.  France established Lebanon, which is why they speak french there and England established all of the other countries in the middle east with the exception of Iran.  The Brits appointed a few 'kings', such as the Saudi family in what is now Saudi Arabia and then proceeded to cut deals with their puppet governments to drain out their oil.  So far so good.  After WW2 the Brits once again received a mandate from the United Nations, or actually an extension of the mandate they had from the old League of Nations to establish Jordan, then named Trans-Jordan and in time they also established Israel...etc. ..etc...!  Meanwhile, the 'west', after keeping a rather low profile in the middle east began to import such things into the traditional lives of the natives such radical ideas as free speech, women's rights, democracy, western thought in general and rock and roll, blue jeans, McDonald's, and in the case of Israel....Jews!  Now there were folks in the middle east that saw all of these things and said...\"It is good'!  Others saw these things and said....\"It is evil' because the Holy Koran says....fill in the blanks...!  So now in our time we have a new dynamic.  Those in the middle east who are in favor of accommodating western ways....few in number....and those that want 'The West' out...many in number.  The problem is....'The West'  still wants their oil.  Therefore we support the Saudi family thugs who, should we leave the middle east will find themselves hanging from the nearest lamp post and we have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan acting as mercenaries for the Oil Mafia that has so much influence on 'our' government that at least in the case of 'oil'...they ARE the government!  Just as Americans fought to get rid of King George...which we did, or in the case of the Native Americans who fought to get rid of the paleface invaders...which they didn't, there are forces in the World of Islam that want to get rid of 'The West'.  It's as simple and as complex as that.  Extract the issue of oil and all of this would be over...but that ain't gonna' happen..is it?", 9767, "84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa", 0],

	101047 : ["The Constitution does not grant the federal government the authority to force private citizens to engage in commerce against their will.  That makes the individual mandate unconstitutional.  The mandate for employers with 50 or more employees to provide insurance will put further strain on those employers and force many of them to fire some employees or go out of business.  This means perhaps millions of new people on unemployment.  They will need extended unemployment benefits, which will increase the deficit.  Obamacare levies taxes on all medical equipment, which will raise the price of wheel chairs, canes, oxygen equipment, the table you sit on when you go to the doctor, tongue depressors, walkers, crutches, anything used by the medical profession or patients.  This will cause the cost of medical care to skyrocket.  And since the hospitals and doctors will have to buy less, that means the people who manufacture these items will have less business and will be firing employees, who will then go on the unemployment rolls and add to our deficit.   These are simple statements of fact based not on emotion but on information that is available to anyone who cares to read it.  How is that \"spreading hatred\"?   And as far as putting emotion behind assumptions, every argument you Libs have ever made for this bill has been based on things you've heard or read somewhere, things Obama had told you about the poor, sick, helpless people without insurance who die every year - what was that number, 14,000 every year, wasn't it?   Funny how he never backs up anything that comes out of his mouth, but you just emotionally believe him.

However, I doubt that Soros, who is a Jew and a former refugee from Nazi Germany, really has a lot of enthusiasm for \"Nazi style dehumanization.\" I'm not a fan of Soros, particularly, but it looks to me as if part of the American Right Wing is trying to do \"Nazi style dehumanization\" on him.   For a certain kind of far right activist, the kind of person who wants to blame every sin of modern capitalism on \"evil Jewish bankers,\" Soros is probably the perfect villain.  He is Jewish, he's enormously rich; his currency speculations helped to break the British pound in the 1990s, and he spends money promoting certain liberal causes.

	101086 : ["Apparently, you've been told that the Tea Parties are somehow \"anti-government\". Is this what the pundits you listen too have to do to keep you listening to them? The government George Washington fought for was NOT a big, bureaucratic encroaching government that practiced out-of-control spending hellbent on European-style Socialism. The Tea Parties are a grass-roots populist movement that is fed up with the out-of-control spending of the federal government. This frustration started with the Bush Administration and exploded during Obama's. The Tea Parties realize that they, as well as the rest of Americans will have to pay for all of this spending eventually through taxation. The sooner irresponsible spending stops, the less America will be trapped by it's debt.     The secondary issue for the Tea Parties is the move toward European socialism the Obama Administration is embarking on. Nationalized health care, a desire for it to be single-payer if all possible, \"social justice\" initiatives, bail-outs, taking an ownership of private enterprise, backing growth of union control, say over corporation salaries, interference in the bankruptcy proceeding, demotion of states rights, a disdain for the Constitutions restrictions on governments powers of economic issues and the \"help\" it can provide to Americans, openness to subjugating the US to EU environmental controls, promoting economy-killing policies like health care, Cap & Trade and Cash for Clunkers in the name of Progressive \"social justice\" and \"green\" redistribution of wealth and direct Executive Branch control of identifying \"troubled\" business.  The Tea Parties believe in the principle of the founders. The purpose of the government is to protect the natural rights of citizens and can not \"help\" in ways not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. This power is left to the states. The Tea parties recognize the importance of some federal regulation on interstate business, too much hurts business and can assert coercive control of government over business.  Listen to the language of those who object to the Tea Parties. Do you hear rational arguments against them or just attitude, hyperbole and diatribe? It's almost always the later. Ask yourself why that is so.", 9769, "7gWhhJktaa", 0],
	101087 : ["I agree with the comments by Joe S and Vince.  On a recent trip out of the US, I came across an interesting comparison.  In our country there is a sense that our system will provide for anyone who wishes to improve their own economic fortunes.  It is suggested in this question that anyone can simply \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps.\"  It is such a popular belief that it goes without question.  Here the idea is even unthinkably extended to the wealthy.    But other more socialistic countries (any of them,) don't have this concept so firmly ingrained into their psyche.  As a result; elsewhere, it is more likely to find more social compassion than in the US.   The proposed bailout was/is just that: a bailout with business as usual.  Like teenagers daring each other, risk taking will always continue unabated until someone gets hurt.  And then when it is possible for corporate leaders to shift the blame and responsibility they will do so.  Our system is not delivering either moral guidance or effective limitation either by legislation or stockholder accountability to these corporate leaders.   The money went to high risk mortgages because of the requirement for growth in an environment when there was more cash than investments.  This is a problem with our fiat currency, there is no limit to the amount of money that can be printed.   The system is not working and correction to corporate welfare is only a part of the solution.  It may be time for a return to a gold standard and seriously examine the need for a constitutional convention.  Our constitution is so old and out of date that it contains provisions for which the founders would be sued had they included them today.  However in todays environment I am not sure a fairer bargin could be struck.  Most importantly, is for us to examine what we want from our lives and what we are willing to give up to get it.", 9768, "L8zmQS8Jaa", 3],
