	70897 : ["First off, you are not fasting if you are looking to enjoy some sort of ice cream substitute. A fast is when you abstain from food. It sounds like you are just going vegan for a while, which is good. My advice, as an avid faster, to get the most out of your \"fast\", eat as many raw fruits and vegetables as possible. If you are craving something sweet, eat a ripe banana, mashed with some raisins. While you are \"fasting\" stay away from all processed foods, including soy ice cream. During your vegan diet, try making your own \"ice cream\" by blending fresh fruits and soy or rice milk, then freezing.  I just did this tonight with papaya, but it also works well with bananas and mangos.", 8602, "AA11091091", -1],
	70898 : ["There are a lot of vegan ice cream substitutes, as people mentioned from tofu or rice. But since you are really fasting I suggest this instead: Put a ripe banana in the freezer. It will turn completely black but this is ok. When it's frozen, peel off the skin with a knife, slice it up and eat it, it's as good as ice cream.", 8602, "hqXCb7Hzaa", 1],

Firstly we could use   lights which are more efficient, such as LEDs which are significantly more efficient than normal lights. Also we should try and use recyclable and recycled wrapping paper. Every year we fill several bags with paper which goes straight to the landfill, a massive waste especially when making recyclable paper shouldn't be particularly difficult. We should also try to use local produce when possible. The traditional   dinner exists because it comprises of food which is readily available at this time of year, so there should be no need for our food to come from any further affield than Europe at the most. Finally we can thank the TV channels for putting so much rubbish on the TV that no one should be wasting electricity watching the TV, so there is a positive already.", 8599, "VrsRx8Fraa", 1],

Dispose your   tree properly- go to a DIY disposal centre. 6. Buy presents with less packaging- the less packaging the less un-recyclable waste. 7. Recycle all packaging appropriately.  8. Use rechargeable batteries- saves money and electricity.  9. Buy food from a farmer's market -good for the environment and for you! 10. Make your decorations out of all un-recyclables: old wrapping paper or   cards, bottles caps or coloured paper.  11. Remember that all travel can be done by trains or buses or bikes rather than cars. 12. Reuse wrapping paper. 13. Buy 100% recycable cards. 14. Send e-cards! 15. Buy just enough food, because we all know we buy too much at  - make plans and don't over-do-it 16. Reuse   tins. 17. When shopping reuse bags. 18. Make your own   gifts to give out i.e. home-made chutney or biscuits. 19. Sell unwanted   gifts- instead of throwing them away. 20.

	70905 : ["Use LED lights on our trees and other lighted decorations. Recycle all our wrapping paper which we receive on our presents and do not use wrapping paper if possible on our own presents to others.  Buy our vegetables when in season and don't buy those which are not in season and have to be imported from warmer climes. We can also reduce the energy taken to cook food by cooking a full oven of food at a time instead of cooking items individually at different times.  Keeping a live   tree in the garden in a container, to reuse each year is also a brilliant way to save on artificial trees and also produce oxygen at the same time.  Give Eco friendly gifts and if possible don't give gifts which will cause Eco problems, ie. battery run objects which do not adapt to rechargeable batteries or can not be reused if batteries run out.Recycle all the old packaging and bottles cans etc.   Best way to make   greener is to walk or take the bus instead of taking the car.

Maybe breezes? ~ an icy wind wafts animals scurry to hide inside the old oak. I like this imagery. ~ tinkling of the bells windy music from the trees  is coming. I found   jarring here. Since   is not in nature, he does not fit the genre. ~ squirrels saving nuts burrow into hiding place food for winter nights. Perfect. ~ carolers singing the baby in the manger celebrate his birth. Something odd about the grammar here. Carolers singing the baby? ~ red, green lights twinkle on a seven foot pine tree stockings hanging near. Need description of the pine rather than a measurement. ~ in his old work shop daddy puts toys together mom wraps packages. Okay, but not really about nature. ~ silence in the night resting before morning light gifts under the tree One of my favorites. ~ to all a good night joyous greetings from tori wish you happiness. Form of haiku, but not the substance. ~ Cheers, Bruce", 8598, "Sn0CViR7aa", 4],

I love the whole, but my favorite is too darned hard to pick out.  Isn't zephyr your haiku and scifaiku name? I'm sure it is. It isn't an arcane word, just rarely used, but it is absolutely correct in the haiku. Thank you and may you have the most wonderful   of all. .", 8598, "Cuat0V6Raa", 2],
