He's one of the worst I think immortal technique is keeping it alive mostly because he speaks the truth on each song & tells people to download his music illegaly. Now that says somthing. He dosnt care weather he makes no money. He doing it for the love", 9574, "17ODvmpBaa", 0],
	96091 : ["Yes.  The reason I hate so much rap and hip hop is because of those people.  I don't want to listen to stupid people talking about how much money they have as if I give a f uck.  I want to hear a story, and I want to hear emotion.  That's what makes a song a song, and not a bunch of screaming monkeys with 20 pounds of gold plated cast iron around their necks.", 9574, "3Gx8GhJwaa", 2],
	96092 : ["It's all about the money. Artists don't even rap about what they want also, they rather rap about sex, money, and drugs because it sells. Obviously we can all see that.

	96094 : ["The main reason I can think of is because there are still a lot of other legends who haven't really been inducted, who have even been around longer than The Rock, guys like Macho Man Randy Savage, or The Ultimate Warrior, or Sting, who still have not been inducted, and for the most part, careers are over. Even though The Rock has no interest in returning to the ring, The Rock could still go in the ring if he had too, I don't plan on seeing him wrestle anytime soon, and it might never happen again, but I wouldn't say it couldn't, because The Rock is still young and very capable of competing, so that is one reason, because I still think the HOF should be for Legends whose careers are pretty much done within the ring and there is no way they will return. Another good reason is, well, it will give something for The Rock to look forward too when he gets older. There is no doubt that The Rock has accomplished a lot of great deeds in his short wrestling career, but I don't see the rush to put him in the Hall of Fame, personally, I think it would be more of an honor for him if he got a chance to look back on all his great accomplishments in his retirement years, and WWE showed the world what made The Rock special. So, no, he is not over rated, but, yes, it is too soon for The Rock to be inducted this year, because the Hall of Fame is meant for the older generations to have that one last moment in the spotlight and reminisce the highlights of their careers, and to have one last chance to entertain the fans, and kind of connect with the fans, by showing the fans their appreciation to them, and also to give the fans one last chance to appreciate that stars efforts they put into the ring, before going into Wrestlemania, where it is all about the current generation of great wrestling superstars!!! The Rock is Hall of Fame Material, so it will happen with time, Dwayne Johnson has Future Hall of Famer written all over him!!!", 9571, "njn1I1FUaa", 0],
	96095 : ["No..the Rock should not get inducted in the HoF.. Its way to soon. Maybe in 10 or 20 years, but not that soon. The Rock is maybe a great actor and Mic-worker, but hes not a legend in my eyes, hes not a legend like Ric Flair or Taker is.", 9571, "KgsuCqEbaa", -1],

	96113 : ["Actually, if you really think about this question...50 Cent will sell more and make more money off of a album he drops the same day as Kanye. This is because 50 has been around maybe 7-8 years more in the rap game(including when he released mixtapes) and he also has many endorsments in other companies making him a better and widely known person. The music might not be something to relate the two with, but 50 Cent definately is made more public and well known through rap and other things that he does.", 9575, "OYgoR0SKaa", 1],

	96115 : ["Although I do l2 south side rappers, they are more mainstream and are the reason hip hop died in the 1st place. I think the most lyrical rappers have been from the east coast, and thera are quite a few from west coas, mid west as well", 9574, "tgY1HdkCaa", 1],
	96116 : ["lol@\"Pac and Biggie put West and East on the map\" I'm a Pac fan, no, a Pac stan, but that's a little too much credit. Both coasts were already on the map long before they came around.  South sucks. There's only a few people from there that I think are good and none of them are among that list you named.  I don't think anybody is keeping it alive, I think it's dead or at least has a very faint pulse that the underground is responsible for. But even the underground is nowhere near as good as it used to be. It was a lot better before because it was harder to make money underground and all the underground guys were trying hard to make it to the major leagues. Nowadays, with the internet and more independent labels, it's a lot easier for them to make a living and I think a lot aren't trying as hard as they normally would.", 9574, "None", 3],
