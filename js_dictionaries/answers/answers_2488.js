	130245 : ["I get your point....I really do.  I'm just not sure it is feasible.   I know your opinion on allowing your dogs to remain intact.  While I totally respect this and I knwo YOU are able to be a responsible owner of intact dogs, many aren't.  I also know that you would be quite pissed if you were in a mandatory spay and neuter area.  The mandatory Spay and Neuter laws in areas such as Las Vegas have been largely unsuccessful.  There are loopholes. I think the problem is, that it is hard to distinguish the \"good\" dog owners from the irresponsible ones.  Then, we have all owners lumped together and subjected to the laws that should only affect the \"bad\" ones. The problem is, a dog is considered property and then as humans we have rights with our property.  I hear it all the time here \"don't listen to these idiots.  It's your dog, breed it if you want to.\"  We live in an egocentric \"it's all about me\" world.  People don't think of the big picture.  Frankly many don't think past their own wants and needs. While I think your plan has a basis for solving the problem, I don't think it will work. ETA: I think UHave2Be summed up part of what I was trying to say waaaaay better than I did.  (Its before 8am for me too...I think we are both in CA)  It seems that laws sometimes only affect the people who follow them.  There will still be selfish idiots who do what they want. Funny thing is, I don't care if someone like you (Jen) or UHave2Be has an intact dog because I know you will not have \"accident\" litters BUT the only law that I have seen so far attempting to control the animal population is mandatory spay and neuter laws.  To get around it, you just have to pay your $20 a year and some BYB, pet quality dog can keep pumping out litters.  Maybe if they were more selective who was allowed the permit...I dunno.

	130246 : ["Dogs have come to serve a new purpose: companionship. This purpose among the usually thought of purposes like livestock herding, sled pulling, hunting, etc are useful to human society. The only problem we have is with owners of these pets who do not or cannot afford to take care of their pets. Cats are not as useful in other areas, but serve great as companions and as pest removers. Sometimes people can't afford to take care of their animal any longer, or their pet has puppies or kittens because they couldn't get their animals spayed or neutered. This problem will not go away by charging more money to those who have animals, only by allowing them less expensive options to take care of their pets, at least vital services like spay & neuter, euthanization, and shots that are vital to the safety of the populations of both people and pets such as rabies, parvo, worms, etc. This is the only way that the overpopulation and cost will go down. The bottom line is, some people do extremely stupid things, have extremely stupid ideas, and cannot help to create problems for everyone else. The only way to fix this problem is through education and affordableness. Yes, unwanted animals that are being kept in shelters should probably be euthanized if they are there for too long of a time and no one wants them. It's sad, but that's how it is. If these solutions were put into place, I would not be able to support them, because they would not work. People still smoke even though cigarettes keep getting more and more expensive. There are low income spay and neuter clinics everywhere. The one I volunteer at is in a small town who used to have an extreme overpopulation of stray cats and a small number of stray dogs. Since we started doing the clinic, the number of these strays has been cut in half. Partially because generous townspeople have brought in some of these strays to be fixed and get a few shots to help keep them from spreading diseases. The problem with these is that people don't know about them, and that a few people are stupid enough to think that they want to breed their dogs or that their dog is tougher without being fixed. These people just need to be educated and over time, there would be fewer and fewer of them.", 11060, "74mDvMJraa", 1],
