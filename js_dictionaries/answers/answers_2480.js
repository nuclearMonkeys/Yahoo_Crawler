	129825 : ["Your instructor's confused. (Actually, if s/he's distinguishing between \"equations\" and \"formulas\" then s/he's really confused.) A periodic equation is one whose value repeats exactly as its argument increases. A recursive equation is a sequence of functional values in which any but the first value of the sequence depends on one or more previous values of the sequence. They are not the same thing (though there are recursive equations that are also periodic). Fibonacci numbers are an example of a recursive relation:  F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1,   F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1  F = 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, ... where n is the sequence index (I can't type subscripts here, but I don't care) So is this, in which the recursion relation includes an independent variable x:  y(n, x) = A y(n-1, x) + (1 - A) x(n) where A is a constant 0 < A < 1 and n is again the sequence index. This is a low-pass filter, much like the filters in your MP3 player. Your book's \"Recursive Formula of a Sequence\" is probably a good place to start, though it may emphasize the closed-form solution of recursion equations to yield a y = f(n) or y = f(n,x) sort of relation. Sometimes this is possible, but usually not, and rarely is it useful. w", 11051, "None", 0],

Pretty, soft, feminine, and delicate, and anything that you would want to see on a girl. Boys: Brennan - 4/10 - an okay name, and not really my style. All names beginning in \"Bren\" were ruined for me after my mother bought a rabid poodle named Brendell (actually happened). Easton -11/10 - I love this name. I can't even begin to stress how much I love it. It's masculine, strong, uncommon, and still has enough edge and interest to keep it from falling into the category of the Ronalds and Williams and Charles'. Gavin - 7/10 - I like this name. Reminds me of the song Angel by Gavin Friday. Aiden - 5/10 - a neutral name for me, and a teensy bit boring, since it's a common name where I live.

	129856 : ["This is similar to a question posed a while ago. The simplest way to do this is to prove the identity tan x * tan(60+x)* tan(60 -x) = tan 3x. To see how this implies the result, put x = 10 Then tan 10* tan 70 * tan 50 = tan 30. But note that tan 70 = cot 20 = 1/tan 20 and tan 50 = cot 40 = 1/tan 40 So, plugging that in,  we have tan 10/ tan 20 * tan 40 = tan 30 or tan 10 = tan 20*tan 30*tan 40, as required. It remains to prove the identity. First, we need that tan 60 = â3. Then tan(60+ x) = (â3 +tan  x)/(1 - â3*tan x) Also tan(60 -x) =   (â3 -tan  x)/(1 + â3*tan x). Multiplying these together gives (3- tan^2 x)/ (1 -- 3*tan^2 x). Finally, multiplying by tan x, we get (3 tan x - tan^3 x)/(1 - 3 tan^2 x), which is the formula for tan 3x.", 11052, "820e78fb52fa6459785b110a32d806b6aa", 8],
