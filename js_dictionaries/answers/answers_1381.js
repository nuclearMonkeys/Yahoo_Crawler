	74663 : ["1) Your attempt to twist this ignores the overriding directive to \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and give to God what is Gods\".  The message is that YOU as an individual must help those who need it, NOT your government.   2) Concerning what women do with their bodies, Republicans have been consistent in their upholding of the sixth commandment, as have many others from different political parties.  And yes when pilgrims arrived here to settle and start a new nation, it was with Christian beliefs. 3) Republicans have never been anti-government, just for smaller less intrusive government and lower taxes.  Consider that with your lower taxes, you can help others out who need it, which is consistent with the call to help others that you cite in the second paragraph of your diatribe.", 8776, "XxSj6AsBaa", 2],
	74664 : ["The right seeks to liberate corporations from all oversights while controlling our private lives from the choices we make about whom we marry, how many children we have, where we send those children to school etc.  It is a world where the government does come into our homes; and I am very uncomfortable with that.  I make rightful decisions but those decisions do not follow the same as those from the Republican party.", 8776, "AA11904370", -1],
	74665 : ["Charity, helping others, is NOT done at the point of the spear, or under threat of imprisonment..  Telling a woman what she can do with HER body is slightly different from telling her what she can do, at taxpayer expense, to the body that she caused to grow inside her.  You can marry anyone you want, if they agree.  Just don't expect or demand that society accept your \"marriage\" as valid. The government Republicans, most of them at least, is the LIMITED one we were given by the Founders of this nation.", 8776, "None", 0],
	74666 : ["Think about it, you are already paying for the people who cannot afford health care.  That is one of the reasons health insurance costs are rising.  People who have no coverage and cannot pay, go to emergency rooms that cannot turn them away for health care.  The cost is then passed down to those who can pay.  If you are going to pay taxes for health care, and you do, in medicare and unemployment tax, you mught as well gt something out of it too.", 8773, "AA10465540", 2],

	74671 : ["The biggest problem these days is the reason people get married. I mean sure they love each other when they marry, but they don't date long enough to really get to know the person they are marrying and then after a while the shall we say infatuation wears off and then they are stuck married to someone they really don't love as much as they thought they did.  As far as men differing from women in reasons for separating or divorcing, it is because women are not afraid of being alone and men are. I am a man and I have been married 3 times over a 26 year period and I discovered this about myself with the help of my third wife. We talked a lot and we are still friends to this day. I don't know any other way to put it other than, make sure that marriage is what you really want before you do it.", 8775, "69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa", 0],
	74672 : ["I think you didn't want to hear this, but honestly, I really do believe it's because less women are sitting at home taking care of the children, and out in the work place, and do not have to put up with a lot of crapola anymore, so they don't! Men may get a little more \"domesticated\" when they are older, and perhaps some women that marry old men when they are younger are having second thoughts when they are more mature, and the guy gets much older too.  Over all, though, I think men have always been less likely to be the one to file for divorce.  They would rather have their cake and eat it too.  Well, that's not cuttin' it with us Broads anymore, because we cookies have gotten a LOT smarter!", 8775, "None", 1],
	74673 : ["To answer it simply. FEMA and the Red Cross have completely different purposes really. FEMA specializes in managing what goes down prior to a disaster. They manage emergency crews, government/army groups, and the citizens affected by the disaster. The Red Cross is more of a humanitarian organization. They specialize in providing helpful services for those affected by disasters; such as providing food, water, and medical care.", 8779, "h8daoNT0aa", 1],

	74688 : ["Women file for divorce twice as often as men do in the 'western world' right now. That trend has been true essentially since women begain receiving custody, child support and alimony. Some states/countries have moved beyond that now to having the 'default' arrangement be 50/50 shared parenting post divorce with child support only accouting for income differential, since both are supporting the kids part of the time.  In those regions, the divorce rate drops. Women divorce more then men because they expect to keep their home and children and simply cut the father out while getting income from him.  Men who divorce expect to lose their kids, their homes and continue to financially support a woman they no longer want to be with.", 8775, "53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa", 0],

Who bailed out GM and all the other private companies who made a mess of their financies putting not only their company and employees at risk but employees of smaller companies all over the world. Are these companies going to pay to clean up the streets after storms, flooding etc? I think not.. In the modern world there needs to be cooperation and collaboration between public and private organisations. The private sector is good at innovating but they have a habit of raping people due to financial greed. Public organisations can provide incentives for private companies, regulation to prevent them raping us and to maintain fairness in a world dominated by faceless multinational companies with no particular allegence.

	74700 : ["See your problem is you're quoting the Jesus of Love.  The one they worship is the Jesus of Money! They need to re-read the Gospel of Matthew 25. It's about achieving salvation by helping the least among us. Many theologians call that passage the \"Judgement of Nations\" (although the meaning of 'nation' is not the modern meaning). KJV:  NASB:  37 \"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?\" 38 \"When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?\" 39 \"Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?\" 40 \"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" .", 8776, "IM30PoPNaa", -5],
	74701 : ["Homeless people are largely homeless, because of government interference in a market system (mortgage industry) it had no business meddling with. The sub prime mortgage debacle would have been eliminated if government hadn't insulated lenders from making bad loans. Then lying to investors about the quality of derivatives. There would have been no need for the bailouts to Obama's Wall Street buddies. There is an economic principle: Whatever the government pays for, it will produce more of. I guarantee, if the government pays for homeless, jobless, hungry people it will only produce more jobless, hungry and homeless people.   Republicans like me (TEA party patriots) want a limited government. If you are still reading this, Government has no business changing a hundred thousand contracts by altering the definition of a word. Republicans want to save and preserve (Innocent) life. Not all life. There is a huge difference.  Jesus said many things besides your hippie feel good misconceptions.  Jesus called most of his disciples while they were at work -e.g. fishing, or at a tax office. David and Moses were both called when they were out with the sheep. Elisha was called while he was plowing. Jesus seemed to like busy industrious people, commending shrewd stewards, hard-working managers that turned a profit, and centurions who were senior military officers bearing considerable responsibility in tough times.", 8776, "261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa", 1],
