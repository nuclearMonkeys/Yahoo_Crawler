ErrorSafe may give exaggerated warnings of threats on the computer which tricks the user into purchasing a registered full version of the software in order to remove the reported threats. Toolbar888 is a malicious spyware program. Toolbar888 installs itself silently on your PC, possibly as part of a wider malware infestation. This program will install an Internet Explorer toolbar, and will deliver enormous numbers of popup adverts. Toolbar888 creates a huge security hole in your PC, and transmits the keywords that you search for to a 3rd party server. Toolbar888 is also known as FreeProdTB. Yoou can also use this to remove winfixer,free. Spybot - Search & Destroy detects and removes spyware, a relatively new kind of threat not yet covered by common anti-virus applications. Spyware silently tracks your surfing behaviour to create a marketing profile for you that is transmitted without your knowledge to the compilers and sold to advertising companies. If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you haven't intentionally installed, if your browser crashes inexplicably, or if your home page has been \"hijacked\" (or changed without your knowledge), your computer is most probably infected with spyware. Even if you don't see the symptoms, your computer may be infected, because more and more spyware is emerging. Spybot-S&D is free.", 8344, "effa79c5567a10463ae7886adc920f55aa", 1],

Goldfish grow to be a foot long (30 cm) and will die prematurely in a small tank. If you want to keep any fish in that tank, go with a rosy minnow, as it is a cold water/temperate fish that will fit in the tank you have. Other than that you could get a white cloud mountain minnow, but only 2. To get a betta you would need to get a heater. I highly recommend you get a bigger fish tank.
