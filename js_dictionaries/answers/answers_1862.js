	98835 : ["I think that it is a great idea, I posted the article last week on here in a question of my own. If you read/listen to the entire story, it's not just about dress size. They are trying to make sure that the models are healthy.  It's been a growing problem that young women and teens have started to have more and more disorders from trying to be too thin. Everything from eating disorders to misuse of diet pills has cause some teens and young women to become very sick, and like you mentioned, sometimes even die. Fashion models have become the standard for beauty, so I think that women who have these health problems should not be applauded. We wouldn't tell our daughters that it is good to starve themselves, so why should we want their role models to look like that?  Their rule for women with a BMI under 18 to be excluded, and any women with a BMI under 16 will be given a physical at the location by a qualified doctor. They are telling these women, and the world, that unhealthy women will no longer be the accepted standard for beauty anymore. If you look at a picture of the women who are suspected of having a too low BMI, they look sick. These women are underweight and frequently malnourished. Not only is it unhealthy, it looks like they came from an underprivilaged country.  I honestly don't see this ban as any different from other public health laws. Smoking in public has been banned in many states, drinking laws have gotten more strict some places, soda machines have been taken out of many schools, schools are doing BMI testing on students, and even the fast food places have tried to offer healthy menu chioces after protests that they are contributing to US obesity. If we can help people from being unhealthy and overwieght, then what is the difference in trying to help people avoid being unhealthy and underwieght? In my opinion, there is none.", 9679, "e2dfd7eb65d0d2120a4565407a8c2ee7aa", 1],

	98883 : ["I see. And what sort of \"the occult\" would this person be being in? I only ask that because people said to be into the occult don't consider themselves to be occult at all. Terms like witchcraft, black magic and sorcerer weren't used by the people who were / are accused of them, they're used by the accusers. Not so many centuries ago, the Christian church was known for going on holy rampages across the known world. The object of these missions was to convert everyone to Christianity, and they were dead serious about it. If they saw any faith or spiritual belief that wasn't their own, it was labelled as the occult and devil-worship. Any non-Christian rituals of any kind were called black magic, and any followers or adherents were branded as witches and sorcerers. They were then arrested, made to confess through torture, and either conditionally released as converted & saved Christians or burned to death in public. Note that there was no room for negotiation or explanation, and no offer of agreeing to disagree was made. A person was either a devout Christian or a Satanist, and that was the end of the debate for the Christians. I only say that so that you'll have a background on what the occult is, and you can look it all up in any history book if you want to verify it. Since the days of the inquisitions and crusades, the church has backed off when it comes to executing non-believers. But that was actually very recently, and since then a number of faiths have emerged. Contrary to what their followers may tell you, religions like Wicca and LaVeyan Satanism are actually less than a century old. There is always Vodou of course, which is pretty old, but nobody has ever heard of a real Vodou curse being cast unless you count Hollywood movies. Contrary to popular belief and most religious hysteria, most 'occult' religions and beliefs aren't into curses and spell-casting. So if some kid (because it won't be an adult) puts a curse on you, tell them you used The Force to protect yourself from it and thumb your nose at them. If they believe in Harry Potter but not The Force, now who's being naive? There is, however, one curse that does work. But it's not occult or even religious in nature. This curse has worked perfectly every time it has been cast, and it might have even been cast against you already. You'll know the curse when you hear it, because it goes \"when you get older and have kids of your own, I hope they act just like you\".", 9682, "None", 0],
