	79008 : ["From what I understand the delivery charge does not go to the driver. The driver uses his/her own car and gas, etc. So, yes you need to tip the driver. I have seen this question here before and I wish someone in management at the pizza restaurant would post here and tell us why they have started charging this fee. I no longer get my pizza delivered. I have found a pizza restaurant in my neighborhood that doesn't offer delivery, Their pizza is way cheaper and way better than the chains!

	79009 : ["I always gave them $3-5 or at least as much as I would leave in a restaurant. One day the pizza place I called charged me a $3.50 delivery charge and I figured that was their built-in tip to make up for people that didn't tip, so I paid it but didn't give anything extra. The next time I called the same pizza shop, they refused to deliver to me because I didn't tip the delivery guy. I just laughed and told them your loss! That was about 4 or 5 years ago. There are at least 20 different pizza shops within a 5 mile radius from us and they're all dying for business including the one that refused to deliver to us. They've all lowered their prices and guess what? I hardly ever eat pizza anymore unless I make it myself.", 8968, "f28111cd5ef37f3683a2b5ef27104608aa", 0],

	79015 : ["The fact that we are living and breathing and able to do all these things. The fact that we are not rocks and some divine coincidence made use who we are instead of some inorganic atom. The fact we can give things worth. We can categorise. Its all beautiful, the sight, the sound, the feel, the emotion, the taste. Even pain. We can feel that not many other things can. Pain may be painful, but we can feel it just as we can feel happy. Its amazing really that out of all of this we can do these things. Although it seems to suck sometimes its still wonderful.  random fact: if you shoot a rabbit, it doesnt know why it feels pain, it doesn't register that there is an explanation, it just knows it feels pain and as a reaction will run away, even if its dying. Shoot a human (even if they did not know what a gun was) it would realise its something launched, have some sort or knowledge of what to do and so on. I dont think this was relevant but its written now... But if youre looking for one reason it would definitely be pie.", 8969, "5KyleJnnaa", 4],

There are always unexpected things in life, you didn't know would happen, but they DO happen! Don't expect things to happen, just lay back and let them flow. Don't worry about the future! You don't have to worry about bad things that probably won't even happen. That's how people lose their minds! They think other people always talk about them! No, just NO! And if they do, who cares? It's those peoples' faults' if they wanna be rude and mean and bully other people, saying UNTRUE things! That's what makes life worth living! Everyone in this world has a part in this world.
