	84760 : ["If you say yes, you would be called a racist.  But quite frankly, a man with hardly any experiecne, except for state govt. and 2 years in the senate with no great accomplishments would not make it this far (if her were white).  Look at all the other candidates who had much more experience on both side.  where are they now???  They faded away", 9169, "fbeba5dc300a1f4a43941be04a82654aaa", 4],

	84762 : ["I think Obama is getting so many votes because he is intelligent and a great speaker.  To those of you saying he is getting the black vote or simply getting them because is is black your wrong. Look at his supporters, they are all races genders and ages. He seems genuine and seems to really care about the american people. He sees that we are more divided than ever and wants to bring the country back to where we can focus on the bigger issues despite or differences on trival things. But just like all politicans, what they say, and what they will do when they get elected is something different. I;m personally against the bush/clinton/bush/clinton regime. mccain or obama 08!", 9169, "FMMjMnUyaa", -3],
	84763 : ["Those that matter do not mind. Those that mind, do not matter. (I learned to repeat this to myself after it was told to me in counselling.) Drop the drama.  It could be more perceived within yourself than what is actually happening. Girls are a trip.  If you get along with your friend, so be it. You have no one to please but yourself. As long as you are not purposely avoiding others, or being outright rude, I say do as your heart leads and lose the losers that bother you. When I am in tough times, I always tell myself, \"Soon this will just be a memory.\" Best wishes!", 9167, "ohuYrgWaaa", 4],
	84764 : ["Yeah... the other girls are just SUPER JEALOUS. Who cares about them. You guys have each other and thats all that matters. As soon as the other girsl see that you obviously don't care they will get over themselves and leave you alone. I've never had anything like that happen to me before but its really obvious that they are jealous. Don't worry about anythiing!! Hope I could help!!", 9167, "DXNqtq4yaa", 2],
	84765 : ["Your understanding of what humans were at one time is an understanding that many have today, given to them by secular scientists that do not believe the Word of God.  Darwin's 200th anniversary was just celebrated this year, and his macro-evolutionary thinking has been embraced by scientists and society for most of that time.  This is because man does not want to believe there is a Creator, man wants to believe that we came from an organism and all evolved from that organism millions of years ago.  This way, we can live however we choose to live, free of God's law.   There is no missing link that has ever been found that proves the theory of evolution, and carbon bone dating is a method scientists have \"perfected\" by their own rules and thoughts.   God created Adam and Eve, in the first chapter of Genesis, on the 6th day.  Adam and Eve talked with God, and God even had Adam name every animal that He had created.  There has always been a language, albeit a language that you and I don't understand, but a language that did not consist of grunts and slaps on the head.  You've been watching the Discover channel, and the stories and recreations you see on that channel are just that: stories.  Man created the caveman, there is NO proof that any such being ever existed.  No scientist can prove that the Neanderthal man couldn't speak (which the neanderthal man is another discussion entirely), and for that matter, no scientist can prove that dinosaurs were the gray color you see all of them today in the skin added after bones are put together.   So you can choose to believe all the claims around you with no proof, or choose to read the Bible for yourself and come to your own conclusions.", 9174, "3Bc4FoLdaa", 0],

	84767 : ["They'll say they won't support Obama until he is the official nominee. As long as they think Hillary has a chance, they will say they won't vote for Obama so as to make the case against him stronger and the case for Hillary stronger.  After Obama officially wraps it up, and the choice is Obama or McCain, we'll see real Democrats go behind Obama.", 9170, "e19ukSO0aa", -6],

	84770 : ["i'm a REPUBLICAN and that i could vote for Hillary to be the Democratic Presidential candidate because i comprehend she couldn't in any respect win hostile to even the worst Republican candidate. If the Democrats make Hillary the Democratic nominee they are handing the Presidency over to us Republicans. She is too polarized to the acute left. Her ties with the acute liberals are genuine reliable. she will be able to keep attempting to seem center of the left yet her balloting record and public comments from the previous will be presented up in the course of the campaigning.", 9175, "p2hhhUaKaa", 0],

	84772 : ["Well, most people were not pleased with W or his old man, so it is not surprising at all he would think the same.  Calling Hillary as an erstwhile politician is, well, far fetched.", 9175, "V7lUyjDSaa", 0],

	84778 : ["When I got married, my wife had a shoe box full of similar mementos. I got hacked off about it and she threw some of the stuff away. After a few years when we were both more mature and comfortable in out relationship, it came up in conversation. I explained that the reason I didn't like it was that I felt threatened by them. She just said, that there was never a reason to be threatened. These were her memories. Documentation of where she was and who she was with during a certain time in her life. She said that there was a reason they were ex-boyfriends, and that the reason she got rid of some of them was because she still had those memories in her head and that it wasn't worth losing me over. It is just his way of cataloging his past. If it bothers you, ask him if he would mind losing some of the stuff. I bet he loves you enough to thin out his collection.", 9173, "None", 0],

	84780 : ["I wanted to add my opinion quickly before the question gets deleted. No, if Obama were white he would have never even won his state Senate seat nor the US Senate.

	84782 : ["If Obama were white, he would just be another politician running for president. The only reason why he is where he is, is because he is African American.  He has no outstanding plans, no out-of-the ordinary answers to our problems.

He won't take WV in the Fall so that 70% doesn't matter there.. it's hopeless. The big problem will be the nearly 30% of PA and OH who said they won't vote for him.

	84792 : ["Ask yourself this?  What has Trump really succeeded at? If you ask me, it's 2 things: 1.  Pumping up the image of \"the Donald.\" 2.  Running his companies into the ground, some repeatedly, and then taking them through bankruptcy successfully to re-emerge has healthy companies. It's true.  He's run virtually every one of his companies into bankruptcy.  Some more than once!
