	13730 : ["If the balance owed, interest rate, and loan term are the same then the payments and total interest are going to be the same. In the real world credit cards usually have a longer amortization schedule and the minimum payment resets each month. For example they might give you a minimum payment that would pay off your balance in 5  years. But next month the balance owed is a little less, so the minimum payment is a little less. Each month they set the minimum payment at the amount that would pay off THAT balance in 5 years from THAT month. So its like you're constantly making the first payment on a 5 year loan, and the payoff date is always 5 years away. Of course if you keep paying the same amount  as that first payment and you don't reduce your payment to the new, lower minimum each month then you'd pay it off 5 years from the original payment. In terms of  your credit score the loan is probably better. Credit cards are called a \"revolving credit\" because you can constantly borrow more money. Whereas loans are a 1 time thing with a fixed repayment schedule. One factor in your credit score is the balance owed on your revolving accounts relative to the limit. For the best scores you want to keep your balance owed at or below 1/3 of your limit on all revolving accounts. But its not better if you borrow money on a loan, then you don't have the self control to stop using the credit card. If you borrow money to pay of the card then you run up the balance on the card again you just end up with twice as much debt.", 2288, "Jvx658HFaa", 3],

If it's not paying on time, then start paying on time--if it's carrying too much debt for your income level, then start paying down the debt by making MORE than your minimum payments. If it's bankruptcy, or collections, then get those collections paid, and just wait on the bankruptcy--because that stays on your report for a long long time. (ten years or more).  The best way is not to open other credit accounts, don't take out loans, don't try to live on money you don't really have and get your bills paid.
