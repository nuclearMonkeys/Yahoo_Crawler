''Mel'nica'' (Mill) - folk rock ''Agatha Christie'' - well...mind-blowing. I don't like ''Kino\", Viktor Zcoy - pop-rock. Was very-very popular.

Ahaha...yes. It was my party. 0_O See, last weekend I had my birthday party at my grandmother's cabin, but my PC wasn't working, so I didn't want to miss anime, so Saturday night while my other friends were down at the cabin playing sleep-over games and whatever, I was in my grandmother's living room, watching anime.

	100213 : ["Well this is pretty simple.. The onboard Radeon is always in use by the computer and the built in display. You really can't say you never use it, you use it every time you turn on your computer. It uses a shared memory technology and the less RAM you make available to it in the BIOS the lower the resolution and color depth you will have available to you when you restart, hence the big icons and lack of colors. You need to give it between 16MB and 32MB minimum to be able to run modern office and productivity applications. This type of Video memory sharing is a slower technology than having dedicated high speed video memory that is separate. Computers designed this way generally aren't that great for high end graphics processing such as gaming, video editing, animation creation and rendering, High Speed Simulations, etc. The only way to not have this problem is to get a notebook comptuer that has dedicated video memory for the onboard graphics card/chipset.
