	4164 : ["Of all the English speaking countries in the world, Canadians have arguably contributed less to our mother tongue than people any place else. Think of the colorful words and phrases that Ireland and Australia have given us. Think about the massive linguistic influence of the Americans. That's Canada's greatest offering? \"Eh\"? Then again, if you've ever been to Canada and interacted with Canadians, you're likely well aware that while they're astoundingly boring, they're certainly polite and agreeable for the most part, but they're not exactly the sharpest characters going.

	4169 : ["Yes. Voltage does not cause heating, current does. The wire or conductor does not even need to be insulated to work at high voltage; many early electrical systems used bare wires supported at intervals by ceramic blocks, and power distribution systems often use bare copper \"busbars\", well spaced inside metal enclosures. The important part is that spacing between conductors is well over the possible arcing distance via air or the insulation. Any wire or cable supplied by a reputable company will have a specification for its maximum working voltage, which depends mainly on the insulation type and thickness. A lot also have the ratings marked on them.", 702, "T5MR7fNHaa", 1],
	4170 : ["The insulation on wire is rated for a maximum voltage.  The wire can be used below the voltage rating of the insulation, not above.  Any wire with no voltage rating printed or molded into the insulation is for low voltage only.  I'll make an arbitrary guess and say 24 volts. The thickness (cross sectional area) of the conductor determines how much current the wire can sustain. ", 702, "None", 1],
	4171 : ["You surely are unclear! Your supply voltage is 120 volts AC at maximum of 15 amps.  Your needed voltage is 9 to 18 volts AC?  Or DC?  Are these voltages stepped or variable?  120 volts at 15 amps is 1800 watts 9 volts at 40 amps is 360 watts 18 volts at 40 amps is 720 watts Surely you can use a step-down transformer to provide your needed lower voltage at the required amps. Can you more ACCURATELY describe the voltages and currents required?  FYI: You can not modify a 15 amp receptacle to give more current.  A whole new branch circuit must be constructed with the proper circuit breaker at the panel, along with heavier gauge wiring and the proper receptacle.  Update: You are very confused. You say you want to supply \"a device\". Then you say you \"will be running a circuit in mixed parallel/series with multiple lines of different voltages but constant current\". I suggest that you seek help at your location. You cannot supply various constant current sources from a single source. You can buy a low voltage, high current DC power supply that has CV output or CC output, but you sensibly can supply just one load. You don't need 40 amps from your wall receptacle.  15 amps is adequate.  It seems that you do not understand electricity.", 703, "None", 1],
