Then Hillary was talking about Obama not having any diplomatic relationships in the Middle East which led me to finding out how he made that one leader mad and both jumping on John Edwards for his foreclosures in New Orleans at the same time he's shown giving them sympathy!

	78651 : ["Dearest, have you ever seen a political race yet that did not involve/include some \"infighting\" amongst the candidates. Have you ever seen a race wherein even your beloved GOP had the grace and common sense to promote only its \"best\" candidate and none of the others took shots at one another? I think not. Enjoy the political tabloids while you can; the GOP will get its collective head handed to it in the next presidential election.", 8956, "336704ebb7887b4a469719c72c79a9f4aa", -1],

That can lead to love possibly. I say just take a chance if I met someone who I were infatuated with and who felt the same way about me, then I'd risk it. I'd take my time, not rush into marriage or anything, but I really would have nothing to lose and only a love to gain.", 8959, "5d4086bf6180dad4ada0540f4f0142d8aa", 1],

I gave him my number and he knew when he saw me that I was the one.  Me on the other hand was skeptical and not sure at first, but the way everything played out, we feel in love, married and have 2 boys.  We have been married 10 years.  Although I love him.  I do not love his family and right now that is the only source of our problems.  We fight mainly over family.  They never accepted me because we married so quickly.

	78663 : ["There certainly are a great deal of intolerant people here answering this question.   I think Obama has his priorities really messed up.  As a far, far left liberal he sees things in a slanted way that the US is very bad.  I hate the apologies he has been making and this stance towards terrorists. American has been strong in the past due to our superiority, peace through strength.  Now, he apologizes and at a time where we need to be strong with Korea, for example, he's being a wimp.  At a time where a nuclear war could really be a threat, he's talking about getting rid of our nuclear weapons. His ideas about guns and their control have people really scared.  To some (I do not own a gun but appreciate the right to if I wanted one) having their gun is security.  Our forefathers had escaped tyranny and felt that people in this free country should always be able to stand up for themselves. He even insults people of faith all the time as well, World Day of Prayer is a prime example, just another slap in the face.  He's out there bowing to a king of a nation who has not been our friend and then he is not showing our own people that he cares enough to show respect for a day set aside for prayer by attending a simple ceremony. I could go on, but it's making me in a rather foul mood to begin my day.  I can't wait until the next election.", 8958, "AA12212403", 2],

	78667 : ["Signing Vick would be a waste for the Vikings.  They need a quarterback who can make plays in the passing game, not another running back.  I don't think any NFL team will sign him.  His asking price of $10 million is just unrealistic, plus, he wasn't that good to begin with.

I say these teams for they are starting less quality QBs and by week 4 if they are horrible than Vick will be cheap and hope to turn it around. The Jaguars I think would be the best place because Garrad struggles and not a quality QB and if DelRio doesn't do something bold to change that team he is probably fired after this year.", 8957, "8ixOAGgQaa", -1],
