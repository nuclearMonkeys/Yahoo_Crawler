	752 : ["Refusing the vaccine in the middle of a pandemic isn't being neutral-- 560K Americans who have died from COVID is the \"side effect\" of not getting the vaccine.  Waiting another year means another year of risking death or serious illness from COVID.  On the other hand, if you don't want the vaccine, 10 other ppl are fighting to get it.  I have friends who drove to a vaccination center 150 miles away to get vaccinated.  The scientists are in a no win situation.  If they took 5 years to find a vaccine, ppl would say:  \"What the H took so long?\"  If they work fast, then they are viewed with jaundiced eyes.  I am a lifelong Republican, wear a mask (long before a state mandate which came way too late imho) and got vaccinated.  ", 134, "None", 1],

	755 : ["Not all antibodies are the same. A test for HIV antibodies is a test to see if you have an active infection of HIV and it does not mean the person is immune. With COVID there are neutralizing antibodies and then there are antibodies that are not. The test for general antibodies is not the same test as a test for neutralizing antibodies. The test for neutralizing antibodies is taking your serum and mixing it with virus and then trying to see if the virus grows in culture. That is different to simply checking for antibodies that stick to the antigen. There are less neutralizing antibodies compared to regular antibodies.  Apart from the qualitative difference in antibodies one has the timeline. A positive test today for antibodies does not mean you will have antibodies tomorrow. Right now that is important because the normal course of COVID infection and resolution along a continuum of immune response is still being mapped out. We don't know how long immunity lasts. Yes people have gotten reinfected with COVID meaning they didn't have enough immunity to combat the disease in preventing an active infection. The good news is that on record did not transmit the disease based on epidemiological studies.  It takes time to obtain a natural history of the virus. Making assumptions on incomplete data will bit people in the butt.", 136, "0nyWiro9aa", 0],
	756 : ["The antibodies from having COVID don't last. You still need to get vaccinated. Many people have contracted the disease again after having it one, and have passed it on. The evidence is that people who are vaccinated do not carry the virus and don't pass it on. In the US, there is no \"green passport\" and I don't know how we're going to be able to prove we've been vaccinated. ", 136, "cbMTODDZaa", 0],

Or, Polythene.    I  have CO2 cartridges to refill my M/Cs  and bicycle, and Flat Fix for the cars, which uses R134-A (\"Freon\", if made by Chemours, Inc.)   Edit:   N2 is only 3% larger molecule than O2.   Only real advantages of dry N2  are that it's almost  inert,  and no water vapor to Radically change tire pressure with temperature, like in a racer.  Nor icing at 26,000 feet, so, used in aircraft. C/R found only a 1.3 PSI less loss with N2, after 16,000 miles; not worth it.    . @R:   Water vapor Is Steam; Steam Is water vapor. Just a colloquialism of how \"hot\" the vapor is. If liquid water heated enough, yes, of course, it turns to steam.  Or Water Vapor. No difference.   (In a Tire, I seriously Doubt it gets to 100 C (212 F),  anyway, to be properly  called \"steam\". Maybe wing wheels on 747 on landing and hard braking. They utilize 300 PSI N2,  have  multiple-disc brakes that often glow Red, thrust-reversers, too. Aircraft tires are changed , often.. And,  just getting water To 212  F at Sea Level doesn't necessarily boil  it, takes still more heat . \"Boiling\" means vapor pressure equals or exceeds  atmospheric pressure.. Water,  of course, also vaporizes by  Evaporation,)      It's just  that the water vapor in air in a tire Expands or Contracts far more  with temperature change  than the \"ideal\" other gasses present; and not linearly; making a much  bigger difference in pressure with temp, and handling. An \"ideal\" gas, like nitrogen, varies in pressure v. temperature  directly; by Avogadro's, Boyle's, and Charles' laws.    Sorry 4 rant, but, when getting technical  or scientific, you can be 99% right and 1% wrong, and Still  be Incorrect.
