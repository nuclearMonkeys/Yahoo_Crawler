This is the whole problem with 'equality' laws - they apply a so called equality where none exists, and take no account of the roles nature gave us. Women are stamping their feet and having hissy fits, claiming men oppress them and hold things back, where in reality our society was shaped over generations of natural order.  Women are now trying to slant the deck against this order, to  apply some arbitrary  rules that in all honesty are purely in their favor.  It used to be about recognition for the role women play in society, but its been twisted into some man hating monster by the feminists. You just have to read some of the comments on this thread - you'd think men had women in actual chains or something! The fact is, the rise of the female in society has been a good thing overall, but there have been disadvantages also.  We are now a fractured society driven by career and the family unit has all but gone.

Islamophobia (or anti-Muslim sentiment) is a term for prejudice against,hatred towards, or fear of the religion of Islam or Muslims.The term entered into common English usage in 1997 with the publication of a report by the Runnymede Trust condemning negative emotions such as fear, hatred, and dread directed at Islam or Muslims. While the term is now widely used, both the term itself and the underlying concept have been criticized.The causes and characteristics of Islamophobia are still debated.Some scholars have defined it as a type of racism. Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia resulting from the September 11 attacks, while others have associated it with the increased presence of Muslims in secular nations", 11147, "ZNWtFNo0aa", 0],

They usually don't eat garlic bread, either. I was a soldier stationed in the army in Germany when I was a teenager. You would be surprised how quickly you learn to become accepting of women with hairy armpits when that is all there is to chose. I have actually known a few guys who were really hot for hairy pits, but they were preverts. It does seem to me that women shave their arm pits quite voluntarily in American society, unless you are among the hippy/counter cultural milleau, in which case, I would refer you again to my earlier cited German observations. If your scene is the festival/farmers market, you are going to be tapping hirsute chicks are you will be jerking off to porn.  Shaving is tyranny and voluntary domestication of the human spirit.
