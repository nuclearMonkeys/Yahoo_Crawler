He can crush a tank with his hands, fly faster than any jet, completely invulnerable to their weapons. He doesn't need the boots to fly, he can repulse stuff with his super breath. So really the only benifit the armor could ever give him would be in a fight with someone who has kryptonite. thats about the only purpose it could serve, and he actually has a suit for that.

For the most part all babies are born with the color of eyes they will end up with, maybe just lighter. And yes the guy talking about alleles was correct, two people with brown eyes can have a baby with blue, green, or hazel eyes. There are also other factors that determine eye color and shade.
