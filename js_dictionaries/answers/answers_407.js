Even though the show was lewd and perverted, I couldn't help but laugh at the corny, slapstick humor. My favorite part was Beavis pulling his shirt over his head, and calling himself \"the great Cornholio\". I have to admit that part was hilarious.

	22356 : ["Yeah I really enjoyed the episode. There were only a few funny episodes on the original star trek, but they took that ball and ran with it in later shows, and there would be multiple funny episodes per season of the 90s shows, focusing on things like data deciding to adopt a cat or a ferangi, the greedy race, having to deal with an auditor. I enjoy those light on action heavy on character scenes episodes, because when the plot relys on a 15 minute RED ALERT SHEILDS AT 45 PERCENT sequence every episode it does start to get stale.", 3606, "byGLIikVaa", 2],
	22357 : ["These kinds of things CAN bother me -- but it's not enough to stop me from watching.  It also doesn't stop me from complaining. If we can believe that our yellow sun would give a Kryptonian an array of superpowers, we are expected to go along with everything else that they present. Originally, Superman had the strength to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but then they turned that into the ability to fly at the speed of light and reverse time. I just watched the new version of \"The Equalizer\", and it's seems a bit far-fetched that she will have access to a world-class hacker who will do the work for free.  It's not the only show that has that trope.", 3608, "LSJ8BmHVaa", 4],
	22358 : ["In TV and movies, you have the problem that it's hard to act through a full mask.  Watch Mandalorian.  I love the show, but Pedro Pascal can't act through the mask.  Especially since his character isn't prone towards demonstrative body language.  So the smaller the mask, the more you can show your actor's emotions. But the trope is also very alive in comics.  Robin has a thin mask.  And of course, there's Superman.  You are far from the first person to point out how stupid the glasses thing is as a disguise.  Certainly, if you've ever known someone who suddenly radically alters their hair (for a woman) or suddenly needs glasses or such, they can look like different people - briefly.  As long as you're not looking too closely. And I think that effect is what inspired the Superman/Clark/Glasses trope.  Of course it wouldn't work in RL.  Especially since Lois and Jimmy interact closely with both Supes and Clark.  There's no chance they fail to put 2 and 2 together.  There was an episode of Lois & Clark where a time traveller meets Lois Lane and says she's very famous in his day, and says everyone wants to know \"How dumb was she, REALLY?\" because of the inability to see the Superman/Clark thing. In season 1 of Supergirl, they explicitly state that the glasses thing works because \"people see what they expect to see\".  Which is actually true.  There's tons of actual research on how people miss obvious things right in front of them if it's sufficiently unexpected.   But they also try to give the glasses purpose.  There's a flashback where the glasses are given to her when she's young to help her suppress her x-ray vision because they have lead in them.  Which is just about the dumbest claim ever if you put any thought into it, but I appreciate the ATTEMPT to give some kind of logic to a relateively dumb trope. I guess what I'm saying is, with comics, there's a heavy load of tropes built into the genre that require suspension of disbelief.  The idea that these superheroes could stay anonymous for long periods of time, ESPECIALLY with these flimsy disguises, is kind of one of them.  ", 3608, "3Cd8Iq5gaa", 3],
	22359 : ["Actually you have it bass ackward.  The hills and mountains are formed first.  Then they direct the rain or spring water to follow the contours of those hills toward lower elevations.  That's why those streams of water flow, the water is pulled by gravity to lower elevations. One of the survival technique taught is to find a stream if you are lost in a forest and follow the flow of that stream.  It will lead you to a river and the river might lead you to a lake.  But when you follow that river to a lake (or ocean) you will probably first run into a town or city.  Towns and cities are typically created along rivers and other water sources.  And there you are, not lost any more. Lest you misunderstand...I'm talking about hills and mountains, not canyons.  Canyons in fact are created by rivers and streams acting to erode over millions of years.", 3613, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", 1],
