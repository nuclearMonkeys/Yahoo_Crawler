	98192 : ["First, arm yourself with the facts. You can find out whether or not you have a potential IHT problem yourself. Only if the answer is \"yes\" do you need to see someone. You don't say how much you know about this already but you need to add up all your assets and liabilities (or those of the person whose estate you are concerned about) and to the extent that the total exceeds the limit (currently £285,000) IHT will be due.  For transfers on death, the value of an estate above the nil-rate band is taxed at the rate of 40%.  Here's what's in an estate: 1. assets in the sole name of the deceased,  2. their share of any jointly owned assets,  3. assets held in a trust in which the deceased had an immediate post-death interest, a disabled person's interest, or a transitional serial interest  4. any 'nominated' assets 5. any assets they have given away, but kept an interest in (\"gift with reservation\").  6. the value of an alternatively secured pension fund (ASP) from which the deceased benefited as the original scheme member, or as a dependant who received benefits from the left over ASP fund of an original scheme member.  You must add most gifts made in the seven years before death to the person's estate to calculate the IHT due, but some will be exempt and these exempt gifts do not need to be included. You can also leave out any exempt gifts left by way of a will or intestacy.  Exempt gifts are: 1. gifts to individuals more than seven years before death 2. gifts to spouses or civil partners  3. gifts not exceeding £3,000 in any one tax year 4. gifts on consideration of marriage or civil partnership  5. gifts to UK charities  6. gifts for national purposes  7. small gifts (£250 or less) 8. gifts which are normal expenditure out of income  You can deduct from the value of the death estate certain reliefs from the value of some types of property such as farms, businesses and unquoted shares. You can also deduct bills outstanding at the date of death and the funeral expenses to arrive at the net value of the estate.  The personal representatives are liable to pay any IHT due on a death estate.  For lifetime transfers the rate is 20%. Lifetime gifts to individuals are potentially exempt transfers (PETs) which only become chargeable to IHT if the donor dies within seven years. Other lifetime transfers (e.g. into trusts) have an immediate charge to IHT.  So from this you can see that there's a lot you can do yourself if the problem is small. IHT planning at its most basic is things like making sure that Granny, if she has more money than she can possibly spend in her lifetime, makes gifts each year up to the £3,000 annual exempt amount or makes lots of gifts under the £250 limit (such as   or birthday presents for each grandchild) and so on. Or if she has a large pension, setting up a pattern of \"normal expenditure out of income\" such as helping the grandchildren out with living expenses at University.  If it's you, you're pretty sure you're going to live more than seven years, and you have money sitting around that you're never going to need, give it to your kids now instead of making them wait twenty years to get it in your will.  You can do things like this without needing to go and see anyone. The key is keeping written records. Also, watch out for number 5 in my \"here's what's in an estate\" list. You can't give your house to your kids but go on living in it (well, you can but it won't be effective in removing it from your estate for IHT purposes). You would need to pay them a market rent - which they'd have to pay tax on. If, looking at all this and applying the rules to the facts of your case, you have a significant potential liability then it is well worth going to see someone. I would phone round the large accountancy firms and law firms and find a specialist. Bear in mind that most people are NOT specialists in this area. Be really careful of Mr Small Firm Accountant who'd love your business but really can't offer any advice beyond what I've just suggested. If there are millions of pounds at stake it is well worth the cost of specialist planning even if it costs £30,000 because you are comparing this cost against a 40% charge, and for specialist planning you need a specialist. Any accountant worth his salt would be giving you an initial meeting for free, where he will ask the kind of questions I've asked and then tell you whether it's worth complex planning and whether he can do anything for you. At that point you would decide yes or no and agree a fee.", 9651, "434f04a6fde02d2e60610cacc58bd89eaa", 1],

The other truth is this:  black people only make up 10 percent of the population and without tens of millions of white peoples' votes, Obama could not have won.  Most black people were solidly behind Hillary until well into the primary campaign, so it is false that they started out for Obama.  Also black people traditionally vote Democratic in high percentages, even though all previous candidates have been white, so that is a myth that gets passed around among the right wing to explain how their guy lost.

	98207 : ["The issue is not experience. The issue is not black and white. Obama ran under the familiar promise of 'change' and 'hope'.  And on the surface, he was change.  Under different circumstances, I would be thrilled that we finally do have a non-white president.  However, when you look at Obama under the microscope, you will find nothing but the same principles, values, and policies that previous puppet-presidents have reinforced. He was glorified in the media; moreso than any other president in history.  He received and accepted more campaign donations than any other president in history.  His advisors/mentors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger have been a tyrannical influence in Washington for many years.  This is not change. Obama was chosen by the 'powers that be' and he will push the same inhumane, globalist agenda Bush (and every puppet before him) pushed.  He reads pre-written speeches off of a teleprompter, then cracks jokes about it (among other things) to present an image of humility. All of this garbage about Obama being a Muslim and a communist is all right wing, neo-con BS.  That is just a distraction.  It's all a part of the left/right wing paradigm.  It's an act.  It's a show. It is show business.  The left and right (liberal and conservative) is just used as tool to keep us at odds with one another. Instead of the people uniting to find the cause of all the world's problems...we are fed celebrity gossip, sitcoms, and reality television.  They inject us with mercury, poison our drinking water, and genetically modify our food.  But, of course, Obama will not address these issues.  Why?  Because he is not change.  He is not running the show.   Once you realize that the presidency is just a puppet-pedestal, you will begin to see things for what they are.  JFK, as shady a character as he was, wanted to bring some relevance back to the presidency.  Ten days before his assassination, he declared war on the elitists that were secretly running ship.  His death signified their sadistic nature. Look in to the New World Order, Theosophy (the religion of the elitists), and Eugenics.  But...be aware of deceptive information.  Question everything and do your own research.  That is key. To make all of this relevant, I want to present a quote from someone speaking from the perspective as one of us.  From someone who knows real struggle and hardship: \"It's not going to change for us. The little man on the totem pole.  And no one looks at the agenda.  As long as he positions himself right, has the right tie on, has the right smile, repeats the slogans over and over, and drives it home...the average American is going swallow it hook, line, and sinker.\" -Professor Griff (Public Enemy) Change does not come with a new president.  The game is rigged and the people don't seem to care; or realize it. The real change starts with us and why we are allowing unseen hands to govern our lives.", 9640, "SVZtxcPsaa", 1],
	98208 : ["Considering that the African American population of our country is teetering around 10% at any given time, a landslide vote from that ethnic minority would not secure a seat to the presidency. Most of Obama's votes were cast amongst young peoples, many in college, as well as trademark liberals, and Republicans and Independents fed up with the Bush administration. When speaking of experience, Obama was trained at a relatively young age to engage his audiences, speak with oratory, and compete in the argumentative structure that is prevalent during the primaries and campaign trail.  He has the experience to convince, manipulate, and make his audiences feel overwhelmed by the emotion of his rhetoric. Truth of the matter is that Obama's 'political' experience is irrelevant.  When considering that nearly half a billion dollars is spent on the campaign trail, one can deduce that presidency is being bought and paid for.  The presidents decisions are less than likely going to be anything of what someone consciously running a country might decide is best for the well being of the American nation.  His decisions, policies, and speeches were bought and paid for long before he became president.    The same is true with Bush, they are two very different heads of the same dragon, both proposing different means of attaining the same goals.  Their support is for the multi-national corporations that put them in power, not the 'welfare of America.' The media is bought and paid for.  The government is run on financial interests. The populous is to busy with their daily lives to be concerned. They run the education dept. to keep us ignorant.   What ever happened to courses on critical thinking? The idea of Mccain Vs. Obama is a facade.  They impose arguments against each other, as the basis of their party demands, which only forces the public to choose sides in whom they feel is the lesser of two evils.  With only two real parties to vote for, the people who really run Washington have enough stock in both candidates to get their agenda to infect the world. If Mccain had control of the White House for the first hundred days, my guess would be that the only difference would be the amount of doctors on direct call.", 9640, "None", 0],

	98212 : ["The two answers immediately before me are good.  I agree you need to do your research and at least have a basic understanding about your assets.  If you decide that you need professional advice Chartered Accountants have a role in determining effective strategies, particularly if you are planning for the future rather than dealing with a bereavement.  this is because IHT planning also impacts CGT and income tax, at least potentially.  You will need a lawyer to do the paperwork (will, trusts etc) and the accountant and the lawyer will have to work together to some extent, so make sure they can get along.  If you go to an IFA for IHT advice you may get lucky, but it would be just that - luck.  Most IFAs I have ever come across do not have the necessary IHT knowledge to plan a substantial estate without the assistance of lawyers or accountants.  In fact, I have come across some IFAs whose idea of IHT planning is to sell an insurance policy to pay IHT.  That costs far more than some decent advice to mitigate taxes.", 9651, "AA11085771", 0],
