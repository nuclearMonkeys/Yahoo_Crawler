	114012 : ["Harry potter is an amazing series. It is witty, imaginative, entertaining, thought provoking and beautifully written. A lot of us, including me grew up with it, and the story grew with us. A person of any age can read Harry Potter and get completely wrapped up in the story. Mainly, it is the way the story is written, it is an entirely new world, all created and every question answered by Ms. Rowling. As for Twilight, It is very poorly written. Stephanie Meyer uses the same phrases and word choices over and over, and creates characters who have low self esteem and are self deprecating. Her stories lack imagination. Where Rowling creates an entire new world and creatively introduces information in a way that astounds us, Meyer introduces information in completely predictable and redundant ways, and offers nothing new. Instead of creating a new world with interesting characters rooted in Greek mythology and folklore, she decides to have vampires present in an American high school. How innovative. Twilight is a teen fad but Harry Potter is an amazing piece of literature that will withstand the test of time.", 10373, "8B914yepaa", -1],

	114015 : ["President Richard Nixon took office in 1969 with a plan he stated that would end the war. His policy was \"Vietnamization\" of the war, in other words turning it over to the Vietnamese to fight and gradually withdrawing U.S. forces. He ended the draft. He bombed North Vietnam, and in 1972 U.S. air power encouraged Hanoi to  established an agreement with the United States. Hanoi agreed to leave the Viet Cong (Communist) forces in the south of Vietnam to fight alone.  The U.S. part of the agreement was that it would pull its troops out of Vietnam and dismantle its bases. The U.S. and Hanoi agreed to an exchange of prisoners. According to the agreement, the U.S. could replace arms, on a one-to-one basis, that had been supplied to the Saigon regime. And should the Hanoi violate the agreement, President Nixon planned to use air power again to deter Hanoi. The most controversial aspect of his strategy was an effort to cut the Ho Chi Minh supply trail by secretly bombing North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Cambodia and invading that country and Laos. The U.S. and South Vietnamese incursion into Cambodia in April 1970 helped destabilize the country, provoking a bloody civil war and bringing to power the murderous Khmer Rouge, a Communist group that evacuated Cambodia's cities and threw thousands into re-education camps.", 10375, "0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa", 0],
