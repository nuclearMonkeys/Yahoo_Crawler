That being said, I don't think that there has be a struggle in order to be happy, or even to have a purpose.  In my world there are answers for just about anything, in fact,  if there isn't a readily available answer for something, the first real answer is usually 'We don't know yet, but we have an idea,' much different than a stereotypical religious default to 'It was [a god]'s will.'  More often have there been cases where the religious force answers to fit what they want to believe; once upon a time there was a society whose religious government would say, and force those that say otherwise to say something along the lines of, 'if my calculations are correct, the Sun was created by God and don't question it.' Also, I don't know how old you are or what you're going through, but if you're going to look for trouble by being so judgmental, don't take on the holier-than-thou visage, it's just insulting to those that are or were religious.  Maybe you should take some time to respond to some of the more civil and eloquent answers instead of trying to be a victim by only acknowledging the more callous ones. Also also, a bed of roses doesn't sound too nice anyway, roses evolved these things called thorns....", 9695, "8AJh3SPKaa", 4],

	99402 : ["As relating to atheism the world makes perfect sense. There are many questions still, of course.  As yet there's no answer to everything.  We do seem to be gaining more answers by the day though through our study of the universe around us.  So yes unanswered questions are no problem. The questions of \"why\" have been moved a lot deeper as there's simply no need to ask them in the absence of a god Science, or should  I say \"science\", seems to have taken on some other meaning that gives it more impetus than it deserves.  It is simply looking at the universe and trying to figure out its workings.  That is all.  Science is not the answer, science is the method used to get to the answer (by studying what actually happens).   That's not to say the systems we've set up are optimal (clearly they're not), but in the light of atheism their origins are comprehensible. Rather than being a bed of roses all people, including atheists, have the same struggle for survival.  Some are more fortunate than others.", 9695, "OKy2PRbiaa", 2],
	99403 : ["Marginally better than when I was a Christian. Why would it be a bed of roses?  (they have thorns anyway: I've never understood that phrase) Fewer inconsistent answers, and a better framework for dealing with them. A more complex relationship between morals, ethics and society. Science and evolution have never said they've got the answer to everything: science works on everything that's within reach, as it comes within reach, with answers subject to refinement and change as information increases, which seems a far better plan than dogmatic absolutes. The dark side of the moon is no longer an absolute unknown, neither is the interior of an atom.  That's amazing progress for 400 years. Anyone can have an answer for everything... The trick is to have right answers.  That takes more time, more caution. And tentative, approximate, answers in many cases. We know relativity works. We know quantum theory is necessary. The two have not yet been made compatible: we're working on it.   \"I want it all, I want it now\" may be a good song lyric, but it's not a realistic human ambition. edit: I'm not sure about this \" solar system size bubble\" This galaxy is is big enough for my lifetime, and I've lost track of how many other galaxies there are.", 9695, "8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa", 4],

It is a lot better to believe in the beauty of the absolute and inescapable nature of life and death; the concept that everyone will leave this world the same, and be treated the same after wards; that there will come a time where you are no longer forced to suffer that which is left to suffer, and that since the majesty of the world is only a temporary experience, you should enjoy it with everyday you have and not hinder others from doing the same.  Science and reason do provide answers to a lot, although currently not to everything.  I take comfort and pride in the fact that we're willing to admit when we don't know something.  It proves we have a solid litmus test for determining what is right versus wrong, accurate versus inaccurate, and truth versus deception.

My struggles are just like yours, except for one difference - mine are godless - but they're still struggles. Some struggle with survival, some struggle with the loss of loved ones, some struggle with letting go, etc. As for the science and evolution, I never had much of a scientific brain and science is not the reason why I'm an atheist. Human nature is, but that's a long story. I have learned to accept that there's absolutely nothing wrong with saying ''I don't know'' instead of lying to myself that God did it.
