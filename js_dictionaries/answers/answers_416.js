	22802 : ["There is no gender attached to spousal support requirements in the US, however in states that are eligible it can depend on how long you were previously married. They also tend to look at your 2020 income for the entire year compared to your spouse rather than your current job situation.  Courts also consider if you are \"voluntarily\" unemployed.  For example if you quit a job recently it could disqualify you for spousal support.  Regardless your attorney would need to go over your specific situation and see if it's something you would qualify for.   You may find the marital settlement you would get in divorce is enough to buy you time to find something.    Immigration sponsorship is usually a more formal process that both parties would be well aware of.  If she's never signed an affidavit of support then I don't think she would be required to sponsor you.   ", 3675, "8KEvbPXyaa", 0],
	22803 : ["A lot depends on your driving patterns. If you pretty much never go more than, say, 50 miles at a time, then an electric car will probably be more than adequate for you (as long as it has, say, 100 miles of range).  If you occasionally take longer trips, but like to stop fairly frequently when you do, again, electric will probably be fine, as long as there are enough charging stations near where you want to go. If you frequently take long trips, you're probably better off with a hybrid.", 3668, "s90qOj5Baa", 2],
	22804 : ["I my family currently has one gas only and tow hybrids and one plugin hybrid.  I got the rage fear and the fear of being stuck during a rolling electric brown out. I like the extra weight of a hybrid in the rain over the gas size gas only car.  I like the plug-in more than I thought since I live in California, I had feared that 20 miles of charge would cost more than a gallon of gasoline.  It might depend on your age and how much the cars you look at will cost you to insure. Also what your electric rates are. I would get another plug in hybrid but maybe not a Ford unless they start making them with a spare tire. ", 3668, "368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa", 0],
	22805 : ["People's opinions are going to vary, understandably, and part of the reason is driving habits vary.  For me, most of my mileage comes from periodic, fairly long business trips by car. So I looked at an EV, and decided it would be best for lots of local trips because of the limited range and need for charging. I settled on a hybrid, because it gives some of the advantages of an EV, but on a long trip I can just stop at a gas station, fill up, and be back on the road quickly. I am not very familiar with Teslas - but I have heard they have good range, and I've seen their charging stations in many places in the Northeast US. ", 3668, "WvFJh2GAaa", 0],

	22807 : ["I love my Pruis and my hybid Ford but I took a long time to get a hybrid because I was afraid they might spend more time in the shop than a European sports car. The maintenance isn't cheap but the prius has held up pretty well and price of gas only car maintenance has increased a lot in the past two decades as too. Electric cars didn't have the range in the 80s. We didn't even know if they would keep a charge when it is 40 below zero (I actually still don't know)", 3669, "368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa", 0],

	22810 : ["It seems electric cars are what governments want us to move towards . Unfortunately many don't understand the infrastructure changes and costs involved .      Hydrogen is what I think we need to strive for but the electric movement has win out politically.      I wonder how much electric companies and electric car companies pay off politicians.      Anyway it seems electric cars seem to be where we are headed towards .    Wait until we have a big enough solar flare to knock out the electric  grid.  It happened before in Quebec Canada . Putting all our eggs in one basket is stupid . ", 3670, "None", 1],
	22811 : ["I believe in large countries like Canada, the USA, Australia etc will have hydrogen powered cars.  I saw a youtube video of a group of 4 drive across the USA in a Tesla.  They found the car was good at directing cars to recharging stations but what happens if the station is full and people are in no rush to come back and move their cars.  I also saw a comparison video on several EVs and none of them did better than two thirds the distance they were supposed to travel.  Using lights, airconditioner, and other accessories cuts the battery charge back a lot.  I have read of a Nissan leaf owners who will not put the heater or air conditioner as they draw so heavily on the batteries and they rug up or wind the windows down instead of using the air conditioning.   When the hydrogen cell cars become common you just pull up at a service station and fill up in 2 minutes and keep driving just like current fueled cars.  Those who worry about Hydrogen fuel being explosive the truth is that it is safer than liquid fuels as if the tank ruptures in a liquid fueled vehicle the fuel spills onto the road and can engulf the car in fire, but in a hydrogen fueled car if the tank splits the hydrogen floats off upwards into the atmosphere so their is no fuel on the ground to catch fire and engulf the vehicle.   Also remember that in 10 years time the batteries will need to be replaced at a cost of several thousand dollars. And that could have bought a lot of non polluting hydrogen.  Also if your power comes from coal or gas then the pollution at the power station cancels out the saving on pollution you were hoping to prevent.   The next problem can the power grid handle the huge draw half a million EVs charging overnight.  What happens if the grid goes down after a storm and it takes days to get any household power and your EV needs a charge or it will not move.  If you are just doing short distance driving the EV may be all you need but in big countries where many people drive long distances they need a vehicle that can be filled up quickly and can keep driving.", 3670, "None", 1],

	22813 : ["Hydrogen is expensive to store. It is difficult to detect if it leaks. It is very explosive.  It requires a lot of electricity to break apart water (thus making hydrogen and oxygen). Electric cars are the future. Everyone will drive to work, and maybe plug in to top up a while.  Most of the charging will be done during the off hours at night.  The increased demand on the power grid is not as significant as the demand on petrol stations.", 3670, "be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa", 0],
	22814 : ["Car batteries are never put in landfill.  Car batteries cannot be recycled  for lead anywhere in America.  Car batteries are collected and sent by ship to Taiwan or other locations in Indonesia and the sub-continent.  Then they are melted down for lead while they release deadly fumes into the air.  All of the other batteries you listed are now, by law, made of metals and materials deemed non-toxic.  So just throw them in the regular garbage.", 3671, "r6oMZ4iyaa", 0],

	22817 : ["Quick charging, anytime charging, anywhere charging and use of electricity from fossil fuel based power plants for charging are also existing issues with electric vehicles. As of 2019, the recycling of Li-Ion batteries in most cases does not extract lithium since lithium-ion battery technology continuously changes and processes to recycle these batteries can thus be outdated in a couple of years. Another reason why it isn't being done on a large scale is because the extraction of lithium from old batteries is five times more expensive than mined lithium. Recycling processes today recover approximately 25% to 96% of the materials of a lithium-ion battery cell, depending on the separation technology. Involved steps are discharging, disassembly from the vehicle, crushing or sorting, recovery of electrolyte followed by hydro or pyro metallurgical process of extraction. Safety of workers in recycling unit, safety of near by surroundings, safety of mine workers, safety of near by surroundings, disposal to poor and developing nations where there is leniency in following laws on safety, human rights, environmental rights- remain issues.", 3671, "8fcf5ca3338e6d3a4970d35b8c0e7444aa", 0],
