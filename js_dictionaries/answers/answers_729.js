YOU have to be specific and ASK places of accommodation.Bring your own suitable for European voltages and outlets to guarantee. Washrooms/lavatories usually do not have much room for a power chair. It can be done and there is lots to see and do in a chair. Can you do everything and go everywhere? NO just the way it is. Many disabled help sites in Europe to assist with travel planing. Power chairs DO NOT GO ON A PLANE They do not fit in the Aisle. They must go in the luggage hold. Passenger is transferred to a narrow push chair to get to their seat. USE GROUND lavatory just before flight. The ones on the plane can be difficult. YOU when booking your flight use the Airline special agent dedicated to assist travellers with special needs. BE HONEST in what you can and cannot do yourself. Airline staff are not your private medical care team. YES lots of cobblestones. The way it is. Get a good cushion. Believe it or not Europeans also use wheelchairs. Wheelchair accessibility is getting better year by year. Is it everywhere or for 100% of some site? Usually not. From experience pushing a child in a stroller is much easier than pushing mom in her chair. A lot of distance between places. Either long train rides or flights. May want to be a little less adventurous for your first journey. SORRY to inform you that the term handicapped accessible or wheelchair accessible means different things in Europe than in the USA.

Your best bet would be to do some guided tours with a bus that can accommodate the wheelchair (I think most tour operators can). For example, trains in France are great, but you have to haul your suitcase up a few steps with people rushing to get on behind you. You also want to make sure that any hotel you book has an elevator- many don't. I would suggest a bus tour in Ireland (unless you want to drive, but the tours are really good) and Rome. ", 5957, "cbMTODDZaa", 0],
