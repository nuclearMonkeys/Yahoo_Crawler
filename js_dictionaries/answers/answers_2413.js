	126466 : ["Probably  To believe in the young Earth creationist story, one has to believe that a long series of natural philosophers and scientists from Nicolas Steno in the 1600s to Craig Venter in the 2000s have been systematically lying about what they had found.  Not only that, but thousands of geologists and biologists working in industries such as mining, oil, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals in countries all round the world are lying as well, and have been for many decades. Not only are these lying, but physicists, chemists and even laboratory assistants have been cooking virtually all their routine results from analytical chemistry laboratories, ion microprobes, genome sequencers, microscopes or seismic imagers to agree with the \"evolutionist\" case.  The numbers of these people who are supposedly conspiring against a minority, mostly American Christian view of the Universe defies an accurate count, but it must be close to a million over the past century or more. So far these conspirators have managed to operate many industries successfully,for decades, despite the creationist supposition that the science on which they are based is all false.  The enormity of such a supposed conspiracy puts the supposed conspiracy over the Moon landings in the shade for absurdity.The absurdity is among the young Earth creationists, who, once they have concocted an absurd lie, cannot refrain from repeating it no matter how many times it is refuted.", 10906, "3oJCGVzkaa", -1],

	126472 : ["The article entitled below \"The Nature of God: The Nature of God What kind of body does God have? “God is a Spirit.”—John 4:24. WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS The Bible describes God as a spirit being. (2 Corinthians 3:17) As such, he is far superior to us and beyond our physical senses. He is “the King of eternity, incorruptible, invisible,” says 1 Timothy 1:17. The Bible also states: “At no time has anyone beheld God.”—1 John 4:12. Our Creator is so superior to us that we cannot even begin to imagine what he looks like. “To whom can you people liken God, and what likeness can you put alongside him?” says Isaiah 40:18. Even the awe-inspiring physical heavens pale in comparison with the Almighty.—Isaiah 40:22, 26. There are, however, intelligent creatures who can see God and even speak with him face-to-face. How so? Because they too are spirits, and they live in heaven. (1 Kings 22:21; Hebrews 1:7) Concerning these superhuman creatures, who are also called angels, Jesus Christ said: “[They] always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.”—Matthew 18:10. Is God omnipresent? “You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens.'”—Matthew 6:9. WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS The Bible does not teach that God is omnipresent, or present everywhere at all times, like some impersonal force. Rather, as Jesus' words found at Matthew 6:9 and 18:10 show, God is a person—a “Father”—and he resides in heaven, his “established place of dwelling.”—1 Kings 8:43. Toward the end of his life, Jesus said: “I am leaving the world and am going my way to the Father.” (John 16:28) After his death in the flesh and resurrection as a spirit, Christ ascended “into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God.”—Hebrews 9:24. These facts about God matter. Why? For one thing, because God is a person, we can learn about him and draw close to him. (James 4:8) For another, the truth about God protects us from false worship, such as the worship of lifeless images and objects. “Little children, guard yourselves from idols,” says 1 John 5:21. How were humans formed in God's image? “God proceeded to create the man in his image, in God's image he created him; male and female he created them.”—Genesis 1:27. WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS As humans, we have the potential to reflect God's personality traits, such as his love, justice, and wisdom. In fact, the Bible says: “Become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love.”—Ephesians 5:1, 2. God also made us free moral agents, which enables us to choose right over wrong and to express love for others in a variety of ways. (1 Corinthians 13:4-7) We also have the ability to be creative, to enjoy beauty, and to stand in awe at the amazing world around us. Above all, we have received a spiritual capacity, a natural desire to learn about our Creator and his will for us.—Matthew 5:3. How Bible truth can help you. The more we learn about God and imitate him, the more we live the way he intended us to live. As a result, we experience more joy in life, along with genuine satisfaction, inner peace, and contentment. (Isaiah 48:17, 18) Yes, God knows that his endearing qualities resonate in the human heart, drawing honesthearted people to him and setting them on the path to everlasting life.—John 6:44; 17:3.

Of course in this world of technology and information I have to rely on things being created by people and systems that I  do not understand or have even been exposed to intellectually.

That we should believe in something that exists in a state that is beyond the ability of our senses to detect. While it exists within those severe limitations, it is all powerful and all knowing. Somehow these people have the ability to know that it exists and can not only describe it, but have knowledge of its will and desires, even though it is beyond comprehension and description.

Essentially, through the use of Reason, God's existence is revealed by the observation of the order and complexity found within nature and our personal experiences. Belief that God should be honored in a way that the individual believes is best and most appropriate for them.  Individuals must determine for themselves how best to honor God and only they can develop how to accomplish this. For many, it is a multifaceted and an individualized process. Classical Deism has tended to define God as separate from his creation (only transcendent); however, Modern Deism does not define God.  This is because Reason is limited in its ability to fully comprehend and define God, which produces different views on what individuals believe the nature of God to be.  Some Deists see design in nature and through this design they also see purpose in the universe (and in their lives).  Others see God and the universe in a co-creative process. While others see God as a subtle and persuasive spirit. Of course, there are many other views as well.

The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. God can be found in the cathedral or in the laboratory.

One of the religious truths is that God created everything and declared all was good. Catholics can believe in the theories of the big bang or evolution or both or neither.  On August 12, 1950 Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical Humani generis:  The Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God.  Here is the complete encyclical:  And here is the Address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on October 22, 1996 speaking of the Theory of Evolution:  Here is an interesting article about Pope John Paul II's opinion in the matter:  The Church supports science in the discovery of God's creation.
