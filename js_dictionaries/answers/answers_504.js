	28216 : ["I wouldn't say I worry about it daily but sure I have concerns. Believe there have been, and will continue to be, many scientific advances over the years, that will endeavour to counteract on the environmental ravages of the current and past.  My biggest concern at the moment are the continued loss of rainforests, habitat destruction, for palm oil plantations.  Also the World's oceans are becoming even more polluted and over-fished that they are no longer life giving or provide healthy food for humans.  So humans destroyed the lands, and scourged the planet of rainforests, that were the lungs of the Earth.  I expect that people will have to work sincerely on protecting and replanting rainforests to halt the global warming processes.  People will have to cease relying on fishing to survive also, as what remains is just too unhealthy to eat.  Obviously we cannot continue to behave as we are in respect to nurturing the planet.  I expect the scientific community will provide the knowledge to exit the damaging phase, but whether the countries of the world would unite in enacting policies to see humans out of that phase another thing.  Eventually I envisage all humans will have to stop eating meat, and rely on plants to survive, as a matter of survival.  Animals take far too much land and contribute to global warming, and plants can offer suitable choices.  I see cleaning up the oceans is a major move, and I don't know if that can ever be achieved now though.  Still I am hopeful humans will survive, but they have to learn better ways of living within a limited Earth.  Perhaps space exploration will see some develop other planetary systems in the future, that may be essential to human race survival.  As far as over-population is concerned there have been some methods that have been implemented to hinder the growth factor, but unlikely to see any remarkable reductions in the near future.  Many cultures have adopted a low birth rate due to economics and fertility health of humans already.  I see that continuing to evolve to affect third world countries also.  Pandemics, especially in over populated countries, will continue to cull populations as they will be the last to vaccinate of course.  In time they will see the advantages of slowing the birth rates also.  We won't see enough changes in our lifetimes but there will certainly be some, and changes of attitudes will evolve with time also.  Do not give up on Earth as yet but instead try to do your bit to help the environment, as we can all contribute in some small way.  Joining a voluntary tree planting association with like minded individuals is another way we can leave something for the future also.  Do not despair.  ", 4372, "Y4fZfm94aa", 2],
