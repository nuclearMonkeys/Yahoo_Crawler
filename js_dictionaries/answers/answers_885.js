	49301 : ["No one but the executives of these companies know the future plans for the camera industry. It's no secret that smartphones were initially ignored by most, if not all, of the manufacturers.  Their arrogance led to them to sit on their laurels (I'm talking to you Nikon & Canon) as the consumer camera market was annihilated by the then world's largest camera manufacturer, Nokia and especially Apple. Few companies have made smartphone solutions, Hasselblad introduced an add-on lens for smartphones that were any good.  There are quite a few add-on lenses by other brands:  I think instead of capitulating to the smartphone market, the remaining camera manufacturers (Samsung & Olympus quit the camera business in 2019 & 2020 respectively)may make their cameras more like smartphones.  Nikon & Sony have introduced tech that allows the camera to connect with a smartphone and automatically upload images to the cloud.  This is a good first step, and I think things will get better because, well, they have to if these companies want to continue to be relevant. Instead of making gear for the smartphone market, the manufacturers might actually make their camera adaptable to the smartphone.  Having an open-source firmware, having apps designed for their mirrorless cameras will allow users to use their cameras more like they do phones. Just like the battle between Beta vs VHS where the inferior VHS won the war due to the overwhelming availability of movie rentals, it seems that the vastly superior point-and-shoot digital cameras will succumb to the inferior smartphone.  People will always prefer convenience to performance.  The writing is on the wall.  Actually, it's been on the wall for so long that the paint is peeling.", 6930, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],

Quality of digital images does not degrade over time. You can loose your images if your storage medium goes bad which is why you backup your images to multiple storage devices.

We keep descending and it becomes denser and denser until that liquid hydrogen becomes a super hot liquid metal. If we kept descending, we likely would eventually come to a solid core.

Do a simple YouTube search for something like \"Camcorder vs DSLR\" and watch what the pros have determined to be the pros and cons of using both for video.  Most that I've seen confirm that the one and only reason to use a DSLR/mirrorless for video is to obtain that shallow depth-of-field look that you can't get with consumer-grade camcorders.  Other than that, there isn't any reason to buy a digital camera for video.  The ease of use, the lack of overheating issues, the quick workflow, the fast f/1.8 zoom lenses, the superior image stabilization, the optimized sensor, the videocentric features not found in any DSLR/mirrorless no matter their cost. Realize that while brands like Canon have great reputations for their video performance, that performance is only found in their top-end models like the 5D Mark III/IV and their 1Dx.  But even at that, these cameras are intentionally limited in their video performance because Canon doesn't want to their DSLR/mirrorless cameras to hurt their camcorder sales.

	49320 : ["You haven't said what you're photographing with a flash. That matters. Option 1. Buy an external speedlight that fits on to your camera's hot shoe. A speedlight that uses Nikon's TTL metering system is recommended. It needs to have a swivel head. Nikon's TTL BL metering system is magic once you understand how to use it. I don't know if off-brand flashes work as well as Nikon's speedlights regarding exposure control Learn to use bounce flash. Properly done, bounce flash produces flattering lighting. You can use the ceiling, walls, or someone's back (if they are wearing a white shirt) for bounce. Bounce may do exactly what you need to do. Avoid directly aiming the flash at your subject. You can buy radio triggers for the speedlight where the TTL functionality is preserved. Be careful with radio triggers as many of the cheaper triggers don't work well. You can also get cables that allow you to get the flash off the camera. I've modified such a cable and put Ethernet jacks on the cable so I can extend the cable with an Ethernet extension cable. I don't think the D5300 support Nikon's creative lighting system fully, thus, your camera can't work wirelessly with a remote flash using the CLS system. Wireless CLS support starts with the D7xxxx series bodies. Option 2. Buy a monobloc(s) with a light modifier (umbrella, soft box, or use bounce flash). You can connect via a cable (need to buy a hot shoe to PC or 3.5mm adapter), slave it to your on-camera flash (use the on-camera flash in manual mode at the lowest power setting so the on-camera flash won't influence the lighting or add just a tad of fill), or use a radio trigger. Monoblocs are very flexible, but aren't conveniently portable. Option 3. Use continuous lighting. You can buy a few work lights from the hardware store and use 1600 lumen 6000°K LED lights. This works for photographing things that are close (within a couple meters). Not very portable. With any lighting system you may want to learn to use reflector cards to add fill light.", 6949, "HFuI8oVYaa", 1],
