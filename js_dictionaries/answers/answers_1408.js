For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 48 You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\"", 8821, "None", 2],

	76017 : ["Interesting question. Actually there are two priesthoods. The Priesthood of Aaron (aka the Lower Priesthood) and the Priesthood of Melchizedek (aka the Higher Priesthood). The words \"lower\" and \"higher\" are not meant to infer that one is better than the other, it just means that the responsibilities associated with the lower (the one that you start out in - if you're a worthy male) are less than that of the higher. Those who have the higher can do all that the lower can do, but those in the lower can not do the things/are not responsible for the same things as those of the higher.  So now that that's out of the way... The priesthood that Melchizedek belonged to was called the Priesthood of the Son of God. In an effort to not over use the name of the Son of God, and because Melchizedek was such a righteous man, the name was changed to the Melchizedek Priesthood. I'm sure others had it, because Melchizedek received it from someone (likely his father), although we don't know because scripture doesn't say.  In different dispensations different keys of the Priesthood were had. Not all of the keys of the Priesthood were had at any one time until they were all restored to Joseph Smith. They were restored to him by the last Prophet who held that particular key. Therefore, while Melchizedek had the key(s) of the High Priesthood, they were at some point lost by the time of Moses. It is thought by some that Moses had the High Priesthood and Aaron the Lesser Priesthood even though that is not supported by the Old or New Testement.  Oh, and this may go without saying, but just in case, \"keys\" as it means here does not mean a physical key. Also, while there is only one Priesthood, it is divided into two arms - the Higher or Melchezidek and the Lesser or Lower or Aaronic. Also as part of the Aaronic Priesthood, their is the Levitical Priesthood. This Priesthood is only for the direct desendents of Levi (one of the brothers of Joseph of Egypt, you know 12 brothers, 12 tribes of Israel, etc.).  You would think this question would be a fairly short answer, but it does sort of open up a can of worms - so to speak.", 8827, "AA10410743", 4],

She knows, and that's not going to change, no matter what stupid schemes you and your friend invent. So why don't you do the honorable thing and just admit it? Everyone makes mistakes.

Half the time it's just useless **** like a phone case from Primark, or Earrings from Claires, the other day it was 6 nail varnishes from Tescos. It's stuff not worth buying you know. Boots its kind of a bad choice though, my friends stole from there and they followed them all the way to Topshop, they're now banned from Boots for 2 years. So I'd go with Superdrug or somewhere else that doesn't have proper expensive stuff in. Boots has like Ted Baker bags and perfume so of course they have to have high security. If you are going to do it, just look to see if there is anyone in the aisle. Don't look up at the cameras because that will make you suspicious, and make it more obvious. And just act normal while doing it, take the makeup, walk to the side a bit and put it in your pocket. The less slyly you do it, the more guilty you like.

Say... if the occasion merited me wearing a suit or tuxedo, she should probably do a touch of eyeshadow.  Not that I tend charity balls on a regular basis, but I do, very occasionally, get invited to some swanky shindigs. By and large, though... I generally prefer a less made up woman.
