Anyways, I cannot wait until this summer, because I enjoyed the one I went to! I got there as the door opened at 8:am, and did not see one brother or sister \"running\". I did see only a few people save seats for elderly members of their family, and Im guessing that they did that because it would be very difficult for them to climb stairs. Everyone was smiling and happy and the only time I seen a child unhappy is when it was a baby crying because they were needing a diaper change or maybe a bottle. My 12 year old son went with me and ended up taking notes most of the time and has said so himself that he is \"excited\" about going again. He just loved watching the baptisms and the dramas especially! I guess maybe if you have no interest in learning about God it would be hard to sit through, just like how I hated math, but had to sit through it when I was in school an do the homework on it LOL! Also, they take a lunch break after only a couple hours and that lasts about a hour or hour and half? Well during that time, I see them hugging each other, smiling,laughing and sharing food. I also seen children playing together and feeding little baby ducks outside. It was like my own personal look at how well everyone should and will soon get along in the coming paradise.

They are all here in happy combination.   Some cities were more favored with the Lord's presence than others, and therefore he looked for more from them. These cities ought to have repented, or Christ would not have upbraided them: repentance is a duty. The more men hear and see of the Lord's work, the greater is their obligation to repent. Where most is given most is required. Men are responsible for the way in which they treat the Lord Jesus and “his mighty works.” There is a time for upbraiding: “Then began he.” The most loving preacher will see cause for complaining of his impenitent hearers: HE upbraids, even he who also wept. Repentance is what we who are preachers drive at; and where we do not see it, we are sore troubled. Our trouble is not that our hearers did not applaud our ability, but because they repented not. They have enough to repent of, and without repentance woe is upon them, and therefore we mourn that they do not repent", 10920, "None", 0],

He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent: Because most of His mighty works were done in these cities, they experienced a greater light - which required a greater accountability. i. Of course, we in the Western world have a tremendous accountability before God. We have had an access to the gospel that no other society has, yet we are in desperate need of repentance. b.

The fulfillment of the 49th generation of the 5th Seal/Age took place in the year 313 AD, however the beginning of the 1st Season of Labor of the 6th Seal/ took place in the year 0 BC/AD and the completion of the 7th Season, the Season of Rest, of the 6th Seal/Age, the 49th generation was in the year 1960 AD. The beginning of the 1st Season, of the 5th Seal/Age was in the year 1680 BC. The beginning of Time began in the 1st Season of labor of the 1st Seal/Age some 200 million years ago. Jesus and Daniel both revealed the day that many falsely call the \"rapture\" and is called the \"Time of the Blessed\" by the Father. Jesus said this time would be 70 times and Daniel said this time would be in 1,003,530 days. Each of these propheices refer to the year 2800 AD. The fig tree was the beginning of the 6th Seal/Age and referred to the Time of the Gentiles who were given Grace, forgiveness of the sins if they were willing to obey all of the commandments and sayings spoken by Jesus.

Hebrews a million:6 has been intentionally mistranslated by way of a few to help their trinity doctrine. Hebrews a million:6 is an prompt quote of Psalms 40 5:6 which speaks relating to the characteristics of an anointed king, whether David, Solomon, and so on. in case you prepare the trinitarians' translation of Hebrews a million:6 to Psalms, you may could desire to end that the king being spoken approximately is likewise God Almighty. yet seem at what playstation  40 5:6 rather says, and you will then see how Hebrews could desire to be worded.", 10926, "ezMFzJ3Waa", 0],
