I believe that you see this reaction most often to questions that have either been asked and answered a thousand times before, in cases where the question is trollish ( ie, why are atheists so f..ing stupid that they don't believe, blah, blah, blah,), where the question is so steeped in magical references that, while the argument might be valid,  it is clear that the premises have never been actually examined or they are simply assumed to be true premise,  or where the logic of the question itself is at issue ( anything involving circular reasoning for example.)

	60651 : ["Whoever said this appears to have been speaking from a non-theistic point of view. Using Aristotle's Four Causes framework:- - Material cause describes the material out of which something is  composed. In the case of humans that is organs, tissues and skeleton. - The formal cause tells us what a thing is. In the case of people you might say that people's function is to survive and thrive. This could be seen as serving others. As mothers, fathers, employers, farmers etc. - The efficient cause is that from which the change or the ending of the  change first starts. This has had no conclusive proof insofar as the origins of life on Earth. However the climate of a few billion years ago appears to have been vastly different to what it is now. It is highly likely that the conditions were just right for the formation of biochemicals such as RNA, amino acids and chlorophyll. Given enough time, the first forms of life might then arise through interactions between these  chemicals. Then if evolution is sound then that would involve the fittest new organisms surviving and the offspring adapting. Fast forward  to the present day and man is the fittest as he adapts the environment much more than he adapts himself.    - The final cause is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. In the case of humans this could be to produce and nurture the next generation. Following the chain of causality backwards, you come to the creation of universe. The cause of the creation of the universe is often referred to as the Prime Mover. If you reject a theistic point of view then currently the  most viable alternative is that the universe came into being spontaneously.  i.e. a rare, random, multi-factor event - the way you could describe an accident. So if the creation of the universe is an accident then everything following on including  the existence of human life is not purposefully caused and therefore are accidents also.", 8087, "81bc5e1b7f28b60b366a49c329f3158caa", 1],

	60657 : ["The basic unit of living things is the cell, and the basic material that makes up a cell is protein. Evolutionists acknowledge that the probability of the right atoms and molecules falling into place to form just one simple protein molecule is about 1 in 10113, or 1 followed by 113 zeros. In other words, it could take 10113 chances for the event to occur once. But any event that has one chance in 1050 is dismissed by mathematicians as never happening. However, far more than one simple protein molecule is needed for life to occur. For a cell to maintain its functions, some 2,000 different proteins are needed. What, then, is the probability of all of these happening at random? It is estimated that it is 1 in 1040,000, or 1 followed by 40,000 zeros! Are you willing to rest your faith on such an outrageously remote probability? If the probability is so remote for a cell to come into existence by accident, it would be even more so for the cell to evolve into the great variety of complicated living things. The fact is that between humans and beasts, there are differences far greater than the obvious physical ones. Man is endowed with a conscience; he has feelings, aesthetic values, moral concepts, thinking ability, and reasoning powers. Animals do not possess these capabilities. If man evolved from the animals, why is there such a huge gulf between man and beast? This is another thorny problem for the evolutionists. The marvelous structure of our human body also testifies to the existence of a Creator. A close look at a tiny living cell will help us to understand why. Our body is made up of about 100Â trillion (100,000,000,000,000) tiny cells. The complexity of each living cell can be likened to that of a city with its many operations, such as power generation, management, transportation, and defense. In addition, the cell's nucleus contains tens of thousands of genes in the intricately arranged DNA. It is said that our DNA contains enough information to fill an encyclopedia of 1,000 volumes. All this information constitutes a genetic blueprint and determines our skin color, hair type, stature, and countless other details of our body. If all construction blueprints require meticulous design, then who designed the complex genetic blueprint in our body? The structure and the function of the various organs in our body are so intricate and ingenious that no man-made machine can even remotely compare with it. Of all the organs in our body, not one is more astounding than the human brain. The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica notes: “Transmission of information within the nervous system is more complex than the largest telephone exchanges; problem solving by a human brain exceeds by far the capacity of the most powerful computers.” To scientists, the awesome function of our brain is cause for wonderment. Could this marvelous organ have been formed simply by having the correct atoms and molecules fall into place at random? 10 What conclusion can we draw from all of this? One thing we can agree on is that laws must have a law-giver and that design requires a designer. Since precise order, complex design, and immense wisdom are observed in everything—from the smallest cell to the boundless universe—is it not reasonable and logical to believe that there must be an all-intelligent and all-powerful Designer behind them? The Bible is right when it says about God: “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.” (Romans 1:20) Even though we cannot see God, our belief in his existence is no mere superstition. Daily, we deal with many things we cannot see, such as wind, electricity, magnetism, and the force of gravity. We know that they exist because we can observe the effects they produce. Similarly, the intricate design and the superb order in the universe distinctly testify to the existence of a Grand Creator.", 8084, "1LyRXuxVaa", 5],

	60664 : ["Well, some of the life on this planet is a catastrophe, not just an accident! But seriously, I agree with the answer that says life adapts to the surroundings.

Our sun too is changing and at some time in the future Earth will not be in the perfect position to support the kinds of life that are here now.

Ever since then, the talk about Christian Religion has been polarised to the point where those who \"Believe in the Faith\" are unfortunately out numbered by those who, though born Christian, have rejected thoughts like that Six day theory cause it does not match Scientific Reality.

	60674 : ["Antony Flew explains why chance or accidental explanations fall short, citing a refutation by Gerry Schroeder of a so-called, \"monkey theorem\".... To paraphrase this refutation from Antony Flew's book There Is a God, Gerry Schroeder says that the \"monkey theorem\": \"...defends the possibility of life arising by chance using the analogy of  a multitude of monkeys banging away on computer keyboards and eventually ending up writing a Shakespearean sonnet. Schroeder first refereed to an experiment conducted by the British National Council of Arts. A computer was placed in a cage with six monkeys. After one month of hammering away at it (as well as using it as a bathroom!), the monkeys produced fifty typed pages - but not a single word. Schroeder noted that this was the case even though the shortest word in the English language is one letter (a or I). A is a word only if there is a space on either side of it. If we take it that the keyboard has thirty characters (the twenty-six letters and other symbols), then the likelihood of getting a one-letter word os 30 times 30 times 30, which is 27,000. The likelihood of getting a one-letter word is one chance out of 27,0000. Schroeder then applied the probabilities to the sonnet analogy. 'What's the chance of getting a Shakespearean sonnet?' he asked. He continued: 'All the sonnets are the same length. They're by definition fourteen lines long. I picked the one I knew the opening line for, \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" I counted the number of letters; there are 488 letters in that sonnet. What's the likelihood of hammering away and getting 488 letters in the exact sequence as in \"Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?\"? What you end up with is 26 multiplied by itself 488 times- or 26 to the 488th power. Or, in other words, in base 10, 10 to the 690th. [Now] the Number of particles in the universe- not grains of sand, I';m talking about protons, electrons, and neutrons-is 10 to the 80th. Ten to the 80th is 1 with 80 zeros after it. Ten to the 690th is 1 with 690 zeros after it. There are not enough particles in the universe to write down the trials; you'd be off by a factor of 10 to the 600th. If you took the entire universe and converted it to computer chips- forget the monkeys- each one weighing a millionth of a gram and had each computer chip able to spin out 488 trials at, say, a million times a second; if you turn the entire universe into these microcomputer chips and these chips were spinning a million times a second [producing] random letters, the number of trials you would get since the beginning of time would be 10 to the 90th trials. It would be off again by a factor of 10 to the 600th. You will never get a sonnet by chance. The universe would have to be 10 to the 600th times larger.
