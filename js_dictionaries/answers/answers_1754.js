	93400 : ["Some loaded and smart questions here. US has a vested interest in keeping the status quo in terms of competitiveness in the world market and economy. Would the government go as far as prevent progress? Well that depends on how much influence the corporate powers and industrial juggernauts have on politics. And I would hazard to guess that in the States the influence is astoundingly high. The politician with the biggest backing from industry will have the loudest voice. Whether the government is willing to admit this is another story.  As for the consumption question, of course it would cost less if consumption declined. It comes down to the basic law of economics, as the demand declines, the supply increases thereby reducing the price to offset the decline in demand.  As for the last question, that is a no brainer! All developed nations should be placing more emphasis on perfecting green technologies, making them more accessible, and thereby more cost effective to the public. People fear the loss of jobs if we change, but this will create so many more new jobs and incentives for industry to make a profit, while doing something worthwhile for our environment. oh and to answer your main question, what I just said all leads to this... to a certain degree, US does hinder other countries if they are perceived as threats to our standards of living. Communism is perceived as an 'evil', admittedly less than it used to be, and there are still restrictions on countries which practice it ~ take Cuba as a classic example.  Another case in point was the Kyoto Protocol and the State's refusal to sign on. Canada is no better in this regard having later backed out due to our wonderful Conservative government currently in power. But this in effect has reduced the legitimacy and effectiveness of the protocol to virtually nil because yes the US along with Canada, Russia and Japan (who also bailed) are economic powerhouses with alot of buying power. So that basically equates to \"maintaining the status quo\" and stemming the growing tide of change. Another case in point are the huge pharmaceutical companies that are allowed to run unchecked with their stronghold over generic drugs, preventing cheap drugs to reach those who need it most in developing countries. And the list goes on and on.... ps. as for some commenting on the US providing aid and technology innovations, that is true but often this aid does not go to those who need it most, which is a universal problem, not just an American problem.", 9481, "None", -1],

Every kitchen needs the basics, of course, but there are a few others that are a must: a cast iron skillet and deep pan, a lemon reamer, herb file/grater, 3 sizes of stainless steel mixing bowls, a large pyrex measuring bowl, pyrex baking ware (9'' round cake pans, 13x9 baking dish, 8x8 baking dish, and a large casserole dish with lid), and the most important is to have the best knives possible. I personally recommend 'Henkel' knives. Every kitchen must have a chef's knife, a paring knife, a boning knife, a 'rocking' cleaver, and sharp kitchen shears. 3. The ability to follow your nose/taste buds! Every cook should have a knowledge of all the herbs, spices, broths, meats, veggies, etc. so that one can come up with their own recipes. Once one knows the basic formulas to cooking and baking, sky's the limit for them to develop their own style of cooking. It is a serious art.
