Ballet works particular muscles in particular ways that tend not to \"bulk you up\" and give a very lean, toned appearance. So if this is a person's main source of exercise, even if they aren't dancing professionally, they might be more likely to look thin in comparison to a soccer player or something.  -  There is also the unfortunate fact that ballet prefers naturally thin bodies. Girls who are naturally thin, have naturally broad shoulders, naturally toned, naturally flat-chested, naturally flexible bodies are preferred in dance. They receive a lot more encouragement from teachers at a young age because they are naturally built for ballet. They are often said to have more \"potential\".

	54912 : ["You're conflating \"Jewish DNA\" with \"being Jewish.\" Jews have stayed so tight-knit for so long, they have their own distinct genetic haplogroup, so you may have 25% Jewish DNA, but that's just your ethnic and genetic background. When you refer to the maternal descent, that is more to do with the Jewish community accepting somebody as a Jewish person under Rabbinical law, i.e., religion, e.g., having the right of return, etc. Just having DNA that is shared with Jewish haplogroups doesn't make you \"Jewish\" you have to actually be accepted by the Jewish religious community to be considered \"Jewish\" in that sense. I also have Jewish ancestry, but like you mine is on my father's side. My DNA tests have come up all over the place. On one test it said I had only a tiny sliver of Ashkenazi and then some Middle East, Caucuses and Eastern European adding up to around 4% total. And on another test, for my Jewish, I think it turned into Sephardic, Greek, Slavic and Southern European adding up to about 8% with these groups all combined on that one. Mine is from a great grandmother on my dad's side, so I guess their algorithms had to do a little more guesswork, but I know I am not Greek, Slavic, or Southern European (which is Spanish/Italian I think mostly), so that must have been something that the other company's test might have combined together to put all in the Ashkenazic and Middle East, Caucuses, Eastern European and mixed in some of my German in there instead as I got high Western Europe but most of my German comes from my Jewish side (They were Jews from Trier), but it broke it all up into totally different population chunks in this other test, so make with that what you will, they're all doing a lot of guesswork I think, and you just kind of have to understand they're not the gospel. They rely on estimates and presumptions that can go in multiple population groups sometimes. My cousins who took test on same company where my Jewish came up as Ashkenazi, who share our same Jewish great grandmother all got around 6% Ashkenazi though, so not sure why their's came up so concise and not mine. My great aunt, the daughter of a Jewish mother, only got a small amount of Jewish too (but she only took the test on the company where mine came up as Sephardic) but she had really high Eastern and Southern European, which I know she has none of since she would have the same ancestry as my grandfather, so I don't know what that test was doing. My overall DNA profile must have confused the algorithms, as I have a lot of Dutch and English and Scandinavian, whereas my second cousins have a lot more Italian and Southern European stuff, but still not sure why my great aunt came up so wrong on the one test as at least one of her grandchildren on the other test came up with more Jewish than her. I mean, she should have had 50%, and me 12.5%, so who knows. And I am also not sure if what we got from our other sides of our families made a difference or I just didn't inherit as much DNA from my Jewish great grandmother or what, as my actual definitive \"Ashkenazi\" or \"Sephardic\" results on either tests were only between 1-2% but then got all these random other things I have no evidence of in my family tree for that has over 40,000 people on it. I swear they just throw darts at a dartboard or something, because I know my great aunt claims her mother was Jewish and that her Jewish family came from Trier. And I think she would know what her own mother was. And when I researched this, it said that the groups that I got that I have no evidence in my family tree for, all happen to be commonly found for Ashkenazic Jews also and share a lot of commonality with their DNA with those groups. This makes sense, as they did migrate from the Levant area and went through all those places into Europe. Here's a Wikipedia article talking all about it, so maybe it can answer your questions.

	54913 : ["In spite of what others have said, the real truth is you are too old. Don't feel too badly as most who start young also don't reach the professional ranks. There are so few jobs and many gifted and well trained dancers ready to fill those jobs. The main problem is you have aged out of the full time, world class professional level training, that is required for a career as a dancer, I don't see how you can do this no matter how gifted you are. It takes ten years to “make a leg” in dance which gets you to the age that many professional dancers start to retire. Which is why you have aged out of type of training. That being said, no where is it written that you have to get paid to enjoy dancing. Recreational dance is for anyone of any age, shape and abilities.

	54915 : ["It's definitely within the realm of possibility, but it would require a massive commitment in terms of time training and of mental effort. The rule of thumb we use where I teach is 7 years of serious training before we recommend starting to audition, but that number goes down with talent and it goes down much more if the student has other dance training or training in other physical disciplines like martial arts. It's more common for men to advance quickly, but I feel like has more to do with pointe work than anything else. Pointe will be the biggest hurdle for any young student pursuing ballet as a profession. It's also faster for men because there's so much less competition. Smaller non prestigious companies literally advertise that they will take on men who only have athletic or theatric experience with no dancing. So to answer your question Yes!! I just started ballet and I'm in my early 20s. My instructor told me not to feel bad about being so old because she taught another girl who started as an adult and went professional. My instructor also started as an adult and now teaches several classes. She told me that if I put enough passion into it, I could go professional, but it's a hefty commitment. It takes a lot of time and discipline. It's never too late. Go for it!!", 7649, "None", 0],
