	28748 : ["A lot depends on your definition of \"not physically strong\". To do damage to a bigger opponent, one must generate some measure of force.  Punching technique, for example, won't help you if your body cannot generate enough force to tear a wet paper towel. If you mean a person that possesses some lean strength but is not particularly tall or \"bulked up\" then yes, good technique can overcome a size/bulk disadvantage. I knew a guy that was about 5'4\" and average build, but he was also trained in boxing.  He got into a bar fight with a powerfully-built guy over 6 feet.  The guy tried to grapple with him but the shorter man sent him to the floor with a  perfectly-timed uppercut to the chin. A friend who trains in Muay Thai told me about his teacher..a guy that stands about 5'6\"..who sent a 6'4\" college linebacker flying with a push-kick to the chest when the player hurled racist slurs at him in a bar.. But he also told me the guy's body fat was around 3% and he did 30 minute rounds on a heavy bag almost every day.... so some measure of conditioning must be there.", 4459, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", 2],
	28749 : ["That is true. It really is all abt technique not strength. When i actually test or for demos the crazy thing is they have us do them when we are already been training for over an hour and you are starting to get tired. Funny thing is the more tired you are the more technique you have to use. That just an example in a controlled environment. I know for fact that a small guy who is trained can and has beat bigger stronger guys. It is all abt technique, timing, distance, etc... In my case when you beat 1 guy it maybe just luck. Yo beat 2 than maybe you have some skill. You beat 3 in 1 sitting than that something you really need to look at on how and why a smaller person with some strength ad lot of skill beat 3 very physical trained men, in less than 3 minutes. It all abt how you train and what you train in. It not just get strong and learn some boxing and wrestling. In a fight you have not even 1 second to make a decision. And it could cost you your life. If you train i MMA and follow that training, well you just trained for sport not street. BIG DIFFERENCE in training and mentality. Nothing replaces the real training principles. Which is train as if your life depends on it. FYI on the street there are no rules, no times out, no corner man, no one to back your 6. U run what u brung, hope you brung enough. That saying was not just fitting for the street racing days but also for life on the street.", 4459, "None", -1],

	28751 : ["There are codes of conduct for many martial arts (\"bushido\", tenants of Ching Wu/Jing Woo, etc.), but not all. In fact, many schools, even to this day (although not nearly as prevalent) will challenge other schools to assert their dominance. The concept of using martial arts as a means of self defense ONLY is a more occidental idea to satisfy insurance requirements and claims. By all means, I teach my students that they are well-within their morals to defend somebody else if need be - is that technically \"self\" defense? My school is a part of the Jing Woo Federation, so we do teach the martial moralities (\"deed\" and \"mind\"). Something else I teach my students: if your life is at risk, do what you must, but if you're being robbed at gunpoint, and you feel that the assailant only wants your money, hand it over: nothing in your wallet is worth dying over. Conversely, if you feel in danger for your life, do what you have to do to survive. You ran away from someone with a bat and not only lived to tell the tale, but came away unscathed. That sounds like a win. Films for wisdom? There are many, but don't blur the line between fantasy and reality, even if the movie is \"based on a true story\". Bearing that in mind, Mr. Miyagi has some great philosophy in the \"Karate Kid\" movies, and \"Fearless\" is one of my personal favorites that (dramatically) tells the story of Huo Yuanjia and his creation of the Jing Woo Federation.", 4460, "AA11725378", 2],
	28752 : ["If one has zero training - Very unlikely they would win without extra help (e.g. weapons, another person, element of surprise).  With TMA or single martial art/non hybrid combat sport training - Depends on a number of things. Being a pro doesn't necessarily mean someone is head and shoulders above everyone else. UFC, PFL, Bellator, and the like are of course the highest echelon of MMA competition. So one could argue in most cases a fighter of that caliber would win. But there are plenty of \"Toughman\" competition-level fighters out there that are only a step above an undisciplined street fighter. An experienced TMA practitioner could absolutely devastate someone at that level. Many MMA fighters don't specialize in any one thing. So while it is great to be well-rounded a lot of them have serious holes in their game capable of being exposed by someone able to impose their strength (i.e. one facet of the game).   Lots of TMAs have competitive formats that are on par with pro leagues too. I'm all for people feeling MMA competition is the highest level of combat sport competition. But it doesn't mean MMA fighters are the greatest at everything. A well-rounded person has an advantage with less rules. But they can still be exposed if there's a huge gap in skill. There's no way an MMA fighter is just going to run through a Judo or Sambo master. They can still get knocked out by a good kickboxer or boxer too. It really depends on a number of things. ", 4461, "lpU2dnqsaa", 1],
