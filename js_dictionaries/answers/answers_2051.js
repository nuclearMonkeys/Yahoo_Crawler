	108316 : ["To answer your first question; each state has different laws about carrying firearms. You will need to check the laws in New York State and also check to see if there are any local ordinances. Some places allow concealed weapons permits that are fairly easy to get and other places restrict those permits. There is a difference between permits to register a firearm, and permits for carrying a firearm with you all the time. There are several other options you should consider; check to see if your local police department offers personal protection training, which is a good place to get ideas and answers to your questions. Hope you don't mind, but I'd like to back up a bit, and talk about some other ways besides a gun to keep yourself safe. You went from talking to someone you didn't really want to because \"you didn't want to be rude\" to feeling some very justified fear and wanting to carry a gun. I think there are some steps in the middle for you to consider. Don't assume that living in a small town means that you are immune from threats or violence. \"It\" can happen anywhere; it can be attacks, stalking, violence, robbery.....any crime. Learn about personal safety; your police department, neighborhood watch, any many other groups offer safety and self-defense classes. Spend some time learning how to take good care of yourself. Don't confuse being assertive with being rude. Many people do this; and it really doesn't make much sense. \"I can't talk, I'm writing and need to finish\" is not rude. You say this man invited himself over to chat; well, you are not obligated to chat with anyone. Now that he has \"popped up\" enough to scare you, it might help if you just don't engage with him. If you he shows up and you feel threatened, call 9-1-1 right then. Why wait to report it the next day? You don't know if he means you harm, don't take a chance. Keep a log of his contacts with you. Be aware of your surroundings; and avoid walking alone in areas that are away from other people. This is basic personal safety with or without a stalker. It is great that you can walk with your husband on weekends. What about during the week? You might consider doing group activities more often; are there any walking or hiking clubs in your area? Any activities at local recreation centers that you might enjoy? How about recreational sports teams? Perhaps a local writer's group? The more you are around other people the less vulnerable you will be. Remember being told to not walk alone when you were a kid? That advice still applies. Vary your routine. Don't do things at the same time every day. This advice applies whether or not you think someone is stalking you. Shopping the same day each week, running errands the same time of day, etc, makes it very easy to know where you will be. Have you considered other safety devices besides a gun? Check with your police department to see what they recommend you carry with you at all times; perhaps pepper spray.  Always keep windows and doors locked; at your home (when you are there and when you are away) and your car. Consider investing in some sort of alarm system. Consider getting a dog.  You may not be able to control what the man you describe does, but you can do quite a bit to control what you do and to make yourself a bit less vulnerable. Trust your intuition, don't rely on police reports and a gun as your only tools to be safe, stay aware and come up with some plans to stay safe.....with or without a stalker.

Do you have a close friend of family member who can start accompanying you for a few weeks, off and on so it would show him you're not alone?  Be rude. Whip out your phone every time you are approached and start talking to \"mystery guy\" or \"mystery girl.\" Just stay on as long as you need to and walk away from him at the same time in the direction of a person or persons-never to an open area. Or if he starts a conversation, whip out your phone (as if you got it on vibrate,) and blurt out, \"I gotta go.\"  Nothing else.  Do not allow him to chime-up a conversation.  Leave him cold. Repeat as necessary. It's fine to have an unloaded gun if you are trained to use one safely, but would you be willing to spend your life in prison if something should go wrong?

	108336 : ["You having an anxiety disorder and him having a party on his own has NOTHING to do with you! If you want this man to marry you AND to tell you the truth then you need to see a therapist on your own and deal with your own issue on YOUR OWN! You are teaching him that he can't tell you the truth about his plans or you freak out! Which means you will end up with a husband who has to lie to you so that you don't freak out (such as not telling you his bachelor party plans or telling you where he is going and what he will be doing in the future).  YOU are wrong here. I am not trying to suggest that your anxiety issues are not real and not a concern. What I am saying is that you can't control others and you should NOT try to control what he does in his own free time. If he tried to make you come to a party you weren't comfortable with then that is another issue. But his party has NOTHING to do with you and you should stay out of it! Tell him NOT to tell you about the party because it is upsetting you to hear about it due to your anxiety problems.  He SHOULD go to his party and not tell you about it. I think you need to IMMEDIATELY see a private therapist to talk about your anxiety issues and how to cope with it. This is a problem you need to work on by yourself with a therapist and not push your problems on your fiance!  What you are doing is making your fiance prisoner in YOUR anxiety ridden world! That is NOT healthy for you or him! You need to deal with your issues on your own and if hearing about a party upsets you then tell your fiance not to tell you the details. Have him promise you he won't do anything that would upset you and to tell you only when he is going out and when he will be back. No woman wants to hear the details of a bachelor party!  You should work on your trust issues and anxiety issues alone with a therapist and maybe get anti anxiety medication if your condition is this bad. Do not get married if you are going to constantly tell your future husband what he can and can't do because it might cause you anxiety. You can't go through life controlling what other people can and can't do. If him going to a party causes you so much anxiety then how are you able to go to work and even function day to day? Are you seeing a counselor because you need to see one immediately and especially before you get married because you have serious mental problems that need medication and/or talking it over with a professional!

Preventing someone from living their life is unfair and wrong. What the heck else will you not be able to handle?  What else will he not be allowed to do while married to you?  How much more controlling are you going to be in the name of your emotional instability? You need to learn how to handle your problems.  Perhaps go on meds or change the ones you are on would help.  You cannot allow your problems to become his problems because then it is all about you and nothing about him. I am not trying to be harsh here, really.  But, you are using your unstable emotional frame of mind to control his actions and that is unfair, wrong and downright used as emotional black mail. If you are so worried about other women, strippers are the least of your problems as there are sexual temptations all over the place.  He could find the girl two doors down irresistable and have sex with her on his lunch hour in your bed.  So, you see, anything is possible.
