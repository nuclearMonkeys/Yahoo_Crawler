	16654 : ["Air conditioning and heating top the list. This applies to household service. From your list: #1  Air conditioner. read up on ways you can cut a little expense with these. #2 is refrigerator. the more often the door is opened, the more often the compressor starts, and startup can take 10 times the running power. #3  Washer/drier. do full loads,and outdoor clothslines really help there. #4 TV/entertainment. Modern equipment is quite efficient so no big dent there. You did not mention lighting,, Often uses more power than TV etc. Install LED lighting and turn lights off when not needed.", 2866, "3521143c1fee1cb67663128ed5d0ef31aa", 0],
	16655 : ["My first real job was a customer service rep for a utility company. I helped customers figure out how to reduce their bills a dozen times a day for years. Appliances that produce heat or cold use the most power. The hotter or colder it goes, the more power. The larger the area being heated or cooled, the more power is needed. Producing heat with electricity only (not natural gas, propane, etc.) is the most expensive way, whether you're heating the air or water. So air conditioning, furnace (especially if it's electric heat), water heater (again, especially if it's electric), refrigerator, and freezer tend to be the most energy-guzzling appliances. Resetting your thermostat one or two degrees warmer (for AC) or cooler (for furnace) can help. Turning it off or way down when no one is home for five or six hours can help. A thermostat with a timer can return the home to comfort before anyone returns. Do the obvious things like closing blinds or curtains when the sun streams in, cooling only the rooms you use (i.e., if you have a guest room or another seldom-used room, don't routinely cool it), and supplementing cooling by moving cool air around with fans. All can help you reduce bills.", 2866, "None", 3],

	16658 : ["Led bulbs won't work in enclosed light fixtures. Any light fixture that allows free air circulation around the LED bulb will be fine", 2867, "None", 2],
	16659 : ["Yes the leds with the screw base will have it's own driver inside. Since you aren't using halogen bulbs anymore you would need to change the wiring in the lamp fixture to bypass the transformer. Make sure you know what voltage you are running and get the right bulb", 2867, "TllBCDE8aa", -3],

	16664 : ["Depends on the child.  If they aren't active, then it's likely too long just like for an adult.  If they are active, it can be done without too much issue.  I went hiking with my kids at that age further than that.  They are slower than I normally would go, but keeping food and water in them they do just fine.  Having activities or interesting/fun stops along the way keeps their minds off the distance which is the biggest barrier.  ", 2858, "EVz77LT6aa", 9],

	16668 : ["Mostplants ARE easy to grow if they have the correct growing conditions...soil, sun/shade and water is all they need. Veggies are easy to grow: like tomatoes,  cucumbers, bean vines fresh herbs. Flowers like marigolds, coleus, impatients and begonias are easy to grow. So are butterfly bushes and lilac trees and Rose of Sharons. ", 2870, "9MJS6I6Laa", 1],

	16671 : ["LED bulbs are all made in China so quality is poor. And most LED bulbs can't handle heat so you can't use them in enclosed fixtures or they don't last as long as a cheap incandescent bulb. The lifespan claims are mostly lies and you will be lucky to get a fraction of what is claimed on the box. They are also prone to flicker because the slightest resistance in the bulb socket contacts will cause flicker. Many also create radio interference to TV reception ham radio communications, and AM broadcast. LED bulbs are easily damaged by power surges and they are made with some of the most toxic chemicals known to man so they are really not \"green\" since edison bulbs were 100% recyclable and merely used glass, aluminum, and tungsten.", 2868, "None", -2],

	16674 : ["The repairmen may have introduced debris in the line. Some debris clogs the street valve and limits water to the house. A pressure gauge can tell you your static pressure and your 'use' pressure. Both readings should be pretty close in number. I would call the repair man who fixed the leaky main and ask them to fix their mess. It worked BEFORE they 'fixed it', right? Whenever there is a main break or service, they are supposed to flush the main (usually the nearest fire hydrant).", 2871, "41vWD9x2aa", 1],

	16676 : ["No deck stain is waterproofing.  Water Lox is as close as it gets.  Nothing needs to be removed.  Just stain the deck EVERY SPRING with a water based deck stain.  Use a sponge mop and a roller paint pan.  Do it fast and throw it all away.  Maybe you need to remove and remount all the deck boards just once.  Both sides need to be stained and tree ring ends need to be concave down.  New 3 1/8\" Torx screws.  Fast and easy.", 2872, "PLbU2zcYaa", 0],

I AM DONE. The rests rots away in 1,2,10,25 years(like I really noticed?)  You may see the occasional sapling shoot out of the ground 5 or 10 feet away which you hit with an axe and cut it underground.  That is a MAYBE. .Hell, I plant my new tree real close to the original one as the dirt is good  .  The roots will figure they way around it.", 2860, "None", 1],
