The Associated Press is reporting that ABC is canceling Bill Maher's late-night topical talk show, \"Politically Incorrect,\" and replacing it with an entertainment show led by Comedy Central's Jimmy Kimmel. Daily Variety confirms that Kimmel has been signed to a contract.  \"Politically Incorrect\" has been on thin ice since just after the September 11 terrorist attacks, when host Maher was quoted as referring to past United States military actions as \"cowardly.\" FedEx and Sears pulled their advertising from the show.  But, according to the AP report, ABC Chairman Lloyd Braun said Maher's controversial comments had nothing to do with the decision to replace him.  \"We made a decision to go with straight entertainment programming in late night,\" Braun said on Tuesday. \"That's just basically a scheduling opportunity that we felt over the long term had more potential.\"  Even before the current move, ABC had signaled its willingness to make changes in its late-night lineup. In March, sources revealed the network had had talks with David Letterman about joining the network, which likely would have displaced both \"PI\" and Ted Koppel's news show, \"Nightline.\"     QUICKVOTE     Will Jimmy Kimmel fare better than Bill Maher in ABC's late night slot?   Yes     No     View Results                Letterman stayed at CBS and \"Nightline\" received a two-year commitment from ABC, but the status of \"Politically Incorrect\" remained up in the air.  Variety observes that its cancellation is no surprise to many in the industry, particularly after Maher's post-September 11 comments. Whereas Disney executives often publicly supported Koppel and \"Nightline\" after the Letterman flap, there was little support for Maher and \"PI.\"  Maher's contract expires in the fall. It's unclear when the final \"PI\" will air or how ABC may fill any gap between the demise of \"PI\" and the premiere of Kimmel's new series, Variety reports.  \"Politically Incorrect\" had its debut on Comedy Central in 1993 and moved to ABC in 1997.  Kimmel's half-hour show will bow in January, Variety reports, most likely in conjunction with ABC's broadcast of the Super Bowl. Details are still sketchy, though the show is expected to be in the same comedy/entertainment vein as Kimmel's other work.  Kimmel has hosted \"The Man Show\" on Comedy Central since 1999, and also was Ben Stein's original sidekick on \"Win Ben Stein's Money.\"  \"The Man Show\" will have several months of original episodes, but the show will end production with Kimmel's departure.

This man has been the Congressman for the last two terms, if the people thought that his running under his father's name was a fluke the first time why was he re-elected? Surely the people knew the difference by then.  I mean no political candidate is perfect but at least Harold Jr. is formally educated. Did you know he has a degree in law?And since he went to school in the business of law., one would think that he would be self assured when it came to the causes of us my fellow Tennesseans.  I  have watched commercials over and over of Corker trying to \"expose\" Ford Jr. But this man is an un-married, successful, educated diplomat. We don't hear tells of woe about him being an unwed father,(shows responsibilty) he is not married ( meaning he would be readily available if something should happen to occur and we need the voice of Tennessee to be in attendance) he has a law degree(meaning he himself would be able to understand what he was voting on).  Mr. Corker has been uneasy hence the commercials, we all know that Corker has money,yet he spends it redundantly trying to low rate Ford, seems like to me he finds his opponent worthy, more than that formidable!

And most people who lifted themselves out of unfathomable circumstances wouldnt have been able to do that if the apple didnt fall far from the tree.
