Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be ‚Äúhealed‚Äù by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven ‚Äúmark of the beast‚Äù vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be ‚Äúhealed‚Äù by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 3943, "None", -3],

But the most annoying science deniers were and are the ones that continue to deny any fact from accepted science submitted to them. These are the illegitimate AGW deniers. These are the ones that plain lie about what accepted science says, or worse yet, act like 5 year olds, and deflect by falsely accusing people of being 'Dirac'. How stupid and childish.

In a trench put the larger logs and branches, add leaf mulch and other organic matter (weekly compost material), top it with garden soil.¬† Plant lightly the first year. The next year it will be ready to use. The logs hold on to water and in time decompose....giving back to the soil, creating worm food. Instead of giving away all that organic matter to public works....use it in gardens. Reuse paper (envelopes, backs of documents) for scrap paper. Wash plastic freezer bags---dry, and reuse them. Reuse plastic veggie/fruit containers from the veggies/fruits you buy that are in plastic bags, and use those plastic bags for trash and other things...like stuff you don't want to put down the drain. Use used paper towels to soak up/wipe grease, and other liquids you don't want to get into your plumbing, and them toss them in trash, in a reused plastic veggie bag. Wash used pieces of aluminum foil: they clean up nicely. Hang out laundry on the line, if you have space. Catch rainwater for use in garden--cover so animals don't get in them, and screens for mosquitos. You can also put in a short tree limb, so an animal can climb out if they get in. Use fall leaves, grass clippings (if you don't use pesticides) for mulch or adding to soil. Reuse bricks and concrete for garden borders. Reuse bottles/jars for storing all kinds of things. Jarred candles: clean out and reuse to store...coffee Use old window screens (with a few bricks) for covering emerging seedling beds--to protect from chipmunks/squirrels. Old windows: reuse to build top of a cold frame for seedlings Reuse large item plastic bags (like from soil or mulch bags)---as trash/yard cleanup bags. Egg containers can be used for seed starting, or for keeping tiny items. Egg shells, if cracked on the top, making tiny holes on bottom with a shish kabab needle, can be used for starting seeds. You just plant them in the ground, adds calcium. Veggie waste, can make vegetable stock. Bones--make meat broth or soup. Cardboard---use to create garden beds. Shredded paper: add to compost or trench compost. Plastic lidded containers, like cream cheese, reuse to keep nails, etc... Plastic milk containers: can use for watering plants, covering plants (cut bottom off) in spring or fall nights, or using for yard stuff like grains/garden fertilizer to pour out. Old metal bucket: make a cool bucket stove!---great emergency cooker, used a lot in Asia, middle east. Cut a rectangle towards bottom for coals or wood, line it with your own cob (mix of straw, mud/clay and water) add in a grate in the middle for holding firewood. Make 3 cob mounds that rise a bit above the rim--that would hold a pan or pot. Old plastic plant pots without bottom: can cut out the bottom and plant invasive growers like mint, from taking over... Old round metal trash can cover, or round snow sled---use for outdoor quick cooking, to hold the ashes.", 3948, "ENZ9zaaDaa", 0],

	24929 : ["There are a 4 good reasons to post anonymously. 1) It makes it more difficult to block people and there are a few people who block just for \"fun\", they are easy to spot btw, they complain about people posting anonymously. 2) Cyclops would posts anonymously, but since he was the only one who blocked me, I also knew it was him who blocked me, so I just cut and paste the answer and modify it a little to mention cyclops in the answer using another account.¬† The only downside is that it would take a minute to switch to the other account and back. 3) Now we are all here anonymously anyway as none of us use our real name,¬† I believe \"names\" introduce a bias towards the poster, which, for the most part¬† I tried hard to avoid myself.¬† (But I will admit that I came down harder on Sagebrush, because I believe the man is pure evil) 4) There is one looser, you know him well, who would copy the name and picture, to use them in one of his many sock accounts, in a futile attempt to troll people.¬† Posting anonymously stops that childish tactic. I really don't get what you were trying to accomplish, you have been beaten in your own silly game and your only \"success\" has been the destruction of this section.¬† Your behavior is like a child who destroys other kids sand castles because he is jealous and unable to make sand castles himself.¬† The difference is that you are dealing with adults on YA who have a thick skin, else they wouldn't be here.¬† If you are looking for attention, why not make a better looking sand castle?¬† Ii the case of global warming, why not write a paper that proves or disproves the current theories of global warming?
