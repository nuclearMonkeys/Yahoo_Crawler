	98336 : ["Because ... and this is going to absolutely GROSS YOU OUT ... Sewage plants ( this is our human, raw sewage plant, typical of all cities in the USA ) filters out HUMAN FECES and sells it to farmers as fertilizer.   Believe it or not, this is completely true. Fecal germs such as Hepatitis, Aids, and other diseases such as Ecoli are dumped directly onto onions and other types of grond-grown products and are absorbed directly into the soil. Because it's a plant, usually it does not carry disease, however in 2000, there was a rumor that a Mexican cut his hand while cutting onions and caused the green onion Hepatitis B outbreaks, nationwide.  Proven wrong, by 20/20, by showing how the farmer bought raw sewage, this has shown the American people the truth...and this is most likely a cause of the Ecoli spinach problem, as well. I would guess that the raw plants, themselves, were sprayed with the sewage prior to being harvested, and that some plants, even washed, still contain the topical sewage, and Ecoli bacteria.", 9655, "None", 1],

	98340 : ["Okay, that guy's right, go to a community college.  I goofed off in high school, partied too much and graduated with about a 1.5 gpa if I remember correctly-not good anyway.  So I went to a community college (a few years later) and got the gpa to a 3.9.  It was also nice because the classes were smaller than a bigger school and if you ever needed help with anything they had lots of tutoring programs (math, blech!).
