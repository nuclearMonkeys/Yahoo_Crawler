	50164 : ["Why should anyone learn a programming language?  I suppose the reason is because you want to use it to control a computer. So, maybe you should learn to control the computer first.  However, it's not done that way.  It's like when you learn to drive, you do it in a car.  So, which car should you learn first?  If you learn to drive a Toyota will that make it easier to learn to drive a Honda? The analogy isn't perfect.  Cars are designed to have similar controls.  Programming languages are NOT designed to make it easy to go from one to the other, but the general concepts of programming remain the same -- and that's because, after all, the purpose of learning a programming language is to learn how to control the computer -- and the hardware doesn't change when you change programming languages. Many languages are based on C, and parts of programs written in such languages can be identical.  Usually, when there are differences among C-based languages, it's with the input and output statements. Meanwhile, unless you are in a course, you don't need to memorize the syntax of every language.  And, even in a course, many will give open-book tests, because memorization is NOT the purpose of the course.  The book won't help you if you haven't already learned the concepts. If you are hired for an entry-level job, they do not expect you to have learned anything beyond your courses.  It will take 3 to 5 years working full time at a programming job for you to be considered an expert.", 7062, "LSJ8BmHVaa", 1],

So the source code must be converted into zillions of ones and zeros so the computer can be directed to perform the program. Here is an example of source code a programmer might write to print \"Hello world\" on the screen: Start: Print \"Hello World\" End program. So that is the program source code. However, it has to be run through another program called a compiler to convert it into the proper pattern of ones and zeros before it could be run on a computer and be delivered to the customer. And that would look something like this: 111001100010101001110100101000 0100100111011110100110111111001 1110010111010100001101111010111 111001100010101001110100101000 0100100111011110100110111111001 1110010111010100001101111010111 1000101011101010010010011111100...... Suppose the customer wanted to change the \"Hello World\" to \"Hello Frank\". He looks at his program file and sees all of the ones and zeros and can't even begin to figure anything out. So he goes back to the programmer and tells him he wants to modify it to say \"Hello Frank\". So the programmer, having the source file, can do that easily. He just changes \"Hello World\" to \"Hello Frank\". Then he runs it through a compiler program again to generate all of those ones and zeros (an executable file) and gives it back to the customer.

	50195 : ["The answer is 0x0F = 15 not -241 like you would think. If you keep it 1 byte (0x00 to 0xFF) The question is do you understand why? 1st is that 1byte numbers have a range of 256 values (0 to 255). What if we wanted positive and negative numbers?
