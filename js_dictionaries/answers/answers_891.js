Both of your cameras are severely lacking in video control however, there will be instances that you might prefer one over the other.

	49607 : ["A Petzval lens would be on the top of my list.  Swirly bokeh! Because you're using the lens for portraits, avoid any lens below 85mm.  The longer focal length will flatten the perspective making your subjects look more attractive than they do in real life", 6974, "OczpbeMdaa", -1],

	49610 : ["You would probably get better IQ with the expensive Canon lens, not least because it is image-stabilized and can use AF, and the full-frame sensor will be less noise-prone. The image will just take up a smaller proportion of it than with the crop.  I've s", 6976, "UReKGnGXaa", 0],

If you stay close, you'll see noticeable distortion (yes, even if 35mm is standard in APS-C). Experiment on distances. You can", 6978, "21112cc7ac2bacc93374e23ada41a67caa", 0],

	49614 : ["Select spot focus mode, focus on the person's eyes. Provide sympathetic lighting. 35mm is not perfect for portraits as it can make noses look too big. 55mm would be better. That, on your crop sensor, would be more like the ideal 80mm on a 35mm film camera", 6978, "UReKGnGXaa", 0],

	49616 : ["Sorry for the novel of an answer, but I just wanted to be through. I wouldn't recommend it because it uses AA batteries.  You'll be going through batteries like they're going out of style.  I've seen a lot of cameras that run on AAs and none were any good", 6979, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],

	49621 : ["The good thing about a selfie taken in a mirror is that it places the camera or phone 'virtually' at a reasonable distance from the face, thus gets rid of the typical 'selfie distortion with holding the camera/phone just a typical 2 feet from the face. Yo", 6966, "None", 1],
	49622 : ["With a few exceptions, the cameras in smartphones all have a single wide-angle lens.  Wide-angle lenses produce a certain type of distortion to the perspective which makes people look ugly.  You can see the distortion in this link (for reference, smartpho", 6966, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],
