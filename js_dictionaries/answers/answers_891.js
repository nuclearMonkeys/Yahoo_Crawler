	49608 : ["Luck=Moloch=demon.Gov't is killing you with highfrequencyelectricity. Theotokos Virgin Mary gave prayers to \"Schema-nun Antonia\" on how to save aborted babies from hell. If you pray these prayers diligently, aborted babies are released from hell. On each painted nail there are forty demons. Smoking is censer to the devil.Using foul language calls upon Pagan deities (aka demons); Holy Spirit departs on seven meters. People who use drugs see demons who cleverly disguise themselves as ghosts and aliens.America will be last country to switch to Euro (antichrist's world currency). Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He'ssurrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher]. If you have a lot of nanochips in your forearm, then you will not be able to make proper Orthodox sign ofthe cross (last mercy for you will be to cut yourforearm off). Nanochips are sprayed by the gov't usingchemtrails; they're also in gov't food andmedicine; so, eat food from your own garden. In case garden is destroyed by ice from the sky, have chickens for eggs and goats for milk (Paisios). Lipstick contains cells of abortedfetuses, dog fat, and placenta; human fleshis in McDonalds, Pepsi, toothpaste, antiaging,anticancer, vaccines, perfume, etc.; that's why you should not be using anything that modern society has to offer. You're better off hiding within a 10-15 people group in order to escape Apocalypse. During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly. GabrielUrgebadze said thattheydoitonindexfingerwhenthey scan your finger. Basically, trytoavoidnewdocuments at all cost. Policewill microchip and isotope ray people on highways. Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement. That's why you should give back documents of your deceasedrelatives back to the gov't so that the gov't cancels these digital antichristiannames given during antibaptism by the beastsystem; or just burn thesedocumentsbecause gov't could get upset and could send demons to mark you because of this outright act of defiance. Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbrings them up alevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed). Feed thepigeons;when pigeons bowdown, people are savedfrom temporaryhell. It's a big sin to rememberthe deadwithwreaths (because demons put these wreaths on their necks if they're inhellwith theirwrists tied up behind their back while hanging by their wrists), meat,alcohol,sweets,andworldlymusic. Demons printiconsof saints/crosses/8sidedstarofTheotokosVirginMary in newspapers/products so that you throw these newspapers/products in the trashblasphemingthesesaints. Crosses on solesofshoesandbackofpants are blasphemy. Demons makecarpets with crosses and put them on sidewalks so that people walkoncrosses. Playingcards mockhow Jesus sufferedonthecross: clubs(cross on which Jesus wascrucified), diamonds (fournails Jesus was crucifiedwith), hearts (sponge with vinegar that Jesuswas given to drink),spades (spear with whichJesus waspierced).Cremationisdevilworship; onlyblasphemers suchasLenin should be burned; if Lenin is buried, earth will be polluted, and China will attack Russia because of this. AfterChinaattacksRussia, RuskiOrthodoxTsar (shown by resurrected SeraphimofSarov) willcome topowerinRussia;this Tsar will slay traitors insideChurch andgov't; asaresult, Russia will be the only country not under the antichrist.Ecumenism=263heresies;each heresy leads to hell. In 2006 in Moscow (that's why Moscow will sink),representatives from most religions signed a document where it says that all religions worship the same SupremeBeing [aka thedevil]. Priests who participate in ecumenism will have Pagans walking on theirheads in hell. ArkhimandriteAntoninKapustin left a prophecy that Church of All Russian Saints in Gorny Monastery, EinKarem, Israel will be blessed by forerunner of antichrist; pseudoPatriarchKirillofRussia and MarkofBerlin blessed thischurchin2007.

	49609 : ["You would probably get better IQ with the expensive Canon lens, not least because it is image-stabilized and can use AF, and the full-frame sensor will be less noise-prone. The image will just take up a smaller proportion of it than with the crop.  I've shot an eclipse on an old manual Tamron 500mm f8 mirror lens without any tracking gear, and I wish I'd practised more because the event is over so quickly!  Have a go at shooting the Moon with your Opteka on a sturdy tripod.   Visit stargazerslounge.com where you can discuss these topics with those in the know.", 6976, "UReKGnGXaa", 0],

HEIF has an advantage over JPEG with improved bit depth (renders intensity & colors in finer steps). However, not many viewing programs handle HEIF right now unless you're in the modern Apple world. HEIF, or AVCI, is a compressed format (information is lost) which means it is not as good as raw if you post-process your images.

	49613 : ["Select spot focus mode, focus on the person's eyes. Provide sympathetic lighting. 35mm is not perfect for portraits as it can make noses look too big. 55mm would be better. That, on your crop sensor, would be more like the ideal 80mm on a 35mm film camera.", 6978, "UReKGnGXaa", 0],
	49614 : ["Preferably use a tripod to hold the camera steady. Set up about 6ft / 2m away from the person/people; use appropriate zoom to get the overall view framing area you require. And focus - or use autofocus; if the persons face is filling a reasonable part of the image, it should autofocus easily. If using manual focus and you are not sure, adjust slightly either way until you get just noticeable blurring then set in the centre of that range. You can also take extra shots with the focus adjusted fractionally either side of that position and see which come out best. (Mine is a D5300, but I've never had a problem with focus on anything like that).", 6978, "T5MR7fNHaa", -1],
	49615 : ["Sorry for the novel of an answer, but I just wanted to be through. I wouldn't recommend it because it uses AA batteries.  You'll be going through batteries like they're going out of style.  I've seen a lot of cameras that run on AAs and none were any good.  They were slow: slow AF and a lot of lag between pressing the shutter button and actually taking the shot.  This will likely be very frustrating for anyone taking shots where timing is required or essential.  Nikon is a great brand.  The B500 is designed to look like a more \"professional\" camera with its shape similar to DSLRs that advanced and pro photographers use.  However, it is nothing more than a simple point-and-shoot camera in a fancy shell.  If Nikon only made cameras like the B500, it would not have the reputation that it does. The camera is designed for those who want a big range in the zoom because they shoot landscapes, people (e.g. portraits & candids, social events) and far off subjects.  The camera has a maximum focal length of 1,000mm (35mm equivalent) which is really desirable for those taking photos of things like surfers, baseball or soccer games, and birders like these types of super-zoom cameras a lot, too. Like any and all cameras, the B500 is designed for some types of shots and totally NOT designed for others.  Where the B500 really struggles is low-light shots without a flash.  The small 1/2.3\" sensor has very small pixels.  The smaller the pixel the less light it'll capture during any given exposure time.  This results in a poor signal which is a product of the light hitting the pixel and creating a voltage similar to how a solar panel works.  When the camera has a low signal it has to boost or amplify it.  The net result is a lot of noise even at low ISO settings like 400 which is an extremely common ISO to be used by anyone.  Now, if you only post to social media/the web and never make prints larger than about 4\"x6\", you really won't see the noise all that much.  Also, there are plenty of software options that will remove the noise.  Cameras have noise reduction built into them but they are not very good especially when compared to apps for your computer. I would strongly recommend that you get something else, save up for a better camera, or buy a high-end used camera especially if you don't need to photograph things that are far away, say, further than 20-30'.  Good places to find used gear is keh.com, adorama.com and bhphotovideo.com.  I've bought used lenses from keh and have had a good experience with them.  Both adorama and B&H are real camera stores in New York who've served pros and amateurs for nearly 50 years.   You can call them up and get more solid advice; something you can't do with amazon. Here's a link to B&H's used section showing cameras within your stated budget:  Here's a side-by-side comparison of the features of the B500 and a few used cameras that I found on B&H's used section that I think are worth considering:   The Panasonic is probably the best of the three for most casual shooters especially when you consider that it came out in 2019 and not 2016 like the B500 and the Sony in the link. They all have the small 1/2.3\" sensor, so image problems like noise and dynamic range is likely to be equal among them.  What really excited me about the Sony is it's 5-axis image stabilization which far, far better than what the B500 has.  Since your hands shake, I would definitely recommend the Sony for you. The Panasonic has image stabilization, too. If you're the type of person who would editing your images with software like Photoshop or Lightroom, you'll like the Panasonic because it shoots RAW images and not just JPEGs like the Sony and Nikon do.  The difference is that you will have vastly more tonal range with RAW files.  JPEGs only have 256 shades of color range, but RAW files out of the Panasonic go up to about 1,024.  This means you will have much better ability to brighten up dark/underexposed images or deep shadows. It also means you can bring down highlights that would otherwise be too bright.  You can do this with JPEGs but a much, much lower extent.  You can also fix any color issues with RAW files while you can't with JPEGs.  Of course, if your the type of person who'll doesn't want to edit images and just want to download and post, then this benefit of shoot RAW is not a big deal.  However, if or when you have an important image that you need to fix, you can do it with RAW files.  Often cameras will allow you to shoot both RAW and JPEGs files at the same time allowing you to have JPEGs to quickly upload and RAW files as a backup or when the JEGS didn't come out right (especially beneficial during special events) If you like video, the Panasonic shoots in 4K! The Panasonic also has a very good Lecia designed lens.  If you don't know, Leica is considered to be the Rolls Royce of cameras and lenses.", 6979, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],

	49621 : ["With a few exceptions, the cameras in smartphones all have a single wide-angle lens.  Wide-angle lenses produce a certain type of distortion to the perspective which makes people look ugly.  You can see the distortion in this link (for reference, smartphones use 24mm or 28mm lenses equivalent to the images in the link):   Shooting in the mirror reduces the distortion of the perspective which is why people take photos of their reflection.", 6966, "OczpbeMdaa", 1],

Or, learn to lean against walls, doors, fences etc. to minimise camera shake. If you got a stand-alone compact camera, would you be able to take it with you as well as your phone?  If yes, then the affordable 1\" sensor ones might suit you. Better still would be an entry level DSLR.", 6970, "UReKGnGXaa", 1],
