Answers for obvious answers. #2.  I am an atheist, and I can tell you that stopping your belief in God is not going to make you forget about your fellow man.  I find it insulting that you would think we are so debase that we don't give a **** about anyone else.  There goes that stereotypical Christian idea again that we Atheists don't care about anything at all.

Was it something you saw on TV or something that you read or heard?   I'm not saying go out in your pjs and feed people, lol, but maybe this is some sort of a calling.  Do you have a feeling that you are supposed to be doing something else or somewhere else, or are all these thoughts just fear??

After figuring it out, I would find more time for it in my life. Frankly, none of us should go to bed peacefully while 30,000 people die daily to starvation....however, if you are thinking about it constantly, maybe your heart/head is calling you to do something more than just think about it. <<nonbeliever; aid worker", 11127, "None", 1],

I know it seems important, but once the both of you lay eyes on that precious baby, it's not really going to matter if he or she has his skin or your darker skin.  I personally do not have any mixed babies (and I have four kids) but my second child was born darker than the others.  He is NOT Mixed.  He is completely caucasion, but I have been asked by many if he had a different father because he was more olive skinned than the rest of the family.  My husband at the time was, believe it or not, perfectly fine with it because he KNEW it was his child.  The thing you two need to remember is that no matter what that baby looks like, you created it out of love right?   although I don't have any kids with my second husband (who IS hispanic btw)  we do eventually plan on it.  Do you think I am worried about what the child looks like?  No way!!!!!  The fact of the matter is that regardless of what a child looks like, it has your genes and it feels your love.  The baby does not need to look like iether one of you to be loved by you, at least it shouldn't be anyway.   As far as his feelings go, you need to sit him down and talk to him.  Explain to him that his constantly saying that the baby will look black bothers you.  So what if it looks black?  Didn't he know when he was making love to you that you were dark skinned?  Yes he did.  If he didn't want a black baby, he should have thought about that before he got you pregnant.  If he can't accept this baby, regardless of looks, then he just isn't a good father or boyfriend.  Im sorry to say that, but if the skin color is the biggest thing for him, then he needs to grow up and learn what true unconditional love for a partner and a child means.", 11129, "None", 4],
