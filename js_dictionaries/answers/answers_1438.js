	77546 : ["find a time when both you and your parents are calm and willing to talk. Find a quiet place where you are unlikely to be disturbed. If you have brothers or sisters tell your parents you need to talk to them about something in private and ask them if they can tell your brothers or sisters to leave you all alone for a bit while you have a talk. You need privacy while talking to your parents so that they will actually listen instead of getting distracted plus they need to be calm and so do you so that they can think about it better. If they don't agree to talk to you the first time just keep asking then they will realise that whatever you want to talk about must be really bugging you and then they will talk to you. Once you've managed to find a quiet place and got your parents to agree to talk to you then start off by saying what you said on here then say \"you can call my bf's grandparents to check that I am actually going there\". Promise you will do your homework (if you have any) and be completely up to date with everything. If you need to do any chores or something like that, that night try making an agreement like I do with my mum. Just say if you let me go out I promise I will do (whatever it is you've gotta do) tomorrow and make sure you do otherwise you'll lose your parents trust. Say to them that they could use this as a sort of test to see if they can actually trust you to be back in time and not get into any trouble then if you succeed in this they can agree to let you go out on school nights more tell them if you don't succeed then they can make you stay in during school nights. If you really want to be able to go out then you will prove yourself to your parents and earn their trust to allow you to go out so if your that determined you won't need to worry about not suceeding then them not allowing you out ever again on school nights as you will succeed. Say to them that you'll have your phone on you at all times and they can call you any time they want. Say that this sort of thing could teach you about responsibility and say that this sort of thing could help with time mangement skills as you will learn how to keep with the time better and teach you how to be on time for stuff which will be really handy in the future and say that it will also teach you more independence which is also really helpful in life (yeah you may already be quite independent but wheres the harm in learning about it more? same goes with the time mangement and responsibility). However also make sure you ask your parents for their side of the story. Whatever there reasons are try to come up with some thing to say that will either assure them or get them to change their minds. This way they will apreicate that you wanted to listen to their side of the story instead of just wantin to say yours and expectin them to change their minds without them getting a say. Then say to them \"I'll leave you to think about it but please just think about what I've said\". This way you won't be forcing them at all. During the talk make sure you don't lose your temper if you feel like your going to just ask if you can take 5 minutes to calm down then go back to the talk. Hopefully after all this they will see how much you would like to go and how responsible you are being about it and because you have dealt with it like an adult then they will hopefully start to treat you more like an adult (even though your not legally one but if you act like one they you can be treated like one).  I'm 15 and this works nearly all the time for me. Sorry its so long but I couldn't miss one bit of detail. Good Luck", 8898, "EdfBkXCeaa", -1],

	77557 : ["YES YOU CAN.  well im a guy but when i started boxing i was 265, and now im down to 185.  it takes a lot of heart, dedication and the will to do whatever it takes to get healthy.  now if you want to go to tournaments and compete, then your trainer will help you get down to a good weight for you to fight at.  i don't know the type of gym this is, but im at a little ghetto one where the coach tells me what to do.  most likely they wont go too hard on you at first.  you will gradually get into harder exercises as you show progress.  and the trainer might individually teach you the proper technique behind punches, footwork, head-movement.  Boxing is a really great way to lose weight and get in shape.  and you'll get so much mental toughness from it (you'll see why) and also so much discipline.  oh and don't worry you'll get to do a lot of running ;)  the most important thing is to stay motivated, and think about being healthy.  have fun with boxing.  train hard and stay focused.", 8897, "d17P0ljRaa", 0],
	77558 : ["Doing nothing certainly won't help.  Go for it, darling.  If you're strong enough mentally, boxing will not only strengthen your body, but your mind and soul in way you haven't consider. One point of advice:  stop worrying about age and weight and height.  They are just numbers.  Just think about yourself in terms of stronger/weaker.  Go do the things that make you stronger, stop weighing yourself, and don't give a darn about what anyone else thinks or says.  Because I guarantee you, some people, sick people, want you to be weak, want you to be fat because it makes them feel strong. Good luck, and never stop getting stronger from this day forward.", 8897, "None", 1],

Maybe you could make a deal with them where you do x amount of homework after you get home and then stick to that.  If they see you're responsible with still doing the same amount of schoolwork, they might let you go out. Or they just get uncomfortable with you going out on your own because they can't control your every move and think you're going to do something bad.
