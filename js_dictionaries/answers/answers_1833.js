Unfortunately in this world people judge at face value and it can be difficult to be positive and give yourself the respect you deserve if you feel you don't get much positive attention from men. She can't be that ugly cos she has had 2 relationships. I think you need to try and explain to her that she is worth more than the attention that she wants to get from men.  We are born with this body but that is not who we are. Flesh and bones rot away but your soul goes on forever. That is who you really are.  What are her interests? what are her hobbies? maybe she needs to join a club or group where being the prettiest person isn't important. Something that she can do that will build her self esteem and meet new friends. Not everyone can be pretty,Intelligent and good at everything. she needs to find something that she can enjoy and then she may not be too bothered about her physical appearance.  Good Luck!", 9613, "suTGjIElaa", 1],
	97384 : ["Being physically ugly is usually a delusion. There are very few people who are truly ugly. I was bullied in school, too. It's about how you think of yourself inside that matters. Those guys, as you know, are only taking advantage of her. She may not be pretty, but is she really ugly? And, since she's hanging around with you and your friends, aren't they capable of seeing past that and seeing who she really is? That's what a real friend does. They could help boost her confidence to make friends of her own. I also think she needs psychological help. There are community mental health centers in most places that will help and charge what you can pay.", 9613, "Xpxev2yKaa", 1],
	97385 : ["Until I cured myself of anxiety through dietary means, sport was the outlet that lowered my energies to the point I was less dangerous. I always used sports in order to keep anxiety in check.  Which sport? Name it! I even let anxiety run my life to the point I chose the perfect career to earn money and keep myself out of harms way. For 15 years, I was a Drywall construction guy. $1000 per week and a free 8 hour a day cross training, aerobic exercise. I thought it was the perfect plan. and other sports included the obvious ones associated with people who are addictive in nature, have used for all time, running, weight training, karate, and many fun sports I had the good fortune to learn. I am an expert skier of any type; water, snow, and if it had a motor, I used it like a musical instrument; Jet ski, motorcycle, go cart, auto racing. Now that I have found the end of the well you tap when you push your body too physically far, I was forced to find out what was killing me. I kept my body in a 20 year \"celiac sprue\"( google the word). Doctors were ne help in identifying the very cause of the learning dysfunctions and hyper anxiety that came along with being smart and not being able to learn. So my long answers come down to a small story; Yes I have controlled the rage known to come with Asperger high functioning autism through excessive exercise. The foggy anxiety would only leave while endorpines were coarsing through my blood and brain, so I stayed there until I was too tired to cause trouble. Now that I have removed the allergen that has been killing my mental abilities, I have been shocked to find my stability sky rocketting and my anxiety so easily controlible, I have been trying to let the nations increasing mental dysfunction have the known cause. Our number one food group is the allergen that is known to cause most levels of anxiety dysfunction in wheat, rye, barley, malt and oat proteins known as gluten; the diet of the herbivore. In having spent little money, less than $200 US, I had the genetic test that tells you what your particular food allergen may be. I used Prometheus Labs in California to genetically identify whether I fit the profiles of the gluten intolerant. $100,000 and 20 years of suffering the potentially deadly auto immune reaction that even yale new Haven Hosptital is trained to avoid genetic testing. This 99.9% accurate and the only thing that in a court of law can free or condemn you, is not good enough for the practice of medicine when they can waste $99,800 to feed their families with. Me and my wife are gluten free. We try to tell the public of this aweful lie, but people cannot grasp the range of implications that wheat is the cause of the decline of the mental and physical health of the gluten intolerant pack human pack mammal species found through genetic testing of all Italies school children instituted by Dr. Alessio Fasano at the University of Maryland. Dr. Fasano is a doctor teacher in the fields of the most cutting edge of research being taught to our newer doctors now. My emails are open to questions. Warning; do not rely on current methods doctors say is \"Gold Bond\" I have failed both tests. The genetic test saved my life and my mind and marriage.", 9611, "None", 0],

	97402 : ["You could, but perhaps a better question is, Should you?  Students pay a lot of money to participate in college courses and many would be likely to resent the presence of a person who is not seriously interested in the course content. That said, there are alternatives. Some people get campus jobs, or jobs near the campus at places student frequent, so that they can enjoy the academic environment without enrolling in classes.   If you are really just looking for social opportunities outside of the typical bar scene, the public schools in many areas offer Adult Education classes that are more for pleasure and interest than for serious study. They are much less expensive than college tuition.  Community centers and some specialty stores also offer mini-courses for a very small fee. Good luck!  (P.S.
