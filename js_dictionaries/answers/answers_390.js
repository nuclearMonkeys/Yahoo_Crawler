The generator detects the load and either increases RPMÂ  or decreases RPM to supply the amount of wattage needed to power whatever is plugged into it. It had a maximum wattage rating.

	21239 : ["Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport to its planned destination, Beijing Capital International Airport. The crew of the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft last communicated with air traffic control around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea. The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later but was tracked by military radar for another hour, deviating westwards from its planned flight path, crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea. It left radar range 200 nautical miles northwest of Penang Island in northwestern Peninsular Malaysia. With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead, the disappearance of Flight 370 was the deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the deadliest in Malaysia Airlines' history until it was surpassed in both regards by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down while flying over conflict-stricken eastern Ukraine four months later. The combined loss caused significant financial problems for Malaysia Airlines, which was renationalised by the Malaysian government in December 2014.", 3457, "IE2jIhg7aa", 0],
	21240 : ["This information may or may not be true.Â  I saw on a TV show that the pilot had a flight simulator set up at his home.Â  Also there was a mission retained in the computer memory of practicing a flight exactly like the MH 370 path.Â  It was specifically designed to avoid certain radar coverage areas.Â Â  If true it shows the pilot intended to take the plane by a disguised path to a certain area of the ocean.Â  This could be where recovery of debris and data recorders would be impossible to find.Â  I guess he forgot about the information link by satellite at regular intervals back to the corporate office.Â  That gave good clues as to what had been done.", 3457, "2yFSkim8aa", -1],
	21241 : ["I damned near walked into the tail rotor of a chopper...I was coming in from an oil rig after being out at sea for months and my mind wasn't on what I was doing. So yes, it happens.

	21245 : ["You're clearly not a pilot because airline pilots would Â NEVER deliberately stall except when learning to fly. During normal flight they have to alter the altitude of the aeroplane a number times.

	21246 : ["Trust me, that's not what's happening. If the plane dips down, it's because of wind or changes in air pressure. They don't shut off engines to save gas. That's just ridiculous.Â ", 3444, "None", 4],

The Renault ( exactly where you wouldn't go for reliability ) engine is Â poor and underpowered though 130bhp from 2.8 litres is quite high bhp / litre for the USA.Â  Stainless steel body work a great idea, except it shows everyone's finger prints (people will want to touch it all the time) and difficult to repair. Like any classic car , basket cases are cheap , but rarely worth the effort and fully restored are stupid money.
