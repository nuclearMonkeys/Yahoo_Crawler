They need a lot of exercise and if you are a runner who wants a companion they are great. They are generally a teddy bear. They are not a dog who likes to stand still. They are social animals wanting to meet other dogs regularly. I read a book once that said a Husky can learn anything that he wants to and likes. Variety is good for a husky. I have a Heeler /Husky mix and love her too death. We do make sure she has the newness that both Heelers and Huskies like. Always taking her new places with us.

My oldest dog is a german Shepherd/husky mix and is a sweety, she loves people and always has her nose to the ground.  but that was after hours and hours of hard work by 7 people. Huskies are brilliant dogs and need new activities so they won't get bored (that's what causes those destructive behaviors everyone always yells at their dogs for).  every dog needs to learn the house rules their own way with LOTS of patience and rewards (don't reward bad behavior, try taking them out for a run if they seem restless or bored, i find kongs to work well with all three of my dogs). by the way- i think the name is brilliant, very unique. have fun =)", 9384, "c939b935f8a82833428d4c8fc13e9cd6aa", 1],

That said, it's an ethical matter – you hired, you should try to pay.  I suggest making the $600 offer, if that's what you have now, then creating a payment plan of, say, $100 a month for the next 11 months.  If you choose to offer less, I think that's OK, but don't demand it.

You put the dog on a leash and put the leash around your ankle...wherever you goes, the dog goes and eventually, you can take the dog off for longer and longer periods of time... this works (as far as i understand) because in the end, you could be across the room and the dog will still think s/he is attached to you, therefore deterring any errant behaviour..  if you stick with it, are firm and keep a calm, but assertive, \"pack leader\" mentality, you will have your little terror :-) trained in no time!
