	2717 : ["The majority of COVID-19–associated deaths occur in older people. Africa has a comparatively young population, with a median population age of 19.7 years for the continent versus 38.6 years for the United States.", 435, "HhZT5dqFaa", 0],
	2718 : ["First of all, it is not, as it was first often said, because they don't count (that would be a valid reason for North Korean). But African countries are poor, sure, but not completely devoid of medicine. Plus, NGO count, not exhaustively, sure. But statistically, we can deduce what real covid death rate is, and clearly, Africa's death rate are way below Europa or America's. Several reasons: * Lot of them are quite isolated. Far less international flight, international exchange. And even domestic exchange. In lot of countries, outside the capital and a few big cities, there are a lot of remote places. They are not cut of the world, sure. But, well, they don't have dozens of huge LA, NY, Chicago, Houston or Atlanta airports. So less exchange. * It is not directly because virus hate the heat (if that were true, then, there pandemic would have died in Florida and California. But, virus don't like UV. Not that there are more of them in Africa (again, compared to California or Florida). But you find more of those outside. And people in Africa tend to have more outside activities. They don't pack that much in bars and discotheques (and that is where real link with heat is: respiratory virus prefer winter, because in winter people tends to have more indoor activity. And virus, even with masks, spread indoor.) * Africa's population is WAY younger than European or American. So that impact directly death rate, obviously. Lot of African countries have a median age between 15 (for example Niger) and 18 (Ivory coast). So that mean that more than half of the population are teenagers or younger. Death rate among those is near 0. People over 65 in Burundi are 2.69% of the population. It Italy 22%. And most of people who die of covid are over 65. It doesn't impact that much infection rate, of course (well, a little also. But this time, it is probably because teenager barely realize that they are sick, so they don't even get tested). (Keep in mind that this is not a general rule. People can die of covid at any age. Even among people of age 20, mortality statistics show than 2020 is a record year. And that is certainly because of covid. So, I am not claiming at all that young person are immune to covid. Just that, on the statistics, obviously, it reduce a lot the death rate) * I know that lot of American people see Africa as a quasi-anarchy. But, first of all, they are many different countries in Africa. TV always talk about those in civil unrest. But most of Africans live in peaceful time. And with some rule of law. Plus, they saw what happened to our medical system in Europe. They know that if our medical system collapsed, their would to surely do so also. So, they were far more disciplined than Americans to keep themselves safe (only in America you can find people to politicize such an obvious an simple measure such as a mask). Plus, in some of those countries, they are more used to authoritative, strict measure. And don't want to mess up with their Police. So, I am pretty sure that it is hard to hear for American ears, but well, yes, Africans just did a better job than you did in the pandemic management. (but that is only one of the reasons. Even African countries who had a poor pandemic management —there are some— were less impacted, because of the 3 other reasons). So, it is not because of heat (if it were, then the virus would have gone away, in April, like a miracle. It did not, as you are aware). But because of the combination of those factors: less population exchange, less indoor activities, younger people, and better management, better elementary precautions.", 435, "d3cd3e0f2e8feaaff79363574632bf96aa", 1],

The division between Europe and Asia as two continents is a historical social construct, as they have no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six, five, or four continents on Earth.", 429, "HhZT5dqFaa", -3],
	2729 : ["Agreed that the division between Europe and Asia is political rather than physical, but what a difference Europe has made to the world in the last 500 years. No designation on Earth is totally 'pure', without reference to human activity. Back nearly 2,000 years ago, one division would have been 'The Roman Empire', which stretched from the Middle East to the Atlantic coast, from North Africa to northern Europe including much of Britain.  At that time everyone acknowledged that the area was one contiguous area under one single political system.  The Mongol Empire for a while controlled much of northern and eastern Asia, and very nearly ended up controlling much of Europe.  It was the biggest land empire within a single border that has ever existed.    North and South America are connected, by a narrow strip of land, barely 40 miles wide at its narrowest in Panama - but they are connected.  The Panama Canal does not constitute an interruption of that connection.  There is no sea level flow of water between the Atlantic and the Pacific, though the French under the leadership of de Lesseps were trying to dig a sea level canal, which nearly bankrupted France in the attempt.  American army engineers and President Roosevelt more sensibly decided to settle for a canal whose highest level is 85 feet above sea level.  My grandmother traversed that canal in the1920s on a passenger ship, as I did in 1975. There is no doubting those sets of locks at each end of the canal!   Put it another way, there has not even been the Panama Canal for most of the history of the USA, which in itself is a minute fraction of the geological history of the Americas, even a very small portion of the human history of the Americas (approx 16,000 years long). You could also argue against the border between Africa and Asia (Is Egypt in Africa or the Middle East? Politically it is both), but that border has truly been marked by the sea-level Suez Canal - successfully overseen by de Lesseps and opened in 1869. Note to Phil: Iceland sits across the division between the North American and the Eurasian continental plates, which is why Iceland has hot springs, geysers, and active volcanoes.", 429, "None", -3],
