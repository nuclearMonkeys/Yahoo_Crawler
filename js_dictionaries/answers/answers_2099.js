	110748 : ["Our ability to look upon our surroundings and utilise rhythmical events to gauge the course of our actions is in its most basic sense; our ability to decipher the difference between night and day. Most species therefore are in some way, shape or form aware of the concept of time. Without this familiarisation living would be very difficult for creatures who need to hunt at certain times, dig burrows at certain times, avoid capture at certain times etc. Of course there is the argument that instinct is the only thing that guides these animals sense of timing and therefore it is not a conciously defined concept. However, the modern human concept has evolved gradually from that primitive state and therefore it is very difficult to pinpoint a time when this modern concept became so. We know that early religious shrines show evidence that peoples observation of the sun, moon and stars has been quite sophisticated for maybe 8000 years or more. It seems that these early forms of civilization had a fixation on their ability to count time via these celestial means. The neccessity for such behaviour is apparent in any form of civilized life. Work needs to be done, future events need to be organized and past needs to be remembered. The birth of civilization was largely due to the invention of organised agriculture. Mans ability to effectively utilise crops and animals were dependant on his ability to understand time. The seasons needed to be understood in order for success. Ability to predict future events is dependant on the individuals ability to understand timing. Man has constantly needed to redefine and refine his concept of time based upon the knowledge of the day and sometimes the accuracy of his clock. If time only exists as a concept then that concept is still applicable to our surroundings. However whether time itself is a real 'entity' is kind of an irrelevant question for us as we cannot escape the reality of our mortality on this earth. What we seem to know is that causes always precede effects; all actions have reactions. So to answer this question accurately the question may need to be asked in such a manner as defining a specific concept of time as a general concept may have existed in the minds of individuals for untold eons. Like all good concepts, the concept of time evolved into being over time[ironically] and from neccessity to regulate and refine the compromise of how we apply our energies to the ever changing world around us.", 10151, "cBhCnR4Zaa", 0],
