	14265 : ["Do you mean \"save\" instead of \"give\"?  To \"save\" in English is to put away for later.  To \"give\" is to make a present of something and it no longer belongs to you.   To not count my pension I have saved enough money for all expenses for three months, perhaps a little longer, if I spend exactly as much as in normal times.  If I had a problem I would make my expenses as small as possible.  Then it will last longer, maybe double.  I have also, over many years built up a surplus of long-lasting food stuffs so that in an emergency I know I can eat and fed my family. You cannot save a whole month's salary or more immediately.  It takes time.  You calculate the expenses you must meet and then look at the sum you have left over.  A portion of this you must save, but not all if possible.  It is easier to save if you do not have the temptation to touch the saving.  When you have decided on the the sum you will save you must put it in the bank immediately and in your mind treat it as money spent.  In everyday life you must forget about it.  You should also not discuss your your savings or family will put pressure on you to spend it before it can accumulate.  The savings are for safety, there is almost nothing you should spend it on that is not an emergency. This is why family should not know about it because it is easier to pressure someone else to spend their savings when it is not an emergency than your own savings.   Little by little your savings will grow.  Any extra money should also be saved, or at least a portion should be saved.", 2394, "None", 0],

	14267 : ["LDR does not make people act like you do. I'd guess you act like this because you are insecure in this relationship. Why did you text at 11pm and call at 12pm?  That comes off really needy. We have no idea when the last time you interacted with him before 11pm.  So what if he saw your text/call.  Does he need to respond immediately?  I don't think so. You have given us no context to determine what is reasonable.  But if you don't hear from him by 11pm tonight, then you may have cause for concern.  Allow him to be the initiator sometimes. Yahoo!
