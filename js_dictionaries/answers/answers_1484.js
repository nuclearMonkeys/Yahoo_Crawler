A year back I had posted a similar type of question to yahoo answers (though i didn't get any satisfying reply).

I think , If i tell u hoe, then it might help u. Try to think and analyse what u feel are the best qualities of the people surrounding u. I know u feel that u are better than them- but look again, u might find something new. Try to talk chrmingly and always hold a friendly smile on ur face. Initially u might feel awkward but I am sure with the passage of time it will help u to tide over several difficult situations. Secondly, we often tend to overlook some of our closest friends. Beware of that. Lastly, belive in God, write a diary (that will help u - try to wrtite the things as if u are talking to a sweet girl u always wished to have), take up the tasks u are afraid of doing ( try to be a braveheart).................

Genesis 1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. Genesis 1;22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.    God created the Chicken before the egg. The chicken was to be fruitful and multiply and that means lay eggs. Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  God first made our spirits in the image of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Notice it says \"IN OUR IMAGE\" Genesis 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.  Genesis 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. Genesis 2:21-22 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;  deep sleep Gen 15:12    22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  God blessed you with a child that He intrusted you to raise it up to live according to the word of God.
