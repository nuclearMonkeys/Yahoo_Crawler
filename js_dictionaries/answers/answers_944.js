	52650 : ["Atlantis is probably nothing more than a myth. The only person to ever mention it was Plato. He heard about it from an Athenian lawyer, who heard about it from an Egyptian priest.  That's really not much to rely on. And he said Atlantis existed 9000 years before his own time. There would have been no way he could have known of such a place.", 7383, "HhZT5dqFaa", 1],
	52651 : ["So far there has been no evidence indicating that there is a sunken continent in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  If Atlantis did exist then the most likely location is the southwestern coast of Spain or Portugal.  The sinking of Atlantis in a day and a night suggests that the cause was an earthquake which caused a  tsunami. Another possibility is that a landslide in the Canary Islands caused a tsunami.  Other than what Plato wrote there is, so far no other historical records to support the existence of Atlantis.  Maybe Atlantis existed, maybe it didn't.  People thought the Trojan War was a myth until Schliemann uncovered Troy so who knows what may be discovered in the future.   Personally I like to think Atlantis did exist but am not a fanatic about its existence. ", 7383, "6Whuc4WXaa", 1],

	52671 : ["AncestryDNA is about as good as it gets. It is probably better than Ancestry.com When you submit your DNA you get better results as far as ethnicity, discover/find unknown siblings or that your parent is not your biological parent, etc.", 7387, "None", 0],
	52672 : ["If you are talking about their DNA test, yes, it's pretty accurate.  It's just that people don't know how how to interpret their results.  Keep these 4 things in mind... 1.  Even though you inherit 50% of your DNA from each parent.  You do NOT inherit 25% from each grandparent.  Your parent passes on an unequal proportion to you.  That means that your mom might pass along more DNA from her mom than from her dad.  So you could have 48% of your DNA from your maternal grandmother and only 2% from your maternal grandfather.   That's just an extreme example, but it is possible.  It means if you grandfather was Irish you probably think you are 25% Irish.  But if you only inherited 2% of your DNA from him, then you will only show 2% Irish.  But your sibling might actually show 30% Irish.   2.  People have been moving around the globe for thousands of years.  Just because someone is from Ireland and they don't know of any other ancestry, does not mean they are a 100% Irish.  Genetically, the average Polish person, for example, is only 60% Polish.  In Eastern Poland, the people are actually descended from Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Belarusians so many people from Eastern Poland are only 5-10% Polish. 3.  People often lie in order to cover up ancestries that they do not like or that are in conflict with what they identify with.  Parents from Poland who speak Polish and celebrate Polish culture might never tell their children that their grandparents were actually German.  Sometimes the lies are so far back, no one knows. 4.  Also, in any scientific testing there is a margin of error between 5-10%.  So any ethnicity that shows up less than 5% on your DNA I wouldn't even consider to be my ethnicity. The bottom line is that ethnicity for the most part is made up.  On the last census I put my ethnicity as \"American\".  People will say, there's no such thing because everyone comes from somewhere else.  But that's true for the entire world, people have been moving around for generations. Use your DNA results for fun or as a guide to what you already know.  But don't take it so seriously that you changed how you identify yourself.  To me, your ethnicity is the language you speak, the food you eat, the traditions that you follow and most of all, how people perceive you once you leave your home country. If you are an \"American\" who doesn't identify your ethnicity as \"American\", you say you are half Italian, 1/4 Irish, 1/4 Swedish, etc.  Ask yourself, if you were travelling to England, France or Italy what would they see you as, how would they call you?  The answer is most definitely \"American\".", 7387, "None", 2],

Official records such as census records, marriage and death certificates, and ship records can be considered accurate, although they are subject to human error and misspellings.

This year, The close relationships I value feel so near to me and so precious to me especially the way I always connect with my Creator and His beloved Master Habibullah, peace and blessings be upon him, even though I am so busy this year so busy and have my own trials to deal with. What makes me feel very good is something my Creator has said or something my Creator loves and something that makes Him happy. I occasionally answer a question or two around here. The special situations God Almighty has put me in couple of years ago helped me realize the Beauty of my Allah and I've learned His Mercy is His most beautiful quality to me even though He is the One who is full of Beauty, Al-Jamil. I've also discovered His extreme Generosity in the way I connect with my Creator and He gave me more than I've asked from Him and I've learned what makes The Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, the happiest and that is when a human servant sincerely prostrates to Him alone. Ar-Rahman is the only one that can make me feel very emotional and connected whenever I think of my Creator and connecting with Him during prayer. The Qualities of my Lord make me feel so good and its a good thing to remember the Creator's qualities in order to have close trust in Him and the kind of intimacy that helps a believer have strong faith and without doubts whatever regardless the kind of situation one deals with in life. It is very exciting and feels very good when your Creator helps you remember Him and helps you acknowledge Him more than ever and I believe that is His love for the servant He helped remember Him. If Ar-Rahman helps you remember Him, know it is the expression of His intense love and invitation to closeness to Him.", 7385, "NX7SgWWcaa", -1],

Probably, stigmata = similar thing as bleeding walls. Buddhists have 12 ranks; 11th ranked monk can call demon Mina to approach to move things; to a naked eye it will appear as if things are moving by themselves (but it's the demon who's doing it). If you place an Orthodox Christian item into the hand of this 11th ranked Buddhist monk, then demon Mina will not approach. Mina = means land mine to blow things up in Russian; when used as an idiom it means to make a weird face or to take a dump (no shyt that a demon would be called that; kal means feces as a Russian medical term...so, is Pagan goddess Kali = demon shyt too?). Bible says in Russian Psalm 95 (English it's 96) that all Pagan deities are demons. Jesus tells Jews that their father is the devil. Jesus tells to treat heretics as Pagans. So, Orthodoxy is the only true faith; heretics worship demons by default. Heresy is always subtle; it's very easy to fall into one. Major heresies today are: 1)ecumenism (263 heresies combined into one); 2) COVID heresy (like dipping church spoon into alcohol which is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit); 3)modern documents are from Satan (burn them before or when you hid within a 10-15 people group to escape the unforgivable mark of the beast)...electronics will be used to track you (and to show the antichrist on broken unplugged 1970 TV set using Tesla's ether)... 4)Kosher = sprinkled with blood; 5)yeast = grown on pig bacteria; 6)barcode = Druid black magic curse; 7) QRcode = ancient Mayan curse; 8)electricity in church ... use only wax candles...9) not praying for future Ruski Orthodox tsar (who will be shown by resurrected saint Seraphim of Sarov) who will fight the antichrist; 10)living in multi-storied buildings and having bathrooms inside your home (instead of having them outside your home); 11)living in cities instead of living in small self-sufficient villages surrounded by holy water so that a 666ed person can't get in (all clean water becomes holy on midnight from January 18 to January 19; get this water to at least encircle your small dwelling ...12)problems associated with big cities (like gambling, prostitution, alcohol, drugs, cigars/cigarettes, etc.) 13)eating shyt food (Pepsi has cells of aborted; Coke has roaches; McDonalds doesn't rot and has nanoparts and may contain human flesh if Rabbi Finklestein's revelation is true; makeup has cells of aborted, dog fat, and placenta)...forgive me..", 7392, "None", 0],
