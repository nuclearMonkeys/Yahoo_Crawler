Ask one \"If he was the other guard, which door would he tell you to take.\" The answer is always the lie, you take the other one. There are, basically, two possibilities. If the man picks the truthful guard, he (the guard) will think this way: \"I know that door A leads to life. I also know that my colleague always lies. So, if the man asks him, he will inevitably point to door B. I always tell the truth, so I will point to door B, as that will be the truthful answer to the question.\" If the man picks the liar, he will reason this way: \"I know that door A leads to life. My colleague also knows that door A leads to life. My colleague always tells the truth, so if the man asked him, he would truthfully point to A. I, however, am a pathalogical liar, so I will claim that my colleague would indicate door B.\"", 8605, "None", -1],
