A lot of things affect this: level of hydration/dehydration and level of electrolytes are very key. Dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance can definitely screw up a BIA measurement!  BIAs can offer a sort of estimation of body fat, but a very rough one at that. A much better way to get a good body fat measurement is to have a professional measure it using a \"pinch test\" with calipers. You can often find a person who can do this at your local gym/fitness center. Make sure the person knows what they're doing, as human error in this test can also be as high as 10%. side note: he DID mean 2300 kcals. \"Calories\" with a capital \"c\" means kcals, so...  2300 kcals = 2300 Calories = 23,000 calories.  When we refer to calories in a food sense we always use Calories as standard (notice the capital C in Calories on nutrition labels). The difference becomes an issue only in physics, where calories is a unit of measure for energy. As far as physics is concerned, we are expected to eat about 20,000 calories in a day. As far as the FDA is concerned, we're supposed to eat about 2,000 Calories a day.  Just wanted to clear that up.", 10761, "NGfbWhQkaa", 0],

If you plug in another router behind your gateway router, then anything you plug into the new router will use the new router as the gateway. You CAN configure your second router to be an ethernet switch essentially but switches are cheaper and require ZERO know how on how to install them. Ethernet switches are incredibly common.

I prefer a long rod rotating in the x-y plane and viewed from the z plane. Each differential volume as we move from the center must increase it's tangential velocity. As a result of the tangential velocity, Spacetime dilated in the direction of rotation. Viewed from the z axis the rod must appear to bend or curve into an S shape.

IEEE 802.11 is the industry standard for wireless connections and is what handles multiple connections over the same channel.  Most devices can handle 30 or more clients. 802.11n introduced MIMO, which allows for the use of multiple antennas so that there is more bandwidth (for streaming HD video and such) which has nothing to do with the number of connections possible. The way it actually works is the workstation will send the router a \"RTS\" or \"request to send\" frame to the WAP (wireless access point) when it detects some availability on the network.  Then the WAP will respond with a \"CTS\" or \"clear to send\" frame to the workstation and the data will then proceed.  This happens many times a second for each connection. For a really complex explanation, check Page 6 out in this document: To correct Mav: Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing is used to decide what parts of the frequency range are to be used and what is to be ignored and has nothing to do with enabling multiple clients over same connection to a single WAP.", 10764, "mwBYjuFXaa", 0],

To prove that something is true, people do experiments, collect data, analyze the data, graph the data, and finally make a statement that they believe is supported by all the prior steps of this process. As they do the experiments, they record information. This information comes from their observations and information collected by machines. The people and the machines observe and measure changes that occur.    All people and machines exist on this planet. Whatever is being observed also exists on this planet. All that exists on this planet is either matter or electromagnetic radiation (energy). All matter has length, width, and height, 3 dimensions. These 3 dimensions determine the space that matter occupies.  Electromagnetic radiation has no dimensions, because it does not occupy space.  To observe a change, time must exist. If a change occurred, the nanosecond hand on the clock must have moved. Light is always moving. If a change occurred, a process happened. A process has at least 1 step. For that 1 step to occur, time must exist. BUT, TIME IS NOT A DIMENSION! Time is the tool that we use to measure changes that occur in this 3 dimensional Universe.", 10760, "CuhZMDPhaa", 0],
