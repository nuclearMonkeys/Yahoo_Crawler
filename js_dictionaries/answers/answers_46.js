Blind testing under random situations for most situations in the young is rarely fruitful in picking up anything that can change outcome with regards to common diseases but there are exceptions below.  One wants to keep an eye on family histories of any diseases because some are genetic and so one needs to look at that then see if one is genetically susceptible to the same disease. That applies to some cancers like breast etc. There's some biochemical abnormalities also like cholesterol and lipids. If one doesn't have any such histories then you can go on your way but keep an eye on routine screening guidelines like Pap smears.

How would they actually know if you're gay? They don't and they don't care.

That's because the vast majority of HIV cases in the US are still spread by male-male sex. They also ask about other disease risks such as whether you recently got a tattoo or traveled where malaria is common.  They don't verify your answers.

It will be a new one with all of the new mutants covered but it will be new and so your objections will be the same with any new vaccine.

All that means it that you have reduced red blood cells that carry oxygen and if you don't have enough then it can lead to symptoms and confusion can be one of them. He said you have a low iron content in your blood which is the source of your anemia. The way one gets that way is by the loss of blood. Blood or red blood cells are the bodies main source of iron. If you lose blood then you lose iron and over time you become iron deficient and then anemic. The source of the blood loss needs to be determined and the most common one is excessive menstrual blood loss. They should check for things down there like cysts. Things need to be monitored in the future. In the meantime you need to correct the iron loss by taking iron in the form of medications.

Because it is probably from so low down in your GI tract it is almost certain to be something benign. It is quite possibly haemorrhoids.

It is the same thing with COVID or any other test for infectious diseases. It is common for HIV patients to have less than 40 copies per ml on antiviral treatment. Some go down to 20 copies per ml. It doesn't mean they don't have any only that they are less than 40 bringing attention that the test is not sensitive in detecting down to zero virus particles.  Gays are a high risk group for transmission based on sexual practices. Seminal fluid has a very high concentration of the virus compared to vaginal fluids and so infected males are the predominant spreaders of the disease. It is almost unheard of for gay females transmitting HIV among themselves. The risk group is the male gay population and female sex workers.
