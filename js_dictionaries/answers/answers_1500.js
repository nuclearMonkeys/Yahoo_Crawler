Check it: I ride a bicycle to work each day. At 16 miles/day that would be roughly $4.00 per day for gas- an average of 20 work days a month -so there's $80.00 right there saved. Throw in parking @ $120/mo. and insurance another $120/mo. and really I am saving $320 per month... oh wait - if I drove a car, I'd need another car in the family so... a car payment of $240 per month - now that's roughly $560.00 saved per month!!! No Gym membership is needed - I ride instead - so not only do I save time and gas getting to the gym - that's another $50. Total savings: $610.00/per month - that's just money in my pocket. These are averages of course - gas could be more expensive, I might eat more food, etc. but I think it's pretty close.", 9037, "NEuvQwMDaa", 0],

I do type out long answers though:   I think the better choices would be:  - Lose pts. for reporting people - Lose pts. for thumbs downing - Lose pts. if they win an appeal I think that would handle the issue of report monkeys a lot better.  Pastes aren't as annoying as when you spend 20 minutes trying to answer a question and it gets reported.  You don't have to read pastes, I just thumbs down them to minimize.  I agree it gets annoying when it's an obvious paste.  But how are you going to define what's a paste and what's a typed answer?  That would be the problem with enforcing this.  That gives report monkeys more fuel for the fire. People are losing accounts left and right: Enforcing something like this would definitely mean anyone who types something long gets reported too.

Some people can still get around and do things even though terminally ill, others are already too ill to move around and are bed-ridden and unable to think clearly.

	80673 : ["I think on a planet like this, inhabited by a species like this, war is inevitable.  For most of human existence, any tribe that could not or did not fight was quickly conquered by it's neighbors and their menfolk either enslaved or genocided.  Their females had the option of surviving as body-slaves of the conquerors.  We are all the descendents of men who chose to kill and women who chose to live. That having been said, the majority of wars in the modern age are grotesque frauds that have nothing to do with tribal survival.  Most countries, and all of the major warmaking states, are pathocracies.   A \"pathocracy\" is a state governed by a small clique whose psychology is basically criminal.

In the Philippines, whenever I watch the news about our troops combating the insurgents in the southern regions of our islands, it hurts for me to see them endure suffering and sacrifice when their commanders are in the safety of their homes. I am a reserved officer and I know the horrors of war. But sometimes we need war to protect ourselves and retain our sovereignty as a nation.

Even in horrific times like World War 2 I believe that there would have been better solutions. 60 million people died during  World War 2 and so many of those people were innocent civilians. Even if we ever got into that situation again I would refuse to take part in war. Instead I would risk my life to protect people in other ways, like underground evacuations of civilians, helping the wounded in war zones and building shelters for people. I would never take another human life though. The idea that war is sometimes necessary is a myth, war only leads to cumulative suffering and is never the answer. However the real answer is one people don't want to hear because it requires sacrifice. The real answer to world peace is through abstinence of violence. I don't expect anyone to defend me. If disarmament and demilitarization leads to a terrorist coming into my house then so be it. At least then I can defend myself and not hide behind someone else to defend me.

I've seen it several times and still watch it occasionally. Cowboy Bebop is a musically driven space spaghetti western.  Set in the future under a new bounty system, this one is very well done. Bleach is a still-running show that is now airing on Cartoon Network (in English, unfortunately).  It is an action series with some really good storylines. Lupin the 3rd is a very old series, and I honestly preferred the voicing in English to the Japanese.  Still, it's a classic about a thief who always manages to get himself into and out of humorous situations. Love Hina is also a good choice.  Set in modern Japan (helps with the culture when you watch a real-life anime), it's the story of a college hopeful who unwittingly becomes the manager of his grandmother's dorm for girls. Fullmetal Alchemist is a popular anime about two brothers who use alchemy (a form of magic in this setting) in an attempt to restore their bodies to their original forms, which were lost when the brothers attempted a taboo alchemy.
