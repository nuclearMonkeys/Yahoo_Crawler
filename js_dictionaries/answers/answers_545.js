	30305 : ["I don't believe he will find a job after you're pregnant if he's refusing to go get one now! That's like a drug addict promising to get clean IF their gf gets pregnant. It's BS. In my little town, fast food places are hiring in new employees at $13-15 an hour. I'm sure that wage would come in handy and it does not require a glowing resume of learned skills or a long steady employment history. Absolutely refuse to get pregnant until he's worked steady for a minimum of one year. He'd better get busy! \"I was the only one working\". That's past tense. Are you working now? If not, why not? ", 4671, "bjv00RoZaa", 2],
	30306 : ["It would appear that you didn't  really get to know him (his true  inner character) before getting  married to him. Regardless, he  has made it clear that he doesn't  love you enough to put in any  effort, and is even so lazy that  he will make YOU do the work  of ending the relationship. May  as well not disappoint him...  go ahead and GO. ", 4671, "tU5NJVL3aa", 2],
	30307 : ["I take it that your lazy *** doesn't work either?! Better stick with the one who feeds you! Then again, you best hope is that he never finds out that you're a no good cheat because then your lazy *** will be getting a job and divorced in short order!", 4672, "None", 1],

	30311 : ["I have considered counselling others.  After 50 wonderful and happy years I think I have something to offer.  But those who need it most won't listen.  That is why they need the counselling.  In general those who will listen don't really need to.", 4673, "Y1NTL6p2aa", 0],
	30312 : ["We tried it. My (ex) wife lied, the counselors believed her and openly accused me of lying. My ex wife even had affairs with two of them. One of them lied in court supporting her, even though we had hard evidence supporting my claims. I've never seen counseling wok long term. If you need counseling I think it's already too late. Don't put it off. Go ahead and start the divorce. It doesn't get easier if you wait.", 4673, "xQKbxhzwaa", 0],

	30314 : ["You can NEVER be emotionally  fulfilling to someone like that. No  matter what or how much you do,  it will never be enough, or just not  quite what they imagine they need...  or he is simply just lying to you and  turning things around in order to not  take responsibility for his actions.  Either way, your next step should  be to get rid of him... you deserve  someone much better in your life. ", 4674, "tU5NJVL3aa", 3],

	30329 : ["Your chosen bride's maid is a looney. I don't know where she got all her ideas, I've never heard of them before. Plus, its not her role to micromanage YOUR wedding.

	30330 : ["You need either to have good reason, which your beloved probably does not have, or to be just emotionally poor and narrow-minded person who easily throws loud words about love and hate, without thinking about their meaning and not even having a clue of what it is. And, if your brother did not offend the honor and dignity of your beloved, if there were no conflicts between them, on the basis of which one can begin to treat each other with outright hostility, then, I am afraid, your girl is simply too young and not far off and such demonstrations of \"hatred\" trying to somehow fill his own worth, for lack of other talents and merits We gotta talk!, ", 4659, "None", 0],

	30332 : ["Truth be told, you won't be that close to your friends, or most of them, as time goes on. You all will be busy with your own lives. Are you having her do anything at your wedding? Truth again be told, your sisters in law may not be your sisters in law in 5 or 10 years. My sister in law was my matron of honor. I had no sisters.

	30334 : ["i disagree with some of these answers. I'm 22 and personally I couldn't bare the thought of being in your position (no offence) so to cope at 19 i started seeing escorts on a regular. just to sort of get used to a somewhat sex life? you have to realise that's all it is. sex. like literally putting your pants on. people just get used to it and don't think about it after a while. thats why people are saying you'll be highly disappointed in your experience. especially if you get nervous nor hesitant in the activity of your first time especially at that age. you have no idea how you'll perform or what you'll actually like or don't like in reality. you'll learn that the hard way but escorts are a necessary in my opinion if you have never have had sex. not because you are entitled to it but for your mental health. this is why i strongly support sex workers who are passionate about it", 4677, "HvuHvcQqaa", 4],

	30338 : ["Your husband is a bigger idiot than the spitefull witch. HE NEEDS to be a man and set her straight or boycott this wedding and ALL events that exclude you. EeffingNOUGH ALREADY! I would not allow her to gaslight me even one mor e time. She knows she is upsetting you while getting perverse pleasure out of it. Your husband is a wussy! Sorry! You are a saint to put up with herBullshit for 20 years. And, your husband is betraying You, all the while. Have him read this. He needs a WAKE - UP Call!  By the way. All of my siblings and our parents (all 7 of us) can't stand our brother's wife. But at least we don't treat her like yesterday's trash and she is always included in family events. And yes, she wears the pants in our brother's house.", 4679, "None", 2],
	30339 : ["You say your husband's family has put up with this for years, but do you not see that this includes him?  What she did to you was incredibly disrespectful, yet apparently this was ok by him?  Instead, he should have told her he's bailing on the wedding and this isn't negotiable.  ", 4679, "Ohcyim3Kaa", 1],
	30340 : ["Yeah, that's a tough one to swallow. Losing your unfaithful husband early on in your marriage, as painful as that may be, was actually a blessing even though I'm sure the betrayal was knife deep. Then, your friend switches sides and is now with the enemy. Of course you are deeply hurt and betrayed. I would be as well. It is time to let go and move on...but how do you do that? You begin by forgiving yourself for choosing lousy people to be part of your life. You made some up-front mistakes and it's time to forgive yourself for trusting the wrong people. Carry on by being the best you can be and by taking the time for people to EARN your trust and respect before giving more than you are prepared to lose. You can do this!", 4680, "9MJS6I6Laa", 0],

	30342 : ["The card is enough.   Gifts are optional even if you do attend, if you want to give a gift you also have up to 1 year after the wedding to give a gift. I have a lot of aunts/uncles and some I barely know, I might see them once or twice a year on a good year and I really wouldn't expect a gift from them. When one of my cousins got married in another state (he's from here) years ago, I had originally planned to attend but then I lost my job from down sizing and ended up not going.  Once I was back up and working, I sent a gift with a card and later took them to dinner when they came to visit. Another cousin just got married this weekend.  Due to covid her wedding was rescheduled 4 times.  I origially RSVP'd yes but ended up not being able to attend as my mom is recovering from covid complications and I take care of her.  So I sent her a card with a gift, but I'm in a position I can afford the gift. No gift should be given if you can't afford it, you need to take care of you first.", 4681, "5YfuWhLBaa", 0],

	30345 : ["I think it's time to give him an ultimatum. Either he gets a job, or you file for divorce. Give him 3 months, or whatever you feel is appropriate. Under no circumstances should you have a child with this man if he will not work. His “ill get a job when you're pregnant” crap is ridiculous. He's trying to trap you with a child that you'll get stuck taking care of alone. My ex bf was kind of like that. He always complained that he couldn't get jobs, but he didn't even try. He would sleep till 4pm and watch tv all night. He wouldn't even clean the house. As long as you keep taking care of him, he's comfortable and has no reason to do better. Don't cook his meals, don't wash his clothes, and don't give him a penny of your paycheck. Unfortunately you're married, so he's legally entitled to it. But that would require him to get off his butt and make an effort. I suggest you stop babying him, and tell his dad to do the same. Have a serious conversation with him, and do not cave or back down. Tell him that starting tomorrow, he will get up and start applying for jobs. He needs to do it by himself. He's a grown man and you shouldn't have to hold his hand. Tell him that when you get home from work, you expect the house to be clean, a hot meal, and he will give you a list of every job he applied for that day. Do not accept excuses. If he doesn't have a job in 3 months, you will move out and file for divorce. If he shows no progress in a month or so, start looking for apartments for yourself so you can leave in 3 months. Get a copy of the divorce papers to fill out. When you leave him alone with no money and no place to live, he will finally be forced to grow up. He will not change as long as you keep taking care of him. I know you love him, but love isn't enough to make a marriage work. He's basically your child right now. When I finally got my ex to leave, I felt like I was finally free. It was like a huge, fat, lazy weight being lifted off my shoulders. You don't need to stay married to a guy who is using you and bringing you down. Don't worry about upsetting him either. He needs to hear this stuff. The longer you tolerate his behavior, the less likely he is to change.", 4671, "lyTU7F3haa", 2],
	30346 : ["Since he's comfortable in his ways and he's found people to support that, he's not  likely to change.  People can't change other people - they need to choose to change for themselves.  Although you love him, his laziness is putting a big strain on you and it's causing you to resentment him.  Everyone knows what their marriage deal-breakers are, and no one could blame you for leaving him.  Marriages take two and it's unfair that everything is left on your shoulders.BTW you write very well.  Such a nice change from what I've seen here over the years.", 4671, "Je4CIwOwaa", 2],

	30349 : ["The excitement of a lover will override the importance of your relationship. You'll regret leaving your husband for someone broke. Are you sure your lover is using you? I been with my partner for almost 10 years. I have been faithful the whole time. I remember thinking when people step out of their relationship that person is annoying and their spouse got sick of them yet your with them. So it makes me appreciate what I have. There are flaws to him and to me, we accept each other and go from there. It's your decision,  pick wisely. ", 4672, "2fDajuyJaa", 0],
