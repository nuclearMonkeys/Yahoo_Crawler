As always, he thinned his paint way down with turpentine. One day while he was up on the scaffolding -- the job almost finished -- he heard a horrendous clap of thunder, and the sky opened. The downpour washed the thinned paint off the church and knocked Jock off his scaffold and onto the lawn among the gravestones and puddles of thinned and worthless paint. Jock knew this was a warning from the Almighty, so he got on his knees and cried: “Oh, God! Forgive me! What should I do?” And from the thunder, a mighty voice: “REPAINT! REPAINT!

They can easily believe in a real Wizard of Oz, as easily as they can believe Bush is responsible for every ill in the world, from global warming, to the economy to their acne. He is the world's whipping boy. A personification of the US itself. Bush is the new Uncle Sam. A caricature. That's not to say that Bush is not responsible for many things, but he also doesn't really have control of the solar system, either.  Ultimately, what Obama supporters want to do is revolutionize the US & turn the caricature of Bush into the caricature of Obama.
