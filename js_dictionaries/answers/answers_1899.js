	100700 : ["Well your first problem is believing anything that Rick Warren says. If you want to know the true word of God, you need to get away from the teaching of Rick Warren and the Purpose Driven Life Doctrine, If you can even call it that. Rick Warren is NOT  teaching the Word of God. Rick Warren is filling people full of lies and things he thinks they want to hear, which in effect is only leading people away from God instead of to God. And as a watchman for God, it is our responsibility to point out false doctrine and the people teaching the false doctrine and Rick Warren is one of these false teachers. That statement that he made is a right out lie. God knows exactly where Jesus is, He sits at the right hand of the father, He don't need us to tell him that. And there is no verse in the Bible that says anything like that, Rick Warren is a lier. Yes you are right the Bible does say that Jesus has been appointed by the father to be our Judge. And will be our Judge. I am telling you, that anything Rick Warren is teaching is false and is not of the Bible. He is not saved and he is not a man of God. You have proven that to be a fact in what you stated in your question, You can't find it in the Bible its not there, that should prove to you that he is teaching false doctrine.", 9753, "gWiPKe36aa", -1],
	100701 : ["For starters, Rick Warren's theology is pretty much crap. He is all about numbers - he thinks that a successful church is one that is full of people. He doesn't seem to care whether they are saved or not, just as long as they are tithing and are \"active members\". Don't bother with his books. Read your Bible instead! So far as we are told, when we stand before God one day He is going to open the Book of Life. If your name is written in it (and the only way that happens is if you put your faith in Jesus alone), your life as a Christian will be judged. God will look at what you did for Him after you got saved - probably your motives will be judged as well as your actions. Paul says that some Christians \"will be saved as by fire\" - meaning, they did so few things for Jesus that they won't have much of a reward waiting for them. Others, who did many things out of their love for God, will have a big reward waiting (not sure what it will be though).  If your name isn't written in that book, if you never believed in Jesus, you will not be saved. Those poor souls will be cast into the lake of fire forever. PS - that is why Christians are supposed to tell others about Jesus...so that they won't have to  go through that punishment one day. It is OUR fault, not God's, when people go to hell.", 9753, "YQOT68xFaa", 0],

You really can't say you never use it, you use it every time you turn on your computer. It uses a shared memory technology and the less RAM you make available to it in the BIOS the lower the resolution and color depth you will have available to you when you restart, hence the big icons and lack of colors. You need to give it between 16MB and 32MB minimum to be able to run modern office and productivity applications. This type of Video memory sharing is a slower technology than having dedicated high speed video memory that is separate. Computers designed this way generally aren't that great for high end graphics processing such as gaming, video editing, animation creation and rendering, High Speed Simulations, etc. The only way to not have this problem is to get a notebook comptuer that has dedicated video memory for the onboard graphics card/chipset.
