If you have that classification, you most likely have another obstructive disease such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or Bronchiectasis.  With all these diseases, you body can hold too much CO2 and not get enough oxygen.  There is no cure for the COPD diseases however you can manage them.  Ask your doctor to refer you to a pulmonary rehab facility and they will teach you how to manage your breathing problems so you can get the most out of daily life. A good pulmonary rehab program will teach you how to breathe correctly, teach you breathing exercises to help you get rid of CO2 and introduce O2, teach you about your medications (what they do, how to use them, and when to use them), and give you a physical exercise program to help you increase your endurance.
