The only reason I stand behind Barack is because he does not take money from lobbyist. However, Hillary has accepted the most money from lobbyist than any other political candidate in HISTORY. therefore, even though they are basically the same on the issues, I feel that Barack would enter office with a clean slate, while Hillary would enter office owing a lot of favors to a lot of lobbyist, and I do not want the nation's problems taking a backseat to the favors that she needs to fufill.

I think my early decision to vote for Hillary was partly based on her husbands performance as President, and I believe she can continue where he left off, get rid of the deficit, and put us back on track to being a great nation. Also, she's just a good person, she and Bill worked hard for Civil rights BEFORE running for any political office, not to mention the worlds BIGGEST BIGOT, RACIST, SEXIST, Sam Walton, actually hired her to be on the board of Walmart, if he can put aside his disdaine for woman and hire her, it shows a lot about her intelect.

He may have to lay low for a couple years but if he were to run for governer of North Carolina in the future then I think he'd have little trouble.

Anytime he makes a move to get back into politics, it may fail because he hasn't finished coming clean. He admitted to as much as he thought he had to in order to get the press off his back, but he didn't admit to everything. He wants the public to believe that he went to a hotel room with this woman from 9 pm until 2 am in order to talk. If they needed to talk, they would have gone to an office so there would be no mistake about their intentions.  No one seems willing to come clean about the baby, which appears to be John Edward's baby. If two people create a baby, they can keep the parentage a mystery as long as one publicly refuses to take a DNA test. So, it appears they set it up so that she would be the one refusing in order to make John Edward's appear willing.  No one has honestly discussed the payments she has received. She received something like $100,000 upfront and that was called a payment for a video and $15,000 per month through friends of Edwards.

He has more leadership/executive experience than any of the other candidates. He is NOT a WA insider.  If we want change we need to elect someone who isn't part of the WA establishment.   He is NOT a career politician.  He has  spent most of his life working in the private sector so he knows what makes the economy work.  He has a successful career of taking failing businesses and making them thrive.  Career politicians know how to buy votes, grow government, gain more power and manipulate voters, they DON'T understand how let gov get out of the way and let the PEOPLE succeed.  Career politicians have a disconnect with the real world because they live in the WA bubble and think they are above the laws that they helped create.  Mitt lives, works and succeeds in the real world.  That ability and knowledge is what we need in the White HOuse.   He is the only conservative running. People talk about mccain having foreign policy experience, well that is true but I wouldn't say that our   foreign policy has been working that well.  We need new ideas and not the same old ineffective, destructive  ideas that we have been experiencing. McCain/Kennedy amnesty bill will be a disaster for us.  The McCain/Feingold bills limits our political free speech.  The McCain/Leiberman will put huge taxes on energy use.  McCain voted against the Bush tax cuts twice.  Those tax cuts have been the stimulus for our  low unemployment and the growing gdp that we have been experiencing.  Do you see a pattern of McCain's bad judgement?  I do.

Last year, it gave the Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. Trumpeter Award to a man it said \"truly epitomized greatness.\" That man is Louis Farrakhan.
