	62845 : ["A question for Hindus if Ishwar is Omnipresent(everywhere Inside and outside) then Ishwar is also in dirty things like alcohol, urine, excreta? Answer:--       The entire creation is within Ishwar. Because Ishwar is also outside these things but these things do not exist outside Ishwar. So all things in world are pervaded by Ishwar. To give a very rough analogy, we are within Ishwar in similar manner as a pice of cloth within tub of water. There is water within, outside and all around the cloth. There is no portion of cloth which is not wet with water but there is water beyond the cloth as well. Anything is dirty or good for us depending upon our duty towards it. The same set of atoms that form the tasty mango we eat is so lovely for us. But when the atoms disintegrate, interact with other chemicals and form excreta, that becomes dirty for us. But in essence all these are merely different combinations of particles of nature. Since we have a mission on this earth, we analyze each thing with regards to the mission and accept some/ reject rest. What we reject is dirty or trash for us and what we accept is good for us. But for God, such duty does not exist and hence nothing is dirty for Him. On contrary, His duty is different from ours – to help us achieve bliss in just manner – and hence nothing in His entire creation is untouchable for Him.  If you look from another analogy, Ishwar is not like a pampered social worker who would prefer to plan remotely in his air-conditioned office but would desist from visiting the slums where actual social work has to be done. He, on contrary, exists to manage the most dirty of the places for our benefit. And since He alone is most perfect, despite He being everywhere and everything being within Him, He is separate and different from these things.

	62860 : ["No. You seek to redefine the meaning of pure, thus you obscure understanding. If you have a quantity of pure sodium then you have a quantity of matter that is only sodium with no other elements. If you have a bucket of seawater, it may contain some sodium which when isolated could eventually be called pure sodium, but as long as there are other elements mixed with it, it is not pure. Purification is the expulsion of all that is undesired. Feces contains toxins and live bacteria that if eaten will result in illness. Yet after a time of processing it becomes food for plants which produce fruit good for health. It is not only time, but the process of change and filtration that purifies. It is natural for our body to reject that which is impure to us. The concept of premarital sex or sex during dawn being impure is strictly a social one. This perception varies according to society. Not everyone will recognize the harm if any that this causes. For some, it is not important to understand and they will simply follow the customs of society. Others rebel against the customs of man and prefer to rest on their own understanding. As you say, purity is a matter of perception. If a quantity of sodium has 1 part per million of fluorine, it can still be called pure sodium by the FDA.", 8184, "yP2yqKB4aa", 1],

Here's my theory about why that's a lot less common than a fat guy with a hot girl. It has been my personal observation that, for whatever reason, really big guys are even more harsh towards really big girls than average and below average guys.  (which makes no sense to me, but to each his own I guess.)  I have a very large friend (who's a guy) who would rather be single than with a big girl...  Why don't you see more hot guys with fat girls? It's the guy mentality.  I think a guy is more likely to get negative pressure from his friends if he dates someone who's considered generally non-attractive than a girl who does the same. I lucked out.

	62889 : ["Hey Jude [original title: The Beatles Again] is a 1970 collection of non album Beatles singles and B-sides, as well as \"I Should Have Known Better\" and Can't Buy Me Love\", two singles released by Capitol records whose only previous American album appearance had been on the A Hard Day's Night soundtrack album which had been released by United Artists Records. Hey Jude album was not compiled by Capitol, although many American fans wrongly assumed that this was the case. In actuality, the project was conceived by Allen Klein and Apple Records. Klein had regotiated a more lucrative contract for the group in 1969 and was anxious to sweeten the pot with an additional album. He directed Allan Stickler of Abkco/Apple to work on an album. Steckler chose songs that had not appeared on a Capitol album in the USA and which spanned the group's career. He also focused more on more recent singles than on earlier material. The Absence of the songs from a US Capitol album was partially a consequence of the Beatle's willingness to include singel releases on their contemporaneous albums, partially a consequence with their arrangement with United Artists in 1964, and partially due to the habit [of EMI affiliates worldwide] of recompiling the Beatles' British releasees for local markets. Steckler chose not to include A Hard Day's Night, which had been released as a single by Capitol and was available on the United Artists soundtrack album \"I'm Down\"' which was the B-Side of Lady Madonna\". He also overlooked \"From Me To YOU\", \"Misery\", and \" \"There's A Place\", which were first issued in the United States by Vee Jay Records but were not issued on a Capitol album yet. \"Sie Liebt Dich\", a German-language version of \"She Loves You\" was also ignored. Steckler and Apple had become disappointed with the Capitol Records release schedules and determined to promote the new album themselves. Steckler also took the tapes to Sam Feldman Studios [in New York], rather than delivering them to Capitol. He would do this for several releases thereafter. Originally the album was to be named The Beatles Again. Shortly before the record was released, however, the title was changed to Hey Jude, in order to promote the inclusion of the top -selling song that led off side two. Unfortunately, the name change occurred after the labels were printed, and an untold number of copies of the  album were sold with an Apple label sporting the title The Beatles Again. This was also true for cassette copies of the album, which retained the original title. Neither the front nor the back of the album displayed the record's title, but most copies were sold in a jacket whose spine read Hey Jude. Furthermore, in an attempt to clear up any confusion caused by the preprinted label, initial copies of the album also displayed a sticker on the cover bearing the title Hey Jude. The edition of the album with the The Beatles Again label bore catalogue number SO-385 on the label, but not on the jacket. This is because of a similarly-timed decision to reduce the price from $6.98 [SO-prefix] to $5.98 [SW-prefix]. The record jacket was prepared late enough so that it lists the catalogue number as SW-385. The SW-385 catalogue number appears on the label of later pressings that bear the title Hey Jude on the label. The front and back cover pictures were taken at the last-ever Beatles photo session, on 22nd August 1969, at John Lennon's new house, Tittenhurst Park [seven years to the day after they were filmed at the Cavern in Liverpool performing \"Some Other Guy\" [22nd Augus t 1962]. Allen Klein authorized release of the album as a sales buffer during post-production of the delayed Let It Be. In 2007 Neil Aspinall claimed that the back cover was  supposed to be the front cover and vice-verse, but that Klein had rreversed them in error. Until the release of 1967-1970 in 1973, Hey Jude was the only way to own the extremely popular \"Hey Jude\" single on LP or in a stereo mix. The song's \"Lady Madonna\", \"Don't Let Me  Down\", \"Paperback Writer\", \"Rain\", and \"Revolution\" also appeared for the first time  in stereo on this album. Prior to the release of \"Get Back\" single [45 RPM record] in Spring 1969, all Beatles singles were issued in monophonic in the USA. If nothing else, this compilation showcased stereo versions of prreviously single-only mono Beatles songs. The CD era saw the standardizing of the Beatles' discographies worldwide, and the Hey Jude album, as originally released, is not being offered on compact disc. All of the tracks contained on Hey Jude can be found on A Hard Day's Night and Past Masters, Volume Two. A compact disc version exists which contains both Abbery Road and Hey Jude albums. This CD, which was originally produced for select European and Asian makrets, can occasionally be found for sale on online sites such as eBay. Take Care Dave.", 8190, "ONWCXzUMaa", 0],
