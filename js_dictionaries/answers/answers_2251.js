	118340 : ["When you have more than the normal amount of cellulite in your body, it is very hard to feel good about your appearance. The appearance of cellulite can throw your entire level of self-confidence out the window and cause you to feel horrible about the way you look. When this happens, it is time to take action and start learning about a natural way of getting rid of cellulite. And luckily for you, there are quite a few natural cellulite remedies. Powerful Cellulite Massage- When the skin is firmly massaged, the blood flow increases as well as does the lymphatic drainage -- the result of which is the breakdown & prevention of cellulite. This cellulite reduction can be easily seen when problems areas on the skin begin to become less bloated and puffy. Unfortunately, cellulite massage can not be done by anyone at any time, as it takes a specific method to achieve the desired results. To be truly effective, lymphatic massage should be performed by a trained specialist. Cellulite Diet- This is another natural cellulite remedy that works great. Because our bodies react to what we eat on a regular basis, reducing cellulite can easily be done by watching what we eat. However, dieting is rarely \"easy,\" meaning some dedication and strong motivation will be required to stick with a cellulite diet plan. This natural cellulite treatment, like many other types of diets, requires the giving up of sweets and fatty foods. Fresh vegetables and fruits need to included in most daily meals, and they should even be eaten between the 3 main meals of the day.  A snack every once in a while won't hinder your cellulite reduction goals, but you need to have some measure of self-control. Also, keep in mind the fact that skipping meals is a bad thing. Keeping to a regular eating schedule -- breakfast, lunch, & dinner -- is important for maintaining a fast metabolism. Water Consumption- This home remedy for cellulite requires only that you drink water. Water is a natural cleanser that can help repair the connective tissue in your body, thereby making it harder for celulite to accumulate. This technique should be used in conjunction with other cellulite remedies, as it will not completely eliminate cellulite all on it's own. Natural Anti Cellulite Creams- There are numerous creams out on the market that can help in reducing cellulite; such as Avon cellulite cream. The important thing to remember when buying celulite removal creams is quality. It does no good to buy cream if all it really does is moisturize the skin -- and believe it or not, there are imitation creams that do ONLY that. When considering the best anti cellulite creams, research is key. You need to know what ingredients are contained within the cream and if those ingredients are in any way effective in the treatment of cellulite. Generally speaking, you should begin seeing results with any anti-cellulite cream within 2-4 months. Eliminate Cellulite With Exercise- This natural cellulite remedy is often considered to be the most effective cellulite reduction treatment there is. Cardiovascular & aerobic exercises, activities like running, jogging, walking, and treadmill exercising, reduce cellulite accumulation and they can greatly strengthen the connective tissue in the body, which also happens to reduce cellulite.  A regular exercise routine that targets all the problems areas of the body is highly recommended. Once you come up with a cellulite exercise routine that works, stick to it and results should be seen within a matter of weeks -- or months depending on your particular workout. You don't have just 1 natural way of getting rid of cellulite, but 5 different ways!

The Aquarius has such an unpredictable nature at the best of times so when Taurus prefers everything to be organised, neat and tidy, how will they survive in this relationship? Differences Between Taurus and Aquarius Taurus wants to know what the Aquarian's plans for today, tomorrow, next week, next year even, happen to be! They want to feel as if they have some control of their future. Aquarius, on the other hand, prefers to let the future take care of itself. Aquarians don't need to plan. They adapt to whatever comes their way. They thrive on change; Taurus thrives on routine and familiarity. Aquarians love group activities, Taurus gets on best when they're on their own. So, to describe their personalities would be like describing chalk and cheese. The Aquarius partner just doesn't share the Taurean's more fixed outlook on life. Aquarians love change. They're restless, unpredictable people. And when Taurus prefers to know exactly where they stand in their relationships, they're bound to feel as if they're always at sixes and sevens whenever around their partner. For Taurus: This is not a bad alliance as you both have the same interests where money, possessions and security are concerned. The biggest drawback is the old 'all work and no play' syndrome. For Capricorn: You both have the same regard for quality and money. This is almost a match made in heaven. Sexually adequate and certainly a long lasting alliance. They share the same goals and like the same type friends. They are both fond of security and money. Capricorn makes Taurus feel secure and Taurus likes Capricorn's sense of humor. They will do well over the long haul. Taurus admires Capricorn's strength of purpose, and Capricorn is delighted with Taurus's affectionate stability. Taurus can give encouragement and responsiveness Capricorn needs. Both are earthy and passionate. Capricorn is loyal and Taurus is devoted. Both value money, security, and are home lovers. A strong union. Taurus Woman & Capricorn Man This is tied with Virgo as the number one true soulmate match for you. The Taurus girl and Capricorn boy can truly find lasting love together. You both share many important things in common, including a strong need for security. You are also both very deep and passionate and romantic, but this only comes out with the right partner. Capricorn is one of those partners for you. Your lovable and trustworthy nature relaxes the usually serious Capricorn boy, and you really bring out his sense of humor. He, in turn, is devoted to making you feel special. A match made in heaven.  You both value hard work and the better things in life, and that's a big help when you're stressed out over school or family stuff.  You'll always have a shoulder to lean on with Mr. Capricorn, who both respects and admires your stick-to-it-ness.  On the flip side, Your Capricorn boy can teach you a lot about getting the job done.

Most people will look at their cables and if they LOOK clean, and don't see any white corrosion build up on the terminals, they believe the battery terminals are making a good contact.  Once again - NOT SO.  Those terminals and cables are lead.  Lead is a shiny metal.  Scrap the top of a battery terminal and it will shine.  That darkness on the terminal you scraped off is also present between you battery terminal and cable, and will prevent a good contact.

The type with the wires inside that will really make those terminals and cables shine.  Once you have cleaned them, your battery will put out max voltage.
