	81456 : ["Basic things to avoid? Basics: 1) Avoid dialogue tags and try to look for other ways to describe how a character is speaking/reacting 2) Avoid information dumps and try to weave them into the action within your prose 3) Avoid overindulgent and/or unrealistic dialogue/actions that are inconsistent with the character.  4) Avoid purple prose with excessive adverbs/adjectives that modify the nouns/verbs in the sentence. 5) Avoid redundant and/or boring dialogue/prose that do nothing to push the plot along.  6) Avoid imagery that isn't consistent with the story's setting. If its set in the 1300's then don't compare the sun to a light bulb since light bulbs didn't exist then 7) Avoid overindulgent attempts to provoke the reader's emotions. Subtle suggestions will make readers draw their own conclusions and care more about the character's plight than if the author endlessly describes how sad something is and the misery the character is experiencing. 8) Avoid obvious cliches that would detract from the story line (especially in terms of mysteries and plot lines), otherwise the story line will be too predictable 9) Avoid perfect Mary/Gary-Stu characters, give them flaws, wants, needs, etc. Make them real. 10) Avoid trying to get your manuscript perfect the first time around. Just write it and revise later. 11) Avoid copying other authors. You will garner more criticism than praise if you steal ideas On another note: I think writing short stories is harder than writing novels or novellas b/c you have less words to work with in order to develop characters, plot, rising action, conflict, and an ending. So it's more difficult in my opinion because each word counts and you can't overindulge as you can with novels. BQ: yes, everything has changed from my very first. My first had all of the above. BQ2: No. I'm the same as always. But with certain scenes (and this happens while I read as well), I will physically react if my emotions are compromised by the material. BQ3: Not enough room to fill this one out.", 9063, "RkqrLRG4aa", 1],
	81457 : ["Yes, it should. For a few reasons. First reason: Legalizing it would eliminate illegal sale of it. The product would be safer (more regulations), more-easily tracked, and, above all, taxed. Further on the safer topic. In the UK, Holland, and Germany, marijuana-supplies have been filled with chalk, glass, and lead, respectively, in order to make the bag seem heavier and of higher quality. Second reason: It is not a \"dangerous\" drug any more than alcohol. The original concept of \"reefer Madness\" was made by William Randolph Hearst and his associates in order to keep the hemp of marijuana from being used in uses modernly ascribed to paper and other synthetic products, such as oils, paper, clothing, and medicines. Third reason: Marijuana is, in effect, a cigarette with the potency of whiskey -- it does not make you crazy, it is not supremely addictive, and it is not a \"gateway drug\" in and of itself (I shall address that later) Last reason: Marijuana is commonly called a \"Gateway Drug.\" To summarize the meaning of that, a person who partakes in the use of Marijuana will be led through the \"gateway\" into more harmful drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The problem is, though, that it isn't. The only reason people who use marijuana will be led to use cocaine or heroin is because Marijuana has been shut into the same part of society as the other drugs. Hypothetical situation: There are two countries next to each other, which are almost exactly alike except for the fact that one has legalized marijuana. In Country A (the one in which marijuana is legal), a user of marijuana can go to the local liquor store, buy marijuana, and go home without even thinking of cocaine or heroin. In Country B (the one in which marijuana is illegal), a user of marijuana is forced to go to a drug dealer, who probably also sells cocaine, heroin, or Crystal Methamphetamine. The user would probably be at least tempted to try the other drugs. Therefore, marijuana is only a gateway drug if illegal. In summary, marijuana should be legalized because it has been unfairly demonized by the media and William Hearst.", 9062, "EUtUpdSRaa", 0],

	81466 : ["This is the perfect question for me to answer! I'm on my second novel and I remember at the beginning of December 2009 when I decided that I HAD to start story and finish it. So my memories are fresh. Anyway, what I want to say is.... You know what? Write the way you want to.  Wanna have a unrealistic plot? Go for it!  Wanna have rubbish 1 dimensional characters? Go for it!  Wanna tell and not show? (Show not tell is when you avoid the description e.g. of a character. E.g. He was a tall man, with a large roman nose and dark eyes like blackberries, for example (yeah it's rubbish I know.) Instead, when you write about his date with his girlfriend, she could pick up the blackberry on her pavalova and comment on how it's the same colour as his eyes). The reason why I said all of that, is because it doesn't matter. Write how you think it should be etc. Enjoy it! It shouldn't be hard.  My advice for the first draft: - Don't worry about word count/page count. - Don't worry about it being 'rubbish' - DON'T start editing it without finishing the draft. In the second draft, sort out the characterisation, the plot, active voice, not passive voice and so on. Enjoy the first draft. By the time you go to the second draft, you'll have so much ideas! I plan for my second draft to think about every event that happens. (In my story, Some children have been found to be kidnapped. What would that mean for everyone? The public? The people involved? The kids? The families? For the public, there would just be a general surge of interest. But for the people involved, like the police, they would all be shocked and puzzled on how it could've happened. For the kids, they would've been scared. The families would've cried) - Maybe you have writer's block? I'm not sure. I've never had it. Just go to a quiet room, lie on the bed, close your eyes with the sound of the rain from YouTube on. Or go for a walk before you start. Or a bath. - BQs: 1) It was too obvious that I was trying too hard. Also, my plots and characters weren't good at all. While the characters are getting better and so are the plots (noticeably) they still need work. And lots of practise too. 2) It really depends. Sometimes I act really crazy, but I write about serious stuff. I just use Music to change 'me' and what I'm feeling. A writers personality could easily be split in half. But I wouldn't know! 3) Liam. Blond hair, green eyed, thin, tanned and a straight nose. a) \"Whoa!\" He'd go round and explore the place. He'd enjoy it. b) \"Sorry but I think you have the wrong door.\" Completely shocked and irritated that he woke up for no reason. c) Probably go and meet them, and if he could, he'd beat up this particular villain as hard as he could. Then perhaps kill him if he was really that mad. d) Sigh. Think. Then cheer himself up by going out with a friend. e) Burst into tears while no one is looking. Oh dear.

Of course take this with a grain of salt because some of my sources involve definitions of Hebrew and Chaldean words from scripture and it's related texts.

	81477 : ["Original question: At the very basic level, you have to learn to write well before anything can happen. That means: -show don't tell -active voice -strong verbs -no redundancies -good flow -varying sentence structure and length -making sure things aren't awkwardly worded -grammatically correct -limiting the use of adverbs, especially modifying weak verbs -strong, real dialogue After that, I believe we, as writers, create our own personal rules that we follow. I, for example, will never use passive voice in an action scene. To me, that's the fastest way to ruin the intense feel that's supposed to come from an intense scene.  Second question: Sometimes, it's just a matter of sitting down and forcing yourself to do it. Set a minimum word limit that is used for ONLY new content and strive to hit that limit every day. 2,000 words a day is a good goal.  If I'm not feeling in the mood to write, I read. For me, reading helps my writing just as much as practicing writing does. It's absolutely essential, I think, to read other books while you write. Not only does reading another author's story help distract you, your brain can pick up on the sentence structure and style they use. (Just don't read books like Twilight and you'll be fine) BQ1: I've always wished I had someone who would just sit down and tell me some of the key points on good writing. The things that make books so easy to read. In my first novel, it's very obvious that I didn't know how to develop characters, how to use an active voice, among other things.  By now, I've grown a lot, I think. I know how to spin a good character, for example.  BQ2: Doubt it. Instead, I write differently when I act differently. If I've just watched a really sappy movie, I couldn't write a happy scene to save my life. But a breakup scene would probably turn out crushing.  BQ3: a) Where am I?  b) No words. Just unsheathing the swords. c) I don't care d) Why always me? e) Just like before.", 9063, "18UgN6GYaa", 2],

This is what I see the most when I critique other people, and it's the reason my posts end up being a super long. Then again, I'm a grammar stickler.  -Plan your characters before writing. Think of names, personality quirks, etc. It really helps while writing the story because you won't have to spend twenty minutes thinking about whether that action will or won't fit your character. It'll also help you to make less Mary Sue-ish characters.  -If you get bored or draw a blank, save your work and abandon it for some time. Then go back to it in a week or so.  That's all my advice that I can think of! :)  BQ1: My characters are more flawed and have more depth, my names are prettier (I find that funny :D), my grammar/sentence variation is much, much, much better, and my sentences flow more easily. My stories are usually fantasy, so the realistic thing doesn't really apply here. But I have been able to make it seem like it's taking place right below our nose, and we haven't noticed anything.

There are some people who think you should get novel-writing experience by writing short stories. Don't do that. If you want to write a novel, write a novel. If you want to write short stories, write short stories. They're completely different. Short stories don't have the involved plots that novels do. Novels have subplots and the characters have to have more depth. Also, just the length of time, obviously, since novels take longer to write and you can finish a short story in a week's time.  My advice is dont' expect perfection on your first few tries. It's normal to write crap right off the bat. That's how you learn and get better. Realize that the first few novels you write are practice novels and nothing more. Over time, you'll find that your writing ability gets better.
