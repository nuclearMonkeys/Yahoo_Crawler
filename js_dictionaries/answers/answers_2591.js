I had a comment but after reading others comments I fear mine would more likely than not be a violation of freedom of speech which is neither recognized or tolerated but considered an infringement of community standards and guidelines solely in the opinion of Yahoo Answers.

You aren't going to find it at most marine stores, either, unless you live some place(and I don't think Atlanta is one of them) that sells stuff suitable for tying up tugboats, barges, and small freighters. No powerboat or yacht smaller than 75 feet long needs anything even close to that size and most of those will use braided rope, not 3 strand rope like what's in that photo. I can't see exactly what kind of rope that is, the picture is too small, but it might be manila rope and it's at least one inch in diameter. Manila is kind of rough in texture. This page shows a \"poly-manila\" rope which would be much smoother.  If you are going to use rope like that, keep in mind that it's very stiff and hard to work with. It's going to have to be attached to or bent around whatever hardware holds up that swing, it's going to have to be joined very securely to the rest of itself to hold the thing up, and each piece of rope is going to have to be exactly the same length or the swing is going to hang funny. Have you ever spliced rope or put a whipping or a seizing on rope? It's going to take a little practise, some time and some tools to get it right. You might want to look into how to do those things and maybe practise on smaller rope first. Or find someone who does boat rigging to do it for you.", 11282, "E5gaKzCsaa", 0],
