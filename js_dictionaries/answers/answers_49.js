Many types of loads will appear to change their resistance as the applied voltage changes.  For example, a given load may appear as 100 ohms when there is 100 volts applied.  It will draw 1 amp.  If you reduce that voltage to 75 volts, the apparent resistance could change to 50 ohms.  It would now draw 1.5 amps.  This type of behavior is common with some types of motors and switching power supplies. ", 400, "WqRctcQ7aa", 0],

The higher pressure (higher voltage) will put out more water. If you close the valve halfway (lower voltage), less pressure puts out half the water. Think of your resistance as the size of the hole in the sprayer  Higher amperage is what does risk burning a wire up, the wire still has some resistance, which converts some of the current into heat, as it heats, it increases the resistance, turning into even more heat. Heat is electronics worst enemy, it becomes a chain reaction, since heat causes more resistance. In theory, if you could prevent any heat from building up in a wire, it could carry any amount of current, no matter how small the wire is, but it's not actually possible because there is no conductor that carries a true zero resistance.
