	66152 : ["Obama inherited problems from Bush, however, he CLAIMED that he was the smartest man in the room and could solve all of our problems himself.  Remember, he told Republicans that \"they drove the car into the ditch and I just want you to get out of my way as I pull it out and get it moving down the road again.\"    That clearly, except to Obama, an acceptance of the responsibility for the nation going forward. Bush could be dead for 45 years and Obama would STILL be claiming everything happening then to be Bush's fault. whale Stevie?  The Republicans not only got out of the way from 2008-2010, the Democrats didn't let them have ANY say in the Government and the National debt has increased by $4T since then. If the DEBT ceiling was such an important thing, why didn't the Democrats even present a budget last year let alone a raise in the debt ceiling?  If the DEBT ceiling was such an important thing, why didn't the Democrats pass a raise in the debt ceiling last December?  If the debt ceiling was such an important thing, why didn't Obama ask for the debt ceiling raise back in February when he presented his budget for FY2012?  He didn't even mention it as he proposed a budget DEFICIT of $1.5T.   If the DEBT ceiling was such an important thing, then why hasn't Obama or  the Democratic Senate proposed a plan?    Obama has made speech after speech but has never put specifics down on paper to constitute a bill that could be debated.  The non-partisan CBO said to the President \"We don't score speeches, we only score bills as they are presented to us\" The Republicans in the House have presented the Ryan budget and passed it and the Senate has done nothing.  The Republicans in the House have passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling and authorize an amendment to the USA for a balanced budget and the Senate has done nothing. The Republicans in the House have done their job, now it is time for the great pretender to ACTUALLY do something besides flap his mouth. whale Stevie, the election is in Even years(2008,2010) and they take office in January of the odd years(Jan 20, 09 for Obama) Are you HONESTLY trying to suggest that the reason that Obama didn't pass an increase in the DEBT ceiling was because he was being too NICE to the Republicans and wanted their IMPUT???   ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!!!! The real answer was spoken by Harry REID himself AT THE TIME!!! \"Here's Reid on December 8, 2010:     Reid also said that he would like to push off raising the debt ceiling until next year — when Republicans control the House, but that he has not discussed the matter yet with his caucus.     “Let the Republicans have some buy-in on the debt. They're going to have a majority in the House,” said Reid. “I don't think it should be when we have a heavily Democratic Senate, heavily Democratic House and a Democratic president.”\" They could have passed a CLEAN BILL, meaning it would say nothing more than one sentence with NO REPUBLICAN OR TEA PARTY amendments, something along the lines of \"the debt limit of the USA shall be raised by $2.5T\" and it would have passed both houses of Congress and signed by the President.

Obama had never be in charge of any one other than himself before he became President. He grew up in the Chicago political machine, which has a long reputation for dishonesty in government. The choices he has made while in office reflect his lack of experience as a leader. I believe he intends to do good, he is just misguided in his methods. In Washington power is the name of the game.

	66171 : ["Obama has inherited a mess 30 years in the making. Every president from Reagan to GW Bush deregulated to the ground (Clinton repealed Glass-Stegall a huge mistake). This resulted in higher gas prices, airline fees and food prices. Reagan's economic policies created the enormous debt we have now increasing it from $700B to $3T. By the time GW came around he continued deregulating, cutting taxes for people who don't need them, resulting in huge deficits and more debt. When Obama came in office the debt was nearly $12T. The wars, costing 4 trillion dollars are still unpaid for due to Bush's tax cuts. Obama inherited one heck of a mess. You can complain about the Stimulus but at least it did something. I often see construction projects improving our deteriorating infrastructure from the Recovery Act.

	66172 : ["I know Obama has taken more time off than any pres. in recent history,he has signed on to more spend and spend legislation than any other pres. in recent history, he has lovingly shaken hands with some leaders of countries that would love to see the U.S. taken off all world maps,he continues to allow our country to keep in place some old programs/subsidies/taxes that in most cases haven't done anything other than make grafters richer and taxpayers poorer! His influence on Congress has promoted the mess we are in now in over the National debt and although he scrambling now to make points to win re-election, and I still think he may do it,but the debt crisis and the eventual after effects no matter which way it goes may plant the nails in his re-election coffin! I know we the people have been done a dis-service by this man and the past presidents starting just after Ronald Reagan are complicit also but this man is just icing on the cake! There is no one I know of in my small slice of life who has not come into agreement with me after these past 2+ yrs. Some of the recent world catastrophes seem to point to some Divine dis-satisfaction we got ourselves in 2 different wars neither of which have been paid for, there appears to be no glimmer of light anywhere in the dark skys, and who is the major party that got all the spendthrift programs started , who voted them in to law, the Democrats that's who, the past 30 yrs or so have been filled with new program and a resulting tax these new programs and resultant costs continually dig our hole deeper and deeper and who digs these holes, the Democrats! A man like Ron Paul would get my vote but his changes he says he would do are giant type changes that scare everyone in one way or another.His being on a major party ticket this time will help, but his ideas scare all the old guard and I don't see him or anyone similar making it to the nomination,if  Paul was elected he would have many big big obstacles on the road to trying to get some of his ideas \"Off the Ground\" but if He is nixed on all his ideas and suggestions will go into the history books! Maybe somewhere in our future they will become law and finally some really big ideas will flower! It's just that presently we are mired in over 200 yr. old mud and some of the new ideas I speak of will require re- writing the Constitution it will just take time and time heals all. The only stumbling block would be a war with a country that could stand a while, and slow us down more! During all this it would show everyone the 2 party system doesn't work too good anymore and changes or amendments and or re-writing the Constitution will be the order of the day. These items will be necessary to start a fool proof method of taxation that has half heartedly been presented to the U.S. for years would be the National Sales Tax and it would call for everyone to pay a tax on everything sold within the U.S., no one for any reason get's a free pass for any reason, period!I have heard all the discussions why a National Sales Tax won't work, now is the time where some tax experts would study and work out a plan that does work! It has to work and would quickly pay off the National debt and pay into other services such as Social Security!  This idea has been talked over many  times and yet no one seems ready to do away with the I.R.S.Why not? This method of taxation is a decades old and current disaster, it's graft and inequities with many old and stupid  laws etc. Lots of bugs to work out, but it's plain to see how this method of taxation is way over due and would plug the ages old holes that the income tax had! Putting together all the details including Medi Care under this umbrella of taxation should and can be made to work.Think also if the entire income tax system was brought down, the immense savings. This savings can be used to reshape the system of voting, by allowing every citizen over 21 to vote and vote on everything requires a vote from the people. A new system that would put the voters more in touch with their own government! We would do away with everything connected to the present system of voting and allow every voter to call in their vote, paper registration and Government verification would still be necessary it's the removal of paper ballots and the resultant inconvenience to go vote would be alleviated and all citizens voices would be heard! I know these are major changes and will take major changes to accomplish within our system of government but it is all way overdue!

	66192 : ["People don't \"forget\" that Obama inherited problems. What it comes down to is the game of politics. The democrats and many independents know very well that common sense proves that all these enormous problems we face did not appear overnight, but over a long period of time and countless poor and greedy decisions. Obama did just inherit these problems, but he's getting blamed for them because the GOP is spreading their propaganda (i.e. \"Obama and his 'blank checks'\" - He's trying to pay back debt we already spent!) to win back the White House. That's all they care about. Unfortunately, about half of republicans somehow believe this garbage because they lack common sense and the other half pretend to because they just want to hate Obama. It looks so disgustingly obvious what the republicans are doing with this whole debt ceiling crisis - they're stalling to put Obama back in a corner so that he has no choice but to agree to a bunch of stuff the republicans want because they know he won't default. They won't even agree to any sort of long-term deal because they hope to take over the White House to put in a new, long-term deal with everything they want in it. It's so shady, it's mind-boggling that people don't see right through it. Clinton had our economy booming. The rich actually had to PAY their taxes rather than get away with loopholes, the middle class was doing great, and we had a surplus. Dubya was the one who screwed us, and to this day I'm still trying to decide if he was that stupid and thought he was doing right by us or if he was just downright shady. I admire Obama for even attempting to take over this mess. @WillamH10 - If the republicans DID get out of the way, Obama could begin to try and fix things. You can't try and call him out for saying something that still rings true... First of all, Obama did not get into office until 2009. I still like him, but myself and many of his supporters are disappointed in him for trying too hard to be this glorious bipartisan president. He began sending notices to the House and Senate in January that they needed to get this done ASAP, yet he was ignored time and time again. He should've gotten it done when we had full power in the House and Senate, but he wanted to wait and be seen as more bipartisan. It's a sweet and sugary idea, but it's clear now that it's a joke. Yes, the Republicans have done many things and \"the Senate has done nothing,\" but you fail to acknowledge what's really going on there. The Republicans refuse to budge on many of their issues (i.e. no closing of loopholes, or as they like to lie and claim \"no raising taxes\"). Obama reluctantly agreed. We had to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Obama reluctantly agreed again (much to the dismay of his party). For some reason, that's still not enough for the Republicans and they are WASTING TIME insisting on putting these partisan bills together for a worthless vote b/c it is a known fact that it will not be passed b/c it's not bipartisan enough. The deal Obama and the Democrats reluctantly agreed on is already more right, but that's still not good enough to the Republicans... yet it's STILL all the Democrats' and Obama's fault? We're on hold getting a REAL deal and bill done because the Republicans insist on putting Boehner's new bill to a vote just for face. Just to make a point. Just to WASTE TIME.   And once again, just b/c certain things \"got worse\" while Obama was in office, still doesn't necessarily mean he was the cause. Things take time to expose themselves fully. Everything was still in the middle of going downhill. It hadn't plateaued and Obama made it worse. Yes, he did spend more money for the bail out, but I guarantee that if he didn't do that, things would've been even worse and you all would be blaming him for doing nothing. For example, if he let GM go under, think about the thousands of people who would've lost their jobs... that would've added to the already ridiculously high unemployment rate. If there were no GM, that's less American cars to buy (even though a majority of their parts are made outside of the U.S. anyway, but that's a whole other argument), and more people would be buying foreign cars instead. That's just one example. People fail to realize (or conveniently fail to acknowledge) that a president doesn't just come into office and do what he wants right off the bat. Yes, the bail out was Obama. We all know that, but there is also spending done under his watch that was still put forth by bills previous presidents (Bush) signed. Obama can't just come into office and kill previously-signed bills. We can argue back and forth forever, but the bottom line is, if people don't like Obama, they're going to keep finding reasons to blame him - he was doomed from the start.", 8324, "None", -1],
