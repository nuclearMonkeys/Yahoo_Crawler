	127122 : ["Jesus' death ended the old covenant, which includes the ten commandments. When people are confronted with Scriptural facts they do not believe, they resort to proof texts, assumptions, inferences, poorly drawn conclusions, and other things in order to circumvent the facts of Scripture. What you have cited here are proof texts. Mt. 5:17. You assume that Jesus is talking about the legalities of the law, but the context does not support this view. There are no laws codified in the prophets. You cannot destroy or fulfill in the prophets what is not in the prophets. Rom. 7:12. The law did exactly what it was intended to do; it brought all under sin. It rightfully and justly condemns transgressors. Is that what you want, condemnation? II Cor. 3 states the old covenant law had a glory, fading as it was, yet what glory it had was nothing compared to the glory of the new covenant. Mt. 5:19 says \"these\" commandments, and not \"the\" commandments. It relates to the commandments Jesus proceeds to give His followers where He alters old covenant points of law beyond \"jots and tittles\" (in relation to your first proof text) and even negates a point of that OC law. Mt. 19:17 is taken out of context, and ignores the conclusion of the matter later in the same chapter. No one will save themselves as a result of keeping the commandments seeing as no one can keep them perfectly, as required. It is \"impossible\" for men to save themselves. It is only possible through God and what He does. Recall that the man asked Jesus what he, personally, could do that would result in his salvation. The old covenant ended. With it went the conditions of that covenant. This includes the ten commandments. .", 10930, "41h1qHE8aa", 0],

	127125 : ["You can cite a thousand religious scholars and clergy, and all this will never alter the facts.  The old covenant ended. That is a fact.  It ended upon the death of Christ, who was the God of the old covenant, and His death ended that covenant, and instituted the new, and there is no requirement to observe days in the new covenant. The sabbath was the sign of the old covenant.   No one could be required to keep the sabbath under the old covenant until they underwent circumcision. It was established in Acts 15 that Gentile converts to Christianity did not have to undergo circumcision, therefore everything that accompanies it is also excluded, including sabbath keeping.  The new testament church understood this.   Sunday became, through custom, a day of communal worship.  It did not take on the characteristics of a sabbath day.  That some assigned the attributes of the sabbath to Sunday in error does not validate the Saturday sabbath for Christians.  Error does not prove truth. Furthermore, the only ones who have \"branded\" Sunday as a pagan day are those who attempt to justify the sabbath by whatever means available, including such sophistic arguments as this.  The Pagans did not successfully confiscate days from God.  All days are still God's days.  The Pagan's use of days does not somehow mysteriously ruin or tarnish them as a day one can worship God.  Christians are free to worship God whenever and wherever they so desire.  This is Christian Liberty. .", 10931, "AA10471892", 0],
	127126 : ["Jesus did come back. Mankind still thinks that God wants to build his kingdom here on earth.

We know many times in the Old Testament God came in judgement against Israel, not physically coming himself, but by the military force of another country. That is the same thing he did when he returned in the disciples generation. What military force? The Roman army, they destroyed the temple and Jerusalem just as Jesus had said and that would be the sign of his coming. It was the end of the world as Israel had known it. It happened in 70 AD, just short of 40 years from the time Jesus spoke to them about this destruction, still in the disciples generation.

	127132 : ["Many good accurate answers already given, and too, too many ridiculous dogma driven lies that will mislead some. Of course this Scripture proves that Jesus and God, his Father, are two separate persons. The whole Bible teaches that. At the risk of wasting my time and everyone else's, I'll add just a couple of points I haven't seen mentioned here yet. First, to try to link Jesus and God because they are both mentioned in separate visions to have white woolly hair is laughable. Is that really the best they can come up with? Second, the citing of Hebrews 1:6 to support that Jesus is God is either a deliberate lie, or proof of the ignorance of these people. Hebrews 1:6 has been deliberately mistranslated by some to support their trinity doctrine. Hebrews 1:6 is a direct quote of Psalms 45:6 which speaks about the traits of an anointed king, whether David, Solomon, etc. If you apply the trinitarians' translation of Hebrews 1:6 to Psalms, you would have to conclude that the king being spoken about is also God Almighty. But look at what Ps 45:6 actually says, and you will then see how Hebrews should be worded.", 10926, "RP2nzVbvaa", -1],
	127133 : ["You are correct.  The Bible teaches neither Modalism (that Jesus and God are the same) nor Trinitarianism (that God exists in three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit). The Bible teaches clearly that the Father is God Alone, and that Jesus is the Son of God. (John 3:16; 17:3; 1 Corinthians 8:6, etc.) No one has to \"give\" the Father dominion or rulership.  They are His by right as being the Autotheos, God-of-Himself, God by his own right..  By contrast, the life and authority of Jesus, as Jesus himself says, derives from the Father. (Matthew 28:18; John 6:57) There is only superficial resemblance between the one called Ancient of Days in Daniel and the one like a son of man in Revelation.  It may be noted, for example, that the clothing of the Ancient of Days was white and his hair was, not white, but like \"clean wool,\" which is grayish-white.  The clothing of the \"son of man\" is not given any color, and his hair is described as definitely white.  A similarity, but not exact correspondence, is not surprising since the resurrected Jesus is \"the image of the invisible God,\"  the \"reflection of [God's] glory,\" and \"the exact representation of His very being.\" (Colossians 1:14; Hebrews 1:3)  But note that Jesus is \"image,\" \"reflection,\" \"representation\" of God, not God. Nowhere in the Bible are Christ's joint-heirs referred to as \"son of man.\"  Adopted Sons of God, yes.  Son of Man, no.  That's an interpretation without Scriptural merit.", 10926, "FZM15NXtaa", 0],
	127134 : ["I learned about the truth first. It made total sense. Jesus was the first born of all creation. He provided a ransom for what Adam lost, then he appeared before Jehovah in heaven to present the value of his sacrifice.(this was all foreshadowed by the tabernacle/temple with the most holy area) It all made sense even to a child. THEN I HEARD WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE. I laughed. I couldn't believe people could believe that Jesus was God, came down to offer a sacrifice TO HIMSELF, resurrected himself, became a mediator between mankind and himself, and elevated himself to a position of honor next to himself. I thought they were joking. Then I read in THE TWO BABYLONS by Alexander Hylop about the Satanic origin of the trinity.  I learned about the many variations of the trinity doctrine (trinitarians agree on the basics but really contradict each other) and I learned that the trinity doctrine was made official by the Catholic Church IN THE 4TH CENTURY!!! Obviously if this was the central doctrine taught by Jesus his apostles would have known. Bottom line. Satan blinds the minds of the unbelievers. They have to pray for truth and leave their hearts open, rather than blindly accepting what others say.  2 Cor 4: 3,4 3 If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, 4 among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.

	127138 : ["That is a very tricky question, and the answer has nothing whatsoever to do with atheism and everything to do with which particular school of ethics an individual ascribes to. Personally I do believe there are a few things that are universally wrong (I'm not sure I would call it absolute, but it is as strong as I am willing to believe). Killing is universally wrong, that is one pretty much all cultures and all moralities have agreed upon. Sometimes killing can be justified (i.e. self-defense, war/protecting others, etc...), but it is still killing. Rape and slavery are also universally wrong, I don't care if your culture or religion condone it, or if it was considered common in a different time period, it is always wrong and you can never justify it. Lying could probably be in there as well, but it tends to be a little more morally ambiguous than those things that actively harm others (for instance telling somebody their outfit looks great when it doesn't is a lie, but not really immoral, or lying to spare a child's feelings). But my personal moral beliefs are my own, it has nothing to do with whether or not I believe in any gods. Different atheists will have different beliefs. Just like different Theists will have different ethical beliefs (and sometimes differently applied, like how Jews in the Torah could rape/murder/enslave non-Jews or like how Muslims can do the same with the Yazidis). Theism isn't exactly known for moral absolutes either, rather it tends to be a \"might makes right\" approach where you bow down to the rules laid forth by your superiors.", 10932, "IWlrRgmCaa", 0],

In fact, Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church thrill  me a bit, because I know that a false church is going to help in securing the evil of the Gog/Magog government.  Concerning Ezekiel 38, I think a part of what that is talking about is an attempt to take the resources of Canada. Not Israel right away. So, that means the West is going to go through some kind of cataclysm, to where they are considered no longer as a threat militarily, and they will be so destitute that Russia can attack Canada, and the False Prophet can appeal to the West to join in the governmental system of the Antichrist. There would otherwise be no way I can see that the West would join a system of any Middle eastern leader, and no way Russia would ever consider trying to take the resources of Canada.
