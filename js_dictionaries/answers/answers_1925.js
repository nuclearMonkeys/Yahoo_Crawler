We can give them \"democracy\", when all they knew was an iron fist (that we helped setup in the first place). They seem to think we can fight them there so we won't have to fight them here. The country we love is bleeding money and squandering it's power. Paradoxically, often the same people, HATE muslims and the middle east in general. They even call Obama a muslim. They quote things from the koran or whatever you call it, in a very bad light, yet forget the bible and torah also have passages that are similar. So how can you both 'love' and 'hate' (or more likely, fear) the very same people? I would fully support the war, if Iraq, and Iraqi's in general were the ones responsible for 9/11. But it was a criminal act, not a real declaration of war on us. It was not by a government of another country (as far as we know). It was a group of people that were fed up with us being over there. We get it, and we want Osama found. We want retribution, but it must be just. If we label them all \"crazy muslims\", then isn't that just racism of the ugliest sort? Does that make us better than them?", 9800, "None", 1],

I've been watching horror movies since I was seven and I've never been tempted to kill someone.  But back on topic I like these movies because they're different, they're not trying to be like any other movie. Comedy, action, drama they all feel very repetitive but for me with horror movies there is usually a different story. With the Devil's Rejects you couldn't root for anyone, the cop was evil, the firefly's were evil.

I think, though, that you assuming that everything has been \"invented\" speaks to your limited scope - everything you use today has been around for a while.  But there are lots of things being invented in the biological fields - new drugs, new materials, new procedures.
