Ever since that 'stupid doctor' in Finland (or where ever) said he'd found a 'fat gene' and the fat people threw up there arms in delight - giving themselves a reason for being fat (which was later found to be false) the fat people have been claiming it (being fat) as an 'illness' ever since - 'rubbish' - its because you won't control your eating habits. I feel sorry for our doctors who must be 'fed up' seeing these fat people - whose problems are nearly all caused because of their weight. And these people are so 'arrogant' to anyone who says anything about there (excessive weight) appearance. Nobody minds a 'few pounds' overweight - but not 4+ stone - thats just silly and stupid. And they all say the same thing:- I'm comfortable with my weight - nobody could be 'comfortable' being 4+ stone overweight. At least the smokers 'contribute' 6+ billion in 'taxes' to the government/NHS each year towards the cost - fat people 'nothing' - I mean how much tax is there on packets of crisps they all seem to live on buying those 'jumbo packet' size one's. So yes - they should pay something for this 'self inflicted' NHS problem. Anyone sat next to (or rather tried) a fat person on a plane/train/bus - its a nightmare - and 'they' just don't care at all'. Nobody minds a few pounds - we talking about being 'stones overweight' ............men and women.!!!", 9655, "tM2MN5NOaa", 0],

High fat foods, fast-food, crisps, etc etc should have a fat tax, YES. BMIs serve as a guide but there's always going to be someone who disagrees with them, they believe the theory that there's a fat gene & they can't help it.

Yes there are some people who make themselves ill by their own negligence, but the biggest factor in how we arrive at our body shape is genetics, most people who are overweight are genetically programmed to be that way, and there is very little they can do about it. I know, and I am sure most people here know someone who eats the crappiest diet possible and is as thin as a rake. That's simply an accident of birth, something they have no control over, not because they lead a healthy lifestyle. I find it disturbing to see people single out another group because they are 'fat' yet the main factor that the accusers are not fat is pure luck, not because of any special abstinence on their part.", 9655, "f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa", -1],

There are so many things that need hospital treatment that could be down to 'choice'.  Should we start charging pregnant women for pre natal care?

	98463 : ["Christians believe in one God, but that God has several distinct manifestations as He appears to humans in the physical world.  These are actually more categories of action and behavior than entities.  God the Father represents the power of God in the Universe.  It represents the creator, sustainer aspect of the Divine; it is the supreme power above all.  God the Son represents God as He appears in the physical universe to humans that human beings can interact with, this of course, includes the person of Jesus Christ, and numerous appearances, called Theophanies, that God made to people in the Old Testament.  Here God assumes a human form or some other physical form that human beings can see, hear, taste, touch, etc.  God the Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost) represents the all pervading presence of God throughout the Universe.  It is the invisible, yet ever present power of God -- rather like the concept of \"The Force\" in Star Wars.  It is everywhere, though never seen, but is in evidence throughout all of the universe and it is capable of acting in us, upon us, and through us. God is so powerful and so far beyond us, that in our primitive minds we cannot comprehend the Divine in its totality, so we have to think of Him in packets and use mnemonics to sort of grasp what God is.  God is one, but there is also a sense wherein God is also many, but only because we cannot see the Divine in all its totality.  Hence the reason that God is sometimes in holy writings referred to as \"us\" and \"we\" in the Hebrew scriptures. Of course, it never occurs to Christians, that there could be even more manifestations or representations of God than these three.  There, in fact, could be an infinite number of manifestations that God can appear in that we just simply do not know about.", 9662, "5mBo0598aa", -1],

	98467 : ["Here are a few tips; WHEN to eat for losing weight...  • Eat (at least) three times a day.  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course)  • Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas. • Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try.  OK, one apple after 18:00  • Don't starve  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health.  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet.  • Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer. WHAT to drink for losing weight...  • Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day !  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water!  This improves your bowel, reduces the \"hunger\" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks!  Don't believe the slogan \"water makes me fat\". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys.  • Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squized!  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions.  I thought this was not possible for me to achieve. Now... I don't even LIKE them anymore!  Nothing compares to the the smell of a fresh natural fruit juice! Not speaking about health...  • Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home. exercise for losing weight...  • If you want quicker results - exercise would be good.  But remember, you're not going to attend the Olympic Games! If you exercise a lot - you'll get very hungry... and you'll be tempted to eat more. Don't exagerate!  Walking is fine (but not very slow...) for your body, and your spirit. Half an hour, or one hour /day - it's up to you.  Get fit while you sit new workout program that's the laziest way to get in shape - works almost any place, anytime, anywhere… even while watching TV! • Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts...  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss...  • Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants!  • Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated. • Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too? • Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat. Good luck!", 9661, "CciXZNYraa", 27],
	98468 : ["Just as you take a bath each day to wash away dirt from the outside of your body, proponents of the master cleanse diet suggest you also give your insides a good regular cleaning. One way to do this is by using a salt water flush. This flush works much like having the radiator in your car flushed. It cleans out all the trash, wastes, toxins and deposits that keep your body from working at its best. First, you may think a laxative or enema you can buy at your local drug store can do an adequate job of clearing out whatever may be clogging up your intestines. However, these preparations will only clean out the colon - which is only a small part of the intestines - and sometimes only part of the colon. The salt water flush is superior to these methods because it can clean out the entire digestive system. The flush also costs less than some store bought colon cleansing products. Second, you may wonder if you can do a salt water flush yourself or if you need a doctor or nurse to help you with the procedure. The answer is no! A salt water flush can be done at home with ingredients you may already have in your kitchen cabinets. In fact the only things you need to properly complete a salt water flush are water and sea salt. In his essay \"The Master Cleanser with Special Needs and Problems\" Stanley Burroughs cautions users to be sure they use sea salt in their preparation and not regular salt because regular table salt will not work properly.", 9663, "None", 0],
