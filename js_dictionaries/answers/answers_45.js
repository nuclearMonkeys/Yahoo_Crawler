Freezing causes ice to form within cells, and that often causes physical damage to the cells, if not simply bursting them as the ice crystals expand. Once that has happened, there in no possibility of revival, even if there would have been before freezing. Single cell organisms can be frozen and some survive thawing, as not all are damaged severely - but for such as a human, having eg. 50% of you body cells (including brain cells) die at the same time is not something you can survive.", 343, "T5MR7fNHaa", 0],

	2272 : ["It is, of course, quite wrong to say you cannot donate blood if you are gay. It infers in a discrimnatory way that if you are gay you are promiscuous and must be riddled with HIV and other unspeakable diseases. There is no point in testing the blood of a donor to see if the donor is HIV positive. Here is an example. I could have sex with a gay man tonight who unbeknownst to me is HIV positive and I may become infected with the virus. Tomorrow morning after my night of torrid passion I go and donate blood. The test for HIV would come back as negative. My immune system is not going to have produced antibodies to HIV (which is what the test looks for) prior to the shelf life of the blood I donated expiring let alone in the few hours since I was infected. Plus, of course, once I have donated a unit of blood there would be no antibodies developing in what I donated. Consequently, testing a donor is a waste of time. Blood is screened for a variety of diseases. One of those is HIV. However, it is impossible to give a 100% guarantee that blood will be free of all diseases. It would be far better to advise people not to donate blood if they have a diagnosis of a variety of diseases, not just HIV, e.g., Hepatitis B. Also, advise those who are at higher risk of contracting HIV or another blood borne viruses should avoid donating blood, e.g., sex workers, intravenous drug users especially those who share their works, people with multiple sex partners, etc.", 367, "kz04oBhsaa", 1],

No medical professional recommends taking a medication \"just in case,\" but if you're suffering with symptoms, the NHS recommends paracetamol.  Again if you're suffering with an allergic reaction, an antihistamine is the lesser of the two evils.
