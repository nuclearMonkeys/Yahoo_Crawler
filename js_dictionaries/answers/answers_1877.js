	99591 : ["I myself became addicted to solphadeine (which contains codeine)  after having back surgery. At one time i was taking 12 tabs of solphadeine a day in conjuction with other strong painkillers. Two years ago in december i decided to calculate the amount of painkillers i was on per month and it came to a grand total of 635. I knew i had to do something so i took it upon myself to start reducing my meds (without consulting my doctor/not good advice). I started by cutting out 1 solphadeine per day. I have to say that even with this small adjustment my pain went through the roof. But i knew i had to do this for myself otherwise i would be addicted for life and my quality of life would be impaired. It is a very slow and frustrating process but there is light at the end of the tunnel. I still suffer from chronic back pain but i have managed to reduce my intake of meds to 270 per month. I am still in the process of cutting down my meds. What helped me were long hot soaks in the bath, a hot water bottle at all times, my family and some pain releiving gel. I know what you are going through at the moment but let me say that you sound a very strong willed lady and you can do this. Best of luck and consult your doctor before you start reducing your meds.

Your best bet would be to get a Switch or Hub to attach to the back of the first router.  This will provide you with a non-wireless center that should have more than enough ports for all of your ethernet devices. Also, please ensure that you do not have a cordless phone base with in 10 feet of your original router, this could interfere with WiFi signals and cause weaker signal strength in outlying computers.

The settings on the newer router must be similar, if not the same as the current router to make things work right.  Also, Connect directly to your primary router. Pick up an IP from it and note the gateway (probably something like 192.168.x.1). Connect directly to your secondary router and pick up an IP. Log into it and disable the DHCP on it. After that is done change its IP address to 192.168.x.2. It will probably reboot and you will loose connection to it. After that run a cable from a LAN port on the primary router to a LAN port on the secondary router. You should have a full connection now. Your secondary router will act as a switch/access point.
