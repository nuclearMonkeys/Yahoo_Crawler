	100889 : ["Maybe someday. What you'd need is a new MMO, that has WoW's good points, and has it's own strengths, as well. So, you'd need something that appeals to casual and hard core gamers, with plenty of customization (looks and skills), regular updates, huge new world to explore, and without the repetive farming/quests. Maybe even a server counter, that keeps track or kills for you, like in Warhammer. I think the only company that's making the kind of money to develop and deliver that kind of game is Blizzard, tho.", 9758, "7dc6a20a6d47868e1ba43ebbfae30e46aa", 0],

The Bride of Christ are the Jews for whom Jesus first came. And in end times a remnant of Israel will be saved and many Jews will come to Christ as described in Revelation's reference to the 144,000. God must fulfill His Old Testament covenant to the Jews because His Word is Truth. He will do so by marrying His bride the Jews, with His guests being the Body of Christ, all the saved from gentile nations. So in a very unique and figurative way, the Old Testament righteous Jews and those Jews who are saved in end times (the Bride of Christ) will become One in Christ with us, the Body of Christ, who are all the saved from gentile nations.

In the book of Revelation chapter 20 there is a very vivid description of the bride of Christ and it is a city which will come down to the earth from heaven. Many quote these scriptures to say that this is a description of heaven but it is a City that will come down to the New Earth. It is clear in Genesis that the Earth was created for mankind to dwell on and Jesus will come down to dwell with mankind in this new city Jeruselem where He will sit on His throne. 1 Corinthians 12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. Rev 21:2  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. Rev 21:9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.  Rev 21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, Rev 21:11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;  Box Rev 21:12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:   Rev 21:13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.  Rev 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  Rev 21:15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. Rev 21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.  Rev 21:17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty andfour cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.  Rev 21:18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. Rev 21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; Rev 21:20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.  Rev 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. Rev 21:22 ¶ And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. Rev 21:23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb isthe light thereof. Rev 21:24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.  Rev 21:25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.", 9763, "fexmyGg2aa", 0],
