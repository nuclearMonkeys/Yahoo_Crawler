If he has a urinary tract infection then he won't be able to help it and all teh training and suggestions in the world won't change a thing. 2 -Lose the pee pads. This is a sure fire way to CONFUSE your dog because what they learn is that it is ok to pee inside. They do not udnerstand that there is something magical about the pee pads that makes it ok. 3 - Take him outdoors often so he has the chance to pee outside. When he does, praise him in a happy voice and maybe even give him a treat. If you can take the paper / throw rug / whatever that he peed on in the house and put it where you want him to go outside that will go a long way in teaching him to go outdoors. 4 - Do not leave him unsupervised in the house. Keep an eye on him at all times and if you see him sniffing like he is about to \"go\" get him outside. Play with him a little too, otherwise he will get the idea that he is being punished for peeing and / or peeing outside and that it the last thing you want. 5 - Never ever scold him for peeing indoors. If you do all that will happen is he will figure out it's a bad idea for you to see him peeing and then he won't pee outdoors when you go on walks. He'll also get good at being sneaky about peeing indoors so he can avoid the punishment. 6 - Be patient. Now that he has the bad habit, changing it won't happen overnight. Dogs don't suddenly \"get it\" and then act perfect. Instead what will happen is that there will be fewer and fewer accidents and he'll get it right more and more often until finally he'll be housebroken. It could take about two months.

	130015 : ["Its 4:30 in the morning here but let me give this a try ... But the Bible would be a source of verification! You can indeed trust the Scriptures as the sure record of God's dealings with mankind since his original direct creation by God \"from the dust of the ground\". The lives and events recorded in the Scriptures of both the Old and New Testaments - and now vindicated by the finds of history, archaeology and paleontology - leave no doubt that the skeptics of years gone by were totally wrong in assigning the Scriptures to the trash-pile of ancient mythology.  I'll give you a couple reasons to think about ... One is the Bible's uniqueness and unity. The Bible was written by over 40 authors who came from just about every walk of life conceivable, including fisherman, kings, a butler, priests, and a tax collector. The 66 books of the Bible were written over a 1,500 year span in three languages on three continents with one theme and no contradictions. It would be like if fragment of stone were found in Italy, another in Asia Minor, another in Greece, another in Egypt, and on and on until sixty-six fragments had been found, and if when put together they fitted perfectly together, making a perfect statue of Venus de Milo. Most people would arrive immediately at the conclusion that there was originally a sculptor who conceived and carved the statue. Yet another reason Christians believe God is the ultimate author of the Bible is the predictive prophecies in the Bible. This aspect is unique to the world's religions because if one predicts something will happen and it does not, they are proven to be phony. The Bible is literally filled with detailed prophecies that have been fulfilled with 100% accuracy.  The New Testament documents are of course the most important historical sources for Jesus of Nazareth. No modern scholar thinks of the gospels as bald-faced lies, the result of a massive conspiracy. The interval of time between the events themselves and recording of them in the gospels is too short to have allowed the memory of what had or had not actually happened to be erased. Another indicator of the reliability of the Bible as God's word comes from the lengths disciples of Jesus went through to proclaim the gospel. In spite of extreme persecution, people were willing to die for Jesus and His message!", 11053, "fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa", 1],
