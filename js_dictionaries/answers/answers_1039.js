Make it easier for law-abiding citizens to carry weapons openly or concealed.  Let teachers carry guns at school so they can defend the students against school shooters. Get tough on crime and put criminals in prison. Prosecute those who are caught trying to get guns illegally. Doesn't it bother you that every time there is another mass shooting, Democrats propose Universal Background checks when almost all mass shooters have passed their background check and gotten the gun legally, or the shooter acquired the gun illegally and background checks wouldn't have stopped it???", 7948, "d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa", -1],

There are no tribes other than those created by the existence of separate species. Humans are all the same species, the same tribe, the same. Nations are temporary and in constant flux. Families are temporary and in constant flux. Class is temporary and in constant flux. Species is neither temporary, nor in constant flux. There is no adulteration of class, family, tribe or race because all those things are impermanent by their nature. We are just mixing humans with other humans, so what is there to practice intolerance upon? That is why I think you're wrong. You say \"My thrust is on protecting myself and not on 'persecuting others'.\" Protecting yourself from what? Persecution by others, right? So if no one is being persecuted due to their ethnicity, skin color, or cultural identity, there is no need to protect yourself. \"I am referring to habits and culture, not skin color or heredity\". That's fine, but again, habits and culture are impermanent. They are always subject to change on a constant basis. So \"protecting\" one's culture or habits (from change), is not only pointless and redundant, a wasted effort, it is physically and philosophically impossible.", 7972, "2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa", -1],

First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Chipped vaccines = mark of the beast. Sakashvilli and his wife are the heads of human organ harvesting operation during war in Ukraine. They send organs of civilians and organs of soldiers to Israel and America. Someone is hit by car or bullet, then their organs are harvested and sent abroad. mRNA vaccine by Moderna contains *Luciferin* dissolved with *66.6* ml of distilled *phosphate* buffer solution. ...mark of the beast...that's what it is... all vaccines are chipped all vaccines have cells of aborted fetuses in them Police stop you at checkpoint to check if you're chipped (aka vaccinated) Police check the car; let's say 4 people car but signal only from 3; so, police stop it to chip the notyetchipped; signal from 4 now and police let the car go. This is prophecy by saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov. Notice police chip (aka vaccinate) people at gun point in Africa; so, no more \"it's not gonna happen here\" 'cuz it will soon enough, capisce? Police do it on highways or when you leave your city... basically, you can't leave your city unless you're vaccinated; but vaccine = mark of the beast; so, escape now while your city doesn't have these rules; forgive me.

So, they must have died from the new disease that doesn't have a name 'cuz it's caused by 5G. martial law; Constitution was suspended; New World Order read Book of Revelation; Chapters 13 and 14, please chipped people will be influenced by super computers to receive World Passport (grey plastic card with no name on it), but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays If you escape mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to permanent heaven how to escape it? by hiding within a small group (10 - 15 people according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov); no documents; no electronics Project Pogo = Alex Jones, QAnon, Adam Green, etc. videos are put out so that gov't tracks who watches them. (Project Zyphr annihilates people who watch these videos). Drone with scopolamine will drill a hole in your window at 4 am (when electricity for your region has been turned off). Once gassed, you will come out to the police van (waiting for you outside) yourself; you will be taken to underground camp to be tortured for adrenochrome. The rest of the people will be secretly (or even openly) chipped when they sign up for food in closed stores AI (artificial intelligence aka demons) will post on your social media as if it were you doing it while you're on vacation; it will even make phone calls on behalf of you; no one will notice that you're missing in action.", 7973, "None", -1],
