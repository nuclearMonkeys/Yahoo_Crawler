This isn't player power Man United or Chelsea FC we are talking about, it's Arsenal who used to be a great club. Well done Arteta and I thought his interview after the game was very good as well. Didn't make a big deal of it, kept things in house great work by the gaffer. And Arsenal didn't even miss the guy at the end of the day. I don't know how things will work out for Mikel at Arsenal but he has the potential to be a good manager, maybe not world class but mid table prem and spanish teams I'd say he could work a bit of magic at them if given the chance. He won a lot of respect from me over the Auba situation anyway handled it really well and great to see him showing some balls, something Arsenal haven't had since like 2006", 5043, "q1BX2eXuaa", 1],

He's basically blown his chances of ever getting a sniff at a top-tier job again by now after half a decade of failure, and he's too arrogant to take a mid table job. Maybe he'll go win the Portuguese league a buncha times and try to pass that off as some kind of major achievement, lol.
