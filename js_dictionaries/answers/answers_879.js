	48942 : ["Investing does involve taking some risk, but often a quite small risk. In general terms, investing is spending money on something that you have reason to believe will return more money after some time. You can buy something, like gold or art or a house, that you think is underpriced and you can sell it later for more than you paid. Unless you're an expert on evaluating the worth, this type of investment is gambling. You can loan money to someone and collect interest. This is usually pretty safe, but there's the possibility that they will be unable to pay you back. Government and corporate bonds are rated based on how likely they are to pay. You can buy a house and rent it out. The risk here is that your tenants will be unable to pay as much as it costs you to maintain the house. There's also the possibility that when you're ready to sell, you won't get as much as you originally paid. Finally, you can buy corporate stock. This is partial ownership of a company and entitles you to a share of their profit. As with houses there's the risk of the price dropping when you want to sell, or the company going out of business entirely. To invest safely, you first need to figure out how much risk you're willing to take. For example, don't buy property if you need to sell it in one year because the price might go down. However for long-term savings you do need to take some risk in order to get a return that keeps up with inflation. On average the stock market goes up, and you're collecting dividends the whole time. The second important point is to invest in many different things that won't all go down at the same time. Mutual funds let you buy dozens of stocks in different industries even if you don't have a whole lot of money to invest. tl;dr: buy FZROX", 6892, "BxFDTvcLaa", 0],

Whomever buys the house must complywith the tenants current lease agreement until it expires without obligation to renew the lease. If there is no lease in effect, the tenants are month-to-month.

	49019 : ["The bank won't let them take over the mortgage. In fact if the house and mortgage was in your Mother's name then you can't take over the mortgage either. Her estate owns the house and owes the mortgage until probate is settled. You can charge the tenant's rent, just like any other tenant. The rent they pay belongs to the estate, but since you are managing the estate you can use that rent money toward the mortgage. If the rent is not enough to cover the mortgage payment you can raise the rent as long as they're not on a long term lease and there's not a local rent control law. But the tenants can choose to move out instead of paying increased rent if they feel the new amount is too high for the local market or if they just can't afford it. If you want to keep the house you'll eventually have to refinance it into your name in order to finalize probate and close out the estate. If you don't intend to keep the home then you can give the tenants an option to buy it from you at a fair price. They would need to get their own mortgage for the purchase, and the title company that handles the sale would use the money from the buyer to pay off the existing mortgage as part of the process. If the tenants cannot buy it or do not want to buy it then you can hire an agent and post it for sale to the pubic and sell to whoever makes you an offer that you like. You would have to show legal documents proving that you are the executor of your mother's estate and therefore you have the legal authority to sign on behalf of the estate. If you have any siblings that could get sticky and you might want to consult a lawyer ahead of time to make sure you have everything in order.

	49022 : ["The reason \"lens noise\" is recorded when auto-focusing is because the internal mic is not isolated from the camera body. The motors moving the lens to auto-focus vibrate and cause that noise. The vibration picked up by the mic and recorded. The resolution is to decouple the mic element from the touching any hard surface of the camera. This can be done with an external mic - wired or wireless. External mics can either be connected to the camera (usually with a 3.5mm or XLR connector) or an external field audio recorder with built-in or external mics. It depends what I'm recording. For interviews, I use a wireless lavalier mic (Sennheiser G3) connected directly to the camera + an field audio recorder (Zoom H5) positioned closer to the subject, out of the video frame, as a backup.

Every question in th.answers.yahoo.com has tons of blank answers (using space bar); it could have been posted by someone like Shadowfire to gain points for his troll accounts. In his questions and answers he always refers to Christian Lord God as “lord” / “god”; basically, when using proper grammar throughout his hateful blasphemous speech, he deliberately writes these two words from lower case letter. Jewish user Shadowfire (who spams this link “deathmetal.org/news/christ-sodomized” and has been on Yahoo Answers since the beginning and could possibly be the infamous homosexual flying antichrist from the tribe of Dan) from Portland [or so he claims because he could've been born in Russia in Valday (Russian: Валда́й) to a 12th generation Jewish prostitute who pretends to be a virgin)] has many trolls accounts on Yahoo Answers. These could be his accounts: Blackthorne1979, James Blackthorne, ✟ summer of night omega crow † ⚔, Saint James Tiberius Troll, Lord Shadowfire, Carter Berg, Madam Sin Bin, Fireball, Aravah, Miguel, ThatToiletguy, Tublet Huglet, Tut Uncommon: 3peat Offender, Cult Free, Reynaldo Weeks, Juli, Petri Lindroos, Uncle Fester, Lord Ninigi, Knightwulf, Nonplussed, Nightwulf, lyconpolis (lycon = wolf), Derick Fields, Toilet John, Hitler Was Right About The Jews, Master Debator, Magistra, Desiree, D-girl, Firecock, Yahoo User, Corvus Blackthorne, Patrick McCluskey,  Lord Aizen, Torchbug, Arni, r.wolfpaw, No Bozos, Fuzzface McGee, First Dragon, L.E.

Raskin,   A yellow face with simple open eyes showing clenched teeth, El Nerdo Loco, megalomaniac, Corvia Blackthorne, Shadowfire Lives, Shadowfire Lives bytches, The Chick that wears Doc Martens, Homo, Wotan 8, Wotan (who keeps posting “satanisgod.org”), Heidi Ho, Clo Bird, Angels with Silver Wings, Orange I'lluminaughty, Christian Sinner, Gandalf the black, The Lord Hummungus, Mismatched Tube Socks, Pearl, Partysnax the Dragon, etc. and any other anonymous accounts. With one his accounts Fireball, he pretends to be a Methodist old lady who posts short-hand slang TIRH (this is religion here). He reports all answers and questions that he doesn't like just so that his questions stay on top in the Religion and Spirituality section. He trolls in other categories too. It gives Christians a bad name (just because of this troll's sock puppet account). His Toilet John account keeps posting questions where Jesus was sodomized by Roman soldiers. Remember the prophecy where it says that the antichrist will have personal hatred towards the real Jesus Christ. That's why Shadowfire keeps posting thousands of similar questions along the line: “Did Romans sodomize Jesus?” or “Was Jesus anally violated during the crucifixion?” or \"How many liters of cûm did Jesus swallow before being hanged on the cross to die?\" or \"Did Jesus take a big dick up the butt beforr dying?\" or \"Did Roman buttfck Jesus before crucifying him?\" or “Did Romans buttrape Jesus?”. He asks multiple idiotic mundane questions like “Is Hinduism true?”, “What makes a girl harden?” [like he enjoyed killing little girls], etc. and answers them with his sock puppet accounts just to gain points. Some questions you can see that he answered with like five or seven accounts (especially the ones about himself that he reports right away). With his Reynaldo Weeks account he boasts that he was the reason why their accounts were suspended. With his Magistra account he threatens people with clowns and CIA assassins. Shadowfire mocks Christians with his sock puppet account Fireball in the Religion and Spirituality section by answering very destructively and adding \"TIRH here\" or reported (anonymously) or “fck you nigers”. He gives Christians a bad name because he promotes sins like sodomy, fornication, ecumenism, astrology (horoscopes), etc. He should be executed and burned at the stake for blasphemy. He spreads rapture heresy, reincarnation heresy, ecumenism heresy, etc. and many more subtle heresies. Antichrist will ride on a donkey into the 3rd Temple. Stop him before it's too late. Antichrist is gay flying wizard who was born from a prostitute and who will ride on a donkey into the 3rd Temple. Antichrist's mother is a 12th generation prostitute (according to saint Lavrentiy of Chernigov). According to researcher Grigoriy Klimov, prostitutes = lesbians = witches; so, antichrist's mother is a witch, a lesbian, and a prostitute. Hide your kids, hide your wife ‘cuz de evil antichrist is flying thru town; take your glocks out and shoot dat son of a bytch down! Again, he's an s-o-b ‘cuz his mother is a prostitute to Jews and Hindus. Funny thing is that she pretends to be a virgin. Don't be deceived by this skumbag and his fake miracles trying to emulate Christ's miracles! If wrongfully accused, forgive me; state under your account that you are not Corvus Blackthorne then. Shadowfire claims to be extraterrestrial raven when demons pretend to be extraterrestrials. I'm paranoid and think that all Yahoo accounts that talk about ravens are about him. Please, help me; I beg you. Using user Miguel, he's teaching people how to summon demons. Dirty, very dirty!

If you just want fool around with it, then just ask him.  If he says no again, then it's no big deal.  Like you said, it's quite obsolete anyway, right?  More on that later. If you have a genuine interest in photography, then you have a much stronger reason for wanting to use your dad's camera.  If you show your father that you are taking this hobby seriously, and that the phone isn't good enough for what you need, then it's likely that your dad will say yes providing that over the past 4 years you've matured enough and proven yourself to be trustworthy.  Four years when you're in your 40s isn't all that much, but when you compare an 16-year-old to when they were just 12, then that's huge! If you have a genuine interest in photography, and you're taking this hobby seriously by working on your computer editing images, printing out your photos and framing them, etc..., I think your dad will probably notice and may offer you the camera without you even having to ask. What are you doing for your photos now? I assume you're using your phone which is quite limiting compared to the D90.  In fact, there are many types of photos that the D90 can do far better than your phone and many your phone simply cannot do at all.  If the phone, or whatever camera you're currently using, is holding you back (e.g. no manual settings, no interchangeable lens, no continuous focusing, etc...) explain that to your father. Of course, if all you want to do is try the camera out because it looks cool and stuff, then just ask.  If he says no, then live with it.  You'll eventually be old enough to afford a great camera in the very near future anyway. The D90 is not obsolete by any stretch of the imagination.  If you think it takes worse photos than a modern phone, I would encourage you to check out these photos on 500px.com that were taken with a D90:    There's not a phone on the planet that can compare to the capabilities and image quality of even an obsolete camera like the D90.", 6901, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],

Emotional SERVICE animals are allowed in most rentals and it's not based on the ADA, it's based on HUD regulations. The difference between a support and service animal is that service animals provide aid to disabled individuals.  The aid can be in the form of support. As a landlord, whenever you are asked to allow an emotional SERVICE animal, you can require documentation from the tenant's doctor.  You can get the correct form from the landlord association in your area.  This won't tell any medical information but will certify that the person meets the criteria of being disabled. Additionally, as a landlord, under HUD, you are allowed to decline the emotional SERVICE animal if it's a financial hardship - such as can't get insurance because of a breed restriction or the unit is too small to properly care for the animal.
