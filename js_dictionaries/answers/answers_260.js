	13009 : ["Okay, here we go: First of all, why do you say that high-schoolers aren't mature enough? When I was twelve, I was studying quantum mechanics as a hobby, knew all the ins and outs of sexuality, and had already identified myself as a three-spirit. On top of that, I had the maturity to handle conversations about basically anything without a hitch. I could even think through the whole conversation before I had it. If that doesn't strike you as stunning, I don't know what will. That was as a 6th-grader. I still had 3 years until high school. You wanna talk maturity? The average high-schooler's drama? I would rate it a little higher than yours, just from your post. I can see that you aren't very confident about your high school years, and, being skewed because of aging, I'd rate your high school drama just a little more than average. There's my two cents. I hope it helps.", 2176, "hXjvOq9Aaa", -4],

Georgia Guide Stones = 500 million maximum population. KGB, CIA, MI5/6, whatever intelligence service is to keep Jews in power and to kill those who rise up against Jews. Bishop Velimirovic said that Jews created capitalism, communism, freemasonry, strikes, internationalism, globalism, etc. to step on heads of Christians and to crush them; add Black Lives Matter to this. Only WASP neighborhoods were trashed in NYC; when BLM leader announced that they was going to trash Jewish stores, they was arrested immediately. Similarly, Jews sponsored American Civil Rights Movement in order to step on throats of Christians and to crush them eventually. All the revolutions are sponsored by Jews. 9/11 false flag was to attack Iraq; Statue of Liberty false flag is to attack Iran. Heresy leads to loss of love; (according to saint Pelageya of Ryazan) Jews will not receive the unforgivable mark of the beast, but will make sure that all non-Jews will. If you reject mark of the beast, then ur direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov). Hide within a 10-15 people group (saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov); no documents (documents r from satin; burn 'em all); no electronics (so that u won't be tracked; even old broken  unplugged 1970 tv set will show the antichristo using Tesla's ether). oh snap!!! here's the evil flying antichristo flying thru ma neck ov de woodz; hide ur kidz, hide ur wife, antichrist iz flyin' thru town; take ur glocks out and shoot dat son of a bytch down (he's an s-0-b 'cuz his mom is a 12th generation prostitute according to saint Lavrentiy of Chernigov); forgive me. Normal person has two strands of DNA; marked person will have three strands of DNA so that demons can live inside him forever. Book of Revelation says: \"they seek death and can't find it\"; this is about marked people; angel will cut their heads off at the end of Apocalypse. COVID vaccine contains chip; chip = mark of the beast (Book of Revelation Chapters 13 and 14). 5G will kill those who they don't want to live. 93 percent will die according to Orthodox prophecy (7 percent will be left to live during Apocalypse); Georgia Guidestones want 500 million max population. COVID vaccines make women infertile. Reject all vaccines! Reject new documents as modern documents are from Satan; burn documents. Unforgivable Green666tattoo by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist when chipped people stretch their hands to receive grey plastic card (World Passport); permanent hell after this. If you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors will go to heaven (according to last prophet saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov).

What you need is antimins (remains of saints sewed into a towel, one cup, one spoon, wax candles, nonkosher non-yeast nonbarcoded nonqrcoded bread/wine, etc.) Electricity is from Satan; yeast is grown on pig bacteria, etc. Barcode = Druid black magic curse; QRcode = ancient Mayan curse... Kosher (K) or Union of Orthodox Synagogues (U) = sprinkled with blood like Mosis did. Underneath the entrance of synagogue lies New Testament... Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation.
