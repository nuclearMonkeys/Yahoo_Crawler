	18126 : ["On the floor is not a good idea. Heat rises, remember? You would have issues with blocking your fire exit by blocking the doorway. If the heavy drapes happen to fall and block any of the air vents on the sides or back, it can overheat and cause a fire. If you cannot use a window, you can buy a portable A/C (on wheels), close the door, and have some cool air. They still should be vented outside though. A dual vent system is more efficient (draws outside air in to cool the condenser and blows out the hot air and moisture back outside through a window)", 3077, "41vWD9x2aa", -1],

	18129 : ["Leach fields work by percolation and evaporation. Compressing or covering that area is not a good idea.  NOBODY should ever run \"heavy equipment\" over a leach field or even drive or park ordinary vehicles there.  Technologies change over time, so we can't guess what sort you might have, but the simplest ones are just perforated drain pipes under the frost level.  If your frost depth is 4 feet or more, you can't break the pipes by driving over them, but you can still damage the evaporation by compressing the topsoil unnecessarily.", 3078, "VjgqZetcaa", 0],

	18136 : ["Assuming you have a front loader, check the strainer underneath, behind the front panel. Clogged strainers hold water longer and the machine won't open till the level goes down. You need to remove or open the front panel with the machine off and already drained. Get some towels and a small bucket just in case. You should be able to turn the tabs about 1/4 turn counter clockwise to release it then slowly pull the strainer out.Have towels on the floor underneath and the bucket under the strainer too. You probably will find a lot of junk in there, sometimes jewelry, coins, etc too. Wash the strainer out and reassemble. Make sure you know how to turn the water off to the washer too, just in case. Another item might be the water level sensor - line could be clogged with soap residue. You need a repairman to diagnose and fix it. I am lucky - I have an old top loader. NO PROBLEMS. Just set the load switch to one load size smaller than the load I put in. Saves water that way and less hassles.", 3073, "41vWD9x2aa", 1],

He is under no legal obligation to change the agreement. Approaching renewal time, you can renegotiate and if you can't agree, you don't renew and you all move. But it sounds like even if you get the money split YOU think is fair, you're not going to get the effort out of that guy that you want, and you can't force it out of him. So until the lease ends and you go your way and he goes his, you keep paying what you agreed to pay at the beginning.

	18151 : ["That sensor will shut down the furnace if it is disabled or clogged. So will a flame rollout sensor. It would be hard to prove he was the one who did it, after a year. His counterclaim is that he didn't do it, and YOU did. The explosion may be caused by something unrelated to that sensor. One or two of the burners might not have lit when the furnace came on and spewed fuel into the heat exchanger. Another one that did fire probably caused the fuel vapors to ignite and explode. No way to really know for sure. About your A/C. You can have an air handler installed just for that and not have to spend massive cash on a new system. Air handler is just two plenums, your evaporator coil, drain line, blower, and some wiring to tie it in. Same principle as a dual furnace setup except the heat part is in a different air handler. You could also get mini split systems too, which can be cheaper on the utility bill if you use them appropriately (manual zone control). Just so ya know: Unless your furnace is really old, heat exchangers can be replaced. If this is done, ask nicely if the repairman can spray PAM on the new gasket (keeps it from shrinking and very hard to burn VERY). Makes the gasket easier to remove in the future. Same with a draft inducer gasket. PAM! Also, if you have insurance, check your policy. If you have home warranty insurance, check that policy.", 3069, "41vWD9x2aa", 2],
	18152 : ["I would say yes, there is a very good chance.   What you need to do is have the current company evaluate your system. Explain what the previous technician did ....and have this current company supply you with probability as to the cause....and effect of the explosion on the heat exchanger. Maybe it will go somewhere ...maybe not, but it's worth a try. Any pictures you have would be helpful  ", 3069, "SgGB9Ji7aa", 1],

I recently sold a house . . . lived there 23 years . . . the previous owner had clogged the leach field by running coffee grounds down the drain for years . . . . . entire system had to be replaced.  When I sold the buyers had the tank pumped and inspected . . . there was less than an inch of sludge at the bottom after 23 years !", 3070, "None", 0],

	18158 : ["Maintenance maintains the building...they did not design the system. I take it the bathroom is in the middle of the apartment. Most are.  Does your bathroom door have a screen in it?  That allows air through.  If it is a solid door then you got to leave the door open a bit to allow air to enter and be sucked out.  So you have a movement of air otherwise mold happens.  Leave that door open all the time if it is solid  That is the only way the humidity will get sucked out. My gf lived in an apartment and had mold in the bathroom and she had a screen on the door and she had a fan.  Either the screen was blocked or she left wet towels in the bath to dry and shut off the fan immediately when she was finished washing. WRONG. Leave the fan running for an hour after the shower bath whatever.  Never dry stuff in the bathroom when it can be dried on her dining room chairs or something ...laundry hanging out to dry. I live in a house so my bath is right beside a window so leaving the window open a half inch does wonders for drying time. No mold EVER.", 3071, "None", 3],
