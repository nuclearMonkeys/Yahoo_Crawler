Certification is a voluntary demonstration that the individual has met industry standards. Certification requires the completion of a 75-hour course, observation and documentation of 17 skills for competency assessed by a registered nurse and passing a written exam developed by NAHC. There are also programs developed by individual state DOH.  In NY, Home Health Aides have to pass an exam and are certified by the state.  This information is verifiable online.

I do not think that America can take another 4 years under the same repubs, who weren't able to reform their party for the last 8 years. Because one candidate is for the people, while the other has 134 lobbyists in his campain. I am supporting these two because I think America would do better for herself and her people if more of our money was spent here. I would like to see us regain the support of allies. I would like to know that the people who fight for us, will be taken care of when they return, which doesnt always happen. Because we have the top leading health care and more shoild be able to benefit from that. Because I am not stupid, \"the trickle down\" effect in business hasn't helped the lower classes. I would hope that one day when I have children their America isnt destroyed. I stand for women, gays, different races, because we are all one and should be treated that way.

They are a business like all businesses and arn't in business to lose money.  But, they don't want to chase away all their poorer customers because a lot of poor customers become rich customers eventually.
