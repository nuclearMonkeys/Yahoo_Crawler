So many car audio novices like you blow out their system within minutes to an hour. You NEED to learn how to get the proper amplifier for the subwoofer, get the proper enclosure for the subwoofer, set the gains properly, set the crossovers properly, and keep the BASS boost OFF. It should hit HARD and LOUD without the bass boost and you will feel the bass thumping through your body. If it doesn't, the woofer is in a poor quality enclosure, the output signal from the HU is low, the LPF crossover isn't set up properly, the gain isn't set properly, or the woofer's life is coming to an end and it will be time for a replacement of the woofer.", 3818, "euO1RSFVaa", 0],

I mean, I'll admit I'm one of them, I'm entitled, lazy, arrogant, but my views are about helping people who are in need. For example, I got a black cat, I started feeding him because I thought he was a stray, but it turns out it belonged to the people three houses down, which I found out after a couple of years. He's gone off his food, as he seems to have a bad tooth, so my choice is basically to take him to the vet, and see if it can be fixed, or put him down. Same basic thing with humans, but you know, even most Western countries don't have free dental for everyone.

Now, after another year, I have regained my axel with a bunch of other double jumps. It doesn't matter if you're good or not or if you practice a lot, but you just have to be positive. When I was sad in the first few months, I didn't get a single bit higher than where I was before.

If Muslim women choose to wear a hijab then that's their choice (the same way I support Jewish men choosing to wear a yarmulke if they choose).   My country (Canada) chose to accept refugees from Syria and I supported this decision because it was the right thing to do during a crisis.  As to Ms Begum, I don't know the details of her case but she should be prosecuted under the law \"if\" there is evidence to support the actions you describe.  Separating an infant from her mother is rarely, if ever a good idea.", 3821, "Pc0QjrQ4aa", 0],
