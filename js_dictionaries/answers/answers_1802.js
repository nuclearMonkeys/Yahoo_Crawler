Quick story, when I was aout 12 years old I met a girl that I became very good friends with nearly immediately...she slept with a stuffed animal all of the time, at first, I along with our other friends thought that was somewhat strange.  One of the girls in our group would always...without fail...bring up the stuffed animal in front of others and in a very rude way and making fun of way.   Our friend NEVER seemed to let it bother her only explaining to all of us that the stuffed animal is who she is and we were not expected to like it or really understand it for that matter.  I gained alot of respect for her that day.  What a strong person to be who you are no matter what......That was 21 years ago and I will say...we are still great friends both with children and low and behold...the stuffed animal is still a part of her life today only in a different manner.  My point is, I respect her in every way because I know without hesitation that she is an absolute genuine person and not someone trying to be someone she isn't to please others.

In most circumstances this seems like a bad deal for you, since the difference between RBs is usually larger than the diff between WRs.
