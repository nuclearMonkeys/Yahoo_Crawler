Americans themselves refer to their country as \"America\" and it's quite common in other English-speaking countries as well. People in Ireland, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and many other places use the term \"America\" to refer to the US. It's longstanding convention and it's not going to change.  The only people who tend to get bent out of shape over it are Canadians and people from Latin America. Nobody anyplace else really gives a toss either way. And it's pretty easy to see why Canadians and Latin Americans would whinge about it as so many believe that they have an axe to grind with the United States.  If you were to stop and think about it for a moment, it would likely dawn on you that Americans probably couldn't care less what other people think of the way they refer to their country. Why should they? And you would also likely realise that this only perturbs you because you're one of those people who's compelled to whinge about what Americans do.  Why? My guess is that you're Latin American, and thus feel some misguided sense of hostility towards America and Americans and this petty nonsense is just your way of venting your frustration or coping with your envy.  I'm an Irishman and everyone in Ireland refers to the United States as \"America.\"", 543, "None", 6],
