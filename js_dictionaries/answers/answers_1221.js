These verses happened in the first earth age. Satan is of old. Read II Peter 3:5-10 (1st,2nd,3rd earth age spoken of) In the first earth age, one third of the angels rebelled with Satan. Satan wanted to be god.God wanted to give the angels who rebelled another chance, so He created the 2nd earth age (the one we live in today). This 2nd one started with re-creation of the earth, creation of flesh men and then the Garden of Eden with Adam & Eve.  Satan seduced Eve as to try to prevent her seed from being born generations later (to try to poison her seed) as the Christ child to foil God' plan of giving the 1/3rd mentioned already the opportunity to redeem themselves through Christ. There was no apple in the garden, Cain was Satan's offspring = I John 3:12, II Cor. 11:3, Tares = Matthew 13, Gen 3:13 All of the 1/3rd angels which is mankind has to place through this 2nd earth age to decide whom to love God or Satan, good or evil. God cannot force love, and did not want to destroy His children for their disobedience after the rebellion of the 1st earth age, so He made them born of women, in flesh bodies this time. When all men have been born, Christ will return along with the new beginning, or the 3rd earth age. ----------------------------------------------------------------- DIANE, God did not lie to them.

	66609 : ["Souvenirs are only appreciated if the person you are giving it to has been to Denmark or cares about the place. A lot of the souvenirs mentioned will be put on the shelf by your family and mean \"nothing\" to them. Only to you, who visited. I always suggest bringing home interesting food products that they wont have back home. Here are a couple of fun and tasty treats to take back. Flødeboller: These are chocolate covered marshmellow cream balls on a cookie base. They are popular on top of ice cream, but eaten by themselves. You can get them at almost all grocery stores for about 15 -20 kroner for a box of 12 and I have yet to find anyone who does not love them. Next is Chocolate bread slices or as we call them \"pålægschokolade\". These are bought in a small box with about 30 pieces in each box. Again found at all grocery stores. They are thin slices of chocolate and they are usually served on freshly baked bread that is warm. If the bread is warm the chocolate melts on the bread. If the bread is not fresh baked, you can toast a piece of bread and place on the toast when it is finished. You can even gently warm the bread and chocolate in an oven (do not microwave .. it ruins the taste).  The chocolate does not have to be heated, it can be eaten at room tempertature and still taste fantastic. Come on, where else do people eat chocolate sandwiches? I am always sending boxes of this back to friends who visit. They stock up here and than write and ask me to send a few boxes every couple of months. The other idea of getting candy is great, but you really should go to Nørregade in Copenhagen and get \"bolcher\", which is the danish word for candy, at the BEST bolcher factory/shop in Denmark. It is called Nørregade Bolcher and it is located on Nørregade (right next to Nørreport train station ... 2 minute walk). There you can not only watch them make the candy, but you can pick your own combination of the different type bolcher from the store displays. It reminds one of the old American soda fountain / 5 and dime stores where they had all sorts of different candies in little jars with scoops so you could choose. Even if you don't like candy, it is a great place to visit as a tourist. Another good idea for your mom is some of the great kitchen accesorries in places like Illums. It is pretty pricey, but some cool stuff. Also can be found at places like Kop og Kande and Inspiration for a bit less. Just funky designs that make any home or kitchen look DANISH! Avoid all the souvenir plates, unless your family/friends collects stuff like that.  Also beware that the Stroget is a great place to shop, but their prices are much higher than places in the suburbs. A 10 minute walk up Vesterbrogade or Norrebrogade can put you in the suburbs where the same shops are, but with better prices. Spend wisely, cuz it aint cheap. :)", 8341, "qEcVkjpIaa", 5],

Also use it to clean and fix registry. Tune-up Utilities is also a great program for this sort of thing and has a fully functional 30 day trial. If that does not work I am guessing you have a shoddy hard drive. Hope this helps! Let me know, I will check back..
