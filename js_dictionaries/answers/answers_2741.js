Personalmente creo que \"La Culpa\" es la faceta negativa de \"La Responsabilidad\"... creo que es el medio mÃ¡s Ãºtil y funcional de la manipulaciÃ³n,  una manera negativa de crear una Sociedad, ya que en la culpa va implÃ­cito el miedo... y Â¿no es acaso el miedo lo que la mayorÃ­a de la veces nos hace hacer lo que en realidad no queremos hacer? La culpa siempre ha sido utilizada para controlar a los demÃ¡s, incluso nuestros padres la utilizaron para poder controlarnos en nuestra infancia y adolescencia.... en muchos casos... toda la vida... o Â¿no? Que me dices de los gobiernos y las religiones?

	142930 : ["Hello! A cell phone, or mobile phone is becoming normal for kids 11+ to have them nowadays.  I think when people start secondary school is best, for several reasons.  Route home - usually in Secondary school kids and teens make they're own way home from school - walking, cycling or going on the bus. If they are going to be late then they need to contact their parents or guardians to arrange plans and keep them informed. After-school clubs - If say, an after school club isn't on, and you have arranged to pick them up, then they would need to contact you to ask for a lift. Quite often, the student reception/office isn't open for much longer after school, so if they can't get to them in time, then they are stuck for another hour, half hour. Going out with Friends - At the end of Primary school, kids will start to want to go out and hang up the park with friends. How will they call or text you if something goes wrong? What if they are going to be late back? What if you need them back earlier, how will you call them? Shops up the village - If they are going to the post office or local shop, and you want to remind them about something you forgot, or something goes wrong up the road, they won't be able to contact you if something goes wrong. Texting and calling friends - Most people my age (12) I know at school have a mobile phone. We love calling and texting each other, and can also remind each other about homework we may have missed that day, or even to say what time we should meet up the park.  So, overall, I think 10-13 are good ages, but it does depend if your kid is responsible (like me) and will use their credit wisely, or silly and not very wise and will daftly us up al their credit, or get it lost, dropped or broken. It also depends how fast he/she grows up, is he/she likely to post your letters, go out into town with friends and catch the bus? I got my first phone at the age of 10, my little sister at the age of nine. Maybe I was too young, but most my friends had them at the time, and I did like going up to the park and arranging meeting friends. Then, when I was 11, I used it much more often so I got a touchscreen for  .  Now, I am 12 and I meet my friends up the park very often, sometimes going into town by catching the bus with a friend and swimming or shopping. Now my mum has upped my pocket money, I pay for my own credit, and I am allowed no more than £10 a month. HOPE I HELPED! EDIT:: Like the answer above, I too am asked by my mum when I go out by myself, 'Have you got your mobile phone?' BRACA MONTES IS WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! 6 OR 7 are TOO young.

We told her that she needed to abide by that rule or it was to be taken away. She was very good about. She kept it in good condition & never lost it. It helped with her self esteem. There were other issues that concerned me more; like who she associated with, or going to the mall. Thankfully she has chosen wisely with friends, & she would only go to the mall if I was present. She could shop with a friend & meet me later. I felt that was a good compromise. She graduates from high school next month & the discipline hasn't hurt her any. She is caring & respectful.
