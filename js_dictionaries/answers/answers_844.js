	46802 : ["I usually drink seven or eight cups of tea, coffee, cocoa, herbal tea and so on every day. Most of the time, what I drink is a hot drink with milk. I love these kinds of drinks, so I have a wide variety of drinks that some of my friends call my home \"Kaname Cafe.\". So I make drinks in my kitchen almost every day. It is rare that I just pour commercial drinks into a cup. I used to bring drinks from my kitchen to work ... at least before the New normal after COVID-19. But I still often order exciting drinks at cafes and coffee shops when I go out. I'd estimate $4 to $7 per cup for a franchise cafe or $5 to $15 for a not  franchise beverage store. Whether going out alone or with friends, cafes and coffee shops are a very familiar option for me. Since I live in a city with a population of over 10 million people, there are so many cafes and cafes that it is impossible to cover them all in my lifetime. So when I decide which cafes to enter while I am out, almost always check the reputation of the cafes and beverage shop around the station before or while I go out, and then choose the one just follow my heart.", 6664, "7T53dkplaa", 0],

If you think it's too much, then don't order coffee from Starbucks! DUH!! Easy fix.  As for suing them for their caffeine amount, that's gotta be the most idiotic thinking I've come across in quite a while! What's next?

However, reducing your intake of fatty foods like fatty meat, hard cheese, cream and butter should help. So too should eating more fruit, vegetables and oily fish. You might find that following a largely vegan diet will help you but an ordinary omnivorous diet that avoided those foods that can increase cholesterol would be just as good.", 6659, "None", 4],

	46817 : ["  Yes cheese CAN BE good for you, contrary to what some have claimed. Yes it's true that moderation in everything is good. Also true, and on a far more widespread level is, no one answer that fits all. That can be further expanded to there's no one diet that fits all, contrary to any such claims otherwise. Even many nutritional experts will state the same thing. Of course the \"experts or gurus\" will say that this or that diet, will be healthy for everyone, and that the listed foods are edible for everyone. It dismisses many illnesses, diseases, or genetic inheritances, such as allergies, or say a genetic proclivity for high cholesterol. In fact there contrary to beliefs from the latter part of the 1960s through the mid part of the 1990s that dietary cholesterol was actually a major contributor to high cholesterol. However some will try to dismiss the findings from the mid 1990s through the 2010s as outdated science.   However while it's true, that cheese contains the essential nutrients, vitamin A, Vitamin B12, and K2, it also includes vitamin B1 and vitamin B6, along calcium, selenium, zinc and magnesium. However there are4 not only those with lactose who should or needs to avoid cheese, but also those who through a tick bite, specifically the lone star tick in the U.S., along with some of the other blood sucking parasites, contracted  the alpha gal antigen. Which fortunately is not known to be a lifelong affliction.  Diabetes and in particular type one is not caused by dairy. In fact there is not one shred of scientific medical evidence for. Type one diabetes is a genetically inherited disease. Type two can be because by many things, but once again the link between it and dairy doesn't actually exist. This is a myth that SOME vegans promote as a fact, and without any credible sources. The same with cancer, and osteoporosis, as per one claimant's false claims. Nor does it cause constipation in everyone or \"become a brick in you intestines if you eat to much\", I know better from firsthand experience. Nor are some has put it will cause cholesterol to build up in the heart. In fact it's actually only a very small percentage of the populace whom SOME fats such as found in cheese might build up.  Yet some, and specifically some within the vegan lifestyle and community who has unfortunately dismissed hard science, and decided opinion based pseudoscience is what is top be believed, and accepted as fact. There's become one glaring fact about nutritional science, that is due top to many self interest groups, the field of nutritional science has become more of a soft science, rather than a hard science. There are to many who wants their biased opinions held up as hard science fact, due to the fact that they constructed the \"study\", to yield the results they wanted the study to yield.", 6660, "MD1FznnXaa", 1],

	46819 : ["Fungi resemble neither animals nor plants. They are a separate and fascinating species unto themselves. Like plants, they live off nutrients in the soil, including sometimes animal manure.

It is transported as is, and you can imagine how that would be, right? The transportation costs are high. That's why the unnecessary water is removed to reduce the transportation cost. Unfortunately, some flavor and nutritional value is lost in the concentration process. For this reason, reduced concentrate juice has a slightly different flavor than freshly squeezed juice.
