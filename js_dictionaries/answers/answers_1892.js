The rabbit for the most part ignores him or sometimes lunges to tell him to back off, but ive never had a problem with them and would trust tat cat 100% around the rabbit. the other cat however is a big hunter and started stalking the rabbit, after a few weeks of me telling the cat off or shooing him away he seems to accept that the rabbit is a no chase zone. iwouldn'tt however trust him alone with her. isupposee what im saying is they are all different, most rabbits can hold their own against a cat but you do need to take into account the size and temperament of each animal.", 9735, "None", 0],

He's either an Australian or British guy living in San Angelo/Brownsville TEXAS, while bandwagoning the L.A. Lakers, and every word out of his mouth is either hypocritical and/or cruel. You should have seen the awful things he said last night to A Real Class Act in a question asked by Amber Cavs 2010 Champs.

He deleted his answer after getting shown up. But a few hours after that the whole question got removed anyway. BQ: How sad is it? I guess it's pretty sad. He does this every day, at least 10 hours a day. I would feel sorry for him if he wasn't so intentionally and unnecessarily mean. His only goal on here each day is to try to upset people. Very seldom does he ask a real question. ....

	100379 : ["First of all, lets tackle the all-controversial matter of disfellowshipping.  Whatever version you got was clearly pretty exaggerated.  Disfellowshipping is not any time we make a mistake.  Disfellowshipping is reserved only for EXTREME circumstances in which a person is engaging in a more serious kind of wrongdoing and refuses all help the elders give them.  First of all-and believe me, I'm laughing about this one-masturbation?  Really?  Every last one of us would be disfellowshipped.  The elders encourage us to try not to be overboard with our sexual desires, but they know it'll happen.  That is not something they even mention a lot.  When it comes down to things like a serious alcohol or pornography addiction, the elders are much more interested in helping people overcome their problem than punishing. The purpose of disfellowshipping is, not to punish, but to protect the congregation.  For example, if you've got some girl running around having sex with every guy in town, this of course is a bad example to the other girls, and next thing you know you've got a Hall full of sixteen and pregnant and probably plenty of stds along with it.  It also looks very badly on God if people live deliberately loose moral lifestyles and, honestly, why are you even in church at all if you aren't going to at least try to live by the Bible?  Everyone is protected and clean if such people are removed.  Even then, disfellowshipping can be only a very brief period of time if the person decides to correct whatever they've been doing.  This is also for their benefit, because nobody will correct a serious wrong if they don't understand there are consequences.  Again, these are only situations where somebody is badly endangering both themselves and the congregation.  Now then, about the whole social network thing.  Witnesses are never expected to disown their families, first of all.  Second of all, we are not taught to isolate ourselves.  What the elders warn us about is forming CLOSE friendships or associating excessively with others. They don't force us, but I can promise you they have good reason for telling us this.  I am a perfect example.  I had close friend in high school who wasn't a Witness.   Despite being \"Christian,\" she began getting into some very morally disturbing things and didn't care to leave me out of it.  I wished I'd listened.  Now, I have plenty of the greatest friends and family I could ask for, all of whom support my beliefs and encourage me to be the best I can be.  I by no means feel isolated by my faith.  The more I clean myself up, the better I feel.  I can honestly say there is no way I'd rather live, and while it is not easy, I much prefer my life living by Bible standards. Now then, on to the last point.  First of all, we are encouraged, not forced, to go in service.  Many people only go out for an hour or two on Saturday.  I know plenty of people who haven't been out in months. Now then, as for why we do this: simply put, Jesus told us to.  It is a simple, black and white command in Matthew 28:19, 20, as well as 2 Timothy 4:2-5.  As Christians, we have to have love for people, and we show that love by going to them.  And I resent the statement that we are door-to-door salesmen.  We don't make a single penny off anything we do.  It's all strictly to help people.  And it doesn't matter if the Mormons converted more people, if they are not teaching them actual Bible truths.   And I find it hard to believe that their ministry is more effective when we are the only religion preaching in 236 lands and in over 400 languages.    As one of Jehovah's Witnesses, having known both sides of life, I can say with full honesty that there is no way of ilfe that would ever make me happier.  There are no people that I'd ever love being around more, and there's nothing I'd rather be doing.  All the rules we live by are only what the Bible has laid out.  Our Creator, naturally, would know what's best for us, wouldn't he?  So it is no \"lack of freedom\" to live by the Bible.  My faith has never been a burden to me.  Its what makes me happy, and I can look every one of my friends and family in the eyes and say without doubt that it makes them happy, too.", 9737, "CWjv5O9raa", 4],
	100380 : ["Let me quote you \"What makes him a christian is that he sees the dirt upon his face and thus gives himself to God.\" Wouldn't you say that the key here is repentance? King David committed adultery and then murder in an attempt to cover it up, yet why did Jehovah forgive him? It was because that David was genuinely repentant and recognize that what he did was wrong and that he needed to change.After this episode David wrote Psalm 51. If you read that Psalm you can see what attitude a person must have to seek God's forgiveness. Compare this with the illustration that Jesus gave here: (Luke 18:9-14) 9 But he spoke this illustration also to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and who considered the rest as nothing: 10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself, ‘O God, I thank you I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week, I give the tenth of all things I acquire.' 13 But the tax collector standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward, but kept beating his breast, saying, ‘O God, be gracious to me a sinner.' 14 I tell YOU, This man went down to his home proved more righteous than that man; because everyone that exalts himself will be humiliated, but he that humbles himself will be exalted.” We all sin and fall short of God's perfect standards, but some are saddened by their shortcomings and try to practice what is right, while not repeating their mistakes. Their is a big difference between a person who commits a sin, and a person who practices sin; that is who deliberately commits the same sin over and over because they do not want to change, or admit that they are wrong. There were some in the first century like this. One group were those who had become apostates, or deliberate rebels against God, and those who represented him. Another group would be those who practiced fornication. This was not just simply a single act , but a willful course where they would repeat the same sins over and over. Jehovah is merciful , he forgives all who repent and sincerely make the effort to change their course of life to be approved by him. However he can not forgive those who continue on a course of deliberate rebellion against him and his standards because if he did that he would have to ignore his own standards of justice. Disfellowshiping is the last resort only if a person is going to continue in a bad course and is not repentant. Also even if a person is disfelloshipped they can still be reinstated later if they come to their senses and humble themselves. This not only helps them, but it also keeps the congregation clean. My mother was disfellowshipped for seven years, but after she realized what she needed to do she was reinstated.", 9737, "IO238yT2aa", 0],
