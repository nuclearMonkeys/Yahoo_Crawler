	72595 : ["Cardio is by far the best way to burn fat. Body builders avoid doing cardio because when you get up in the high levels of cardiovascular training, they conflict with weight training elements on a biological level.  Cardio metabolizes fat as an energy source during your runs(race pace) and if you work at the right vo2 max for long enough you can get an EPOC which is when your metabolism is raised so high during your workout that it takes 3 days to taper off completely, meaning you burn heaps of calories. A strength and conditioning coach once told me that the best way to strip fat off a body is to run, so even from a strength coach he'll still recommend cardio for fat burning.  As for having a higher metabolism from bigger muscles, yes that is true but it is not as effective as running. The bigger the muscles are the more energy it takes to keep them alive and sustain them. Keep in mind your BMR goes up doing cardiovascular activities too because your heart increases in size and needs more energy to pump larger amounts of blood out.", 8687, "nwQDMP2caa", 0],
	72596 : ["Fat does not really burn like people say. This is why people say it doesn't burn fat. Though once you have used up your carbohydrate intake you will start turning your fat into ketones which then your heart and brain uses then the rest they don't use you pee out.  Also muscle does help turn fat into ketones quicker but it isn't more effective since you are still using carbohydrates first as energy. Your body also uses protein and calcium along with other minerals and vitamins to contract your muscle but that is kinda irrelevant. You will use up your carbohydrates quicker doing cardio than you will strength training. That doesn't mean you should not do it though since muscle is necessary for your daily bodily function.", 8687, "LP6pMesJaa", 0],

If you eat once, then you must eat next after 4 hours. You must take breakfast regularly. In the night eat your food three hours before going to bed.  3) Walking is very good. You must walk as much as you can. Walk everywhere you can. Use of elevators and escalators must be reduced and instead of these you must climb stairs more often.

	72606 : ["The stratosphere is not cooling, if you graph global stratospheric temperatures up to the current date there has been no noticeable stratospheric cooling since 1993 which was associated with ozone depletion from volcanic SO2 emissions from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Thats almost fourteen years of warming, almost half the period that the consensus of AGW advocates are so sure of. Could the last fourteen tears of warming be associated with natural ozone recovery from Pinatubo and El-Chichon,? yes it could, the data from the stratosphere certainly does not support AGW, in my opinion. Ken: With all do respect, to take anything from the Stratosphere without acknowledging the major contamination of volcanic SO2 emmissions is an absolute joke.

In 2006 and 2007, his two better years, his defense too good, they forced the most 3 and outs and they made their team had the most time of possesion in those two years. Tony Romo can't do it by himself, and he's average at best, Palmer, Both mannings, Rivers, brees, Brady,Pennington and Cutler are all better than that guy so i don't know how he gets all this credit when he hasn't done much to prove it. Ill give it to him he is a pretty accurate passer and his girlfrien was hot, but other than that, whats he got that every other QB doesn't have?? And to the guy who said LT is overrated, the guy has his worst season ever after playing all year injured and he still rushes for 11yds, 4th in the AFC and 10th in the league. And the 7 seasons before that he produced over 1250s each year, how is that over rated?? Not to mention the first 5 years of his career the chargers were a one dimensional offense with a crappy o line that gave up the most sack 5 consecutive years.
