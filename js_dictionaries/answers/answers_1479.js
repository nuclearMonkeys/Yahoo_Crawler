For us, a wedding is a big huge thing. For men it's something else: A nightmare. My husband to be was completely panicked about getting married when we decided to do so and kept second guessing himself.  I was so excited that I was just bulldozing right in and making all these decisions and he was absolutely terrified. After a few of those conversations (Like your friend and her man) I figured out that it wasn't the BEING married that frightened him. It was the GETTING married. Men get a little crazy about weddings, they start thinking about their own futures and wondering if they can be a good husband and financially support themselves and their wives. It's a very deep seeded thing! I understand your friend is afraid he'll back out at the last minute, there are a lot of brides that are! That would probably be the worst blows our ego's could ever sustain and it'd crush us. The problem is, that by focusing on the possible negative outcomes and obsessing about them we are almost making it a self-fufilling prophecy.  She needs to be calm and think things through. I know she wants him to be involved but by asking him questions (even simple ones like ceremony location) it just heightens his own tension. She needs to be aware that they will probably h ave at least one huge fight and want to call off the wedding before all of this is over.

I would make her pay for it herself, or at least \"earn\" the procedure by helping me around the house a couple days a month, or something like that.  I don't see what the big deal is about the procedure, and I completely understand why you would want to be well-shaven even though you don't plan on exposing yourself inappropriately.

The other thing you can do, if you can't afford a waxing or if your mom won't let you, is get a bathing suit whose bottom has a little skirt, which would cover more of the upper thigh area.

I hope that when my daughter is around that age, she won't even bother shaving, because if you wax from the start of your hair removing days, the longer it takes for the hair to grow back. I can go for months w/o waxing because I've waxed since 14.

In his mind, automotive places tack on extra charges for women with ridiculous services that weren't even needed, expecting that they won't know the difference.   He was right, I've gone through this battle several times with various repair shops and dealerships, but most notably was this lube shop that tried to charge me 75 dollars to fix my carburetor. lol my car was fuel-injection.

Attorneys are licensed by each state, so you should contact that licensing authority by letter, enclosing a written \"time line\" and photocopies of all papers and bills and emails, etc.  To find the name and address of the licensing authority, go to the official state web site for your state and look for licensing of lawyers.  In Illinois it happens to be the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission, which is a part of the Illinois Supreme Court, but other states will have their own special names and addresses.  I urge you to look up the licensing authority and notify them about what happened on your case, and then let them take it from there.  He won't be disbarred unless he has a significant track record of that sort of behavior, but they will certainly notify him of the complaint and demand that he respond to the licensing authority about it.

They help more than you know! As far as a major, if you aren't confident in your talent that you would be able to out-shine all the other students who have been in theatre probably from a very young age, go for it! My advice though: I would major in something that you can make a living off of, possibly minor in theatre, and keep pursuing your theatre career WHILE working doing something else.

So a bikini wax might be roughly the same price or a little lower, depending on your location. I got mine in Bakersfield California, which is a lot lower in price than San Diego for example. I rather wax than to shave.  1) Shaving can cause cuts, nicks, razer burn and more opt to have ingrown hairs. 2) Shaving also cost a lot in razers after awhile. I rather get a Brazilian wax that last me 4 to 5 weeks than to shave every other day, switching out the razer blades each time.. 3) Waxing can cause burn and irritations for abit until your skin gets used to it. The first two wax's, I was very tender down there as it is ripping the hair out. So it is wise to not go swimming or apply lotion. Best to apply Aloe Vera, keep the area dry and to wear loose clothing (skirts, not tight pants or anything that can rub or cause more irritations to the skin).  It is best to do it a few days to a week before swiming or vacation. You don't want to get into lets say, chlorinated or the ocean the same or next day for example.  Ocean water is different from a salt water bath. if your skin feels hot after, bathe with a cold salt water solution regularly. It might sting a little but it will dye down and the aloe vera helps sooth it too. 4) Just like shaving, when the hair begins to grow back after a wax with in a few weeks, you can get itchy.  Sometimes I did and sometimes I didn't. Over all, it wasn't that bad. 5) Remember: Do exfoliate the area daily. There is also a special cream to help prevent ingrown hairs as well.  6) Sometimes you can experience hairs, especially small ones to surface after a week or two. That is normal and common.
