	79754 : ["It used to be weird, but that was around 40 years ago.  Ken was originally marketed to the guys, because guys often had sisters and / or female friends, and girls traditionally played with dolls.  Ken was a way for the guys to get in on the game.  Of course nature quickly took its course, and Ken became Barbie's unofficial boyfriend.  Mattel never marketed it that way, it just happened on its own. When I was a kid, boys were supposed to play with trucks and Lego and girls were supposed to play with dolls and tea sets.  Also when I was a kid, computers were the size of 18-wheelers and phones didn't work at all unless they were plugged in.   When I picked up my one son at preschool (over 10 years ago now) he and his buddies were playing dolls.  They had just fed and changed the baby, and were loading it into a stroller for a walk to the park.  My son interrupted one of them, saying \"You're doing it wrong, this is how my dad always does it with my brother\" and showed them how to support a baby's head while holding it.  When I mentioned this to the preschool teacher, she said \"Right, and I suppose you work 12 to 14 hour days in the field, while your wife stays home cooking and raising the kids?\", and she had a good point.  That thing she said was how real life had worked for centuries, but several revolutions (ie: industrial, electronic, digital, etc) had changed all that.", 9001, "M0akEw8Vaa", 0],

In response to the question, I'm reading a book by Christina Sommers about research conducted by numerous feminist organizations in the 80's and 90's painting a picture that female adolescents were being demoralized by a sexist educational agenda.  Now i've only just started but Sommers is tearing the research apart.  Studies done by the AAUW (American assoc. of University women), had been misleading at best.  The jist is that girls were already eclipsing boys in almost every area (except sports), and then this crisis was announced, which pumped millions into special educational treatment for girls and gender re-education for boys.

I'm sure that there are a few good feminist researchers, but I feel that the vast majority of them are already tainted as objective researchers by their undisguised bias and willingness to selectively analyze a situation in order to promote their narrow ideology. Let's face it-the language regarding the patriarchy has some serious conspiracy theorist undertones that have no place in academic research.  Granted, the only feminist papers I have read have been linguistic anthropological ones. It seemed that they were a bunch of angry women who had nothing better to do with their academic lives than selectively read medical textbooks and argue that the metaphors of sperm and eggs were degrading to women and re-affirming to men (no joke)....I also read one feminist article on how anorexia really is a girl's ambition to become a man. As someone who's suffered from anorexia-and knows that the disease not only does not involves a desire to be masculine but kills a quarter of its victims, I found that article to be offensively and ideologically exploitative of an already-suffering group of women (the irony does not escape me).

You might be allergic to something. I do know for sure though that the nausea is from the Tylenol 3.  Tylenol 3 contains codeine which causes nausea when taken without food.  Take it after eating and avoid moving around to much.  This will prevent nausea.  If nausea still occurs, lay down and wait, it should go away. The hospital is always open (at least the emergency room) and you might want to go.  Allergic reactions can be life threatening (your throat could swell blocking your air way) so i would go to the hospital as soon as possible, unless your sure that it is not getting worse.
