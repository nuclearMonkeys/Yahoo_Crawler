When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 2131, "None", -1],
	12703 : ["It does make you want to rub your eyes a little. The first thing your mind does is look for an explanation. I suppose that is normal but the explanations the mind comes out with are often weirder than the event itself. It's strange how the brain reacts to the impossible happening under your nose. One night at a friends home, a beer glass that had been put on the floor by the tv, suddenly tipped over nearly to a tipping point, it stayed there a second before falling back and revolving a second before sitting where it had been in the first place. My pal and I both saw it and were still there at around 4.30 AM trying experiments to try and make it happen again without success. He had twin daughters around 6 at the time and they had a hard life with a very strict mother. Also, one of them was very sickly with heart problems. Poltergeist activity is often reported in homes that have disturbed children, especially girls. I never saw anything else happen but it could have had something to do with the girls.", 2108, "P5CWQ2wMaa", 3],

	12708 : ["I can't tell you exactly what to do, I would find a therapist/psychiatrist and stick out to the end. I am saying this because you are graduating soon, and it sounds like you are clinically depressed. As for the nurse thing, you don't have to become a hospital nurse that works 24/7 like some of the comments are saying. You could work in one of those cute little doctor offices with quiet hours. Please reach out for help, you don't have to suffer alone. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder, but after I was put on meds I feel so much better. Those thoughts you're having is the anxiety/depression talking. Also please ignore the troll comments. I get them all the time and they mean nothing.

	12710 : ["Yes. Except for those few which are diesel hybrids. Also except for some plug-in hybrids; they have larger capacity traction batteries than regular hybrids, typically with a 20 to 40 mile battery range the original plug-in Prius only had a pathetic 10 mile range), and so if run only on battery power can get away with never needing to be refuelled. In reality if plug-in hybrid drivers want to use the heater then they need fuel to run the engine just to provide the waste heat necessary for that. A regular hybrid must use fuel as the battery only gets charged by recovering energy from braking (regenerative braking) and by running the engine directly as a generator. The traction battery on a regular hybrid only has power to go between a few hundred yards up to about a mile or so.", 2129, "gjUpsUZAaa", 2],

	12719 : ["1. Wear hand protection, like gloves, to do dirty jobs. Or even not so dirty jobs. It's old fashioned but not incorrect to don the white gloves when you leave the house. And it allows you to gracefully deal with any messes life might hand you.  2. Keep them cut short and wash your hands frequently, scrubbing under your hands with a brush and/or cleaning under your nails with a wooden \"orange\" stick. Yeah, use a nail file tip, tooth pick, whatever if you must. Better than dirty nails. 3. Daily shampoos that also clean your nails. If you don't shampoo that often, then a 3 minute soak in warm soapy water followed by a scrub and nail cleaning.  That daily soak might sound like a lot, but think about what kinds of awful stuff your hands may encounter as you go about your daily activities!

	12736 : ["YA was a game on the one hand, i knew i was wasting my time. For serious questions i often comitted an hour of tedious research and forming my answers to be most readable. i was in love with the old Green Yamster. When it went to Purple, i needed a new computer to handle the added graphics and necessary browser to support it. I quit for 6 months and finally had the extra necessary to get one. I was about level 4 at the time. The new purple format seemed less friendly, took longer to load, caused me to buy more bandwidth. Then, i got sloppy and started screwing with it. I would give canned refferences and that got me canned. Gosh, i got insulted! After all the time and attention i'd put into it? But then i realized i had picked up a troll. It took me 2 months of faithful appeais to get my old place back. I started 2 other accounts AND MADE FRIENDs pursuing the problem. I had gone overboard, but it got to where i learned to appreciate trolls for their strange ways, really. I also learned how not to feed them. When i got kicked off YAs, it took me a month just to figure out what i had done to cause it. The major hit that caused me to find Quora was how i started losing my work. Quora had a way of keeping incomplete answers safe, no matter what, and that alone caused me to abandon my old YA fascination. The other thing was their inability to appreciate my sincerity when they tossed my level 7 housekeeping options. I had certain areas i was good at and tried to help keep them organized once in a while. I saw the many problems of mischif by angry souls and had those tricks played on me too.

Even if you finish nursing school and go on to become a nurse, you will find that your work won't be any easier. Nurses work long hours, often have rotating shifts, and have to deal with all kinds of hazardous situations such as infectious diseases, sharp or pointed equipment, body fluids, mistakes being made, out of control or unruly patients, and seeing people die. It's a career that has a high burnout rate. I used to have four neighbors who were nurses and all of them had quit or been transferred by the time I moved away.
