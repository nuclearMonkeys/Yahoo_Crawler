	105310 : ["is thhis the car the FAQS page shows details of the cars. Straker's and Foster's futuristic automobiles were originally designed by Derek Meddings for the movie DOPPELGANGER (aka JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN), and were redressed slightly for UFO. Life-sized clay models were built by German auto manufacturer designers, and then racing car driver Alan Mann built the cars for 8500 pounds each. The cars were constructed using beaten aluminum on top of a Mark 4 Ford Zodiac chassis (predecessor to the Granada). The gull-wing doors didn't actually work, so someone always stood off-camera to raise or lower the doors. The actors reported that the cars were very unpleasant to drive in, as there was not enough headroom and the engine exhaust fumes spilled into the interior. Also, the cars could not move very fast, so many scenes were sped up to simulate a fast-moving vehicle. In the years since UFO was made, the cars have changed hands a number of times. Straker's car was owned by Radio One DJ Dave Lee Travis in the 1970's. In 1980, the car was bought by someone in Birmingham who had it repainted with scenes from UFO, and then let it sit in a warehouse for years. He eventually gave it away to one of his employees, who in turn has let the car rust away in his back yard. To make matters worse, he eventually built a garage next to his house which prevents the car from being removed without a crane, and has no particular interest in ever restoring or selling the car to someone else! After UFO, Foster's car was originally sold to a film company which removed the scoops and slats and painted it red for a futuristic porn movie. It was later purchased in 1982 by film buff who made the car driveable and actually used it as his personal transportation for 18 months!  It was then damaged in the front and ignored until 1993, when it was purchased by UFO fan Tony Read. 12. Why does everyone drive on the wrong side of the road? In England, people drive on the left side of the road and steering wheels are on the right side of the vehicle. However, in UFO's version of 1980s England, both of these have been reversed. Although I am not aware of an official explanation for this, it seems likely that UFO's creators were simply going along with what was being predicted at the time, which was that England would switch their driving system sometime in the near future. It's interesting to note that other Anderson series like CAPTAIN SCARLET also show reversed driving in futuristic England, and that UFO's several flashbacks to 1970 shows normal English driving and cars. this site may ahve some info 00000000000000000000000000000000 Do have a link to the Itv.com site where Secret Squirrel could watch the episode. well done", 9919, "IU6jtoSgaa", 0],

No need to ask. 2-5 don't apply to me 6.) Have you ever answered a “ Give me a plot,” idea? What did you answer back with? Depends on my mood. I haven't been on too much lately... Sometimes a simple 'do it yourself.'  Sometimes I whip up a bs plot for my own amusement...usually the exact opposite of what the asker  wants. They say no romance or horror.

Are you disappointed with the lack of hard work with coming up with ideas when you see a “ I need a plot” question? ( rate 1-5.) Probably a 3. It used to really wind me up. I'd see one of those questions on every other page and I'd say to myself, \"Well, the next generation is screwed.\" But recently it's become quite common, so it doesn't really bother me. Probably the best word to descibe my reaction would be, 'Meh'. 8.) Do you believe in those people who blame their inability to come up with a plot on “writer's block.” ( give me an opinion.) If the question is worded nicely and has no spelling mistakes, then yes, I don't mind. I get writer's block frequently, and it's a massive pain. However, if the question is something like, \"Gve me a plot plz i have writers bloc help plz\", then it is impossible for me to take them seriously.  9.) What do you want to see more of in the future with \"give me a plot,\" questions? ( i.e: they aren't asking for a full plot or et cetera.) I wouldn't mind it if they just asked for a short stimulus.
