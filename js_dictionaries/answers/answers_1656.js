	88466 : ["Hair isn't alive and it doesn't grow. Hair is an accumulation of a protein called keratin inside the follicle. As it builds up on the bottom it is pushed out the top, creating \"hair growth\". This is a biological process so nothing that you do to your hair, like trimming it or using some \"special\" shampoo can help. Eat a healthy, protein rich diet and take a regular multivitamin daily. Since hair is protein, eating foods rich in protein like peanut butter, eggs, and fish can help to accelerate growth.  Do not take prenatal vitamins, despite what some uneducated people here may say, taking too many vitamins can do serious damage to your organs, cause arthritis, and can even cause death. It isn't \"just extra nutrients,\" it is deadly so don't believe it. I don't mean to sound negative, but this is serious and I don't want to see people get hurt for long hair!  So no shampoo (including Mane n' Tail!) can, in any way, accelerate hair growth. Hair growth is almost entirely genetic, and a little bit diet, so all that you can do it change your diet. Split ends cause breakage on the bottom of your hair, not at the base. Hair is an inanimate strand of protein, nothing that you do to the bottom if it can have any effect on the top of it. So again, trimming your hair has no effect on growth! Hair does not grow from the ends, it grows from the root!   Hair growth is entirely biological and has nothing to do with the hair that you already have, so having healthy hair DOES NOT mean that it will grow faster. If you want healthy hair, avoid heat at all costs and get a salon quality shampoo and conditioner, wash the conditioner out with cold water.", 9296, "yLEn91R5aa", 2],
	88467 : ["this question seems (to me) to be an excellent way of asking which pile of crap smells greater beneficial. Detroit confirmed some promise final season yet then rapidly resumed the identity of a stinking pile. they have confirmed some promise however, and the QB has been notably formidable in how solid he thinks they are. with a bit of luck for Lions followers he seems to be greater beneficial than in basic terms crap with concepts-set. i will flow with the Lions.", 9294, "EbR06sKHaa", 0],

	88470 : ["These are the facts. I am an atheist of some 53 years standing (and sitting and lying down). I do not need an invisble and silent supposed supernatural entity to define how I live my life. I do not need the fear of a non-existent hell in order for me to behave in a civilised manner. It comes naturally. Religion is a curse upon mankind. For any christians, or even muslims, reading this, do try researching the Egyptian god Horus and see, maybe for your first time ever, where your cloned religion actually originated. Then out your brain to work and re-think your stance. This could be the first step towards accepting reality. This could change your life.", 9298, "None", 4],
	88471 : ["How could I deny it. I really don't know what you mean by objective morality.  I believe we have evolved to have empathy. I believe there are objective logical truths (mathematics and logic ) which we apply to ethics because we have that evolved empathy. Without an explicit definition of what you mean by objective morality it is hard to answer the question. I don't believe in an imaginary god. But I do believe there are objective truths. If there is an objective morality it certainly is NOT the Christian moralty which has no problem with slavery but clearly states that working on Sunday is expressly forbidden.", 9298, "None", 3],
	88472 : ["The very fact that you have a sense of morality at an instinctive level should tell you that it is a product of evolution.  Take a look at all social animals, they tend to exhibit many of the same morals that we do, if not to a higher degree.  In species that fight over a spouse, the combat is terminated prior to death, even though it could continue.  Chimps practice cannibalism, but only on  defeated enemies.

	88478 : ["Your hair does grow a little faster in the summer....But lets face it.  Hair realistically grows 6 inches a year and that's on a healthy head.....So be patient...Keep it in good shape. Moisturize it.... Keep the chemicals down to a minimum.  Cutting it does not make it grow faster.....but it does keep the ends from splitting up the shaft and it does make the hair feel thicker....So A little trim ( just a tiny bit) every 6 weeks will help.......But in the mean time be creative, get a cute  hair piece or some scarves  make it look sleek and cool one day and funk it up on another.............and before you know it it will be down to your shoulders...............good luck,", 9296, "fdcc3814a3f9d254e19945306a41cd85aa", 1],

Most of the people who answered this don't realize how good Arizona's passing game was. Lets see #1 in the NFC!!! with  277.3    yards per game. They were almost last in rushing.

	88483 : ["well... i'm gonna give this a pretty short answer... i think there is such a thing as objective morality, because of our shared human experience allows us empathy. a good action is that which reduces human suffering, and a bad one is that which increases it. sorting out the proper course of action is often tricker than that, though - but that's the \"rule\" I go by. there are definately actions that are good-- those which give aid to other people while harming no one else, that is the ideal.. and then there are evil actions, actions which harm many others for the benefit of the few, without any pressing need to do so.", 9298, "OIt4KaNHaa", 2],
	88484 : ["So basically, you're saying that without the threat of some supernatural being looking over your shoulder, you can't behave yourself. Well, don't project that onto the rest of society. People had consciences before they ever dreamed up any gods, and it only takes a little empathy, intelligence, and common sense to discern right from wrong.  That's how a society functions without leafing through some ancient book of scriptures every time it needs to pass a law. Societies share common societal values. If you don't have those, you are, by definition, antisocial. And if you think that only God's laws count, then you are indeed antisocial. I don't need a god to tell that me killing and stealing are wrong. I'm sorry that you do.  Besides, history has shown all too painfully that belief in gods has never stopped people from torturing and killing. Those things have often been done in the name of gods. And do you really want to take your morality from Bible God? Well, then, you'd better be prepared to stone your children to death when they mouth off at you. Or be prepared to die yourself if you do any work on the Sabbath. Assuming you're female, I hope you don't speak in church, either. Thanks, but I'll stick with my own common sense. And I'm happy to rely on human-appointed cops and judges to take care of society's ruffians. If you want to live in a country where right and wrong are dictated by religion, I think there are several Middle Eastern countries that might appeal to you.  I've never killed anyone. I've never stolen. I've never thrown a punch in my life. I don't get drunk. I've never used illicit drugs. I don't cheat on my taxes, or my wife. I give to charity. And I do all this without believing in a personal god who will judge me when I die. Imagine that.", 9298, "MKLUsAqgaa", 10],
