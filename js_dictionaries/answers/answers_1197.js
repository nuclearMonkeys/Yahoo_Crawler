This period of time, the last two years, also inflicted amount-less pain to the American workers, resulting is a beaten and low economy, high prices, job loss, payroll decrease, and so forth. This is not to say that the institution of the President is mistake-free, nor it can be used as an argument to defend the poor leadership of our president; however it serves as a good indicator, related to the times of the current and past events, to show that Congress indeed isn't doing its job, and this is the Democratic Congress, which has a much lower support than Bush does. Bush's approval rating is in the late twenties, which is pretty bad certainly. However, with a nine-percent approval rating, the Congress of today is the loss of democracy in the United States.

Transgender (pronounced /trænzˈdʒɛndər/) is a general term applied to a variety of individuals, behaviors, and groups involving tendencies to deviate from the normative gender roles. Transgender is the state of one's \"gender identity\" (self-identification as woman, man, neither or both) not matching one's \"assigned sex\" (identification by others as male, female or intersex based on physical/genetic sex). \"Transgender\" does not imply any specific form of sexual orientation; transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, or asexual; some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The precise definition for transgender remains in flux, but includes: \"Of, relating to, or designating a person whose identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female gender roles, but combines or moves between these.\" \"People who were assigned a sex, usually at birth and based on their genitals, but who feel that this is a false or incomplete description of themselves.\"  \"Non-identification with, or non-presentation as, the sex (and assumed gender) one was assigned at birth.\" A transgender individual may have characteristics that are normally associated with a particular gender, identify elsewhere on the traditional gender continuum, or exist outside of it as \"other,\" \"agender,\" \"Genderqueer,\" or \"third gender\".
