	91382 : ["Thanks, Isis! First of all, most vets don't have a clue about basic dog obedience and/or training.  And most have absolutely no clue about wolf dog behaviour.   Vets treat animals who are in need of medical treatment.  The people to speak to are the ones who deal with wolves and wolf dogs on a daily basis.  That is why I'm writing. The guy you met obviously wasn't at ALL prepared for his wolf dogs in the least.  Even if this did happen - and let it be known, it was HE who failed his dogs - it was all fault of his own.  Period. Yes, it is common for wolf dogs, once they reach the age of maturity (two yrs and up) will start to become a little more dominant to certain degrees depending on wolf content.  It's not uncommon, really, and that's all that it is.   \"Turning on you\" is not the correct term nor description.  This term just implies that it was a sudden, unwarranted, vicious behavioral change that happened at the drop of a dime!  It doesn't happen like that.  Ever.  What I would give to be in your shoes at that very moment...   Read the sites one poster provided, you will read that this is not uncommon, but is 100% preventable.  But what annoys me more is this guy having the audacity to share his ignorance with you.  Has he no shame?!   People fail these dogs constantly.  I KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND!  But, he actually admitted his failure as if to say that this will, without a doubt, happen to you, too.  I hate people that fail their dogs then turn around and BLAME the dog!   Look.  Koah is young.  Realistically speaking this *may* happen, meaning he WILL mature and the possibility of him showing his dominance is there, absolutely.  But the signs are early-on, and if you are in-tune enough with Koah and have educated yourself enough to recognize the signs, you will notice it and use the proper measures to prevent this from happening.   You don't just wake up one morning and your dog is lunging at your throat.  There are obvious warning signs, and from what you have said, Koah is not exhibiting these signs just yet... but he's still young. Neutering him will help prevent this in the early stages.   This is the first step that you should take.   Have you considered purchasing some books on-line regarding wolf dogs?  These books are written by individuals who have spent countless years with wolves and wolf dogs.  They are full of valuable information that I honestly feel you could refer to as the time passes with Koah.  In all honesty, Yahoo Answers is not the place to seek valuable advice when it comes to wolf dog behaviour.  I've seen some really bad advice that could turn to be detrimental to both you and Koah.  I would hate to see this!  A good example is God's Girl telling you that you must be Alpha.  Bad, bad advice.  If you go into a relationship with a wolf dog such as Koah with this type of mentality, you'll lose.  And fast.   It's more of an earned trust that you must establish in your relationship with Koah in the early months.   Only with trust comes leadership.  And only then will Koah see you as his leader.     Some great books are written by Dorthy Pendergrast, Nicole Wilde, Jim and/or Jamie Dutcher, Barry Lopez and anything written by David Mech. I've had the pleasure of being along-side David Mech, and speaking directly with Nicole Wilde and the Dutchers.  Awesome REAL people who have a genuine respect, love and admiration of wolves. Just do your research, visit refuges either in person or on-line.  Talk to the directors of these sanctuaries - we WANT to help.  And most of all, consider the source, always. Feel free to email me any time if you ever have questions, I'd be more than happy to help. ADD:  Wallflower, you said \"Since your dog is a 50/50 or more mix - considered \"low content\"\"  Do your own reseach into filial content, please.  A 50/50 mix of a wolfdog bred to another 50/50 wolfdog will produce 50/50.  Yes.  They will be very dog-like. A wolf bred with a dog will also produce 50/50 pups, but these pups will be first generation wolf dog, and VERY much so, wolf.  These would be considered high content. 50/50 means NOTHING unless you know lineage of parents, and filial content of wolf dog.", 9386, "None", 4],

	91384 : ["Yeah, your \"VOLVO\" mechanic is CLUELESS!!! FUel pumps eitther work or they don't. There is no in between. Fuel is constantly cycled from engine to tank as you drive and filtered CONSTANTLY! Fuel sloshing in the tank is ridiculous unless the pickup shriveled. Most prroblems lioke yours are due to  a CLOGGED UP FLAME TRAP, which is the Euro replacement for a PCV valve, and a dirty THROTTLE BODY and IDLE AIR CONTROl valve! The IAC is removable on VOLVO engines for cleaning up,and the FLAME TRAP is underneath the intake manifold. It collects sludg and harmful oil contaminants as you drive. If you have NOT been using the appropraite genuien Volvo approved synthetic engine oils, the FLAME TRAP will be FULL of junk and waste. Your fuel metering will suffer, and the engine will stall from low speed running. Your \"VOLVO\" tech should know this by heart!!! >>>>>ANSWER>>>>>Take $20 to the neearest oil change center, and have them remove yoru IAC valve for clean-up and clean your THROTTLE BODY to SHOWROOM floor CLEAN!!! The IAC fine tunes the AIR protion of your fuel mixture based upon siggnals from your O2 sensors. Using inferior wax based oil will INSURE that that you have trouble with your engine sneors with time. Switch over to MOBIL ONE 0W-40 oil, which is one fo the approved European engine oils. The factory fill is PENTOSIN oil, which is harder to find but WORTH it!. Another GREAT oil is TOTAL ENERGY oil from France. NEVER get generic oil changes from oil that gets pumped ffrom the ceilings of most oil change cetners. you will SUFFER in power loss, economy and emissions. many times, it will cost youa dirty converter as you drive on!!! POWER WASH your engine to get things SHOWROOM, since clean engines dissipate ehat more evenly and help prevent the formation of HOT sludgy deposits. If you REALIZE that you have been using improepr waxx based oil, then consider a full MOTOR FLUSHING to remove the junk cheap oil have made in there. Once your engine is cleaned up, and your IAC is, too. install a set of BOSCH IRIDIUM spark plugs, to get the most power and economy from EACH stroke of your pistons! The theory you are holding to is simply NOT TRUE!!! >>>>Remove and clean the fflame trap or replace it!! Your engine cannot BREATH the way it is supposed to if it is clogged up. use AMSOIL FOAMING CLEANER to get the cleaning done, and send me check for $500 for my advice! (just joking although i accept checks) GOOD LUCK< and keep that engine CLEAN!!", 9395, "HFrsH9MRaa", -2],

	91390 : ["Hello Annie, firstly there's no point in getting the new 3G Kindle now as they limit what web sites you can access (only Amazon store and Wikipedia are allowed.) Then, you need to understand that Kindle Touch ($139 without ads) or Nook Simple Touch ($99 without ads) are e-Ink devices for reading and not video/web/apps while Kindle Fire or Nook Tablet are LCD/IPS screen devices for video/web/apps but not too much for reading. Non-touch screen Kindle models are such basic stone age devices (with page turn lag, buttons, and black blinks/flashes on each page turn) that I would not even speak about them - when you read a book do you flip pages or press buttons? Nook (unlike Kindle) supports eBooks in ePub format that is the universal format most used in the world. Current e-Ink Nook Simple Touch has the latest generation touch screen display, no page turn lag, it weights less, its battery lasts twice as long (two months on one charge), it has microSD slot and it doesn't blink on each page turn - much better than current Kindle 3 or Kindle Keyboard. Nook Touch is still better designed than even the new Kindle Touch with battery lasting two months with ONE hour reading a day with Wi-Fi off thus it's still twice as long as new Kindle's two months with HALF and hour a day with Wi-Fi off. Nook Touch and Nook Color and Tablet (unlike Kindle) have microSD card slot to take a card (class 6 or above) up to 32 GB.  For entertainment, Nook Tablet is $224 if sign up for Barnes & Noble membership or $250 without signup. Nook Tablet is clearly the superior device over Kindle Fire. Not just 11.5 hours battery life but 9 hours of video playback time - that's vs. 8 hours for reading and  7.5 hours of video playback on Kindle Fire. 1.0 GB RAM Vs. 512 MB RAM of Kindle Fire, 16 GB content capacity plus 32 GB via microSD card vs. 8 GB capacity of Kindle Fire with no expansion slot. Fully laminated HD screen for reduced glare vs. no lamination of Kindle Fire. Bulit-in and optimized Netflix and Hulu plus with millions of movies/shows vs. 100K movies/shows of Amazon store.  Nook Tablet has built-in mic for Skype voice conferencing and dictations to speech recognition software and physical volume controls on the side (Not on Kindle), very smooth video playback with excellent screen, and very fast apps load. Nook already has Cloud as all eBooks in your online library are stored there as well as downloaded to your device.  Also, If you walk in with the Nook to Barnes & Noble store, you're allowed to read ANY available eBook for free while in the store via free provided in the store Wi-Fi and you get free technical support in case of issues in any of the store.  You can buy Nook's at Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Millon, Walmart, BestBuy, Staples, OfficeMax, Fred Mayer, P.C. Richard, Radio Shack, Target, Fry's, Kmart, Sears etc. stores and web sites. Sample pro review: PCWORLD: The Nook Tablet's unique display has less reflectivity than the Kindle Fire's, and so is easier to read. In addition, some fonts and videos render more sharply on it than on the Fire. The dual-core 1GHz Texas Instruments OMAP 4 CPU and 1GB of RAM made switching from app to app a breeze, with little lag or stuttering. Movies played smoothly and stutter-free in Netflix, and the high-definition images re-rendered for Nook's 1024-by-600-pixel display looked lovely, with terrific contrast. The Nook Tablet's display was dazzling overall. The screen's glare was minimal, thanks to what Barnes & Noble calls its VividView display. The IPS display is laminated and bonded; so unlike on other tablets's displays--including the Kindle Fire's--there's no annoying, visible air gap between the glass screen and the LCD beneath.", 9397, "None", -1],
