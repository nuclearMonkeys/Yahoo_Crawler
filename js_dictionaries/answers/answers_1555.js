Every one knows that the GOP likes the competiton, the challenge, of winning elections but they can't govern worth a darn.  They've never learned that government isn't business and doesn't exist for the sole benefit of business.  It's all about power relations and those of business are exactly the opposite of those of our government.  Business operates like a monarchy with power at the top.

	83431 : ["Obama's ‘Masterful Rope-a-Dope' Against Boehner, Tea Party What you are now witnessing is the most masterful rope-a-dope ever performed by a president against an opposition party in Congress. It began months ago… Joe Biden then lead negotiations with House Republicans about how to find a compromise position on the White House position of doing nothing but raising the debt ceiling and the Republicans position of cutting $4 trillion in spending while raising the debt ceiling. Biden and House Democrats then rope-a-doped the Republicans into weeks of discussions over trillions of dollars of spending cuts. And during that time, Democrats appeared to be increasingly willing to go along with trillions of dollars of spending cuts — possibly as much as three trillion. Then Biden and the President insisted that there be at least a trillion in tax revenue increases and Republican Eric Cantor fell for the Obama ultimatum and walked out of the talks doing exactly what the President wanted him to do because Cantor was thereby proving to the country once again that President Obama was willing to be much more flexible and reasonable in these negotiations and compromises with Republicans than Republicans were willing to be with the President. Specific policy issues aside, President Obama has already won the public contest of who appears to be more reasonable and he won that weeks ago. And: O'DONNELL: The more President Obama pushes for the $4 trillion package, the more Boehner retreats from it. The President is finally capitalizing on a phenomenon that has been obvious from the start of his presidency: if he is in favor of something then the Republicans are opposed — it's as simple as that. Here is the President embracing the Republicans number so now the Republicans must be against their own number. This, THIS! is a work of strategic brilliance by the President.", 9130, "None", -1],
	83432 : ["Cantor is unstable psychologically...an egomaniac trying to usurp House Speaker Boehner's authority, and he lies.  He should be excluded from all further meetings---especially because he is what the Market people call \"short\" (he has bet that the economy will fail, like the derivatives-betting banksters betting against the bad loans they'd made between 2001 and 2008 that led to the housing market COLLAPSE from which we are still trying to recover). Republicans are being DRACONIAN---they do NOT want to create jobs or generate revenues by allowing the nation-destroying budget-ballooning UNPAID-FOR Bush tax cuts to return to the same 39% rate they were before the right-wingers took us all on a devastating (fiscally insane) corporate-colluding DETOUR into financial CHAOS (Klein, 2007; Krugman, 2008; Picker, 2009).  Have you bothered to look at the specific DETAILS of what the GOP's corporate-raiding travesty of justice they call a \"budget\" entails?  President Obama had his economic experts go over our budget with a fine-toothed comb and came up with more than $4.5 TRILLION in tax cuts that would not devastate our country's seniors, disabled, public school system, children, preschoolers, social safety nets, food safety standards, water safety standards, etc.---all things the teabagging evangelicals for whom Cantor speaks want to slash without once considering ways to INCREASE REVENUES!   Polling shows that the public trusts President Obama by a whopping 69% over the right-wing Republicans who got us into these messes in the first place, who rate around 27%.

	83433 : ["Okay........Here is how it stands.  Obama wants the debt ceiling raised but the Houses do not want to do that unless Obama raises taxes or cuts spending.  We are still in a recession and raising taxes right now would be the worst thing to do. Obama is not talking about just Millionaires and Billionaires, he is talking about taxing the Middle Class.  Trust me $250,000 a year is not rich if you are a Fireman and your wife a school teacher in Vermont sending 2 kids to college.  Those are middle class people. Then again Obama will not put in writing the spending cuts he will make if he gets this debt ceiling raised. He wants to kick the can down the road. Most Americans say NO to the debt ceiling being raised without substantial spending cuts.  So there you have an impasse.... Both sides are not willing to budge.  This will be Obama's disaster if he allows us to default by being hardheaded. He is acting like a spoiled brat on the play ground.", 9130, "b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa", -1],

They do offer a free paid app a day, which I enjoy.  You can also side load apps from the Android Market or root your device so that you have better access to the Android Market. Amazon also offers a wide range of music that you can purchase for your device.  Or you can get a good You Tube app to stream You Tube videos.  Another thing to think about is the $79 a year Amazon Prime that allows you access to the Amazon Lending Library and lets you stream unlimited movies and TV shows. I suggest visiting the Amazon site and reading what they have to say about their device and reading the reviews that people have written.  I can tell you that it was worth it for me.
