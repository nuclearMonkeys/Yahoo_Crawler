	35235 : ["1. Fury is not mediocre. He outboxed Wladimir Klitschko and is a really talented fighter. Deontay may have been a touch overrated but he built up a rep fighting some decent fighters. Was he ever in the league of ali, hell no. But remember, Tyson lost to buster Douglas and I'd put wilder ahead of buster. If the peak Tyson turns up, Tyson wins. If the Tyson that lost to Douglas, commander cranium and lennox turns up, wilder wins. If wilder fought Liston, it would depend on how much Liston has been bunged (yes I do believe he took money to take a dive in the 2nd Ali fight). However Liston Kos him Edit - I agree on Wlad. But he was the best around at the time. He was king at a time the heavys were weak. End of the day though he was the best and fury outboxed him becomming the best. Fury is number 1 in the world at the moment. Calling him mediocre is a joke. Wlad was better than Buster Douglas (who beat Mike Tyson)", 5301, "TdmTjKt8aa", 0],

	35245 : ["Even those you'd struggle. Bloodyelbow did a cracking study on purses for boxing fights (link in source). Very few fighters earn decent money. 95% of all income for fights was in the top 10 % of money. In a study of 1225 fights, the average purse for a fight was $67000.. The median purse for a fight was $2000. Now thats before training expenses, trainers cut, promoters cut, travel expenses etc... Bloodyelbow also did a similar study for MMA (link below) and it don't make great reading. This includes UFC, bellator and other fights. 855 fights in the study.... The average purse was 20556. The median was $1250 again prior to expenses. 10% of all fighters only made $1000. In UFC it gets better, the average fighter makes $138000 pre bonuses etc. So if you are a great fighter, yes you will make millions in MMA and boxing.
