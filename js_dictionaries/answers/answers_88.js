	4404 : ["A neon lamp is a special animal device. If you apply a DC voltage across it's terminals you can slowly increase the voltage until it reaches a flash point where it ignites into conduction. If you then decrease the voltage it will drop lower and lower until it extinguishes. The flash point can be 70 volts while the extinguish point is 20V. In your circuit shown, if the current through the resistor is less than the Lamp current. the lamp will pull current from the cap until it drops below the extinguish point. Then the lamp will go out and the current through the resistor charges the cap up to 70V again when the lamp lights up again. The flash rate is controlled by the lamp, R and C. It is called a relaxation oscillator.", 742, "a8pRDaIyaa", 0],

	4450 : ["Not \"experts\" but one guy who is pushing Ivermectin as a drug to treat COVID. Hardly an expert if you read his criticisms of the COVID vaccine he is wrong about most of what he stated. Some of his criticisms can apply to all vaccines and so the guy is clueless about mRNA vaccines for which he is not an expert in. He sounds like an antivaxxer. Anybody who would push Ivermectin is an antivaxxer. Just to give you one example. He states that we are creating all these asymptomatic cases out there because of the vaccine and that is terrible. He gets this from the fact that the vaccine prevents hospitalizations and death. The guy's an idiotic for thinking that somehow this is wrong. Duh!!!! That's the whole point of making vaccines is to prevent people from getting sick and dying. Even Edward Jenner from 1800 would consider him an idiot. Edit The guy is full of it. He is just jealous because his technology is old and outdated. He had nothing to do with mRNA vaccines plus he is an eccentric pushing out of mainstream treatments. \"The vaccine not only produces neutralizing antibodies but also activates cellular immunity through killer T cells. \" \"Evidence supports both T and B cell responses to the three leading vaccines\" \"These studies and others31012 offer strong evidence that T cell immune responses are sustained, even in the face of declining or undetectable antibodies, implying that some immunity persists. It is possible, but as yet unconfirmed, that immunity might last even longer, as T cell responses to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been found several years after infection.13 The evidence from new studies, interim results from phase III vaccine trials, and previous data from phase I and phase II trials support the notion that memory T cell responses to the vaccines, along with B cell antibody responses, should provide good and possibly enduring immunity to SARS-Cov-2. This, together with continuing public health measures, should help lay a pathway out of the pandemic.\" Edit 2 I just read more and his full comments which clearly indicate he is a proponent of letting the virus have it's way and allow herd immunity take its course from there. The guy is more than willing in allowing millions of people to die. That is why he wants people to stop taking the vaccine. He considers it a mild disease that most people don't have to worry about. Just another nut case herd immunity proponent.", 738, "0nyWiro9aa", 2],
