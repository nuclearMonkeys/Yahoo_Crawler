	94755 : ["Hi, I would go for the later model, D60.  You have a few more pixels squeezed out of essentially the same sensor, dust cleaning, slightly higher frame rate, stop motion movie and a few more \"creative\" features which only you can decide if you need.  But you are right, its basically the same body - same size and weight. The only feature both of these lack, for me, is no exposure or white balance bracketing.  This is available on most of the same price-point Canons - the Xti for example.  Exposure bracketing is useful for HDR images for example. I am a Canon user, so would tend towards it but honestly, they are all fine cameras for the price. As for your price indications, on-line you could get a better deal.  I have bought a bunch of new kit from ebay sellers, and providing you use someone with both a high number of transactions, and a high positive rating, I would have little hesitation in going for it. The 2 links below give an idea of what you might get for the money (both include a front lens converter which is probably not worth much) - but have a look anyhow. Good luck!

	94756 : ["Both the D60 and D40 are great cameras. I have a Nikon D60 and I love it. It takes awesome pictures and is easy to learn. My mother in law used my camera once and she loved it so much that 1 week later she went out and bought herself one.  I got my camera last year on ebay and it was the best decision I made. It was cheaper than getting it on amazon at the time. I hope this helps. Have fun shopping =)", 9520, "zz5t5O6Aaa", 0],
	94757 : ["Mind training, including meditation, can help stabilize your mind in the long term, but in the short term, when you first begin to practice, meditation can be very unsettling. You should find an experienced meditation instructor to help you get started. If lovingkindness, or bodhichitta, is what you wish to cultivate, including lovingkindness toward yourself, I suggest you read The Wisdom of No Escape and the Path of Loving-kindness by the Buddhist nun Pema Chodron. Look in your local phone book for a Shambhala Centre or other Buddhist centre in your area. A Shambhala Centre will offer you meditation instruction for no charge, and their meditation instructors will be able to help with any problems that may arise as your practice progresses. Good luck.", 9518, "b849wydSaa", 1],
	94758 : ["Buddhism will help you to better understand any predicament or situation or any person. This is because Buddhism, especially through meditation, tunes your listening to within you, not outside of you. Because everything and everyone is of the same nature and source, by listening within, you can understand yourself. From that, you can understand everyone else and everything else. Meditation is a practice in clearing out false-thinking. It is a practice of taming the mad-mind. The mad-mind is what causes us to think too much, fantasize, desire, daydream, over-analyze, etc. The mad-mind is out of control, thus making us susceptible to depression, anxiety, fear, sadness, happiness, trauma, insanity, thrill, etc.  Meditation tames the mad-mind. By taming your mind, you will be calm, blissful, content, and certain at terms with everything. Read this book on meditation. You'll get a better idea about what meditation does.", 9518, "kSWgbH9gaa", 0],

	94770 : ["I completely agree with Greg L., but I'll add my two scents anyway. All these things that you are seeking to be \"taught\" and \"brung\" to you are already a natural part of you. Its our life that conditions us to change our view of ourselves in relationship to the world (this is whats called karma, partially). When you meditate or practice zazen, you temporarily break the chain of thought that has lead you up to the point where you are now. Without the karma affecting your brain, you can have a uninfluenced mind (at least for a short time, hopefully). In that state of mind you meet up with your compassion. Its just the way we are wired. Nothing special, but very very good. the longer you practice your form of meditation/zazen, the more your mind becomes present, and the past has less and less of an affect on you. Please remember, while practicing to just simple practice for the sake of practicing. While what I have said is true, it is not owed to you by going through the motions. The true purpose of practice should be the practice itself, in my opinion. Know that each time you practice, you are doing something beautiful.", 9518, "5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa", 1],
