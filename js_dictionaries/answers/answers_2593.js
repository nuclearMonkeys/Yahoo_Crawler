	135475 : ["If you survive, which is not uncommon as these things are usually done in extreme haste and not well planned out (i.e cutting or pills, the two least effective, most painful, and most damaging methods) then you can easily have physical and mental health issues the entire rest of your life. This is the most important thing to consider.  Let's say you went with pills. The proper way to go about it would be doing heavy research on the over the counter medications which have proven fatal in high doses, so that you can hit up a dozen different stores for a box at each and do the whole set of them crushed and dissolved in water.  The way most people go about it is going to the medicine cabinet and downing everything they see. This obviously can cause any number of permanent problems. Depending on how much and what you take, you could die, however the chances of that are slim. The body's immune and processing systems are very strong, they can reject almost any amount of the slow acting substances found in OTC medicines.  However this doesn't make it safe either. You can suffer severe nerve and brain damage, possibly causing anything from a cerebral hemorrhage, aka a bleed in the brain, to paralysis, etc. PILLS IS THE WORST WAY TO GO. Let's move on to your cutting example. The proper way is to simply cut the carotid artery, which is on either side of your neck and you can feel where your jaw meets your skull. This will cause unconsciousness within seconds, brain death in two minutes at most, and total bleed out in approximately 7 minutes, 15 seconds, depending on the size of the wound.  However, again, most people don't think these things out. What's more likely is you keep cutting and cutting and cutting on your wrists, arms, legs, stomach, etc, until you pass out from blood loss. You'll have caused irreparable damage to your entire circulatory and musculature systems, in essence limiting yourself to a wheelchair for the rest of your life. Again, the possibility of brain damage due to blood loss is also very high.  Now there is technically nothing illegal about suicide. If someone helps you then it's considered assisted suicide, which is a 6-month to one year jail sentence. This is different than voluntary assisted euthanization, which is used primarily by those terminally ill who wish to die rather than suffer and sputter along for a few more months of pain and medication, which is a completely honorable way out.  Legally, any entity involved HAS to notify your parents about any violent incident involving a minor. So yes, if you fail and survive, medical complications aside, you could be facing a legal declaration of non compos menti, essentially, that you are legally considered not in possession of your mind. This is at the extreme end and is rarely used except in cases of repeated attempts.  You will have a record of mental instability if you get caught in your failure, but, as a minor, you can get these sorts of records \"purged\" or permanently removed from court record once you turn 18. Again though, the first attempt usually doesn't cause anything other than a 72 hour psych hold, some serious punishment form your parents, and a bunch of therapy sessions. I know from experience. The consequences of sch an action are serious enough if you fail, but even more so if you succeed. For one, you aren dead. That's pretty bad. For another, you'll have caused everyone who loves you, friends, family, etc, to be in unnecessary pain for a long time. They may even follow your example, which i'm sure is something you don't want.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, and for some people it's the only dignified or peaceful way out, but I doubt that your life is bad enough that you need to end it, especially since you still care what your friends and family think. A few hours ago I was asking myself the same questions and I got all these same answers.  I'm still considering voluntarily putting myself on a psych hold, which I've done before twice, (always voluntarily) as yes, a paranoid precaution, but it's always helped me. Maybe you should consider the same. It's a peaceful place away from everything causing troubles in your life and you can think over everything, safe from harming yourself, with help literally seconds away if you need someone to comfort you.  Think over everything I've said, please. I don't want to tell you what to do or not do, just help and give the facts.", 11286, "QCdTinCgaa", 33],

	135503 : ["Hello Frog, Well, have patience my friend. By the time you are 21 years old and have experienced your 4 years in the Air Force you will know that you want to do. IF you don't reenlist - of course - use the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill and go to college full time for 4 years to get your degree. (Of course, don't be married yet.) You will be surprised at how many \"real\" adults are in college when you get there.  College is not all 18 year old high school grads.  They are the ones who drop out after their first year - the party-hardy types.  Most colleges report that about 1/3rd of the freshman class drop out and don't move on into the sophomore year.  Why?  Because they are too young and think that party - party is what college is all about.   You will find out that military people and other civilians in their 20s are more focused and see college as the \"golden opportunity\" to advance and guarantee a better life for themselves.  And, party - drinking bouts and running with girls doesn't hack it. Live in the dorms?  You could if you want to save money.  Or, you could rent if you can afford it.  What to do is \"save\" money for 4 years in the military.  If you save $200 a month in the military for college you will have about $10,000 saved for some living expenses. What college should you go to?  Well, that depends.  If you believe that you really like the Air Force and \"think\" that you are officer material THEN you should only go to a college that offers Air Force ROTC.  Enroll in ROTC for 4 years.  You won't need the scholarship because you will have free college already.  And, following your graduation from ROTC and college you WILL be commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the USAF returning back to the AF for 4 more years as an officer.  You will be 30 when you finish your 4 years of officership and you will be a Captain.  Maybe, if you really like it you will remain in the AF and make promotion to Major.  You never know what will happen years from now or what you will decide to do.  So, keep your options open. CLEP tests are good.  But, you have to \"know\" something first before you take the tests.  SO, there are CLEP study books just like the ASVAB.  Buy them and study.   I received 27 credits on the CLEP.  This covered most of my 101 classes in college.  Of course, I didn't leave the AF to do my college work.  I took 9 years going 1 course a semester before I graduated.  I was 40 years old and had 21 years in the AF by then.   Wait until you take the CLEP tests when you make Senior Airman at 36 months service.  Then, you may have learned enough of the material on the CLEP to pass. (Hopefully!) OF course, the easiest place to go to school is near the base that you are discharged at.  Why?  Because you don't have to move very far.  You \"know\" the area.  You \"know\" some people.  You can have already gone to the college and \"interviewed\" or collected \"paperwork\" and actually gone on campus and sat down with the ROTC people, etc.   Remember, your family 'home' is no longer your home.  You are free to make your home anyplace in the US as you wish.  Later on, after you graduate from college you will either:   get a job in some state and move there; or,  reenter the AF as an officer and go somewhere else anyway. OK?  In the meantime, after you graduate from technical school and report to your first AF base you will be placed on mandatory On-the-Job training (OJT) for upgrade to your 5 skill level (Craftsman).  It will take about 10 months.  You will be expected to complete 1 study guide each month; test and pass each study volume before you can take the final upgrade exam for the 5 level.   Worry about college when you are Senior Airman.  But, keep your plans on paper so you won't forget your GOAL. Best wishes, Larry Smith Senior Master Sergeant, USAF (Ret.) First Sergeant P.S.  If you want to follow through with this plan don't get married until you are an officer and meet a prospective wife that will make a fine officer's wife!  Trust me.", 11288, "None", 2],

	135508 : ["Two ways: First there is science journalism ... journalism *about* science.   Caroline covered this well.   A good science journalist actually understands the concepts he or she is reporting ... *really* understands them from the point of view of science history, and can recognize the difference between political controversy (where non-scientists are attacking science they do not understand), and genuine scientific debate (where the scientists themselves are genuinely disagreeing over a specific point of science) ... a journalist who can explain the debate to non-scientists is worth his weight in gold.    A bad science journalist tries to interject their own opinion by skewing the reporting ... or worse, doesn't really care about the science one way or the other and just wants to inflame controversy using sensastionalist headlines or open-ended conclusions (\"Was Darwin wrong?\" or \"Global Warming, Fact or Fiction?\" even though the facts presented in the article are fairly mundane and non-controversial).  Unfortunately, there are a lot of BAD science journalists out there (even in \"reputable\" publications). But the second aspect is the use of the scientific method as it applies to journalism in general.   It doesn't have to be about science ... it could be about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, or why California was experiencing an electricity \"crisis\" in 2000 and 2001.    A good journalist has to dig beyond the party line and put a lot of evidence together that may be leading to a different conclusion. This last one is interesting.   What is the role of the journalist in this scientific method?   Well, they are uncovering evidence (like a fossil hunter digging in the dirt) ... but they need to be careful when *interpreting* that evidence.   Events of today, are what future generations will call \"history\" ... so today's journalists should just be uncovering the raw data and evidence for future historians to interpret.    Yes we have pundits and editorialists whose job it is to make opinions about this evidence *today* ... but they often do a really bad job of it because nobody really cares about the truth, they only care about *controversy* and conflict ... so a pundit or editorial writer who gives a balanced view that lays out what further evidence is needed, (the way real scientists do) tends not to last long. And that, in the long run, is why true scientific method is difficult in journalism.   People who say that the media is \"biased\" to the left or to the right are missing the point.   The 'media' (if there is such a thing) just likes a good fight, and doesn't care who wins.   Science is slow, patient ... but it is relentlessly progressing.   Journalism (at least today) is impatient, and is demanded to produce a strident opinion NOW. (Just my opinion.)", 11290, "AA11513203", 2],
