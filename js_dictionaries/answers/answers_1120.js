As long as one measurement is less than 22, one is less than 14, and the other is less than 9, it's fine. The 22 and the 9 are the most important. 22 inches is the depth of the bin and 9 inches is the height. If no dimension is less than 9 inches, it won't fit at all. If it has a dimension more than 22 inches, it has to go in sideways and will take up too much room.  Though the size of the bins varies from plane to plane. The bins on small regional jets are too small for \"full-size\" bags, so they'll make people check them at the gate (it won't cost any extra though).  I don't know why airlines bother with the \"linear inches\" thing when it's a useless measurement. Something 35x4x4 is less than 45 linear inches, but it's still way too long to be a carry-on.
