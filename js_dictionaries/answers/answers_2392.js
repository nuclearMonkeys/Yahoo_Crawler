There are a few simple things you need to know, although I suspect you have already made your decision to reject God, or the idea of a unique being who created the universe.   First of all, Christianity isn't about Christians.  Christians are a diverse group adhering to one core belief, and it's about Christ as God incarnate.  We don't worship a book.  We don't worship a religion.  We worship Jesus Christ. Secondly, there are plenty of religions out there claiming the ability to improve humanity.  Christianity isn't about that though.  Jesus Christ did not come here to make bad people good.  He came here to make dead people live. Third, unquestioned faith isn't faith at all, it's blindness and silliness.  God created us with brains, reason, eyes, ears, intelligence and creativity.  Would he not want us to use our faculties to know him?  Would he not reveal himself to those He created, in a way that our faculties could discern?  I'm sure you are sincere in your desire to know God.  So why give up so soon, based on misinformation from unreliable sources?   The simple fact that you have a desire for something so completely beyond yourself is an indication that He exists. The fact that people yearn for perfect justice in a world where it has never existed, for example, is another indication that God exists.  Think about it. And why would people have a yearning for God or eternal life anyway?  Exactly how does that kind of nonexistent ideal fit in with herd instinct or survival of the species?  It doesn't.  It only begins to make sense if you allow yourself to imagine that those things DO exist, or might exist, because God placed the yearning in our soul.    Try reading the Gospel of John as if it were written as a letter to you personally, and see if the words of Christ speak to you.

	125435 : ["That's in Romans chapter 6 and you really need to read the whole chapter to get the understanding. Paul has already explained in previous chapters how Christians have received the gift of life through what Jesus accomplished by His sinless death. This gift of grace \"might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\" (5:21). He then goes on to explain why sin is so abhorrent to Christians: \"We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?\" he reasons. No, we live a new life: \"For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin - because anyone who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him... \"Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.\" That last sentence I quoted is key. Who do we submit to as our master? Legalism and sin - or Jesus Christ, who set us free from all of that? Who do we recognise and acclaim as our master? Who do we follow? Who do we obey? By an act of our sanctified will, we make the choice and head in the opposite direction to our former slave-owner, Sin. Paul goes on to show that obedience leads to righteousness; \"But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.\" Understanding this is a work of the Holy Spirit, who sets the captives free. He is at work in the lives of believers so that \"He who began a good work in you will see it through to completion on the day of Jesus Christ\" (Philippians 1:6). It is only after a person has been liberated by the grace of God that the shackles of sin are smashed, and they are free to follow Christ and His righteousness. Jesus said, \"Everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it for ever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.\" (John 8:34-36) Once we put our faith in the Son and repent of our sins, we are adopted into the family of God as His children! That's the turning point! Yes, we all lack self control - many Christians have fallen into sin after their conversion. Paul deals with that in Romans chapter 7 (near the close) and on into chapter 8 (to half-way through). You really must read all those chapters in the book of Romans.

Genesis 2:7  What happens when a person dies? \" Then the dust shall return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.\" Ecclesiastes 12:7, The body turns to dust again and the spirit goes back to God who gave it.  The spirit of every person who dies -weather righteous or wicked- returns to God at death. What is the spirit that returns to God at death?\" The body without the spirit(breath) is dead. \"James 2:26 \"The spirit of God(the breath that God gave him) is in my nostrils.\" Job 27:3 The spirit that returns to God is the breath of life. Nowhere in the Bible does the spirit have any wisdom or feeling after a person dies, it is the \"breath of life\" and nothing more. What is a soul? \" And the lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ;and man became a living soul\" Genesis 2:7 A soul is a living being.  A soul is always a combination of two things: body plus breath.  A soul cannot exhist unless body and breath are combined.  The bible teaches that we are souls.

The word “mingling,” as applied here, is a key scriptural term which refers particularly to Christ in His incarnation as typified by the Old Testament meal offering. This type of Christ is described in Leviticus 2:4 as a composition of fine flour (the humanity of Christ) mingled with oil (the divinity of Christ). Thus, in the one being, Jesus Christ, the divine and human natures were, for the first time, joined in such a way as to be thoroughly and inseparably “mingled,” retaining the individual characteristics of the two natures such that a third nature was not produced (Lee, Footnotes 367-368; Webster's). Jesus Christ, therefore, is the first God-man, “the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced  To our natural understanding, the notion of God mingling Himself with man is inconceivable, yet this mysterious union was fully accomplished in the person of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the incarnation of Christ also points to the nature of the relationship God desires to have with us. God wants to unite and mingle Himself with the beings He created in His own image (Genesis 1:26). Eventually, through His complete salvation work, God will produce for Himself a counterpart that matches Himself absolutely in life, nature, mind, being, image, and glory, yet not in His incommunicable Godhead (Lee, HWMR 32).\"  Taken from this link  I know you have lots of good answers here but, thought  to drop by and share with all of you this -:)   Have a good night-:)   xo", 10839, "None", 4],

If people were given animals for free, they might use them for animal testing or something else. But more than likely if someone has to pay or an animal they won't use them for testing..

Pat yourself on the back  for doing a great job because your son is comfortable enough with you that he can pull away. It's nothing personal he's just telling you that he's not a baby anymore and he's doing it by action because he doesn't know how to express how he feels.
