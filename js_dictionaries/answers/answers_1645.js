	87917 : ["iIt does say in the bible that Babies & children, who cannot decide for themselves whether or not they want to trust their faith in God, go to heaven, so that could be why, He knows that they will go to Heaven.  Those quotes are not exactly from God, they each have a reason & are apart of a story. For example when Moses came to realaese the Israelites, Killing the first born was a last result for God. Many things cant be explained.  This quote helps me understand- A Golden Heart stopped Beating, Two shining eyes put to rest, God did this to show - He only takes the Best.", 9276, "Teji7a7Naa", 3],
	87918 : ["You are really making a great study of things you perceive to be God's fault. You obviously like wallowing in the mire. Now look at it all again and find the reasons these things happened. God never inflicts anything on people directly if they don't deserve it. But ungodly people don't teach their children God's ways. That is the responsibility God gives them which it is foolish to neglect. Then make a positive study of all the things that God has given to mankind through His grace, because we are totally unworthy of anything. From the air we breath, the natural wonders of the earth, rain, seed and harvest, so much fuel that we've abused it with our lifestyles. The glories of sunshine and a blue sky. Sea and rain. It's endless. Most of all He gave His son that we might have life, can you better that? On the side of bad things happening to people the LORD God pleaded and pleaded with people to go His way and they would have blessings but did they? Of course not, and by being disobedient they knew what God said would come upon them but they still were perverse. There is the love of God and the wrath of God and He never deceives anyone but tells it as it is. Some of the things , I haven't read them all, were prophesied before they happened, God did not make them happen but knew their faithless ways. If you make your choices you take your consequences, you would in everyday mundane things, so it is with the important things. Serve God and live, deny God and die. The same yesterday, today and forever.  But now, there is not often instant Almighty justice, it is deferred to give you the maximum opportunity to repent and get baptised.", 9276, "None", 4],
	87919 : ["god dosen't kill  babies in the life sense nobody kills babies women have abortions for a reason and who are we to judge but also babies die if they are poorly what about miscarriage which is out of the womans control anyway, babies born prematurely. nobody knows why these things happen but they happen for a reason i feel as a women it is our bodys way of telling us it is not the right time to have a baby. apologises if i have offended anybody i didnt mean too   ", 9276, "cebac9a9fdb5738e1c4f5532e30fff77aa", 1],

	87926 : ["People designed this flu. It's not just swine flu, it's a strain of swine/bird/human flu and the only way that can happen is if it's created by humans in a laboratory. PS - it's a VIRUS not a disease. Edit- Here's the quote for those who disagree: “This strain of swine influenza that's been cultured in a laboratory is something that's not been seen anywhere actually in the United States and the world, so this is actually a new strain of influenza that's been identified,” said Dr. John Carlo, Dallas Co. Medical Director", 9278, "None", 2],

	87929 : ["well the bible is not the word of god it was written hundreds of years after jesus so just because some random people wrote it it doesn't mean god wants it , or believes it. also god isn't real and babies get killed on their own or by other people.", 9276, "None", -1],

	87931 : ["God doesn't kill babies. Babies (and anything else) can't be killed by something that doesn't exist.

	87938 : ["If any God exists, he would have been responsible for creating us, would be all powerful, and would care deeply about what he created; Us. A benevolent God would want us to believe that he exists, and would give us valid, empirical reasons to do so. An omnipotent God would be able to convince all people of all cultures on his own, without the need for human missionaries. An omnipotent God would be able to overcome doubters and angelic adversaries wishing to make us question him or looking to sew doubt about his existence and desires for us. An omnipotent God would be able to get his word to all cultures and would ensure that all understand perfectly what he expects from them and what they can expect from him. All cultures, throughout history have different Gods and different methods of worshiping. The only exceptions are those cultures that get invaded and overrun by another culture, and usually, the losing culture must adopt the new religion under threat of death or torture. Even then, the losing culture keeps many aspects and rituals of their old religion, merging them with the new one. There is no proof whatsoever that God exists. There is no proof whatsoever that any particular God is the one that exists. Therefore, one can only conclude that no God exists. Atheism is a religious believe that God does not exist. Atheism is a religion, because it is a religious belief. Conclusion: Atheism is the one true religion. EZ", 9280, "None", 0],

	87948 : ["In the Old Testament context, the Jewish people were polytheistic until abuot the time AFTER they came back from Babylon. They thought Yahweh (God's real name) was the God of War. So they only prayed to him for war, and for revenge. So God, who wanted to reaspond to the people, he followed their askings. The Jewish people asked god for revenge on Amalek. So God granted the people this so they could believe in him, if only for a war God. Remember, God has yet proven that he is a loving God other then to Abraham and a select few. When Jesus comes in the New Testament, they do not he is the Messiah because tehy think that the REAL Messiah will drive out the Romans and be a King. THEY DID NOT THINK HE WOULD BE FULL OF KINDNESS, because they did not know better. The Old Testament is full of stories not fully documented.

	87958 : ["Eternity, the alpha and omega concept, is by definition zero. If you have a set that encompasses everything...an infinite set of all positives and negatives, when you put it all together you're left with zero. To attribute any aspect to an \"eternal\" being, i.e. to say God is loving, is to limit what God is. If God is loving he is therefore not hateful, and therefore not eternal. Further if God is eternal he would have no motivation to do anything. A perfect being has no desires, and would have no need to create the universe.  Some atheists will use an \"eternal\" universe theory to avoid the question of where the universe came from by saying it was simply always here, and thus void the necessity of a God.", 9280, "io7nHB3Oaa", 0],
	87959 : ["The two have nothing to do with each other. Just because one thing exists does not prove the existence of the other. Even if the argument is trying to say that since god would be eternal, then if eternity is real, so must god be, it doesn't work. That's like proving the existence of fish by saying that there is water. Yes, fish cannot exist without water, but just because there is water doesn't mean that there are fish.", 9280, "None", -1],
	87960 : ["I'm inclined to disagree with most of the other answers in here. I seem to think eternity and God are actually the same thing. I can't see how either can exist without the other. Perhaps they are simply two sides of the same coin. Oh well, that's just me.", 9280, "MiAOnwN6aa", 0],
