Something one of them might've read on the stage of one of those little offbeat coffee shops down in Greenwich Village in the late ‘50s to mid ‘60s. I dig it. Exceptional, actually. Yeah, although I was pretty young and maybe didn't appreciate it as much as I did when I got older, I was actually alive during that era and in that particular metropolitan location,  so I know what the vibe was like back then. And how people interacted with one another. And appreciated things like what you've composed here. And it was much better in those days than it is nowadays I have to say. I guess because there were more people who expressed themselves in the way that you do. But yeah, you have some transcendent gifts there. I write a little bit myself so I think I'm pretty good at detecting writing chops when I see it. LOL. ", 7949, "None", 0],

Since that's the only poem that I make a habit of reading that often, I suppose I'd have to say it's my favorite although I don't think of it that way.  I agree with absolutely none of Wordsworth's views as expressed in it but, as a musician, I find reading good poetry exactly analogous to listening to a melody.  I also like to read some of Keats' works on occasion. It's been awhile, but I'm also fond of Milton's L'Allegro and Il Penseroso. I probably should spend some time reading newer writers but it doesn't interest me. I do spend some time on occasion editing some of the things I've written over the past fifty years and occasionally putting down something new when I'm feeling poetic.", 7922, "hWi899Itaa", 0],
