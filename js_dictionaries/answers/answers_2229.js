	117249 : ["For females, 6 months.  For males, 8-9 months.   It can cost very little or be very expensive.  It all depends on what vet you go to, how many services you ask for along with the alter (such as pre-blood work, catheter, etc), as well as spay versus neuter.   Neutering in general costs less, because spays are more invasive.  I have paid $60 to alter countless rescued shelter dogs, and as much as $400 to alter an adult, large breed retired show dog.  A small puppy at a young age should not cost an outrageous amount. I would say for a male or female Yorkie pup around 6 months of age, betweeen $150-$250. Both are completely safe and routine. I would just seek out a hometown veterinarian and have them suggest the best alteration plan for your pup.  It is also smart to schedule the spay/neuter when you go in for the pups last round of vaccines.  You can also schedule for the microchip to be inserted while s/he is being altered as this is less painful due to the large needle. Good luck and thanks for spaying/neutering!!

These are some of the few things that the government IS supposed to take care of.   That being said, I think most people are tired of paying for others' bad choices.  I know I am...  Also, this isn't a 'republican' idea.  It may have been at one time, but the republican party moved away from that a long time ago.  The democrats never believed it.  There are too many 'party voters' and not enough thinkers.     I consider myself a Classical Liberal (from before the term got hijacked by progressives).

	117277 : ["Most likely either the oil pump is failing, or the oil pressure relief valve is sticking.  Unfortunately, extremely low mileage doesn't make for a good car - in fact, it usually ruins the engine.  Since it would have rarely warmed up completely, moisture inside the engine would cause rust to form internally, and they wear out quickly due to poor lubrication (oil not warm enough to flow properly.)   I once looked at a 12-year-old car with only 56,000 miles - driven by a couple of nuns!  The engine was already junk - blowing oil smoke, leaking oil, rusted exhaust pipe, leaking head gasket...  Engines wear out fast when they are cold. Of course, if you had read the owner's manual, you would realise that the engine should be shut off IMMEDIATELY if the oil light goes on.  The extra friction from having no effective lubrication is causing it to run very hot, as well as wear out quickly.  Given time, it can cause the crankshaft and camshaft to weld itself to the engine block (I once had a motorcycle that did exactly that!) - if it doesn't just catch fire first.  Leaving it running will kill it in no time.  And the extra wear on your engine's bearings from having no lubrication means that the likely fix now is a complete new engine. Good luck!", 10493, "jZsHAaKiaa", 1],
	117278 : ["Check the fan.  It looks like it's not an electric fan and that the belt is loose. When you're doing high rpms, the friction moves the fan. But at low rpm (idling) the fan belt slips and the fan doesn't move. Just guessing, I don't know that car and it could have an electric fan, then this answer doesn't make sense.  But check if the fan works when it's hot. It could be an electrical problem related to the engine idling.", 10493, "None", 0],
	117279 : ["Since this is under cleaning and laundry, I will answer as if you are asking about smelly laundry. Separate your laundry to whites/colored laundry. Use a good quality detergent, such as Tide, use hot water for your whites, add bleach, use the hottest water recommended for your colored clothes,  and use a good fabric softner such as snuggle in the final rinse, and then thourughly dry. Never store clothes damp. If your clothes have a mildewy smell, purchase a one pound box of Arm and hammer baking soda, add 1/2 pound to the wash, add the other half to the final rinse, along with the fabric softner. Hang your shirts and pants on hangers to help prevent wrinkles and keep fresh air circulating around them when hung in your closet. Baking soda also helps with sweat smells too if you have that problem. Add to your bath water at home and soak. Once a week add a cup of apple cider vinegar to your bath water to help eliminate bacterria and soften your skin.
