	15407 : ["\"Why do some men oppose laws advantaging women that are needed to create a level playing field?\" How is equal Rights, equal Opportunities and equal Freedoms NOT a level playing field?  This is exactly what the originally stated goals of feminism were.  Suddenly, advantaging women over men is seen as a \"level playing field\"?  How childish (and disrespectful) is that?? A true \"level playing field\" is where everybody has an equal OPPORTUNITY to fully participate in the game. What feminists are calling a \"level playing field\" are equal OUTCOME laws that discriminate against male's opportunities, while privileging women; thus tilting the game in favour of women. Actually, equal outcomes fixes the game. We already know what the score will be. Why even bother playing ... or trying to excel? A TRUE \"level playing field\" is one where everyone has the same OPPORTUNITY, and thus, the outcome is not assured. The \"play\" takes place, and there are winners and losers. Feminists don't like that of course. They want to privilege women to a guaranteed amount of \"wins\" whether that is deserved or not, just like occurs today in feminist run elementary schools. And when equality minded people attempt to show them the inequality of their privileges, then feminists quickly begin screaming that people are trying to \"take away their Rights\".  - (they have internalized their PRIVILEGES to become RIGHTS) - .", 2607, "aSm9xSn3aa", 4],
	15408 : ["You didn't give specific examples so I have to make some assumptions as to what your arguments are. A few hypothetical scenarios. I quit my job to do something I deem important, and you didn't. Five years later, you're a manager, and I'm not. Am I oppressed because I'm not a manager like you? Does this playing field need to be leveled? That's what feminists are arguing with their glass ceiling argument. The reality is women are the ones quitting their jobs to spend more time at home with family, and their careers suffer as a result. We work the same job. I work part time. You work full time. Am I oppressed because I get paid less than you for doing the same job? Does this playing field need to be leveled? That is part of the reason there is a wage gap. Feminists argue women are paid less because they're oppressed. The reality is women earn less because they contribute less. The average woman works less and has more breaks in her work history compared to the average man. Also, women aren't flocking to the jobs that are dirty, dangerous, physically intensives nor in miserable working conditions that are as a result high paying. Basically the arguments for advantaging women are horseshit. Women are reaping what feminists sowed. Women have freedom from gender roles that men do not because of feminism, and the uneven playing field is the result.
