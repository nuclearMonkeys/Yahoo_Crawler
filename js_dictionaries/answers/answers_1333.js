These devices are based on the false notion that disease-causing agents and diseased tissues emit radio-like frequencies that can be detected and cured by matching their frequencies Royal Raymond Rife believed that that cancer was caused by bacteria (it isn't). During the 1920s, he claimed to have developed a powerful microscope that could detect living microbes by the colour of auras emitted by their vibratory rates.  His Rife Frequency Generator supposedly generated radio waves with precisely the same frequency, causing the offending bacteria to shatter in the same manner as a crystal glass breaks in response to the voice of an opera singer. He sincerely believed in it, but it's nonsense. Unfortunately wherever there's cancer there's a greedy charlatan willing to part desperate and vulnerable people from their cash in exchange for ineffective quack treatments, and the Rife machine is one such scam. Hulda Clark is another person who invented a machine she claimed could cure disease - including all cancers. It made her a very rich woman. She died of cancer last year. ====================== EDIT: It would be helpful if some of the 'thumbs-downers' would share their extensive knowledge of Rife generators...", 8671, "FicyC2TXaa", -2],

	72260 : ["Yes they can, but here is what you need to do in order to prevent a lapse in service. A. You need to contact your provider explain the situation and ask for a \"Critical Care Form\". This will enable your meter to be classified as a critical care account. If the provider refuses to give this to you then contact the utility directly. I don't know your geographical location. If you are in an area that is regulated this may be the same company. Your provider may also have payment plans available or be able to work with you on a one time delayed payment in order to prevent having your meter de-energized. You may have to get a doctor's note in order to force them to leave your power on. good communication and showing a good faith effort goes a long way though.       B. there are utility bill assistance programs at local churches and non profit organizations. While there may be some programs for actual disabled individuals (especially if the person is a veteran) most state governments have programs for low income assistance. Here in Texas it is called \"Light up Texas\". Their website is:   or call1-866-454-8387. You might also check with your local social services office or local county office.       C. Have a backup plan in-case the power gets shut off. Discussing your situation with friends, family, outreach programs, shelters and churches should help you work out a place to stay temporarily until you have a more permanent ans stable living situation.   I hope that this helps and that your situation improves soon. All the best.", 8670, "MND9pNtNaa", 0],

	72281 : ["You have joined millions of computers worldwide in having the \"Search Redirect Virus\". What makes this virus unique is the ability for it to \"hide\" from most anti virus software. This is all due to how the virus can infect your computer. In a normal scenario, with a typical virus, it would infect your PC by attempting to install a software package or run a malicious process that could damage your system. The anti virus is designed to recognise this and stop this from happening. However, the Redirect Virus manages to infect system files and change a few settings within these. This allows it to elude the detection from the anti virus. You are getting redirected because the system file the virus has infected is used by the operating system to communicate with the internet, via the web browser. A change in the settings of this file means that the way Google directs you to the website from a search result can be intercepted and changed.
