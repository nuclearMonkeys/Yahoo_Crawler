	111185 : ["Most routers come with 3 or 4 ethernet ports for multiple computers or devices. If you've run out (like I have) just go to the store where they sell computer network equipment, and buy a small ethernet switch.  One port on the switch is an uplink port which allows you to plug it into your router and providing more empty ports for devices to use.  No configuration is needed.  It's literally just plug and play. If you want to use wireless, and your router supports bridging, you can just grab a second wireless router, and use it for your game consoles or other devices by your TV.  Once again, you'll have multiple ethernet ports, and you can always buy a switch if you need more ports.  In bridging mode, this second router simply acts as an ethernet-to-wifi adapter for all your devices plugged into it.  Very useful for extending your network without having to run very long ethernet cables around the house.", 10177, "4Pk6VNftaa", 0],

I'm set on the old cars, there's no new cars that's under $20k and will get the mpg I desire. commuter only is 80 mpg, a offroad/SUV is 30 mpg. the closest is the Prius/Insight hybrids, making only 50 mpg. there's no truck or SUV I know of that even makes 25 mpg.
