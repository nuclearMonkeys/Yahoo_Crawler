This is often known and referred to as “FREE-MONEY”. It eventually turns out that behind the scenes, a hired Financial Consulting Team had been responsible all along for applying, qualifying, researching and tracking the status to achieve Funding & Loan Forgiveness for the eligible Company. Let's say that the Financial Consulting Team wanted an upfront payment of 120K to get the $930,000 in Government Assistance for the Business.  So now the question is this: Do you think 120K was a fair amount to charge [and not a scam] under these new circumstances? If not, what should the upfront charge have been? Less than 120K or more?", 2358, "ZXyqgjW2aa", 1],

I dont do crypto and most on here dont either, so you wont get any support there.  I have 2 ideas that might work, but I wouldnt put much faith in it. Once most people, especially elders, are convinced of something, theres no changing their minds.

And that it's always been ridiculous to focus on a vaccine instead of treatment. However, we know cases in the US began to drop in mid-January, long before most people had any vaccinations and almost no one had had 2nd vaccinations. I haven't looked at the current reasoning for that. One article I read in February is that most everyone who could get covid already got covid.  It's related to the memory cell changes that are not exclusive to covid. - The doctor who wrote this article is not a freak/nobody.  He was a Surgeon General nominee under Obama. ", 2364, "cK28Kl0Uaa", -1],

Many seem to think that if you buy a stock for $100 dollars and sell it for $10 that someone took $90 from them, which is absurd. The value of something is only what someone will pay for it on that day.   On the cypto though, that is not an investment. It is a wager on a bet.
