	61747 : ["this question has some of the best and most knowledgeable answers i've seen in the past two days (at least the first 3 lol) instead of the usual totally uneducated bashing that goes on, so that's refreshing. also good question as for the answer, i don't think that this is nearly enough to attack pakistan, unless it is proven that the pak government is directly involved and the us and other countries back this up; which is not likely to happen, even though it is likely that they were involved in some shape or form edit: to ruby, indian organized crime is closely linked with pakistan, e.g. dawood ibrahim", 8132, "a274a024ae8de51744103c10154affe0aa", -1],
	61748 : ["India-Pakistan intelligence chiefs talking at length on hotline followed by Defence Ministerial level talks and then a 6 am emergency cabinet meeting all point to one direction. My own feeling is that the Pak govt is completely held ransom by the terrorists who have a safe home in Pakistan. India should start commando operations into Pakistan just like the Americans are doing and flush out the lairs of the terrorists. If India invades Pakistan at this time, it will have the world leaders backing it. Pakistan at this time is on it's knees and can't afford a war spanning more than 5 days. This is the time to strike and wipe out the incapable government there. Thereafter, the Indian Government should provide protection to the Pakistani citizens who have none from their own government. Pakistan citizens are our brothers and have a right to live a secure and prosperous lives. But Pakistan as a nation should be wiped out and be made a part of India where all would find a tolerant home.", 8132, "w5iy0pL5aa", 1],
	61749 : ["Ok guys, think about it for a second. How many countries are fighting in Afghanistan against Taliban( who don't have anything)? The answer is many, and look whats happening there. British generals are saying that they have no control there. Israel attacked Lebanon but could not advance, so unless all of you think that Pakistan is weaker than Taliban and Lebanon then sure India will attack Pakistan but if not then i don't think it would be feasible for both countries to fight since both are nuclear powers and if they happen to engage in nuclear fight it will be disastrous for both countries. Now Pakistan can not sustain a fight along its long border with India and that would likely be the cause of nuclear war between both countries because Pakistan's last option would be to use its nuclear arsenal. So the conclusion : No war", 8132, "xyrmtDA6aa", 0],

	61751 : ["Relax, as long as gay guys aren't going after him after being told \"no.\" It's not a crime to try and steal a glance or flirt, but since he's not interested, all he has to do is say \"Sorry, I'm not interested.\"  There isn't any \"special thing\" that makes a guy attractive \"to gays.\" LGBT are people, not a separate species! The same qualities that make a person attractive to another person (regardless of orientation), make him hot bait, apparently.

	61752 : ["I have not been to halloween night but went to their   celebration couple years ago. No expense was spared. they had real snow and the themed events were amazing. if the halloween is half as good you will have a great time.

	61755 : ["I had a similar problem last year. there are little fuses in the plugs to the lights. when you hook too many end to end,  this is what happens. I had to hook up two strings of lights, then run an extension cord to the second two. The extension chord will also give you a couple more outlets to work with. If the strand of lights has two wires running between the lights, when one goes out, they all go. If there are 3 wires connecting the lights, if one goes you will just loose a short section. Confused enough yet?", 8136, "WtTc6DRQaa", 0],
	61756 : ["This is gonna take forever to fix!  Most strands of lights will go out if one bulb is bad!  They suck, buts that's how they were made!  Some others give directions to only use 3 in sequence, so check that out first because it may be the quickest solution.  OR, go buy new lights!  Merry  !", 8136, "3jxOiVAoaa", 0],
	61757 : ["I think it is the reverse mathematical equation theory. Where in this case the 1 and 2 would reverse and it would be  --,2,1,4,5. Than you add the 4 and 5 to get 9, which is your next number like so, --,2,1,4,5,9. than you add the 1 and 2 to get 3 like this, 3,2,1,4,5,9. than you reverse the first three numbers to get your answer,  1,2,3,4,5,9. 9 being the first number of the next set of numbers.", 8136, "ea97d69dc236da6fb6cce56a3afc7a8baa", 0],

You could step back a little and get some more detail in the foreground :) or do super close ups of the house.  But the rest of your work is really good, youv'e definately got the lighting right in your work... envy :) You should consider getting a deviantart account. Then you can see which of your photos are favorited more and get even further oppinions on your work. Seeing other peoples work can also inspire you and help you to improve.

	61764 : ["WOW!!  Those are really some GREAT pictures!  You will do well in photography. Hard to choose least favorite.  Some of the \"portrait\" type pictures were a little boring, too stiff or posed, but still well done.  I guess I'd say my least favorite (though, really I liked them all) would be the one of the gate.  The little hearts on the gate looked too cutesy.  Looked like they were the only reason for the picture, which made it kind of cliche.", 8135, "None", 0],
	61765 : ["There are two possible  Conspiracy Theories 1- India will remain quite and try to maintain peace. In such bad economic time the affordability of a war could be a huge problem. If Decision is made inside India without Foreign Interference than there will be no war. 2- If india is getting America Support and Advise, it may well attack pakistan. As Pkaistan is in Worst of times (financial Crises, Electric Crises, Housing Crises, Water Crises, Gas Crises, Full Of Corruption). Terrorism Crises is the major one. Pakistan dont want America to come in and America wants to come in so itll want to engage pakistan with india and will come in from the Afghanistan side. India also knows a good time when pakistan is engaged in a problem with afghanistan border. May want the control of pakistan. Pakistan will be fooish if they dont Make good arrangement to Finish all the crises going on inside the country. Reduce Chances of Foreigners Attacking in pakistan. No Electricity , No Gas How they think they are going to fight. Its not simple as playing Kabadi. Zardari and Nawaz Shareef have Already Finished Half of Pakistan in less than a Year. Such Bad Economy means theve ate > half of pakistan.", 8132, "8NIzBkRtaa", -1],
	61766 : ["No.  The Pakistani government has condemned the attacks and will disavow the militants.  The Pakistani government has no effective control over much of the country, which is in the hands of tribes loyal to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  Knocking out the weak Pakistani central government does not solve the problem.  The tribal territories in Northwest Pakistan have become what Afghanistan was 7 years ago, the terrorist hatchery of the world.  The solution is going to have to be an artful combination of politics, money and military might. Right now the Pakistani government is not willing to do any aspect of that and has effectively ceded control over those areas to the indigenous tribes.  ", 8132, "AA11565799", 6],

This can easily be transformed into a decent image by cropping it into a head and shoulder shot. The 116 is the most frustrating because there is no save, you clipped off the birds wing.

I believe a country like pakistan with so much of corruption and poverty and no direction and leadership, and just being stupid, people like this want everybody to be miserable and join their pity party. If they are not sucessfull we make sure no one else will be either. The only way these people know to get attention its by fear, killing innocent people.

The whole world knows that pakistan is a terror factory.By the pure common sense an enemy should be attacked at its weakest and this is the time they are in bad shape with the forex reserve drying out n they are still struggling to have a proper democracy. This is the write time if not to completely resolve the problem as some of my friends pointed out at the possibility of a civil war in pakistan and why don't we act as a catalyst in doing so. aren't we facing a civil war from decades in one or the other form in Punjab or kashmir. If we cant force pakistan to stop doing this to us than lets just help them getting into a civil war or economic breakdown so they have enough problems to deal with and we can rest in peace at least for some time.", 8132, "2SBrosaeaa", 0],
