The award was to recognize that Haatchi was both a survivor and an inspiration.He overcame his fear of humans to become a therapy dog for those who needed his help.Scooter, animals can teach us all about compassion , love and forgiving.Even though Haatchi was left to die tied to the train tracks to die, he survived and gave hope to a young boy.It is too bad his original owner will never pay for his cruelty.The point of the story is that sometimes we just want to read something inspiring, to reaffirm that there is still hope and that there is still good in the world.thanks for sharing this story.", 9219, "AA10672842", 1],

At the very least, this is an obviously unethical practice. In regards to giving the gowns to the hospital instead of the funeral home, definitely give a call to the Pastoral Care departments of any or all of your local hospitals.  Someone there will be happy to help you!

Something like: \"This gown has been made available at no cost by ________ If you have been charged for this garment please call ______\" I don't know. It could also be a means to make contact with grieving families who might be looking for support in time of need. The group I used to be in made a special point of arranging meals for new parents or families that had recently had a death or disability. It's amazing how people respond to the idea of having a free meal dropped off once a day or a couple times a week - no pressure, just \"here you go, hope you're doing ok.\" Of course nothing keeps the funeral home from discarding the tag, but it's a thought.

This means that not only will it be more difficult to clean, if you don't keep a thin layer of oil on the bore, IT WILL RUST. 2) Canted sight tower.  Cheaper builds may be factory seconds, meaning things don't always line up exactly properly.  This could mean something as simple as not being able to sight in the sights, as the amount of adjustment required is beyond the mechanical capability of the adjustments, or as critical as partially covering the gas port causing weak gas impulse to the bolt carrier. 3) Improperly crowned barrel.  Ruins accuracy. 4) Improperly applied/headspaced barrel extension.  Could cause excessive headspace issues, which in turns causes difficulty in extraction -- this could be as simple as failure to extract, or as critical as ripping the case head off. 5) Substandard or out of spec parts.  Could cause catastrophic failure. Here are some problems you can experience with a cheap lower: 1) Out of spec -- magwell or fire control pocket may not be routered out properly.  Holes may be off by a few thousandths.  Not much of a big deal but may affect reliability or ability to use certain magazines or fire control parts. 2) Parts out of spec.  As simple as a selector which doesn't exactly point in the correct direction, or possibly as critical as a hammer/trigger engagement which doesn't seat absolutely properly, possibly causing an accidental discharge.  Or a pin which is oversize/undersize, causing you to either have to modify the pin or the receiver to accommodate it, which leads to a chain reaction of making good parts fit bad parts. 3) Substandard materials.  As simple as maybe a bad, flaky finish, or a casting with \"bubbles\" in it which can catastrophically fail when stress is placed on it. When you buy from a reputable source, they have quality control steps which alleviate all of the above.  Cheaper parts mean the quality control steps have either been abridged or omitted altogether. There are your facts.  Feel free to check them.", 9224, "dOQowNWKaa", 0],

But a lousy barrel, bolt carrier, and bolt, and you have walked away from what an AR platform does well. Accuracy. I agree most these ARs are way over priced for what they are. Many are more interested in a contraption of a thing, with all this extra stuff attached. Again, ruining in my opinion what should be, and was meant to be a light weight, simple, and extremely accurate tool. Personally I would save the money on all the garbage \"tacticool\" stuff and put it into accuracy and a good rifle scope.

I am building an AR on a budget.  I could have it completed for less than $600.  That, to me, is a cheap AR.  That would be getting a basic build, with quality parts.  No tacticool foregrips with 27 attachments.  No piston operated, just DI. No fancy flash hider or aftermarket grip or stock, just basic stuff.  Will it be a sub-MOA gun?  Not likely, but I'm nowhere near a sub-MOA shooter, so I'm sure the gun will be fine for a while.  Plus, it's still decent parts.   I would not use a composite lower, even if they are cheaper.  I picked up a Stag lower just because it was a good price and it was available.  I got a killer deal on a Palmetto State Armory lower build kit with the buffer tube and stock for like $80.  I'll upgrade the stock later, but right now I just want it to function.  For the upper, I intend to spend more than the minimum, because that's where most of the accuracy will be. Maybe one day I'll build a really nice rifle with all the bells and whistles, but not right now.

	86341 : ["Here is some I picked up on here: BIDEN: Complained about \"economic policies of the last eight years\" that led to \"excessive deregulation.\" THE FACTS: Biden voted for 1999 deregulation that liberal groups are blaming for part of the financial crisis today. The law allowed Wall Street investment banks to create the kind of mortgage-related securities at the core of the problem now. The law was widely backed by Republicans as well as by Democratic President Clinton, who argues it has stopped the crisis today from being worse. ___ BIDEN: Said McCain supports tax breaks for oil companies, and \"wants to give them another $4 billion tax cut.\"  THE FACTS: Biden is repeating a favorite saw of the Obama campaign, and it's misleading. McCain supports a cut in income taxes for all corporations, and doesn't single out any one industry for that benefit.  __  BIDEN: \"As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry — deregulate it and let the free market move — like he did for the banking industry.\"  THE FACTS: Biden and Obama have been perpetuating this distortion of what McCain wrote in an article for the American Academy of Actuaries. McCain, laying out his health plan, only referred to deregulation when saying people should be allowed to buy health insurance across state lines. In that context, he wrote: \"Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.\"  ___  PALIN: \"Barack Obama even supported increasing taxes as late as last year for those families making only $42,000 a year.\"  BIDEN: \"The charge is absolutely not true. Barack Obama did not vote to raise taxes. The vote she's referring to, John McCain voted the exact same way.\"  THE FACTS: The vote was on a nonbinding budget resolution that assumed that President Bush's tax cuts would expire, as scheduled, in 2011. If that actually happened, it could mean higher taxes for people making as little as about $42,000.. In the March 14 budget resolution supported by Obama and Biden, McCain actually did not vote.  ___ ", 9228, "P95YzHNxaa", 0],

AHMEDINIJAD MEETING: Joe Biden lied when he said that Barack Obama never said that he would sit down unconditionally with Mahmoud Ahmedinijad of Iran. Barack Obama did say specifically, and Joe Biden attacked him for it. 3. OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING: Biden said, “Drill we must.” But Biden has opposed offshore drilling and even compared offshore drilling to “raping” the Outer Continental Shelf.” 4. TROOP FUNDING: Joe Biden lied when he indicated that John McCain and Barack Obama voted the same way against funding the troops in the field. John McCain opposed a bill that included a timeline, that the President of the United States had already said he would veto regardless of it's passage. 5. OPPOSING CLEAN COAL: Biden says he's always been for clean coal, but he just told a voter that he is against clean coal and any new coal plants in America and has a record of voting against clean coal and coal in the U.S. Senate. 6. ALERNATIVE ENERGY VOTES: According to FactCheck.org, Biden is exaggerating and overstating John McCain's record voting for alternative energy when he says he voted against it 23 times. 7. HEALTH INSURANCE: Biden falsely said McCain will raise taxes on people's health insurance coverage -- they get a tax credit to offset any tax hike. Independent fact checkers have confirmed this attack is false 8. OIL TAXES: Biden falsely said Palin supported a windfall profits tax in Alaska -- she reformed the state tax and revenue system, it's not a windfall profits tax. 9. AFGHANISTAN / GEN. MCKIERNAN COMMENTS: Biden said that top military commander in Iraq said the principles of the surge could not be applied to Afghanistan, but the commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force Gen. David D. McKiernan said that there were principles of the surge strategy, including working with tribes, that could be applied in Afghanistan. 10. REGULATION: Biden falsely said McCain weakened regulation -- he actually called for more regulation on Fannie and Freddie. 11. IRAQ: When Joe Biden lied when he said that John McCain was “dead wrong on Iraq”, because Joe Biden shared the same vote to authorize the war and differed on the surge strategy where they John McCain has been proven right. 12. TAX INCREASES: Biden said Americans earning less than $250,000 wouldn't see higher taxes, but the Obama-Biden tax plan would raise taxes on individuals making $200,000 or more.  13. BAILOUT: Biden said the economic rescue legislation matches the four principles that Obama laid out, but in reality it doesn't meet two of the four principles that Obama outlined on Sept. 19, which were that it include an emergency economic stimulus package, and that it be part of “part of a globally coordinated effort with our partners in the G-20.” 14.

This does not mean ones salvation is taken away but that one has not Truly chosen Christ as evidenced by the works of the holy spirit with in the individual.

	86358 : ["Whoa! You are treading in dangerous waters my friend. Read Acts 2:37-38. Amazing how easy it is. \"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works lest any man should boast.\" Ephesians 2:8-9. What you are trying to say is that we have to earn salvation. And the only way we can earn something is to work for it or to do something for it. If these two verses don't explain it for you, than I don't know what else to say. These verses in Revelation talk about those who faked being a Christian. And then it goes on to say that these people were rich. They were putting their trust in the money, not in Christ. They weren't Christians at all! The bible doesn't contradict itself at all. John 3:16- \"that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"", 9229, "ZYldgOdTaa", 2],
