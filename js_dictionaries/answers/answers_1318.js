While medium/large companies like to see other large company names, this may not be an advantage if you are applying at a \"family\" corporation. The culture/mentality is different. Small companies don't have really defined job descriptions, they are more fluid. They may not have top of the line technology. And, people who have only had experience in large companies may be uncomfortable with this.  It also can depend on the field. If you are in a technology role - having worked for a big name tech company (like Microsoft) would probably carry a lot more weight. But I can see that if you were in their Marketing department - well, you probably don't have lots of issues/experience with brand recognition.

You actually hurt them if it comes off that somebody else did it.   I want to know what they say, not what you say about them.

	71515 : ["I would highly recommend checking out this website,   for more tips, advice and strategies on how to craft a winning resume as well as everything else necessary to succeed in landing job offers. The problem with resume writing companies is that no matter how much they advertise that they'll write the perfect resume for you, nobody can talk about your accomplishments and the value you have added in your work experience as well as you can, simply because they don't know the whole story. More likely then not, these resume writing services will put some generic \"buzzwords\" that are all too common and will result in a fast exit into the trash can.  The key to crafting a great resume is by customizing your resume, using strong verbs, giving concrete examples of past accomplishments and showing your value through detail-specific and result-oriented bullet points. I have provided an outline of a resume below. a. Basic info - Name, address, phone number, email b. Education - School, GPA, relevant coursework, achievements/awards c. Work Experience - This should be the bulk of your resume where you discuss your prior positions in detail-specific and result-oriented bullet points d. Additional Experience or Leadership Activities - Anything else you would like to include such as prior employment, volunteer work, leadership positions you have held in the past or current e. Skills & Interests - List any technical skills you have accumulated (Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel are the basic ones) as well as some activities or interests you have to make yourself seem personable and not a robot.  To reiterate my first paragraph, really do check out   as I was able to land multiple job offers out of college by implementing and applying what I had learned to the interview/recruiting process. The website clearly lays out a step by step plan from start to finish (resumes/cover letters to interviewing tactics and etc). As I am sure you are well-aware of, landing a job isn't just about a great resume, it's a combination of many factors.  Additionally, what really sold me on the website was that it offered a 150% money-back guarantee. you either get a job or you get your money back and some. You really can't lose haha Best of luck and feel free to reach out to me should you have any further questions.", 8624, "None", 0],

So, do you know a kid who knows about riceballs other than an Asian kid in the neighborhood? Also, 4Kids director does not absolutely care and hate the Japanese culture. Why does he dub anime? Money? Fame? Reputation? Many reasons. He's the one leading the company, so he's showing what kids should watch instead of need to watch. Is that right? Teaching kids xenophobia? It is wrong clearly. 1.
