James II and VII, King of England and Scotland, is missing somewhere in France and is the most recent monarch to have his body go missing (blame the French Revolution). The remains of Oliver Cromwell are also missing. There are also a couple Welsh princes whose remains are missing; Dafydd ap Owain Gwynedd and Dafydd ap Llywelyn.
