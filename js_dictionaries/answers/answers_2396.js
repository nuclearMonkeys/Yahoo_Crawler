Once we have sinned, our minds are not capable of understanding the depth of meaning within it. 1 Cor. 2:14; 1 Cor. 1:17-27.  Yet, through God's providence, the Holy Spirit aids in communicating the gospel to us.  Ps. 25:8; 1 Thes. 1:5; 1 Pet. 1:12. If a hearer accepts the gospel, repents, confesses Christ and is baptized into Him, Acts 2:38; Matt. 16:16; John 14:6, then they receive the Holy Spirit into their hearts.  Acts 2:38.  The Spirit then guides the believer in understanding.  John 14:26; John 16:7-13; 1 Cor. 2:10-16. To believers, the Bible is self-authenticating because it claims to be inspired by God.  2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21.  Rejecting one portion while claiming to believe that another passage is of God is inconsistent. Responders should state whether their view is based upon Scripture (and cite to it) or upon some other basis, such as their own opinion.  That will make it easier for you to assess their answers. Pray and continue to study your Bible.  2 Tim. 2:14-15.  You will be blessed!", 10831, "MGLFntOXaa", 0],

	125623 : ["Everyone is a slave in the spiritual sense. We are either slaves to sin, which is our natural state, or we are slaves to Christ. The writers of the New Testament willingly declared their status as slaves of Christ. Paul opens his letter to the Romans by referring to himself as a “slave of Jesus Christ” (Romans 1:1) and his letter to Titus by calling himself a “slave of God” (Titus 1:1). James opens his epistle the same way, “James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ” (James 1:1).

Sure, but naybe he didn't want to hurt you or the family. All i know is if my wife fell in love with someone else, what would me being mad do? If she falls for someone, she falls. If she's out spreading her legs for no reason, that's being a skank (which could also be fixed if she was honest with me about wanting to live the single life a bit), but falling in love is different.

	125636 : ["Good questions. You need background info so you will understand the Bible better when you read it.  First of all, I don't think God ever planned on writing the Bible as we know it today. He just inspired certain people to put down in writing their experiences of Him. Secondly, I don't think the Bible was ever meant to be a a book of doctrine for Christians although it is used as a basis of discerning divine truths. The Bible is the most divisive and controversial book ever written. Fact: the Church came before the Bible. The Bible as we know it today was compiled only in the 3rd century.  More than anything else the Bible, from my experience, should be used to help us grow spiritually. The important thing is God's personal message for you. Here is a time-tested method for uncovering the mystery of the Word of God: \"the child of God (that's me) takes the Word of God (the Scriptures) into the presence of God (prayer) and lets the Holy Spirit of God (the Author) make that Word come to life for me and, more importantly, in me.\" I hope this helps you.", 10831, "None", 0],
	125637 : ["I think that the general opinion is that the Bible is simply a guide. The belief of most (Protestant) Christians is that a personal relationship with Jesus is what you really need and not necessarily a perfect understanding of scripture. I can't speak for Catholics. I believe that a Christian would also argue that if God wanted you to understand a particular verse, he would use his Holy Spirit to inspire the true meaning in you, and if not, and it didn't negatively effect your walk with Jesus, he wouldn't bother. That's always the point of view (for the most part) that I've experienced. For them, the Bible, though confusing and supposedly inspired by \"not the author of confusion,\" holds no contradictions no matter how strong the evidence. For us, however, it's just another nail in the coffin of Christianity. Truly, people can believe anything they REALLY want to.", 10831, "None", 2],

You obviously understand the importance of fasting so you have to explain that to your parents. Be polite, don't get drawn into an argument - if it looks that way then leave the room. You should try not to get into an argument when you are fasting as it might actually invalidate it - not sure but hopefully someone more knowledgeable will verify that or correct me if I am wrong.  Explain the importance of fasting for you and explain also that you are not allowed to engage in arguments when fasting. Cover your food and leave it in the fridge as you suggested. Go for a walk or something if it look like they going to start an argument with you.    Here is an article to help you explain if you need one: plus this one: May Allah subhana wa ta'ala help you in your fasting and plight with your parents and may your journey into Islam be a very rewarding one, with ease and much help along the way...ameen.

He uses the analogy of a slave and his master to make the point that a slave obeys his master because he belongs to him. Slaves have no will of their own. They are literally in bondage to their masters. When sin is our master, we are unable to resist it. But by the power of Christ to overcome the power of sin, \"You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness\" (Romans 6:18). Once we come to Christ in repentance and receive forgiveness for sin, we are empowered by the Holy Spirit who comes to live within us. It is by His power that we are able to resist sinning and become slaves of righteousness. Jesus' disciples belong to Him and want to do the things that please Him. This means that the children of God obey Him and live in freedom from habitual sin.
