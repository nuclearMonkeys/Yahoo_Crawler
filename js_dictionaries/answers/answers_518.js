	28895 : ["Anything can happen. Having said that, I became a racing fan in 1977. Horses ran more often and ran longer distances. There was no Breeders Cup, the one day to save your horse for. Horses had to compile a good solid resume built on winning a good number of Grade 1s and 2s in order to win an eclipse. (Okay, I acknowledge the east coast bias that existed, and the inordinate amount of weight that the Jockey Club Gold Cup had, but all in all, the claim for supremacy didn't boil down to one day). In the opinion of many, the breed simply does not have the strength, stamina and durability it once had. Classic distance racing has taken a big hit. Races that were held at a mile and half have been shortened to a mile and a quarter; mile and a quarter to a mile and an eighth. The Jockey Club Gold Cup was run at 2 miles until 1976. The Coaching Club American Oaks was a mile and a half. I remember the Monmouth Oaks being run at a mile and an eighth. Also at Monmouth, their big handicap of the year for older horses was always run at a mile and a quarter. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I've read that thoroughbreds are now bred deliberately for speed over endurance. Now, if a horse runs a solid mile and an eighth, he's lauded as the next coming of Forego. Call me a fossil, but I don't think the changes that I've seen in the 40+ years of following thoroughbred racing have been for the better. Better policing regarding abuse and improvement in the safety and treatment of the horses, yes; but everything else? On the balance, I'd have to say no.¬†", 4489, "deQ4bSlPaa", 0],

	28914 : ["I agree with Blue Jay, the running style you're referring to is a Closer! In my opinion a CLOSER is the most exciting style in horse racing. A closer will go to the back of the pack, sometimes as many as 9 to15 lengths off the lead, and then wait and make one big run at the end of the race. Another great closer; The great Zenyatta, she definitely is known as one of the greatest closers of all time as well.¬† Zenyatta would charge from last to first and win by as much as three lengths or more. There's also: FRONT RUNNERS: These types of runners want the lead right from the beginning of the race. A beginner may think of this as a good thing, and it can be, but often times horses that are in the lead in the beginning tend to tire themselves out and fade towards the end. Some even go wire to wire. Front Runners go for the lead right from the start, and the they battles hard with the horse beside him to get that lead. STALKERS: A stalker likes to be near the lead, but doesn't necessarily have to be ahead to be happy. Typically a stalker sits within one to four lengths of the lead and waits until the top of the stretch before making their move. If the race lacks a true front running horse a stalker can assume the lead as well. They sits patiently, and start to move at the top of the stretch.¬†", 4490, "552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa", 2],
