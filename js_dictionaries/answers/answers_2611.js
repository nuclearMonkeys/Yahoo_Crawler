How many ,say, Aquarians are in the world?....Millions...do you think all of them will be thoughtful, rash, exciting, sensitive (or whatever twaddle these people make up)..of course not. Do you think they will all have a life changing experience this week...No, but some will and if they have read it in their horoscope they will think...'Wow.aren't these horoscopes accurate?'

	136384 : ["Shawn Michaels retiring. Because Shawn inspired me and even though he \"retired\" many times during his prime. Something about him expressing his farewell in a proper speech gave a finality to my childhood. It was my dream to see him perform live but sadly I live in another country and don't have enough money to travel. It would be great to see Bret Hart return; but the fact that Bret didn't really inspire me as much as HBK. It's a once in a lifetime thing and people never thought he would actually return but Bret never meant as much to me as HBK.", 11326, "YcWGDKvkaa", 0],

We would sit at the back of lecture theatres and wait for our friends to enter th room below and call them to try to catch them out, before they switched off or changed settings to silent.

	136408 : ["Anal sex between guys would not contain any person 'being handled like a lady', there's nothing female in it. It is now not as clear cut as dominant/submissive both, a lot of homosexual men take both roles. Your son is who he is, he's 21, he is acquired an identity. Somewhat of rough intercourse is not going to make him into what i will a 'fancy' homosexual man. I can see that you are involved about individuals treating him another way but that is his fight to fight- all you can do is be supportive. You have had a shock and i'm certain your son realises that. When you see him he'll be embarrassed, worried and defiant. There possibly just a little of shouting at the beginning, do not react to it. There'll be time to address all of the concerns you've got when things have calmed down but at the moment he simply desires to know that you simply love him and accept him.", 11316, "3QKEwmg3aa", 0],

	136412 : ["1) I think Ted is a better wrestler because he is more aggressive and vicious then Cody. He can apply really good submissions and stuff and Cody is just there for girls, but he is pretty good, too. 2) I think Ted simply because of his wrestling skills and promos and stuff. Cody is good and all, but Ted is just  a bit better, i mean the match he had against Orton when his dad was guest host, WOW, he is a sure fire world champion some day. 3) Again, Ted simply because he is an all around better wrestler than Cody. He doesn't have a lisp, so people won't laugh everytime he cuts a promo like i do, and he is so talented and Ted is still at a very young age. 4) This i have to give to Cody. Cody is much more faster and athletic than Ted, he does cool stuff from the turnbuckle like moonsaults and stuff and does more agile things than Ted. 5) Ted in my opinion, because he has a more serious face and not a funny lisp. Ted really focuses on what he says, and you can tell by the way his face turns all red and stuff and he really makes u wanna punch the TV. BQ-.... I'll go with Yahoo", 11322, "EHYBicGkaa", 0],
