	109969 : ["Concrete serves two functions: resisting compression loads (weight put on top of it) and as dead weight (adding mass to metal fence posts, for example). Your situation requires neither.  A wood post is best supported by using the excavated material. Set the posts 3' deep (or below frost line in really cold climates, whichever is deeper). Put 4-6\" pea gravel in the bottom of each hole to keep the posts off the dirt. Backfill holes 8-12\" at a time and tamp with a tamping bar. This is a 40 lb bar that has a 3\" blade on one end (for 'mixing' Sakrete in a hole), and looks like a nail head on the other end (for tamping dirt around posts). You'll use the nail head looking end. They cost about $20 and are 5-6' long. The reason the dirt is better than concrete is b/c most pressure treated lumber has a very high moisture content from the lumber yard. I've gotten squirted in the eye with water from hitting a board with a hammer. As the wood dries, it shrinks. The concrete wont shrink with it, leaving the wood just standing in a square hole in the concrete. I've had to fix several handrails with this problem. I just lifted the posts right out of the concrete, removed the blocks, and replaced them with longer posts backfilled with dirt.  As for rotting, pressure treated lumber does rot. It is only resistant to rot, not impervious. Concrete holds moisture, which will wick up into the post. The post won't rot in the conventional sense, like being eaten by bugs and such, but it will get spongey. Exposure to constant moisture will cause the arsenic to leech out of the wood and it will be attacked by microorganisms. That's why those tiny labels on the ends of the boards say not to use them underwater or in contact with constant moisture. Bottom line; use dirt. Concrete is for putting weight on top of, like a footer, or for making those metal posts that they use in chain link fences bottom heavy. It should never be used to anchor a wooden post. Using dirt means that the posts can always be fixed in place if they lean or fail. Concrete is a one-shot deal. Whenever you do any kind of construction, you have to be able to explain to someone else WHY you're doing it the way that you are and why you're NOT doing it some other way. If someone tells you, \"that's the way we always do it\", or \"it's just better that way\" and can't explain in detail why, then they don't know what they are doing. It is more important to understand a process than it is to 'know how to do it'.", 10124, "AA11544552", 2],

Sorry to say, but Europe and United States is going to continue to trickle down in the same economic and alli-relationships between people in the East, that is where the global shift is happening at.  Heck, I'm considering the move to the east once I get out of college.  The east is where everything is happening at now with factories and production of most of our products we consume and our financial holds are among the wealthiest of the east.  So forget alliances with the Europen Nations cause they will turn their backs on us so fast we wouldn't even be able to say Osama Bin Laden. lol.  So we need a president that is able to negotiate with people in the East.  One word: Obama.  Not only is his name different from all other past presidents, but he brings to the table a different representaion of the U.S.  For thousands of years, it has always been old white guys (OWGs) that have took land from people of color and killed not only them but their culture and religion and acted like they were superior because they were white and it's about time that we have a different look.  I think that showing the world that we can do anything or overcome some things in our country will help the leaders of these nations talk more at ease about the toughest decisions in the world, literally.  McCain is just like all the rest.  His goal is to make it good until he is out of office and I'm sorry, but putting another band-aid over this trama wound isn't going to cut it any longer.  I mean shouldn't our box of band-aids be empty y now form the past five presidents or are we borrowing that from Argentina as well? lol.

When the decision needs to be made between mom's mental health and baby, mom should come first, otherwise both parties suffer. Don't give yourself too hard a time. Attachment parenting is a huge commitment and you should be commended for choosing to do it. I've been blessed in that my 4 mo rarely ever cries. I wear him around and co-sleep and he just knows everything is all right. I never leave him to cry alone on the occasions when he does lose it, and never let him cry himself to sleep. The only times he cries without immediate result is if we're in the car. And even then I pull over to soothe him as soon as possible until he is able to calm down. As for the long run, the whole point of attachment parenting is that the child learns his/her needs will be met, and a trust bond is formed so that as s/he gets older, s/he experiences less anxiety and will tolerate separation better.

	109994 : ["All of your answers to date point out the exact problem with your question. The answer is..... It depends. You need to take into consideration the soils type and bearing capacity of that soil, the temperature ranges for your area, ie; freezing winters in Maine VS no freeze at all in Texas, plus the design, layout of the fence, the height, and spacing of structural posts. Then, once all that is in the equation, further refine your design info to include depth of hole, size of post, and size of the hole circumference.  It is generally accepted that a four foot depth of hole with a concrete base 2 1/2 times the circumference of the post, and rising up the post only 1/2 the depth of the hole, will provide optimum support for the post given the design criteria in frost affected ares. In non frost areas, I'm just not sure what the recommendations would be. Best to check with the local codes office, the building materials store, or a structural engineer.  It is also imperative to use the proper post. Even pressure treated lumber has different ratings for above grade, below grade, and submerged water contact for their pressure treating process. So an above grade post installed in a hole in the ground that can collect water in it will rot over time, even though it's pressure treated. Only pressure treated and Cedar posts are recommended, but the Cedar WILL rot over time, again depending on water table, freeze, and rain exposure. Let me know how you make out.
