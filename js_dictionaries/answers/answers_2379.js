I know that converting from elementary school to high school was tough, I lost a friend who decided to try to make everyone hate me because she's a jealous person, she's done this to one of my other friend before. It didn't work though, it only resulted in people hating her, and likeing me more. All I know is, if you've seperated to go to different colleges it might be hard. For you and for your old friends. New schools, far away from home and other new friends. Lots of homework, etc.  Maybe they've forgotten their roots and the people who made them who they are, but the most you can do is remember them, and just keep trying. In a message, ask for their phone number and the most convinient time to call them!  If you give your heart, the worst thing that can happen is that it'll be rejected and given back to you so you can give it to new people that WILL keep in touch!

Anyway, you are going to meet a lot of people LIKE you or very UNLIKE yourself, so be prepared. There are going to be fakes, liars, cheaters, druggies, nerds, etc.  You should just be YOURSELF, all the time, and get real friends, the ones that will support you no matter what. Also, you should never cut classes, bad. Get more involved in school, something I didn't try to do...but really should have. Join extracurricular activities, clubs, sports teams, etc. Whatever you like, you know? Don't regret like me... The high school years and how fun it is, all depends on how you want to make it...for me, I made it sort of dull and boring and tiring...and didn't get to be myself that much, because I didn't let myself be...there is going to be drama and all, just avoid it...just try your best.

My husband and I have also set up long term health insurance, so that when the time comes where we need extra help, we can either pay someone to assist us in our home and as disease worsen, especially with severe dementia, put that money towards an assisted living or nursing home.) while our daughter scoffs at that and say she would never leave her dad or I, it's what we want. I know first hand how painful it is to care for a parent until their death and it ages you and breaks your heart. Yet, I would have done it no other way. My point of bringing my own life choices to the plate is that, my daughter, though touched by my willingness to do this, it isn't giving her a choice. That choice being to love us and be able to share in our final days. She says, \"Mom, there will never be another you, I want as much time with you as I can.\" maybe this how the wife of the man in your story would feel.

If I choose to spend it at my husband's bedside, who is he to forbid it?  If I need to spend hours crying over him, reading to him, confessing my heart's deepest secrets, or simply holding his hand for weeks-- and that's what I ultimately need to allow me to let him go, then that's what I should be able to do.  I think a much better route would be to have the discussion with HER, not the lawyer.  A heart-to-heart, eye-to-eye talk about what's to come.  Convince her you want her to live and love without you, but then trust that she is able to make the decison for herself whether and/or how she honors, loves, or grieves you.

Equal rights? Why not practice what you preach. Everyone has their own reasons for how they feel about things in their own lives. That is their choice, not yours. The fact that someone else does not see things your way is obviously a threat to you because you demand that they are wrong for their thinking, yet if they changed their mind and agreed with you there would be no problem.

Even your lifelong friends or whatever.  If they just tell one person, next thing you know its around school. also, if hear rumors or something, never tell anyone them.  Everyone might end up blaming you if a secret or something gets into the wrong hands.  Also, look for new friends.  Even if your comfortable with your group of friends, its nice to know there are other friends as well for you.  Pay lots of attention to your grades and don't fall under any peer-pressure.  Don't do things that you're uncomfortable with, and try to be happy:)  High school is a great experience, enjoy it!

I went to a private school, so it wasn't that big and people really knew everyone's business. It caused a fair amount of drama, but everything does mellow out as you grow older. It's unique, but as soon as people start to realize that everything going to change soon, new friendships form and everyone just becomes a lot more accepting.  And, if you plan on going to college, don't freak out in freshman year, but do start early. It saves a lot of time because you'll be a senior and you won't want to stay at home on weekends and write essays :/ Above all, it does end quickly.

I get WHY someone might want to make that kind of will. I get WHY he would want them to move forward. I just don't think its the best way to achieve it. put a time limit and say you do not wish to be held on life support. then you have forced them to move forward...without being a burden, without them stuck beside a hospital bed...but without denying them the ability to process the situation, work through the situation and grieve and come to terms with the situation in their own way. but thats just my opinion.", 10807, "None", 2],

Lofty words, so much 'education' this is 2009 what the f does that mean? this is year 0 in terms of timeless truths. You can't break the law of nature, you can only provide it, or use it to your disadvantage or advantage.

Then if they don't respect you, you can cut them off- but be quick to want to understand them, be quick to listen, slow to speak. That way they will stand a better chance of respecting you. To all the anti-whites out there (and encouraging or acquiescing to race mixing with whites is anti-white), you are all perverts, traitors or thugs. I'm not saying love doesn't exist between races. Of course it does, in different forms. Love is not enough. I should say individualistic selfish love is not enough. You haev to love your race, your heritage, your ancestors, and it's not as if there's not a large pool of people whom you can't find someone to love in. It's not as if you're the last white person on the planet. So love your race, especially if you're european. know your subgroups but don't use ethnicity above race as a cause to be race-divided.
