Athena makes a very good point. \"your world\" is in your head....Athena's world is in her head and so to is BB's \"world\" (in his head of course) Interestingly, we 3 heads (& more...)  NOW KNOW that RWPossum's head is partially in there (his head, so to speak) because his so-called \"outer head\" by his own admission,  includes his family, environment & community ;  And as he therefore could..well be mistaken about \"his\" community & environment * (we should guess less so with his family) : he makes a..philosophical mistake whereas others need not ** * for instance he MAY believe (in his own world &) environment that his or our community is not seriously threatened by    present Climate Change (et al of course).

For this serious mistake threatens not only world three but also our ordinary world.     It is akin to an individual's obsession with \"power\" and therefore with \"control\", in this     case that area of world 3 where philosophical ideas are formed.     And so it is the failure of such individuals TO BELIEVE IN PHILOSOPHY, and especially within     PHILOSOPHY'S...GROWTH.     And in doing so those individuals have made-a-pact with \"subjective-ism\", the Enemy of     Philosophy.     And this is a warning, especially so to students here who do want to learn, to learn also     not just from such individual's past mistakes (should they open-up about them) but from     say group mistakes -- WHERE SUCH HAVE BEEN EDUCATED WITHIN A GROUP, and     therefore a SCHOOL of philosophy for example...

	134861 : ["Yo Rocky! First of all:  I want everybody who says that they want to be a Marine to not even think about what job they \"think\" they are going to get in the Marine Corps. The Marines that I respect are those Marines that want to be IN the Marine Corps because they WANT to be a Marine!  And, thus, the actual job you do get means nothing.   Every Marine is an infantryman.   Remember?  \"This is my rifle, this is my gun.  This is for shooting.  This is for fun!\" That's it.  What job (MOS) the Marines selects for you is the job the Marines wants you to do. The NEEDS of the Corps come before the WANTS of the Individual. It is \"nice\" to dream of those \"sniper jobs\" \"ranger jobs\" \"SEAL\" jobs \"Recon\" jobs.  That's all poster boy stuff.   You want to be a Marine?  You go on line to amazon dot com and type in \"Guidebook for Marines\" published by the Marine Corps Association, 18th edition, 2nd printing.  450 pages and 33 chapters of all ESSENTIAL Marine Corps knowledge.  Price:  cheap:  $7 + $4 postage.  If you are still in high school then study this handbook.  Memorize it.  Learn it.  It is everything you need to become a Meritorious Marine!  It's cheaper than a pizza! Now, if you enlist you are going to have very little, if any, time to go to college as a first termer.  You will be so busy with your field work that you won't have the time or motivation to do any college work for at least your first enlistment until you make Sergeant (E-5) probably. So, if you want to become an officer then the sure way to do it is to go to a college that offers Navy ROTC and get accepted to the college and enrolled into Navy ROTC and the Marine Option.  I don't care what officer field you want to be in.  You will be told at that time what Officer Fields for Marine Second Lieutenants are available when you are ready to select and be assigned.  And that is 4 years away plus the year you wasted before getting to college plus how many years of high school you still have left.  No one knows what enlisted or officer jobs will be open when it is your turn. That's why I say:  Just be glad to become a Marine.  And, you will do your duty in what ever MOS or officer field you are assigned to. If you are going to college you need to have better qualifications than the \"average\" college student.  The US military demands higher knowledge and skills and physical fitness than the rest of society requires. Strive to get a 3.8 - 4.0 GPA Strive to get an ACT from 29 - 32 Strive to get a combined SAT from 2,000 - 2,100 Letter in high school in a sport. Marines must be more physically fit than the other services.  There are no fat Marines.  Give up all fast foods. No more pizzas, burgers, fries, donuts, cakes, ice cream, cookies, pies, soda with corn syrup sweeteners, etc.  You never want to be on the 'fat boy' program.  NEVER. In the Guidebook for Marines it outlines the Daily 16 exercises.  Learn them and do them! The Corps won't tell you this;  but, I will.  For Heaven's sake don't get married during your first enlistment.  You don't need a wife until you make NCO status.  The Marine Corps is your wife.  First and always.  When you go to Okinawa for 12 months you won't have a wife behind crying over you.   Semper Fi, Larry Smith Senior Master Sergeant, USAF (Ret.) First Sergeant", 11249, "None", 1],
