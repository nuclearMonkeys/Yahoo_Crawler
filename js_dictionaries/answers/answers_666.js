Some of it can come from diet too. Have you spoken to your vet about what's going on and the smell you notice from him?   My hounds (not I might add, my Whippet) have occasionally suffered from a yeast infection for which my vet's always suggest using Malaseb.   Unfortunately that's very harsh and more often makes their skin over-react.   I found DermOpt was more successful - there are others too.  My Whippet, with her short coat, has very (and I do mean very) rarely had a bath, or needed one.   She has regular grooming when I check for new lumps and bumps, but that's it.   And I never smell her at all. Have you checked his ears, which if they get infection down there, can cause a bad smell - and so can anal glands if there's a problem there. You might find a basic medicated shampoo helps?   They are usually strong smelling.", 5531, "iNsBFkZ3aa", 2],
