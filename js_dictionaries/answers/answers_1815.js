This may mean that you are more vulnerable to infections, such as coughs, colds and flu. You can help to boost your immune system by eating a healthy diet including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. These contain antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin C, which help to fight infections. You may also like to take a vitamin and mineral supplement specifically formulated for pregnant women, available from chemists.

Like oldernwiser, children were simply not permitted to address an adult by first name only.  \"Aunt -------\" was more respectful than first name alone and more cordial than \"Mrs.--------\" I was born in Arkansas to Jewish parents in 1958 and my mother, also born in Arkansas was raised this way.  I know I recall my father who was raised in Texas, as an adult even calling a friend of his mother in law \"Uncle\" when he referred to him and a female friend of his own mother as \"Aunt\"..so I guess he was raised this way, too This was a sort of respectful term of endearment reserved for their close friends.  I wasn't expected to call all their acquaintances by that title. Perhaps this was more a Southern thing, because I saw this done with both Jewish families and Gentile families in the 1960's. It was also done with both black and whites. It appears that this custom began to go out of style in the 70's and by the 80's and 90's I don't hear this very often.  I did not teach my son to do this for all my friends, but to call adults by Mr or Ms unless the adult tells them they can address them by a first name or another way.  I do have a few long time family friends he calls \"Aunt\" and \"Uncle\" who were raised with that custom like me and wished to be called Aunt & Uncle so that's what he calls them since it does show genuine affection and respect.

Quite honestly, if your not watching this series of Doctor Who simply because there's a couple of characters in it that you don't like, your really missing out on some excellent stuff.  The two parter with the Sontarans was the best of the series so far, and \"The Doctor's Daughter\" although it seemed a bit rushed was very enjoyable and introduced a very important new character, as the title suggests.
