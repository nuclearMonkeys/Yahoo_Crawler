	58380 : ["Consider alternatives.  Laser printers may be initially more expensive. But, if you do a lot of printing, toner will cost less than inkjet ink. You'll save in the long run. You could also consider printers that use ribbons instead of ink. Impact printers can print on multipart forms. Daisy wheel printers have good quality printing, but you are limited to the characters on the wheel. Dot matrix printers with wire print heads are more flexible. You can buy small thermal printers specifically made to print labels.", 8100, "k7hBT7MGaa", 2],

	58391 : ["I've used Brother and Samsung laser printers for decades.  Toner is far cheaper per page than ink and the resulting product doesn't smear.  No issues with either brand that a homeowner couldn't fix himself -- until they plum wore out [and then you just buy a new one].  -- grampa", 8095, "GJKWgx0Paa", 1],
	58392 : ["Inkjet, Epson. Ink is cheap and readily available. Their aftersales service is good and efficient. For laser, Brother has cheap printers and more importantly cheaper ink toner cartridges. Very cheap build though. I'm more into the quality and longevity of HP laser printers so much so that the printers remain fully functional even after they have discontinued supplying ink cartridges for it already. Yes, HP has that habit of not fixing things properly forcing you to just buy a new printer instead. That's why I mistakenly tried Brother. Canon, from where I am has ink that is very hard to find and worse, their service center is very far and takes so long to fix things and instead recommend you just buy a new one instead also. ", 8095, "21112cc7ac2bacc93374e23ada41a67caa", 1],
	58393 : ["I've owned Epsons and HPs.  I've always seem to have more problems with the HPs.  Although I do like the idea of HP's Instant Ink subscription service where you pay X dollars for Y many pages per month, and they just send you the ink as needed for no extra charge. In the past, I always ended up wasting far more ink on cleaning printheads than I ever used printing pages.  With the subscription, I'm really only paying for what I print and HP pays for all the wasted ink used in the cleaning cycles. So when my Epson dies, I'll probably go with HP and their Instant Ink program.", 8095, "d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa", 2],
