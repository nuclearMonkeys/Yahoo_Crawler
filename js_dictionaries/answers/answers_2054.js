If you cant make a decent snoe ball in your hands, the snow is too dry ( and its too cold outside)  If you can make a snowball easily in your hands ( take some snow, cup it between your palm, open your hands and if it keeps its shape you are good to go. if it falls apart you are just setting yourself to a frustraing hour trying to make even a bigger ball)  You can either showel the snow into one place and start building it up or you can take a small ball, set it to the ground where the snow is still loose and hasnt been packed and then start rolling it. It will get bigger as the new snow stick to it ( if the snow isnt too dry)  You really dont need two people because all you need is 3 balls on top of each other. Of course if you are trying to make a life size 6 ft one then you might wanna ask for help :)  Usually you have to do both, roll up a ball and then stack them up, adding extra snow with your hands or a showel to fill some missing clumps etc..  Its fun and it doesnt need to be perfect for kids to love it My daughter loves a snow pony, which is really easy to make too, just put two bigger balls next to each other, fill up the gaps so its a pretty solid block, add one more ball on top of one of the bottom ones fr the neck and head and then shape it a little bit to look like a horses head lol.. she rides on hers for a long time when we have any snow aroundhere ( which isnt often)", 10058, "PFO1jxZGaa", 1],

(if you use one).  don't put a split shot on the top of the hook.  all that does will put the bait on the floor and will not let it move with the water making the bait look alive and active.  there you go that is the best advice i got for you for using live worms.  hope that helps out", 10060, "1nJFqRceaa", 0],
	108482 : ["Use a much smaller hook.  The worm is obviously attracting the fish - so that is not the problem.  Try using a smaller hook and if that doesn't work, then use a smaller sinker so you can tell the bite a lot easier.  If that doesn't work then the last alternative before giving up is changing monofilament line over to Fireline or fine braid.  As the line doesn't stretch, it is incredible how light a bite you can feel.  Really gives you the advantage.  But it is expensive so it would be a last resort.", 10060, "None", 0],

(By that I mean, if I were to ask an Orthodox Rabbi, I'd go with whatever he told me. Until then, I don't buy his claim). His claim that a spirit told him leads me to think he is NOT an Orthodox Jew, and therefore anything he says on religion or spiritual issues is automatically suspect. However, one is not supposed to have figurines of animals or humans, as these can be considered idols, or used as idols. Fortunately, you (as a Gentile) have the ability to remove the status of an object as an idol (or \"decommission\" it, if you like.). I don't believe in the Illuminati, and I don't believe in \"evil spirits\" that inhabit figurines. To think such things are to be feared is exactly the definition of idolatry. Idolatry is taking the fear, honor, love that we should show to God alone, and giving that to something else. Fear WAS a method of worship in the ancient past, which can be seen from the Biblical commandment to fear God. It is therefore not fitting to fear spirits, evil or otherwise, and certainly is not fitting to try to appease them. They have NO power over you; the only power over you is (or 'should be') God.", 10054, "PbMkIRW5aa", 1],
