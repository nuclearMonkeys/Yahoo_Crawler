Capitalism unfairly concentrates power and wealth among a small segment of society that controls capital and creates an unequal society.  Socialism advocates the creation of an egalitarian society, in which wealth and power are distributed more evenly, and that doesn't mean you are going to work hard and then the hobo down the street will make money, I just like the equal aspect socialism brings, capitalism is just based all on materialism, and classes, no one is equal, it's unfair in my opinion. There will be many policies that have semi-ties to socialism in politics, people need to get educated, especially those who believe that socialism is an almighty bad thing, because it's not.  People who call Obama a socialist assume socialism means the same thing as communism, and communism means Soviet Russia, and people remember Soviet Russia has being bad, and hating the United States.

Socialism failed everywhere and we are coming to an end in this world for all old things, to change to a new, and socialism is as old as water. Society will change but the closer we come to being socialistic the more you will see the crumbling of our society and if we don't find a way to survive this we may end up to be a  totalitarian state and then a war and then the end.

I think anyone who understands the situation wants to see the US Auto industry salvaged... but that's hardly the same thing as trusting that the folks who did nothing about this for decades to all of a sudden understand how to save themselves.  The future of GM's management will be part of the restructuring program. Keep in mind that we, the taxpayers, have already contributed many times the actual value of all outstanding shares of GM stock... we really should have a say, and the Obama administration has experts on this, working together with people within GM to actually solve this.  Yes, the UAW is also part of this, and they were already required to make major concessions, as part of the original $17.5 billion deal with GM. So were GM's creditors. Basically, they're trying to cut GM's debt by 2/3, lower UAW pay to match that of the Japanese manufacturers, and move the cost of retiree healthcare from GM (GM and other US automakers pay an average of about $1500 per car in healthcare costs, versus zero for every other automaker in the world) to an independent trust run by the union. Executive pay cuts and an overall restructuring of the company are the final basic pieces of this plan, but details other than the ousting of Wagoner have yet to be revealed.  Note that it's hardly just GM having hard times, but other companies are run more responsibly. After their first operating loss in decades, Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe is voluntarily stepping down. At PSA Peugeot-Citroen, CEO Christian Streiff was ousted by the board of directors.  It seems to be a new and uniquely American thing to routinely reward epic failure. That's the very first thing that needs to be fixed here.", 9156, "AbRfd29Haa", -1],

My real concern is Geithner's suggestion that the government get to take over companies that are not on the Federal dole.  That is socialism.

Those include the candida that cause thrush. But while the \"intestinal flora\" supplements you mention have shown some benefits at reducing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, they have not been shown to be very effective at treating thrush. You should treat the candida with an effective antifungal medicine, such as oral fluconazole (Diflucan) or nystatin (Mycostatin), The usual bacterial population will return to your mouth and intestinal tract on its own. Drixoral cold and Allergy, an over-the-counter drug that's a long-acting combination of the decongestant pseudo-ephedrine and an antihistamine, has few long term side effects. Some of the short-term effects, such as sedation, may even lessen with continued use. But by using a fixed-dose combination drug, you may be taking more than what is needed to treat your allergy symptoms. If sneezing and watery eyes are your main problem, an antihistamine alone would usually suffice, and the decongestant ingredient in Drixoral would be unnecessary.
