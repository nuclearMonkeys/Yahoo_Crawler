	89719 : ["In practice, yes:  Protestants can believe whatever they want. The fundamental error of Protestantism is that scripture alone reveals God's revelation, not the Church established by Jesus.  This means that each individual Protestant Christian is a pope unto himself, authorized to decide what the Bible means. If his current fellowship disagrees, he is free to seek another fellowship of like-minded believers. As a result, we find \"Christians\" who endorse every sin imagined by the people of this world, including sodomy and infanticide, ascribing their evil to any ambiguities they can find in the Bible. No, this is emphatically NOT in God's plan.", 9337, "oZV4Mqqaaa", 3],
	89720 : ["It's practically true--especially today.  There are many Protestant churches that are on the edge of being Christian. They say they go by the Bible alone, but many of these churches take a single verse and twist it around to match their beliefs. Some even go as far to make that one verse the meaning behind their entire Christian belief. For example: Anabaptists say that baptism should not be done because they consider it a work. Doesn't matter that there's 40 other references stating that baptism is needed, that it's a Sacrament and that Jesus himself was baptized, because of one verse against works, they don't baptize.  Christ certainly did not intend His Church to be that way. It is why it is the Church that is the \"pillar and foundation of truth\" and not that Bible. We didn't even have the Bible until almost 4 centuries AFTER Christ's death. If the Bible is what we were supposed to use, then Christianity would have died out immediately because there was no Bible. The earliest written Gospel was Matthew around 90 A.D.--meaning there was still at least 60 years for Christianity to have fallen.  Christianity would not have survived if people based their faith on Scripture alone. Jesus gave us a visible Church whom guided by the Holy Spirit would have the authority to interpret Scripture and based upon Oral Tradition keep the Church from going into apostasy.  That said, there are some beliefs that all Protestants must agree to to be considered Christian: --The Trinity (though even that's becoming a debated issue among Protestants) --Jesus is our Savior --Jesus is God --Sin and the forgiveness of sin --Heaven Unforunately, Hell is being taught to not exist either (nor Satan, which I'm certain he's mad about!) These are some things that must be believed to be even considered Christian, they are the most basic beliefs. After that...yeah, Protestants can pretty much believe and teach whatever they want because there is no authoritative figure to direct them. It is their own interpretation (fallible interpretation) that leads them through their teachings. This is not what Jesus intended.

Churches do experience schisms, but it's not generally done for completely frivolous reasons. True, people are free to start new denominations, if they are disturbed enough by the direction in which their church is headed (for instance, after some churches began reaching out toward the gay community, or ordaining women, there were people who disagreed and began either attending church elsewhere or laying the groundwork for new denominations).

These men had authority given to them by Jesus Christ to act in His place.  Who ordained protestant preachers?  This authority comes from Christ not the Bible, and the Catholic church has an excessive history of demarcation from scriptural practices and abuse of power to show that if they ever held this authority they don't have it any more.
