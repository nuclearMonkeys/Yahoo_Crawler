Pedophiles can't be rehabilitated, children are their preference, they are not going to change.

	128020 : ["Being a victim of child sexual abuse I feel strongly about the rights to prevent child abuse. I'm also a child advocate for 5+ years. This being said, Castration is NOT the answer. Child sex offenders and/or rapists do not abuse simply for the sexual act. Rapists do if for the power and control over the victim. So simply saying cut off their penis is not the way to stop these crimes.  What people do not think about is, if they no longer have a 'tool' aka penis but they still have the urge and aggression what do you think they will do? The same thing those who have been castrated or can not get it up do. They use other items to violate/abuse victims.  I've seen victims sexually assault by bottles, toilet blungers, and other unthink about items. So castrating them does not prevent.  My opinion let's put all sex offenders on an island where they can not leave and let them offend each other and kill each other off.  Or simply mark them with a tattoo showing they are an offender and put them in general public in prison. Being a former Prison guard believe me they would get what's coming to them.  You ask the question why would you not want to protect innocent people from sex attacks. I would! I do each day! But castration would not prevent sexual abuse/assaults.", 10962, "nFLYkIOoaa", 1],
	128021 : ["As a mother I have a pretty definite idea about sex offenders, particularly pedophiles. It has been clearly proved that the recidivism is almost 95%. To allow individuals with this proclivity to roam around free and potentially injure or ruin an innocent child or adults life is for me completely unforgivable. Perhaps if castration was the standard punishment, it might just curtail the abundance of sickos out there. Hard to say of that would work. It would be very interesting to have a complete metabolic work up of these people to see where they are chemically as well as psychologically. I am not sure what has been tried in the past, but with hormone replacement therapies perhaps some of the milder cases could be helped with this. I am also in favor of the death penalty for these people. And if it happened to be my child that had been violated...I would be happy to volunteer to pull the switch or administer the injection. These people are really a pariah on civilized society.", 10962, "NPEjYroOaa", 0],
	128022 : ["Swim. Swimming is very effective! Sprinting will raise your Vo2max somewhat, but if you really want to reek huge results, mileage is the answer.

	128033 : ["The unfortunate fact is that a sex offender that has been chemically castrated can easily counteract the affects by using hormonal antidote or by using a foreign object to assault. The problem is not in the hormones, but in the brain. You can castrate, but it does not take away from the urge for these people to keep committing these assaults. If you have a way to alter the affects of the mind and keep these people from these sick urges, I'm all for it, but there is no positive evidence that castration is the cure. I believe that the answer is to call for much harsher punishments. If you are guilty of sexual assault, especially on a minor or a repeat criminal, there is no use for you on the outside, whether that be incarcerated or confined to a state mental health facility.", 10962, "GicN1B2raa", 4],
	128034 : ["Yep, I will sign that one. The sterilisation one is a waste of time I think! Chemical castration is a form of temporary castration caused by certain hormonal drugs. It was developed as a temporary preventive measure or punishment, typically for male child sex offenders and rapists. Depo Provera, a progestin; and tamoxifen, a drug also used in breast cancer, are the drugs most commonly used today for sex offenders. Depo Provera acts on the brain to inhibit hormones that stimulate the testicles to produce Testosterone; whereas Tamoxifen works by blocking the aromatase enzyme. Depo Provera also neutralises all testosterone so none can be converted to estrogen by the aromatase enzyme. The herb chrysin also works by blocking the aromatase enzyme. Spironolactone, a diuretic, also is an effective testosterone blocker. Chemical castration also occurs as a natural consequence of hormone treatment for male-to-female transsexualism. However, unlike the treatment used on sex offenders, the hormones commonly used lead to permanent infertility.", 10962, "None", 1],

	128039 : ["Here are some of the things that my trumpet prof. has given me: 1) Do a breathing excercise involving counts. Start at 2/4, 3/4, etc. Work your way up, breathing in 2, out two. Make sure to do it slowly, around 60 BPMs, and that your exhaling ends right on the last beat. If you completely fill and empty your lungs, this will help not only with capacity but also control. 2) This one's going to sound weird. Go online and look up a breathing bag (you want the rubber black one, despite the fact that it's more expensive.) Now, before you start practicing a piece of music, breathe in and out of the bag in time with what you would be playing. Example: Your music is in 4/4, so breath out and tongue the rhythms of the first measure, the breath the air back in on beat 1 of the second measure. This is going to make you dizzy. Really dizzy. So make sure not to overdo it, or you'll make yourself sick. However, this benefits you in that after you do this for a bit, immediately start playing the music with your instrument with little to no pause in between using the bag. You should notice an immediate difference, as using the bag trains your body to use proper air according to what your playing. You'll be surprised at what you can do with a small amount of air when it's utilized properly. I hope this helps. Good luck and keep up the music!", 10966, "None", 0],

Perhaps these people serve as a sort of anchor for you. A way you use to keep yourself in place. If that is the case then you need to evaluate if you are in a place you wish to be.  If you are, or these people are making a good faith effort to keep you from what they see as a self destructive act, then they are not really trying to bring you down even if you will eventually discard their efforts and do whatever it is they think is wrong anyway. Being friends doesn't mean being in total agreement. Quite the opposite. People you honestly care about are people your going to be frank with. That means at least occasional disagreements and from time to time trying to save them from a mistake.  If these people are truly holding you back, constantly raining on your parade then it is probably time to cut them loose. While they would not be in your circle if you did not value something about them, if the negative outweighs the good on a long term basis you are better off letting them drift off. I wouldn't just immediately sever ties.  Their negativity may well be temporal and somewhere down the road you might rekindle the friendship.
