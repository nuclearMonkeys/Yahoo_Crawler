Then where you get the smell first it should be narrowed down to one area and just clear up the area and make sure that the wires are not burning or heating up so much. This happened to me once and it was my lights switch.It heated up so much it was burning hot to even flick the switch.

Okay. I think working with anyone who doesn't talk at all or refuses to talk is going to be very difficult and you have to be extremely patient with these people because sometimes they cannot help it or they just don't get it. And I also think that it will take a great deal of commitment for every case that you work on because family members will expect satisfying results, and if one does not put enough into it, these people could end up learning a sense of helplessness. In this kind of profession you get really up close and personal with those that you are treating so you probably gotta prepare yourself for some strange things (i dont really mean this in a negative way). And sometimes speech therapy may not even work for certain individuals and you will have to accept that despite your efforts. Really consider what it is you're looking for in thinking of choosing this career. I found a few negative/drawbacks/difficult points for you from various sites: \"Although the work is not physically demanding, it requires attention to detail and intense concentration. The emotional needs of clients and their families may be demanding. Most full-time speech-language pathologists work 40 hours per week. Those who work on a contract basis may spend a substantial amount of time traveling between facilities.\" \"...does require patience and compassion, as progress may be slow and halting. Speech therapy is a painstaking process, but it can be as rewarding as it is frustrating. \" The third website mentions how sometimes speech isn't necessarily the best way of communication for some people...maybe you can open them up a bit but they end up preferring gestures, and even if they improve in that aspect their family will still demand more cuz they have high expectations...", 11094, "7RY0vJp8aa", 0],

If clear then start looking at everything with a belt, washer, vacuum, dryer, and central air blower while they are running to get max. opportunity.

Then turn off all the breakers and turn them on one at a time. This requires a second person. As the circuits come on line and one make a particularly big jump {make sure range and dryer are off before start} it should be investigated. To be the possible trouble.
