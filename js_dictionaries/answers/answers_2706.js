	141151 : ["It's not that hard to figure out if you break it down.  For it to work properly you need...some pressurized fluid, a continuous path to the point of release and an unoccluded \"jet\" to speed-up the flow and direct the fluid in the intended direction.  You already stated the reservoir was full.  Do you think the fluid is able to make it to the pump inlet?  Check for blockage at the bottom of the reservoir.  Next, when you \"mash\" the button, can you hear the pump running \"whining\"?  Maybe the pump motor is spinning but the impeller is broken.  If so, you won't be generating any fluid pressure.  Try pulling the thin discharge hose off of the pump outlet while someone else \"mashes\" the button \"with the ignition on but the engine does not hve to be running\".  If you have flow from the pump outlet \"under pressure\", the problem may be a cracked or broken discharge tube which means your nice blue fluid is getting spit out in your engine compartment somewhere and draining to the ground.  If your tube is good, then you have plugged up spray nozzles.  Pull the hose off of the nozzles and check for flow there.  Get a thin piece of wire or a safety pin to \"un-plug\" your jets if they're blocked up.  That's every possible thing it could be.", 11491, "FiGJpUfBaa", 0],

	141153 : ["It really depends on more then a fast change or a slow process.  It depends on the company in a large part. Is management supportive? Do they explain the situation clearly? Do they emphasize that no harassment will be tolerated. Does management show support and show that they value you as a person as well as an intricate part of the company? It depends on the actual job and the level of education of your fellow workers. Typically the more educated a person is the better the chance they will understand. Simply put someone with an advanced degree is much more likely to understand then some guy standing in a mud filled ditch . I came out very slowly after talking a lot with my therapist. Incidentally she was very opposed to me even coming out as I would be retiring before having surgery. She felt my personal safety could became a very real issue. I transitioned on the job as a Union Iron Worker/Welder. The opportunities on a construction site are endless to hurt a person if you so desire. I put up with very severe harassment at times. In my job you work for a contractor until they no longer need your service and then are laid off. At that point the Union finds another Contractor or I can call contractors to see if they need help. I worked with two different contractors during my transition. One was a small company with no defined policy. The other was a very large company with several government contracts. The large company had a written diversity policy in place that was enforced. They made a point of having weekly meetings on each site to discuss safety issues, the company's diversity policy, the drug and alcohol policy, etc . The harassment there was minimal as everyone knew it was not tolerated. We were treated as professionals in our field and expected to act as professionals.
