But he's the kind of shy that it may not go anywhere because he's not even making the first move or putting in effort towards trying to talk to you and you're not willing to go to him so if you don't wanna go to him and he's not going to you then maybe you should move on.", 5650, "9QrlDP78aa", -1],

There are many others who could explain it better than me, but the basic reason why I believe that we are saved once is as follows: We cannot ear the gift of salvaton. Not simply \"do not have to earn\" it, CANNOT earn it! The mercy of God is such that the Son was sent to die for all (John 3:16), but not everybody will accept this gift. If it is there, which it is, then all are welcome to take it.

	38155 : ["I used to live next to a graveyard. Was out in the countryside, away from people, buildings and lights.  It was a beautiful, serene place to walk and stroll each day.  The tombstones and grave markers were very old and it was rare a recently deceased body was laid to rest there.  Sometimes I was hired after a strong storm to patrol the cemetery and remove fallen branches. I was pretty familiar with the whole place, and it was huge.  So, the point of all this is, about two or three times each month, around the time of the full moon, the graveyard came alive. Not so much with Hollywood ghosts and zombies but, rather with old spirits who rose up in the wee hours and moved about the graveyard. They were hard to see if you didn't know what you were looking at, for they were more like darkened mists and shadows that flitted about among the stones and trees, regardless of wind direction or other earthly forces. Sometimes they were slow and hugging the ground as if searching for something lost long ago.  Other times they behaved almost playfully, darting in between tombstones and trees, almost like hummingbirds playing a game of tag. They interacted amongst themselves or sometimes traveled alone. I felt a sadness when I saw the spirits slowly wandering alone and slowly, and I imagined they were looking for a lost love.  I would sit in the middle of the cemetery for hours each night amongst these spirits. I felt an energy emit from them which I was sometimes able to absorb.  I was unlike anything I have ever felt. The strongest feelings I would get was when a playful spirit would dance around me as I sat very still on the ground. I felt a connection and a joy that's hard to describe. About an hour or so before dawn they would return to their earthly beds. I would walk back to my house, a changed man. It was miraculous.  So, I answered your question as best I could.", 5654, "None", 3],
