I'll buy your thing if you buy my thing.... I've talked dirty to them. It's a hoot. \"Yeah baby..I get soooo hot when you reduce my mortgage rate...are you naked right now? I am\" They usually hang up, the occasional perv will stay on the line..lol I don't know if you can get in trouble. I guess I've never thought about it. I just have fun, it's MY PHONE and MY TIME.

If they keep calling I think you should keep track of dates, times, how often and if you answer the name of whom and the company you are speaking with.

	71170 : ["If you want a bigger screen on your Nintendo 3ds, I'd say go for 3ds xl, I don't think there is much difference in the two apart from the size. If you do research upon it then you should get a rough idea of which is worth more :D.", 8611, "None", 0],
	71171 : ["The 3DS and 3DS XL obviously differ in size but for me, it's not worth buying the XL unless I found a really good sale. If you're a moderate gamer, the 3DS is perfectly fine for you because it comes with all the features the XL has, just not a big screen. The XL is can be bought for those with poor eyesight, but it is not a legitement reason to buy the XL. If you have sight issues due to gaming, you should consult your doctor/optometrist for glasses to help increase your gaming experience. In my opinion, the XL is really hard carry around due to it's massive size. It'll be a hassle if you don't find a good case to keep it in.  The extra money differentiation between the XL and the regular 3DS come from the screen size difference. If large screens appeal to you, go for the 3DS XL, but don't waste your money on the XL when you can be perfectly happy with a 3DS. (I have a DSi XL and there's no difference between than and the DSi.) Another factor you want to consider is the fact if you're replacing a previous DS model. If you have a really old one (for example the very first DS), the I think it's not a waste go for the 3DS XL (after considering all this). If you had a recent purchase with a 3DS, DSi, or DS Lite, try for the 3DS. No need to pay an extra 70 bucks on what you could have in a 3DS. Good luck! :)", 8611, "J420MZvIaa", 0],
	71172 : ["I don't use Apple. I'm not dumb enough to pay for overpriced hardware that's not any better than a PC, and an overpriced OS that is really nothing more than an altered version of FreeBSD. Or at least, the FreeBSD kernel was used to make the Mac OS. GNU/Linux and FreeBSD put Windows and Apple to shame. The people who complain about Unix systems usually don't know how to use them. Mac is a Unix system, but it is a dumbed down Unix system. BTW: GNU/Linux and FreeBSD are free operating systems.", 8610, "None", 1],

If you use caller-ID and are unsure if it's someone you know, wait, let your answering machine pick-up the call, and if it turns out to be someone you know, you can always pick up the call while they are leaving a message...

	71179 : ["The only reason someone would want an XL is if they have bad eyesight. The bigger screen help avoid straining eyes, but it is less convenient having a big 3ds. So unless you have bad eyesight don't need to get a 3ds. There are no other differences between the two 3ds's, and the graphics quality is (very slightly) better on the small 3ds. The 3dsXL isn't worth the extra money. Ps. When I say bad eyesight, I don't just mean someone who wears glasses, I mean someone with REALLY bad eyesight.", 8611, "None", 0],
