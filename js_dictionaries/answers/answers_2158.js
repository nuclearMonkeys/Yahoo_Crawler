Those who ride the school bus are out there bundled up in the freezing weather waiting for a ride to school and could get hurt because of the extreme cold.... Did you ever think of that??? So who should come to school on these days exactly? Kids that get rides from their parents and the rest stay home?? Kinda makes for a small outcome for the school day - don't you think?

You are required to get to school on your own terms.  Most children (with their parents) walk.  Many parents do not have cars and they walk many blocks to get to school. In other schools in my district, kids are bused,  But, that's a problem too.  You have to walk to the corner to get your bus, then you have to wait for it.  That's very cold.  If the parent has no car, then they must take the bus and they must wait for it outside, in the bitter, bitter cold. It makes perfect sense to me.  It was snowing and cold today.  I live in the Northeast.  Only 1/2 of my class showed up, because of the cold and the snow.  I'm expecting the same for tomorrow, if we don't close first. I also agree with the first poster.  Buses (and even some cars) have trouble in the extreme cold.   I know some places never close.  But, in the Northeast, this is the coldest it's been in 10 years.  So, for us, this is not normal and everyday weather.   We are so not prepared for this, because it doesn't happen too often.", 10363, "None", 3],

I go outside all bundled up and i'm freezing and shaking like no other after 10 minutes. I can't imagine how the kids that have to walk to school feel.

To the character who thinks the presidential elections have got to do with affirmative action, it does now not, in view that the president is \"elected\" by the persons, and no one can force you to vote for a person for the reason that of their race. Affirmative motion used to be instituted to offer a stage playing discipline for minorities as well as whites, and it used to be notion that it will go away as soon as it used to be no longer wanted, or as soon as the institutionalized discrimination was now not as rampant because it was in the '60s. It was not a racist coverage, it was instituted as a result of discrimination in education and employment of minorities. I believe in these days it is needed not up to it used to be forty yrs ago. This software has been a double-edged sword of sorts. Individuals say we are unqualified, however we're hired and expert anyway in view that of this application, but if not for the software, we had less of a risk than others, quite simply centered on ethnicity.

But when these collectors got to know I have block feature on my cell, they start sending my court notices now in mail saying they will sue me. My date is June 4th for judgment being sought against me by Wells Fargo (the same bank who got billions in bailout at the cost of taxpayer). Due to such type of things, there is no way you can expect me to support or approve Obama regardless of what he does.

Ofcourse if I am able to get job that matches my post graduate degree, I would stop complaining about Obama.  But it NEVER happens.

How on earth was some black dude with 2.0 GPA with bachelor in economics able to get $60K an year and I having master's degree in mathematics with 3.9 GPA can't find job?

Bachelor or Master should have been enough to AT LEAST get some type of job. Its not fair. It puts me into a position of doing way more labor and effort than the liberals.   Liberal gets job because recruiter does partisanships like IRS agents. I think this happens in private sector. They are perhaps using politics to deny job. I live in a very solid blue county where Obama won like 70% of the vote. I have one romney bumper sticker. I have feeling if I go to job interview, looking at the bumper sticker they reject job.  I have already read it that when applicant is being interviewed some other employee goes to the parking lot to examine car -- this practice should be ILLEGAL and at least Obama should pass legislation to ban job recruiter getting the car examined while candidate is being interviewed. It is very discriminatory I know they examine cars because when i went to the last job interview my rottweiler was in the car while i was being interviewed. And i left the window open.
