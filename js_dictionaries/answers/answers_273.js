While a debt that went to collections and was eventually paid is still somewhat damaging when it comes to getting financing, especially when seeking a mortgage, one that was never paid will disqualify you.", 2282, "2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa", 0],

SO: the credit card has the disadvantage of being more expensive. That is: you pay a \"late payment\" fee every month until it is paid off, even if you make the monthly minimum payment on time. On the other hand the loan if you miss too many payments your collateral will be repossessed by the bank or other legal action will be brought against you while with the credit card you only have to make the minimum monthly payment which is MUCH lower than a monthly loan payment.
