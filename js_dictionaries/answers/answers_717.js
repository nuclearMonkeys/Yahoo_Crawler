	39981 : ["Coronavirus and Jesus Cup: you can NOT get infected. There are a great many evidences that the Sacrament of Holy Communion cannot serve as a source of infection.  Many priests carry out their ministry in places that, in terms of hygiene or adherence to medical standards, are, to put it mildly, not entirely safe. For example, Father Alexander Klimenko had to give Communion to the prisoners of the Berezan penal colony for 10 years, where there were people with HIV and an open form of tuberculosis, and after all the participants, he had to consume the Holy Gifts (that is, to eat the Holy Communion remaining in the Jesus Cup).  At the same time, he did not get sick with HIV or tuberculosis. The press secretary of the Zaporozhye diocese, archpriest Alexander Ovcharenko, calculated that over the years of his ministry, he consumed what's left in the Jesus Cup (after previous participants) about 2600 times.  The priest states: “As you know, completely different people come to church with many diseases. On average, two times a year in Zaporozhye there are epidemics of influenza and acute respiratory infections in general. Not once after consuming the Holy Gifts did I get sick!  On the other hand, I would only get sick if I either sat outside in the cold too long, or sat in a draft, or turned on the air conditioner. The Holy Gifts are a spiritual fire that scorches not only human sins; take my word for it.”  Deacon Irenaeus writes about this problem simply and convincingly: “At each Liturgy, people who are sick (with whichever disease) take communion. After each use, the Jesus spoon plunges into the Jesus Cup. And the remaining Gifts are consumed (eaten) by the deacon.  About the possibility of getting infected through the Sacrament. I will say very simply, as a deacon, we (deacons) simply would not exist if infection transmitted thru Jesus Cup. We would have died out like extinct species of animals long ago.  In our world, there are a huge number of different viruses that are transmitted both through saliva and by airborne droplets. And it's not only about tuberculosis, hepatitis, but also about other diseases, of which there really are many.  Taking this into account, the Church would have long ago switched to such forms of communion that would maximally protect a person from various infections [disposable cups, disposable spoons, personal wipes for wiping lips (preferably also disposable), sanitizers for hands and icons] - all this would be in the Church if the infection was transmitted through the Jesus Cup.
