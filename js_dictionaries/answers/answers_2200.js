	115801 : ["It depends entirely on the species.  In some species the male and female are identical - with no visual difference.  The only way to tell is through a DNA test. Other birds are dimorphic - males and females have different markings.  In these birds, the females and juveniles (babies) are often a dull color or have patterns which help them to blend into their environment - working as a kind of camophlage so they cannot be seen in the nest. Dimorphic males typically have bold colors or brighter colorations.  These bright colors are used to attract females, and to lure predators away from the nest. Sometimes the difference is very small.  Budgies, for example, share the same feather colors, but can be sexed by the color of the flesh (cere) around their nostrils. Male ducks have a curled tail feather.", 10439, "LW0rZB94aa", 1],
