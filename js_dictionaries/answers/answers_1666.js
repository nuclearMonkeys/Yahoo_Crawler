Then if needed, you can contest the will if there were any changes to the will recently before he passed.  If he was on medication, there's a good chance you'll have a case if he signed on a dotted line to leave you out of the will.   Just the same, why not ask your dad about his wishes and if there is any paperwork you should know about, such as his will.  If he's older, he'll understand.  Make sure he knows it's because you want what's best for him and to make sure his needs are met.  Such as \"feeding tubes\" to keep him alive.

People give me funny looks when I say \"I am vegan because I hate meat and am opposed to animal cruelty!\" They get mightily offended and give you some speil about doing an RSPCA raffle etc and that they have two dogs called Herby and lou-lou that they adore!! But I think it is general ignorance they don't mean to be that way. the Western culture particularly tends to have some kind of line in the sand between 'food' and 'friend' ! But some really cruel people raise animals, bond with them show them love and then send them off to their deaths for the sake of their dinner plates.  This woman I watched on Breakfast news a few weeks ago was extolling the values of raising your own pigs and then the Evil hag turned around and said after two months their friends were sent to the butcher down the road.

	88991 : ["It is possible to make a ferret nearly odorless.  I have 2 ferrets in a small 2 bedroom apartment and they barely smell at all. They do produce a musk as their natural body odor but it can be made nearly non existent.  If you wash all bedding (no carefresh or wood bedding... Ferrets need cloth bedding like hammocks, hanging cubes, sleep sacks, and floor and shelf covers) once a week, scoop out the litter box once a day, dump and scrub it once a week, and bathe the ferret no more than required (if they get into something gross), the smell will be greatly reduced. If you want to make the ferret completely odorless, look into feeding a natural (raw) diet. Most of the smell that ferrets produce is a result of ingesting a lot of fillers and other stuff they can't process. There are lots of great articles and threads here that explain a ferret's nutritional needs:   If you feel like you can't handle raw meat, there are also freeze dried products that cost a little more than kibble (and have the same texture for the most part) that offer all of the benefits of fresh raw meat.  As for the responsibility part, get a copy of Ferrets for Dummies 2nd Edition. Study it as thoroughly as you can and then ask your mom to quiz you on it. Also promise (and keep that promise) that you will do whatever you can around the house to help with the expenses of having a pet. Ferrets are very expensive so this is very important. You might want to start offering to mow lawns in your neighborhood or offering your services as a baby sitter or pet sitter to have some extra cash for ferret expenses.  As far as I know, there is nothing you can do to make a hamster stink less. I had a hamster when I was little and it had to stay in my room at all times.

Why anyone would ever conceive that it might be a good idea to allow a female within earshot, inside a motorised carriage, let alone attempt to control one, is quite beyond me.  I suppose mental illness is an inevitability, especially with long exposure to an ungagged concubine.

What a damned stupid mistake what? I may chain myself to the railings of Buck house and demand that all females have their lips stitched at birth! Further more they should beyond any shadow of a doubt be withdrawn from the education system entirely.
