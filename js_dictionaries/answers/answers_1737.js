Honestly, it is not your place to say how he spends time with his kids or what his kids do during their free time.  It is the responsibility of their father.  As long as your boyfriend is aware of and agrees with your reservations to combine your incomes if you move in together, then you should be ok.  Set the rule that he will be solely responsible for the video game buying and half of the bills like water, energy, mortgage/rent, and food, and you'll be glad to pay for the other half of necessary expenses like that.  You should also have a talk about having kids in the future.  If his way of raising kids is to have a digital baby sitter, then you can decide if you want children with him.  Also, from the looks of things, if you did move in, prepare to be the housekeeper.  If this is the way he runs his home and raises kids, it's unlikely he'll put more effort into doing the dishes. Also, be prepared to spend your own money on the new furniture.  On the bright side, you won't have to worry about his kids wearing it out.  Some guys make better boyfriends than fathers.  All in all, you should sit down with him and have a very serious conversation about your feelings. There is nothing wrong with letting him know your fears about your future (regarding helping his kids with college)  Personally, I would take things VERY slow moving forward.  Keep your income seperate and see if he is willing to make comprimises.", 9445, "kYysDpBNaa", 1],

	92562 : ["The pruning of such a plant is an art form of sorts.  Allow the blooms to completely die back.  With hand pruning only remove the branch back to where the bloom originated.  You can find this at the area where the cutting you are making is light green and the branch a darker green or brown.  Take this opportunity to remove any dead and to thin the center of the shrub.   Once you prune make sure that it has water and nutrients for recovery.  I suggest a granular feeding of a 10-10-10 with minerals fertilizer applied outside the dripline of the shrub.  Apply from the dripline to a minimum of four inches from the dripline at a rate of 1lb/1,000 sq ft.     Shape the plant, again with hand prune, in late June (post Wimbeldon) and apply the fert at 1/2 lb rate.  In October prune the dead and unwanted growth and apply the 1/2lb again.  This will give the new flowers a stronger color.    Make sure you shield you shrub from both disease and from unruly conditions.  Mulch the shrub from one inch away from the base, at a three inch max. level with a Shreeded  Hardwood or Shred Cypress Mulch.  Treat the mulch with a granular application of Sevin to prevent insects.

	92563 : ["Summer Pruning  Allow only one strong leader to develop from the end of each main framework branch without pruning it and stretch and attach this shoot along the support. Cut off the ends of all new side shoots just beyond the sixth or seventh leaf as soon as that leaf develops. New shoots will form as a result of these cuts. As they do, cut them back as soon as only one or two leaves develop.  Late Winter Pruning  Cut unpruned leader shoots back to one-half or two-thirds their length. Cut side shoots pruned the previous summer back to only one to two inches from their base for short flowering spurs.  This method of pruning allows permanent framework branches to extend each year by half the annual growth and side shoots to become short flowering spurs.  Maintenance Pruning  Once the vine has been trained into the allotted space, follow summer pruning practices as outlined above. In winter, prune leader shoots back to only four or five buds.

People who cheat feel that they are lacking in something in themselves (happiness, self esteem, so many other things) or in their relationships (intimacy, support, sex, and again so many other things), so they attempt to fill that void with another person. This is not to say that there is something actually lacking in themselves or their relationships, it's simply that they FEEL that way. Guys with low self esteem are more likely to cheat because they like the ego boost another woman gives them. Women who have intimacy issues and need to constantly feel needed, attractive, wanted, etc. are more likely to cheat. And, yes, sometimes the reason is just plain and pure sex. It's numerous things, but it all comes down to trying to fill a psychological void with a human being. Using another person to make yourself feel better. P.S. And most of the time, these people don't even have enough clarity to accept or realize their psychological issues, so they're generally completely in the dark about why they're doing it. That's why they come up with coping mechanisms, such as calling it love, saying the person is their soul mate, etc. in order to internally justify what they're doing. They are just in denial of the truth. That's why affairs only end in marriage in less than 3% of the cases. And of that 3%, 97% of those marriages end in divorce.

	92580 : ["The spirit of barefooting is, or at least once was, alive and well in all of us. Do you remember how good it felt to go barefoot when you were a child? Even now, as adults, do we still have that spirit? When we can't wait to get home and relax after a hard day, does this mean kicking off our shoes in order to do so? Or, if we are planning a holiday or vacation, do we factor in the   proximity of sandy beaches, grassy fields, or a natural trail well-suited for bare feet? Can any of us truly    imagine being fully comfortable while wearing shoes? Yet how often do we choose the barefoot spirit? How often can we? The truth is we all have the freedom to go barefoot whenever and wherever we want. Most of us, however, just don't realize it. If we knew it was OK to     forget about shoes when it was time for walking the dog,  getting the mail, or even while out shopping, how many of us would choose to go barefoot? Why render our feet deaf and blind if we don't need to? Imagine having to wear gloves or ear plugs every time you left the house. Think of all the wonderful sensory input you would miss. Now imagine expanding avenues of sensory input. Imagine being able to feel the wide variety of interesting textures and pleasant surfaces beneath your own two feet as you go about your daily business. You can. “Going barefoot is the gentlest way of walking and can symbolize a way of living-being authentic, vulnerable, sensitive to our surroundings. It's the feeling of enjoying warm sand beneath out toes, or carefully making our way over sharp rocks in the darkness. It's a way of living that has the lightest impact, removing the barrier between us and nature.”  From the book “Barefoot Dreaming”    by  Adele Coombs In general, being barefoot promotes healthy development of musculature in the feet and legs, while excessive reliance on shoes tends to promote atrophy and weakness in those same muscles. This suggests that overdependency on shoes can have serious consequences. A study published in the September 2006 issue of Arthritis and Rheumatism found that “modern shoes may exacerbate the abnormal mechanics of lower-extremity osteoarthritis.”  Researchers concluded that maybe it was time to re-evaluate our daily walking programs,  presumably to include time for walking barefoot.  Walking barefoot is also a good way to avoid athlete's foot. Contrary to a widely believed myth, it is not the sole-to-ground contact that presents a risk so much as it is feet going back into the moist, dark, warm environment found inside shoes. Closed-toe shoes especially are ideal incubators for fungi and bacteria to live and breed. Allowing the feet to “breathe” also prevents foot odor. Going Barefoot in Public Places: How many times have you seen some variation of a “No Bare Feet Allowed” sign on a store window or door? If you live in the USA, chances are you've seen such signs more often than you've seen a sign stating BARE FEET OK! These anti-barefoot policies are often attributed to nonexistent “health codes.” The truth is, that almost without exception, there is no statutory basis for prohibiting bare feet anywhere, including stores and restaurants. Although store owners are free to set their own policies with regards to attire, there is no compelling reason to limit customer choice when it comes to footwear. Urban myths about bare feet being unsanitary, illegal or dangerous are generally based on lack of information and the lack of personal experience with regards to going barefoot. Studies have proven that everyday conditions in public places pose a greater threat to those who touch objects with their hands.  It is more likely to transfer germs to your eyes, nose and mouth via hands than by way of feet.  Driving Barefoot is Legal: Another widespread misconception is that driving barefoot is prohibited by law.  It is not. In fact, some law enforcement agencies have determined that drivers have better control over the pedals with bare feet than while wearing loose or uncomfortable shoes. Driving barefoot is inarguably safer than driving in some of the footwear that passes for “fashionable.” In Short: Anyone who prefers to take a pass on shoes for reasons of health or comfort should be able to choose to go barefoot, free from arbitrary assumptions based on false or misleading information being used to justify exclusionary attitudes and policies. What spirit is so empty and blind, that it cannot grasp the fact that a human foot is more noble than the shoe and human skin more beautiful than the garment with which it is clothed.\"                                      Michelangelo", 9441, "e45f658f9932624abf10e836e95d3bd3aa", 2],
	92581 : ["WATCH THESE, SO TRUE: 1.  2.   v (I agree with most of what he said. The only thing I would say is that he speaks as if it's still white people we are battling in this natural hair war. BUT most white people love my hair, the majority of negative comments I get are from OTHER black people. We are still the biggest enemies of ourselves) 3.  COMMENTS I HAVE GOTTEN: 1. Your hair looks so damaged (Just becuase hair is not shiny and doesn't sway somehow it is damaged. Our hair type is not meant to be shiny) 2. It looks like a sheep's wool (This is the only comment from a white person and honestly I kind of made me laugh. Our hair does look like wool or cotton and this needs to stop being a bad thing. Silky is not the only good fabric.) 3. I can get my hairstylist to straighten your hair. You don't want your hair to look like that. She can make it all nice and shiny and silky for you. I can't have my grandbaby walking around with nappy hair. (This is from my grandma who has sadly lost most of her hair to relaxers and hot comb so that there are entire bald patches on her scalp.) 4. I don't understand your hair. (What is there to understand?) 5. You look like an African slave.  6. You going to the disco later? 7. Why does it do that? 8. You look better with straight hair (Whatever, we always look better natural) 9. You trying to be a ghetto girl? You not gonna get a job looking like that.  10. How does your man feel lying next to that mess? 11. Your hair isn't gonna grow like that/you won't be able to comb it/it will break off/you can't keep it managble (Basically people telling me what my own hair is capable of. And what does manageble even mean?) 12. So.. what you gonna do with your hair? *Pointed glance at my twist out* (This comment always comes after I just did my hair and I think it look dang good) 13. That's the nappiest hair I have ever seen. Why don't you want a perm? (This from black girls who you know have never even seen THEIR OWN hair). 14. Can I touch it? (This is a comment every natural gets. Our hair just looks so soft and it feels so good. Honestly I know some people don't like people touching their hair but I don't mind. Especially if it's a black girl. How can people learn not to fear or revile our hair unless they are taught? I figure this is one more person who has been shown that our hair is not coarse wiry frizz. I don't mind curiosity as long as they ask first.)  In the end, keep hanging in there. Napptural hair is beautiful and powerful and sometimes people can't handle something so real and they themselves are angry. This is why I like to educate people about nappy hair. If people want to relax their hair, fine but there are too many black women who think they HAVE to relax/straighten their hair. Otherwise it won't grow/they won't get a man/ they won't get a job/they will look ugly/it will be unmanageble. THAT is the mentality that bugs me becuase it cuases people to be angry and frustrated becuase they have no idea how to break free of the cycle of damage and pain they subject themselves to. So they take it out on us--naturals who are not sheep and are putting it in their face that THEY could have natural hair that is not damaged, thinning and breaking off like their relaxed hair. 9 times out of 10 when somone insults my Nappy hair they have some sad little perm that is so thin and short and damaged you can see their scalp. They may even be wearing a wig their hair is so damaged. But yet, they feel qualified to comment on MY hair? People are a trip.  Definitely watch \"Good Hair\". A Documentary by Chris Rock about the good hair/bad hair mentality in the black community. He decided to make it after his little daughter started crying one day and asked him, \"Daddy, why don't I have good hair?\"   It's coming out on HBO. I can't wait, it looks funny, true and thought provoking. Also \"My Nappy Roots\" was a good one.  What we have to understand is that this mentality does not start with us, those people still hating on nappy hair need to wake up. They are stuck in a slave mentality.
