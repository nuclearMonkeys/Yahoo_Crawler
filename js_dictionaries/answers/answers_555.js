When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion).

So your are NOT going to be doing it with this clutch, period. If you work outside the home, and do not have an eye for detail, it is not for you until you have a solid month 24/7 to devote to feeding, making FRESH, formula at the right consistency, temperature for each phase of their feedings. Cleaning them ip afterwards, keeping weight charts to make sure they are reaching their goals.  Most importantly, if you do not know the signs of a bird with sour croup, and how to deal with it, you will be killing these baby birds.  Trust me this is NOT, a YouTube or 5 page quick guide, and it's all good. You need hands on experience with someone that's doing it for years. Hand feeding baby birds can be easy once you know what you are doing.  But your main question tells me you don't even have the basics onboard to take the babies to just hold them, let alone feed them, two fill days without issues. ", 4746, "pCTN3G3oaa", 1],

After finding out the bird would tear up the newspaper I was using on the bottom of the cage to build a nest and laying eggs non-stop I had to stop using newspaper. I unfortunately switched to corn cob to replace the newspaper. Everything was fine for over 35 years and then the bird got sick and died. I tried to save the bird and found an excellent bird Vet who had a blood test done and found out the bird had a liver infection. The Vet told me to never use corn cob in a bird cage because if the corn cob isn't died properly the bird can catch diseases from it.

	30968 : ["you have to try different ways. If the birds aren't used to eating those things it can be a long time before they will try them out. You have to be patient, and persistent. You will probably have better success with vegetables. Corn is a favorite usually. If you get frozen corn let it thaw completely and then put it in a shallow dish, preferably a dish the birds are already familiar with. You can dot this with frozen mixed vegetables too. Parakeets love to \"bathe\" in wet greens. I use nice big lettuce leaves. I rinse them in cold water and lay them flat on the floor of the cage. The birds roll around and flap their wings in the leaves to bathe. Later they will nibble on the leaves. You can shred raw carrots, see if they accept them that way. Try chopping them fine too. Sometimes the way the food is presented is the deciding factor to eat or not to eat. You can make your own wheat or bran muffins with lots of extra added egg. My birds love those. You can hard boil an egg, mash it fine, and offer that, a small amount at a time. Very good protein. Never leave egg in the cage for more than a few hours, as it goes bad. The veggies my keets love the most are corn, raw broccolli tops and carrot tops (greens). Remember that if you have birds that aren't used to eating these healthy foods, you must have patience and keep offering them, day after day. There will be a lot of wastage, but with persistence you should succeed. Another excellent food is seeding grasses from outside, but be sure the area is not sprayed with anything first. You can sprout your own keet seed too, sprouted seed is highly nutritious, just look up how to sprout seed for birds. Good luck!", 4742, "kcVcgnu1aa", 0],
