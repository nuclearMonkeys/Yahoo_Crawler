Use a new razor (used ones laying around rust and carry bacteria) It's best to shave in the shower after your skin has been softened and pores opened from warm water. Use a shaving cream, not soap. Shave down with your hair, not up against it. Also exfoliating your legs with a good body scrub, removes dead skin giving you a closer shave.

Brad Keselowski has a Cup ride because he went out, and beat the Cup drivers.. That is \"development\".. Not a bunch of rookies running into each other.. Just because a bunch of so called journalists think less competition is better than more competition, doesn't make it so.. The only people that should be allowed to voice their opinion on this subject are the folks who actually buy the tickets..
