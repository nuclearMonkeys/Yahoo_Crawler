All good actors are able to - and frequently do - act live on stage, on TV, on radio, as well as in movies.  The style and performance may be different but it's really the same thing.  There are many differences between a live performance and a filmed one, but they're more to do with the production rather than the acting. For the actors, they have to adjust as necessary, making movements smaller for the camera or larger for the stage; being able to whisper for the camera but projecting for the stage; being able to improvise their lines or learn just a few at a time for the camera but having to memorise hundreds of lines to perfection for the stage - and so on.", 2571, "Y4nBQ7wjaa", 1],
