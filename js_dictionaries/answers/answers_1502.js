We all make mistakes from time to time, often when acting on impulse, or for instant gratification, or just to be \"part of a group\". You develop your character by using every bit of experience in your life to shape and mold you into the person you want to become. As kids, our parents did this by saying \"NO!\" or \"Good Job!\" to reinforce behavior. As we grow, we do this ourselves.  I have things I wish I wouldn't have done in my past, looking back.

The war in Afghanistan was a good idea, however, it was handled poorly, and the results show just that. Will sending in more troops solve it? Probably not; we should look to the past, and ask the Russians just how well that worked when they tried it. Yes the U.S. military is superior, but does that honestly matter? Hasn't it been proven time in and time out, that technology losses every time against patriotism and self preservation? Look at Vietnam, it's the same situation; we are in a foreign country, fighting against guerrilas that are funded and armed by an outside source.  The bottom line, is that we already went in, and took out as many key players as we could. Mission accomplished, bring the men home. Sadly, we are more likely to pick up more targets, if we leave, and they begin to surface again.  It's time the U.S. stopped trying to use it's big stick everywhere, forcing our enemies to go underground, while the tax payers are left cleaning up the mess. We have the best tech and special ops in the world. It's time to take the leash off our most fierce beast, and let the special forces do what they do best. Eliminate potential threats. And what bothers me the most honestly, is that if we are going to lose thousands of troops, and billions of dollars.

If he wasn't taken down, Iraqis wouldnt be free, less stability in the middle east, and the US undoubtably would have had a nuke lobbed at them by now.
