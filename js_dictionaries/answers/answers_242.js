Until January 2020, I would spend almost all my time walking around a hospital doing rounds and look at all the patients who had MRSA, the occasional TSS and very little else.  I would get to say, \"you need to be on IV vancomycin but we will have to watch your kidney function.\" If I even had a private practice it would be almost exclusively HIV+/AIDS patients.  That would be great if I was interested in treating a single condition and that single condition was HIV+/AIDS.

	12138 : ["Can you? Yes, but not safely or in a way that would be permanent. Changing your lifestyle (diet and activities) on your way to a healthier weight takes time. One or two pounds a week is a very high standard to hit.  Some weeks will actually go up or stay the same. Five months is roughly 20 weeks.  At a reasonable rate you could lose 40 pounds or so.  Probably less if you're exercising and gaining muscle mass. Which makes the point that your weight number doesn't matter as much as how you feel and how clothing fits.  You could lose that 70 pounds and be sickly and weak, or change your lifestyle, lose 20-30 pounds and look and feel awesome.

Eat the whole thing at once or save half for dinner. At the end of the day go for a long walk 30 mins aleast.  After 2 weeks of walking, start lightly jogging and slowly bump up the distance to 3 miles over the course of the next couple months.

	12141 : ["\"he later appeals\" Uh... who would that be? Not Chauvin: There is nothing to appeal if you are found not guilty of the charges against you. If he thinks he should be found guilty then he wouldn't appeal: He'd just plead \"guilty\" and the trial ends there. Well, I will say this: Even if he's found completely guilty of all charges, we should still expect some riots. Perhaps in jubilation, or perhaps in rage that this was a thing to begin with, people are going to do some regrettable things because of the mere existence of this trial. It's being found \"not guilty\" that will spur more on, even if it's only one of the charges and the other charges end with \"guilty\" verdicts against Chauvin. Let's keep in mind that many are saying that manslaughter isn't enough, as commentators are pointing out that the defense has done well (even if some still do try to hide it).", 2039, "hKgjv1Deaa", 0],

Even a pink-tone, it still wash me off. When wearing a dramatic eye, I prefer pairing it with a berry/fall-ish lip instead. If a product, it's probably a lip-stain and pot concealer.
