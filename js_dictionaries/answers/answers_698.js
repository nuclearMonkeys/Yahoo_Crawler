I suggest that you see a therapist and talk your obsession over with him or her. Therapists are paid to listen to you. We, alas, are not. By the way, no one claims that Charles decided to have an affair with Camilla only after Diana suggested an attachment was there. The whole world knows they were having an affair in the late 70s. Where have you been, sweetie?", 5705, "None", 2],
	38736 : ["Charles and Camilla were an item when Diana was still at school.  The queen would not give her consent for Charles to marry a commoner.  There wasn't much Protestant foreign royalty available, but Charles was required to marry someone from a noble family to produce an heir or two.  So Diana got the job of Royal brood mare.  In the mean time, Charles married off Camilla to the captain of his polo team - the parentage of the Parker-Bowles children has never been tested, but the Royal family are unusually kind to them.  Diana knew exactly what the deal was.  She tried to change it afterwards. Times have moved on.  Andrew Parker Bowles obliged by divorcing Camilla so Charles could marry her.   Prince William married a commoner (who had been his mistress for some years) which means a future monarch will be the grandson of a member of BA cabin crew.  Prince Harry married an American divorcee.  (His great-uncle had to abdicate to do that).  How they are going to square all this with the Monarch being to supreme head of the Church of England is beyond me.  Perhaps Princess Charlotte could become Pope.", 5705, "d900XEySaa", 0],

More info about what you hope to gain by moving outside the US and why this is between the US and a small mountainous country like Austria might help?   What do you think Austria 'might' have that the US doesn't?

	38738 : ["It's difficult to move to another country legally. You can't just pick up and move. First you need to line up a job and then get a visa that lets you live and work in the country legally. European regulations require employers to advertise jobs and demonstrate that there are no viable European candidates for a job before they can offer a position to a non European. In the best of times non-Europeans have to have specialized skills, education and/or experience that cannot be easily duplicated by European job seekers.  My direct experience is with Italy where I lived for 13+ years. In my case, my job was transferred form the US to Italy and it still too 8 months to get a visa. It's not all that different anywhere else. Visa information for most potential host countries can be found on their consulate or embassy websites. You can find consulate websites with a fairly simple search. Note that you'll need to apply to the consulate that has jurisdiction over the state/area where you live, but you can find the necessary information on any of the consulate websites.  If you can get through the legal hoops and find a job that will allow you to support yourself, Vienna can be a great place to live.", 5698, "kgBPU4xxaa", 1],
