	29243 : ["If breasts were only adipose tissue the surgeries to remove or reduce them wouldn't be so sophisticated. In reality they contain other physical elements as well.

	29251 : ["Look.. I have literally been in your shoes.. (several years ago).. and I am here to tell you, if you dont stop doing everything yourself.. several years down the road, you will STILL be doing everything yourself. I had 2 kids, worked 40 hours a week, cooked, cleaned, laundry, baths, homework, ballgames, holidays, cut the lawn, chopped the wood.. yea .. chopped the wood all alone. and barely had time to sleep.Â  Fast forward to now.. still doing it and you know what.. it is NOBODYS fault by my own.Â Â  I created this monster who is now my x-husband, but I did create it by letting him do nothing. And yes..Â  most of my free time was being pissed at him.Â  I was an angry old bat and it still burns my soul to think a person would allow their significant other to work themselves to death.. but they dont care. So.. my suggestion to you.. is stop doing it all.Â  Let some of it go and tell him to help or threaten to move out.Â  What do you have to lose? You are already doing it all.. why have him around.Â  I know that sounds harsh.. but I am harsh and honest. Trust me.. its not going to change... unless YOU change it.", 4542, "None", 0],
	29252 : ["If you think you're missing out on \"quality\" couple time now just wait until a baby takes up all your energy 24/7. This is something couples have to be prepared for before they decide to have a baby. There's just no other way to say it, you and he are going to have a priority other than one another into the foreseeable future. This may be less of a \"he doesn't do anything\" situation and more of a \"I'm not really prepared to be a parent\" thing. Having a child just naturally shifts the romance to the back burner, it just does.Â ", 4542, "J3axFJ2Saa", 0],

	29256 : ["You thought he was a great guy who made you happy but he sounds like a guy who behaves this way in a serial fashion and he's now looking for his next mark. ALL the requests he and his friend made were over the top ridiculous and completely disrespectful to you. You were not \"wrong\", you were mistaken in your estimation of his character. Three adults and three dogs in a 2 bedroom apartment is likely against any lease anywhere that you could have signed. It's nuts. You were dating a bum and then let him and his bum friend move in with you. That was not a good plan!", 4521, "bjv00RoZaa", 3],

	29260 : ["Based on what I've read, it's the Spanish flu pandemic. The strain of the virus was no more virulent than other strains. What made this one so deadly was how it was handled. It was made worse by malnutrition, poor hygiene, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals. It was made worse by the after effects of WWI. All these conditions promoted a bacterial super infection.

If you are developing feelings for him, I honestly think you should distance yourself. Because he has a girlfriend, it seems like you will always be the back burner girl he has to fulfill those needs he has. To me it sounds more romantic than a friendship.
