You may find they have already tried this route and maybe defaulted as well - just ask 3)   Call Community Legal Advice on 0845 345 4345  they are free and will certainly point you in right direction. 4)   You can gather all the policies and call each one in turn and see what their take on it is - people in crisis cannot think straight and even the thought of making a phone call especially if he had a breakdown will just seem overwhelming.

A open house for a new house or condo[and these days people think it is OK to ask for gifts for a new rental apartment. It isn't]. and there will be a baby shower, what a few months from now?  People who are not in the know about the shower, will go there, and hear or see what she is doing, and may decline to attend the wedding, or future events. In the end, the bride loses.  Guess the bride is doing a volume invite, so those that that show up and cough up cash will offset the number who might be going to be offended and not come, and not send a present.
