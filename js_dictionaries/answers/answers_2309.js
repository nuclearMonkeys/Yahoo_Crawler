Anything cold-blooded (unable to control their temperature) is stuck having to stay near a place where they can get to the sun quickly so that they don't freeze, or to shade quickly so they don't overheat.

It's stuff like that which makes me not want to check the boxing section much these days. Lots of racism against Filipinos and Asians gets unnoticed, like how some here say americasfavoritethug is \"funny\". He's no more funny than Fred C is. Judah tweeting \"I'm not racist I love everybody\" is identical to what americasfavoritethug says - maybe he's really thug in disguise? Lol. Certainly there is racism against blacks too, like how Sean G apologized to Fred C despite him saying n**ger. He shouldn't have to apologize to a racist. What makes no sense to me is how some suggest racism from Mayweather, Hopkins, etc. is justified by racism from fans on the Web. On YA there's at least equal racism the other way around, and it's completely different when boxers themselves make these comments. For whatever reason, Hopkins/Mayweather/Judah/Haye have made racist comments but I can't think of any Asian boxer who has done the same, or anyone who has made comments against blacks in the last 20 years. Correct me if I'm wrong. Blacks were once wrongly denied from title fights at one point, but that was almost a century ago, and it was from white Americans, not Filipinos, Pakistanis, Mexicans, or eastern Europeans. In recent times, black boxers have caused the most racism, but that's not to say most are racist or there aren't humble ones like Andre Ward.", 10649, "8qyofB7Zaa", 6],

I do agree Filipinos have also been victims of racism that does not get a lot of attention int he forum because most people think only their group can suffer from racism.

Well, I'm writing Maiyah to tell them they're wrong! Hmmm.. there are also some elements of Avatar: the Last Airbender. With the whole element-manipulating and spirit-world thing.  The spirit cycle concept in my story comes from the reincarnation theory in Hinduism. When people die, they are reborn as something/someone else.  Also, physics. Real-life physics inspired the way my magical system works! Plus, historical events, international relations and real figures in history have inspired some of my characters (e.g. Moroth and Teddy Roosevelt), and so has real-world cultures inspired the races and languages that appear in Ore in my story. The song Europa has pushed me to work harder on my international relations of Ore and current-event-inspired events that drift in and out of my story and manipulate the background :3 And the Hobbit x) It drove me to putting dragons in my story :D EDIT: also one or two elements of Disney's Treasure Planet and Teen Titans are in there, too.

I've always been fond of islands and tropical places, so one day I found myself thinking \"What if I sailed away to an uncharted island and never came back?\"  The more I thought about it the more I liked the idea, so I started playing around with it, adding other elements, creating characters, making it into more of a fantasy story.  I've played around with this idea for about six years now, always improving it and adding to it.  It's my greatest adventure, my fondest daydream.  Finally, after years and years of creating a story out of that question, I started writing it.  I've been working on it for about a year now, and I only have two chapters written.

Also, I was reminded of how the old garbage trucks would have people on the back and they'd hop off to get to open garbage cans. The fact that their feet didn't touch the ground when on the back of the truck interested me. The new trucks have no one on the back, I believe. So I fiddled with the idea of not touching the ground and that's how a lot of my story came about. Some of it was inspired by an imaginary character I came up last year or so. My family was going to a restaurant and I was feeling a bit down. To force myself to laugh, I started talking about my friend \"Zorro\". My family knows I'm silly like that :P My little brother kept questioning who Zorro was and how I met him. I was all, \"Uhhhh. I saved him from drowning in the [insert gibberish here] river. And now our souls are bonded because he owes me.\" I took that concept and played around with it. It ended up changing a lot.  The last element that majorly inspired me was an anime.

	121291 : ["Tidal forces in general are caused by the difference in gravitational force experienced between different parts of the same object. When there is a large difference in the forces between the different parts (either because the object is very large or the gravitational field strength changes very rapidly with distance) then there are pulling/stretching forces experienced within the object as well as the overall gravitational attraction the pulls the centre of mass. In the earth/moon system, there is a large distance between the side of the earth near the moon and the side farthest away. This creates a stretching force - so the earth is pulled into a sort of bulging ball shape Of course, the oceans are free, so they also respond to this tidal force - they flow toward the point of maximum gravitational force which is the point where the moon is overhead. That's high tide! On the far side of the earth, the solid planet has moved toward the moon but the tidal force on the water is much lower so effectively the ground falls downward - creating another high tide! That's the very basic idea - the tides are actually very complicated and controlled by things like shape of ocean floor, funnelling in river estuaries etc. The relative orientation of the sun and moon also plays a part.

	121292 : ["any of the cyclic deformations of one astronomical body caused by the gravitational forces exerted by others. The most familiar are the periodic variations in sea level on the Earth that correspond to changes in the relative positions of the Moon and the Sun.  At the surface of the Earth the gravitational force of the Moon is about 2.2 times greater than that of the Sun. The tide-producing action of the Moon arises from the variations in its gravitational field over the surface of the Earth as compared with its strength at the Earth's centre. The effect is that the water tends to accumulate on the parts of the Earth's surface directly toward and directly opposite the Moon and to be depleted elsewhere. The regions of accumulation move over the surface as the position of the Moon varies relative to the Earth, mainly because of the Earth's rotation but also because of the Moon's orbital motion around the Earth. There are approximately two high and two low tides per day at any given place, but they occur at times that change from day to day; the average interval between consecutive high tides is 12 hours 25 minutes. The effect of the Sun is similar and additive to that of the Moon. Consequently, the tides of largest range or amplitude (spring tides) occur at New Moon, when the Moon and the Sun are in the same direction, and at Full Moon, when they are in opposite directions; the tides of smallest range (neap tides) occur at intermediate phases of the Moon", 10665, "None", 3],

Threats of nuclear war, biological catastrophe, and climate change now bring into question as to how humanity can continue to survive. Personally, I think that with the growth of true threats to survival, there has been growth of human ingenuity as well. We have yet to release a Frankenstein's monster of technology upon the world. Despite the stockpiles of nuclear weapons, there has been no global warfare. Medical research is in a renaissance of advance. Climate change remains a concern, but I believe that we are an adaptable species, as we have adapted before and will again. The larger question is how will humanity survive, which is what is asked. It's very likely that the resources of today may no longer be available in a century. But consider the resources available today that were not available a century before. As stated before, we are an adaptable species, and when one window of resources closes, it's likely that other windows will be openable. Of course, the speed that everything progresses at has increased. Will we be able to adapt in time? Perhaps not for a lot of us, but consider that in the 14th century, the Black Death wiped out over a third of Europe's population. Yet Europe survived and prospered.
