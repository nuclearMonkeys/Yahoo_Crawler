He's doing the best he can in the position he is in. Its not his fault WWE are pg. When cena bled in the iron man match he pushed the medicos away.  WWE are pg because they are now a publically owned business. WWE is not owned by the Mcmahons anymore. Anything they want to do has to be discussed with shareholders etc. I dont want to get too complicated but if vince wanted to make wwe pg 14 again it isnt as easy as a lot of people think.

First, Cena is the top face of WWE, he sells the most merchandise, he sells out arenas, he brings in the most money and probably makes the most money of all the WWE wrestlers, not only that, but he has a passion and love for the wrestling business, it is something he has always wanted ever since he was a child, he is living his dream, no point in giving that up. Second, that just isn't true, he has earn most fans respect, there are only a few Cena haters out there, who just hate Cena for doing his job, most fans love Cena, and the others, don't have anything against Cena personally, they respect how hard he works, and many other things about Cena, they just don't like Cena's Character. Truthfully, this is a good majority of wrestling fans that respect all wrestlers, for the bumps and risks they take just to entertain us, the fans, and, if you was a major WWE star, would you give all that up just because some one on Y!As told you to, I don't think so, and if you did, well, that wouldn't be the smartest thing to do.", 9706, "njn1I1FUaa", 6],

Secondly, the Cena Haters, of which I am one are a much bigger group than the 'Newbie Cena Fans' would think. We don't hate him for doing his job, but rather because he's not doing it well. It doesn't matter how a match outcome is booked if the wrestlers give a great match. Take Undertaker vs. HBK at WM25 for example, Cena has never come close to that level of greatness because: 1 - he undersells every move he takes. 2 - he has about 7 moves and that's it 3 - he ends every match the same: he's down for all 20 minutes then comes back at the very end 3b - its he wrestlers that choose how the match is played, the writers just choose the ending, so its cena and his opponents fault if a match doesn't work well 3c - His matches never flow well because he's boring, doesn't have any form of a skillset and can't wrestle. Just look at the greats: Austin Rock Taker HBK HHH Hart They all put on great matches, not just because they love wrestling as I'm sure Cena does, but because they use their skills and their brains to create great matches. No Cena shouldn't retire, he should just change his gimmick greatly and stop pandering to the Newbie Fans that have only been watching wrestling for 5 years. And FYI, he has only gained respect from those newbie fans, he certainly hasn't from veteran fans from the attitude era. Remember when he was booed out of the Hall of Fame?", 9706, "None", -1],

	99724 : ["\"I have often heard the argument that God is no more real than   Clause or the Tooth Fairy. To me, this seems a bit of a rediculous comparison. It becomes obvious to us, when we have reached a certain age, that the two latter entities do not exist because of overwhelming proof to the contrary (Either we catch our parents in the act, or they admit it to us in due time). However, this cannot be said of God.\" No you cannot. Unlike   Clause, or the Tooth Fairy, your parents never admit that God does not exist. The concept is especially designed so that it cannot be trivially disproven. Notice how God is given absolutely no tangible responsibility to mankind's welfare, because otherwise people would notice the children starving in Africa and wonder what the deal was. Notice that God only helps those who help themselves, and even then, only in subtle ways, in frequencies identical to that of random chance, so that they can't be measured or disproven. Notice how he works in mysterious ways, so that when random sh!t happens, it won't spoil the illusion and comfort of an overarching plan. I've always thought the comparison between God and   to be extremely apt. They're both utterly without evidence. They both promise a world where good deeds are rewarded over some long period of time (cf the carrot and the stick), the net effect of which is obedience. They're also both extremely difficult for believers to let go of. You realise, of course, that your parent's admission and behaviour is not a proof against  , right? Your parents may have been wrong. It just shows *they* never believed in  . It doesn't mean he doesn't exist somewhere. Once you realise that the wisdom of your parents and friends is far from perfectly reliable, then there's really no reason to assume he exists, so I perfectly sympathise with your decision to no longer believe in his existence, but don't for a second think that your God has any less disproof than  . OK, so without further ado, let me answer your title question. Your god is a logical impossibility because his definition includes both infinite love for his children, as well as violence and unimaginable cruelty, both of which are antitheses of love. Therefore, we have a contradiction, and your god is logically impossible.", 9708, "D4Ko5ll2aa", 1],
	99725 : ["There is an unlikely (seeming) popular doctrine going about in the church which defies what the Bible says about God's attitude towards \"the world\", which I think makes God unnecessarily misunderstood.  The doctrine is that \"God loves e-v-e-r-y-b-o-d-y\". It seems right to a lot of Christians because that's what they are told pretty much throughout the Christian world. A lot of Christians in the USA think that people have just as much exposure to the Gospel in other parts of the world, which is simply not true. So the American Christians rely on their experiences with the Gospel and project them onto other places in the world. Therefore, they think, everyone has had a similar amount of exposure to the Gospel before they die. The Calvinists have parted from that point of view, I think with good reason. Because without the trap of the doctrine of \"God loves everybody\", they see an esoteric nature to what Jesus spoke (parables), where the message is heard by many, but understood by a few (for many are called by few are chosen). This means that God doesn't love everybody, and the message to those with no interest for God's kingdom isn't one of salvation, but the other side of the promises of God; Judgment and condemnation. God in the impossibility of God to some, there is promise gained through the will of God for those chosen (\"before the world was formed\" in Ephesians 1:4-5), and predestined (God the Father \"limited in advance\" first, not the people in the world first as they didn't even exist yet before the world was formed). I am not a Calvinist, but I accept that part of what they present as proper exegesis of the word of God.  If a person does not get a personal prompt from God on a spiritual level (something science can't even analyze, and God knew it all along that they couldn't bench test it), they will never know the God of Impossibilities (Jehovah Pela). This is why I place verses such as these to show the Bible says it, but many are incapable of understand it, even though they might call themselves \"Christian\". John 6 65 He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.” Matthew 13 10 The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” 11 He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12 Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.\" He doesn't want everybody, and even if someone he doesn't want responds to him, he will take away whatever it is that they got.

If indeed we believe only what someone has logically reasoned out and built not even the universe would exist.  But thankfully our Creator designed us with another \"dimension\" which is \"Faith\" which brings us \"Hope\".  Trusting in our mind alone limits us to the 1 billionth + of possibilities.
