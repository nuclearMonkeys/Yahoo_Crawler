	64496 : ["Cute misrepresentation of history, asker \"jotun_hertigen.   About every 30 years or so, the young folks in the U.S. have tended to rise up in social conscience to create the pendulum swing away from extremism and back toward center, with the 1960s being one such period of correcting our balance after the disaster of McCarthy in the 1950s. We slipped a stitch with my daughter's generation in the 1990s when the Ayn Rand selfish-self above all else---the \"me, my, mine\" Era of Corporate Greed---kicked in after the Reagan firing of PATCO (the Air Traffic Controllers union) in the 1980s that began an ALL-OUT WAR on our nation's full-time workers...especially UNION workers with benefits.  \"The downfall of American society is the liberated fee-male\" a bibs-overall-wearing bearded right-wing fundamentalist shouted out in a church after I challenged the \"lesson\" of the day that \"A woman must always obey her husband\" in the post-Reagan days of religious-freak extremism. \"No sir,\" I responded, \"The downfall of American society was Reagan firing PATCO!\"  Hippies were nowhere to be found when this nation-destroying GOP extremism took root and grew and took America down a dark and dangerous corporate-greed-driven religious-fanaticism way-too-far right-wing path. Reagan was a script-reading horrible Alzheimer's-afflicted President who was managed by his corporate-colluding evil-intention handlers Dick Cheney, James Baker, the theocratic-COUP-seeking Heritage Foundation, and Cheney's unconstitutional \"CIA within the CIA\" that was connected to the under-reported BCCI scandal. A right-leaning PR firm in Washington D.C., Hill & Knowlton, was hired to paint ugly \"pretty\" and to create an ORWELLIAN \"truth is lies; lies are truth\" sort of propaganda-driven Republicanism that is part of the underlying reasons why so many Americans have been so easily duped by a corrupt, incompetent, narcissistic, inane, and insane conman like Trump...all flash, no substance. Locate a copy of the Donald Bartlett & James Steele, 1990: \"America, What Went Wrong?\" to get a better picture of the downward spiral the GOP caused in the U.S. during Reagan days.   America is not \"destroyed,\" however...in part because we, the American people, were wise enough to choose Bill Clinton as our amazing President in 1992 (see \"The Clinton Presidency: Key Accomplishments\"), then finally wise enough to oust the GOP-controlled 2001-2008 Congress and put the fiscally wise Democrats in the majority, then to elect by a landslide our fiscally gifted and incredibly patient President Obama to pull us out of the GOP-caused CRAPPER (see recovery.gov and also whitehouse.gov to see how very lucky we have been as a nation to have President Obama at the helm).   Empty-promises Trump is alarmingly stupid about things such as the Nuclear Triad (he did not know what that is in an interview with Fox), the name of the Chinese leader---Xi Jinping...Trump did not even know this is a person's name, much less who that person was!...and thought his buddy Putin had not invaded Ukraine to annex the port city of Crimea!  How DUMB does he have to show himself to be before you Trump folks realize you've been conned?   Trump bankrupted three casinos, two of them at a time when our economy was on an upswing and casinos were making money. Six times he has been bankrupt, and Trump has also driven more than eight business ventures into the ground, most of them in their first year of operation. Trump has repeatedly hired illegal immigrants and has been repeatedly fined for doing so, including the two lawsuits filed against him by the Justice Department for abuse of the illegal immigrants he had hired and then abused to tear down the building where his Trump Towers would stand (see \"Trump: What's the Deal?\" available for download at ITunes).  Think of Trump as one of his casinos---flashing neon and very loud bells and whistles to lure you, the gambler (voter), into the rigged-for-the-house gambling emporium, promising you \"big wins\" if only you invest (vote) in his all-flash/no-substance selfish self. As soon as you allow yourselves to be duped into spending everything you own (like with his bait-and-switch fraudulent Trump University), Trump then dumps you as no longer useful. This is the Trump pattern...easily proven.  Read \"The Making of Donald Trump\" by Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston before you vote on November 8th, Trump folks!

	64510 : ["The main item of the Republican Agenda is concentration of wealth.  Since Reagan, their idea of 'tax reform' is to cut taxes for gazillionaires while raising them on the middle class, IOW, to shift the burden of taxation off the rich and corporations and onto the shoulders of an increasingly endangered middle class. One excellent sneaky way to do this is to eliminate or de-emphasize progressive taxes and shift to more regressive taxes.  How many times have you heard Republicans talk about eliminating income tax altogether and substituting a national sales tax?  This is the ironically named 'Fair Tax'.  Eliminating the most progressive tax and replacing it with the most regressive tax!  That would be a huge windfall for the rich, a disaster for the endangered middle class.

	64521 : ["There are so many countless reasons I really want to fanatically support the idea of replacing the current system of income tax with a national sales tax.  I am not going to go into details explaining all the benefits in support of the NST (also known as the Fair Tax Proposal & Bill HR2525), and I recommend anyone who is not already familiar with the NST to do a simple Google search to get a rundown on the basic concept, but I am going to list a few components that are of particular appeal to me:    The implementation of the NST would... ...mean a removal of the IRS. ...result in not having the IRS in my life nor having to account for everything I do to earn money. ...result in not having to file my annual list of income earning activities. ...mean being able to earn money, make money, send money, give money, receive money, and trade money without having to consider what the government thinks. ...be putting the disincentive on consumption and spending and removing the disincentive on earning and investing. ...prevent the government from passing unnecessary tax hikes and constantly having exuberant spending because of the immediate slowing of the economy do to price hikes (the NST causing gross costs to rise). ...mean not having to think about how I will be taxed when I make investments, and not having tax incentives and deterrents influence how I invest my own money. ...permit me to control how much tax I pay by directly controlling my consumption as oppose to my earnings (no one says, \"pay me less\"). ...result is not having to understand an overly complex set of rules to calculate why I owe a certain amount of taxes.    Even having stated all these very desirable considerations, I cannot get around the massive flaw in the possible implementation of such a plan.  The mere fact that anyone who has spent a lifetime paying tax and investing with after tax dollars would be subject to having all those earnings being tax all over again the moment the NST is implemented is enough for me to immediately view the tax as a very cruel and unfair idea based solely on its implementation.  This is the one and only component of the NST that I have yet to hear anyone be able to successfully produce a solution for.  There has been discussion on the possibility of using a rebate system to provide money back to those that suffer as a result of implementation, but then you have to ask, \"at whose expense?\".  Surely on the outset a rebate system would provide money back to those that suffer, but the rebate in turn would have to be paid for at the expense of those who had not been suffering (via a higher tax presumably, thus raising the gross price of products that include the NST) and so therefore you merely shift the burden, not remove it.  Had this plan been implemented from the start we might have a near perfect system, but the implementation issue is sadly so big that it even trumps all of the above mentioned benefits.    No matter how much discussion we have on what tax plan or system would be best for this country, the obvious elephant in the room is the fact that federal spending is out of control in the United States.  The issue of taxation is merely a band-aid to an existing problem which if resolved would make the band-aid far less critical.  If the government were able to get federal spending under control, would it really matter what system we used to collect taxes?  If the federal tax requirements were reduced by 20%, no one could honestly justify a debate between an income tax or a consumption tax as being as important as the fact that the amount of taxes needed is 20% less.     It always sickens me how much focus is put on the collection of taxes and how little is put on why we have to collect most of them to begin with.  No matter what political party you belong to or what viewpoint you have on social engineering, there is absolutely no reason why a tax discussion should not include a spending discussion.  To do so is tantamount to the family who lives above their means and survives on credit cards but only talks about how they can make enough money to survive without looking into where they might cut some unneeded expenses that put them into the problem to begin with.  Until we can turn the focus to spending instead of collecting, the entire matter is really a disgrace.", 8259, "4de217d283f454c679619ecd592f26ebaa", 0],
	64522 : ["A national sales tax would generally hurt poorer families more than rich ones due to the fact that a larger percentage of a poor family's income goes to retail purchases than a rich family. As much as the general population hates to admit it, the rich actually pay more in taxes than the poor. The middle class pay the largest percentage and the national sales tax would probably mirror the amount the normally pay which would mean the poor would have to pay more and the rich less. This would further widen the gap from rich to poor and wouldn't affect the middle class very much.", 8259, "AA11609933", 0],

	64525 : ["Read \"The Fairtax Book\" by John Linder and Neal Bortz, who advocate a national sales tax.  I am for it since it would be easier to govern and it would be proportional.
