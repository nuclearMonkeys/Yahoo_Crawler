	102139 : ["Throwing a bunch of parts at it is pointless. It has been suggested to you to clean the evaporator and condenser. While its imperative to have both coils clean and the filter changed regularly, if the evap was extremely dirty or somewhat clogged, it would be icing and certainly produce air that would not be as cold as it should. What needs to happen here is a qualified tech should put the gauges on the system to read the pressures & performance. The superheat and subcooling should be ascertained. The ambient air, supply air, and return air temperatures all need to be taken and evaluated in what's called a delta T calculation, and the duct work should be inspected for leaks, proper insulation, proper connection(s), and the fan blower should be inspected and cleaned if necessary. My own personal opinion is that the metering device is sticking open and flooding the evaporator. The point is that the components of the HVAC system must work together efficiently and effectively. Have a COMPETENT tech come out and go through the list I quoted. Chances are, a few small things are making one problem.
