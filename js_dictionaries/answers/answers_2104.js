Snake is rude after the movie, so to protect Marge's honor Homer challenges him to a duel, but Snake runs away at the onset of conflict. Overfilled with confidence, Homer starts challenging everyone to a duel by slapping them his glove. It gets him his way, until he slaps a Southern Colonel. The Colonel accepts his challenge and shows up at his front door at dawn. Homer chickens out and the family flees town. The man and his wife set up camp on Homer's lawn, while the Simpson family searches for a place to stay. Homer remembers Abe's old farm, so they go there and they become farmers. Homer has the repeated misfortune of tractors tipping onto him and he has no luck growing crops. He decides to use plutonium from the nuclear plant as a fertilizer. Radioactive tomatoes grow overnight, but they taste like ashtrays and are highly addictive. Apparently, they are tomatoes mixed with tobacco, which Homer starts marketing as \"Tomacco.\" Lisa has moral problems with it. The Laramie tobacco company offers Homer $150,000,000 for the plant. Homer is not very good at negotiating, so he fails to cash in. When they return home, animals are addicted to the plant. They revolt, a la \"Animal Farm\" and a sheep destroys the last plant. The family returns home and Homer finishes the duel with a mere flesh wound and a hilarious \"Glove Slap\" rounds out the episode.", 10163, "None", 0],

Agnosticism asserts that asserting a probability or preponderance regarding existence is the poison that destroys critical thinking, undermines evidence, and leads people into lives dedicated to absurdity.

	110984 : ["Perspective! It's just the state of one's ideas. He's entitled to his.  At Hebrews 11:1, the Bible says: “Faith is . . . the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” Another version says: “Faith . . . makes us certain of realities we do not see.” (The New English Bible) To illustrate: You are walking along a beach when, suddenly, you feel the ground quake. Then you see the water rush out to sea. You recognize the significance of these phenomena and that they warn of a tsunami. In this case, the quake and the vanishing water together form an “evident demonstration” of the yet unseen reality, the approaching waves. Your informed faith, in turn, moves you to flee to high ground and safety. Faith in God too should be an informed faith, a response to convincing evidence. It clearly then doesn't undermine evidence or destroy critical thinking. These are essential for faith. Only then can God become an ‘unseen reality' to you.

	111003 : ["It is very rare that you can get more than what you paid in a first vet visit and shots. Why would someone pay for a mix breed dog when there is no way of telling what traits from which breed might show up.  And whether the mixture will result in a dog with serious temperament and health issues.  At least if you buy a purebred you can usually find out ahead of time any health issues that are found often in a breed. I have had many mix breed dogs that were amazing dogs, they are not worthless, but they do not have a high monetary value to others!  I had one dog that was a cocker / golden mix that I trained as my service dog.  She was not only my service dog but also a therapy dog.  She knew more commands than any other service dog I knew, and we received lots of compliments when we would do demonstrations and go to service dog events.  But I would NEVER have bred her, she was too important to me to risk her life and her health.  I would not have done so even if I could sell and make a lot of money from the pups, she was more important. Are you ready for the veterinary costs to care for your dog and the puppies should things not go well?  Are you able and prepared to provide care and re-home any puppies from every litter your female has that are returned or no longer wanted? I purchased a smooth coated collie several years ago that I was training to be my service dog.  It turned out that he has such severe fear of certain noises that no matter how much work I did training him he could not overcome his fears.  Living in an apartment I can only have one dog and due to my disabilities I need a service dog. The point is:  Part of the contract when I purchased him REQUIRED that I contact the breeder if I no longer wanted my dog for any reason.  (Most of his fears came from spending his first 6 months in a kennel, not being socialized, so the breeder had her share of responsibility for the problem.)  Anyway, the breeder took the dog back.  Since he was so well trained and obedient, she quickly found him a new home in a quiet little town that was not a major city in a family where he was loved and adored as much as I had loved him!  If I had kept him it would have been likely that his fears would have lead to aggression, and would have ruined a wonderful dog. There are many, many considerations required before deciding on breeding ANY dog.  The more you can do to insure the success of the puppies is your responsibility, not just what can you make from their sale.", 10156, "nIf76cf9aa", 0],

You can ask what you have in them for vet bills - shots, wormings,  etc.   They will likely end up in an animal shelter when the are a few months old anyway.     No one will pay any amount of money for a mix breed dog out of parents that have no genetic testing done on them. You do know that your female can die giving birth?  - or need a C-section if the birthing doesn't go right.   It isn't worth risking the life of your dog to produce puppies that no one will want? Do your dog a favor and spay her.    Keep her for a pet and make her a member of your family.   Stop thinking of your dog as a personal ATM machine,  spitting out puppies to sell.", 10156, "gkCkqqHfaa", 6],
