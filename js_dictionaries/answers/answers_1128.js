	61891 : ["What is currently proposed (forgive me if I am wrong as it changes by the minute) is a temporary ONE YEAR increase in the debt ceiling to coincide with tax cuts.  Obama is against this, why?  He is scared that it all is going to come crashing down upon him in an election year.  He wants a plan in place that will carry us through and either leave this on the shoulders of who we elect to replace him (I shudder to think anyone would want to vote him into a 2nd term) or be something he won't care too much about when he is skating through a second term. I hate this and I hate the mess these politicians have put us in.  Isn't it strange that no one saw this coming?  C'mon guys.  Obama, Reid and Pelosi engineered this massive stimulus loan right after Obama took office that was supposed to fix our economy.  Instead it threw us into more and more debt that we cannot hope to get ourselves out of with current spending.  The voting for this thing went pretty much, as expected, right down party lines. So, here we are.  Deeper in debt and they want MORE debt to fix?  Hello? Stop it.  Stop it now, it's out of control.  Cut everything, I mean everything.  I'm sad as much as the next person about cuts, but here we are at the point of no return.  Close the Smithsonian, national parks, shut down offices, lay off people and tighten the belt.  Do not touch social security, but just about everything else needs to be cut or closed.  Military?  Well, we are in trouble.  Libya needs to stop, foreign aid needs to stop and we need to live like paupers, as that is what we are. One last thing, our government should allow an optional contribution on income tax forms to pay off the national debt.  I'd give a few dollars, would you?  Imagine if every citizen in the USA actually contributed somewhere between $5.00 and $100.00 to pay off this debt?  Imagine if we could do this each year?  Imagine we could actually make it work on a voluntary basis?", 8137, "AA12212403", 0],
	61892 : ["The US house is empowered to stop any retarded new legislation and spending, but are powerless otherwise to stop the growth of spending that was set in motion by previous legislatures.  Furthermore they have little control over the discretionary spending spree by the truly enormous Executive Branch or the costs incurred by the ever-regulating agencies under its control.   Raising the debt ceiling means allowing the Feds to borrow ever more money to cover the increasing expense of funding the numerous things the government has under its control.  This isn't really the issue, it is the insistence of the Obama administration (the Obamination) on not cutting any spending but instead sucking more money out of the private sector, which is already reeling from the effects of the recession.    This is like asking for a blood donation from a person laid up in the hospital with multiple injuries. The only solution so far as I can see is to ward Obama off with a crucifix and then when he is back in his crypt, hammer a stake through his heart.", 8137, "Xnh2tmQlaa", 1],
	61893 : ["You are confused. It is NOT the Republicans who want the ceiling raised, it is the Democrats. They want to increase taxes, and raise the ceiling, WITHOUT reducing spending enough to stop the escalating debt. The debt has DOUBLED since 2001, it needs to stop, and then be reduced. But first it has to be STOPPED. The USA is borrowing $4 BILLION a DAY to maintain the present spending habits. Everyone knows you cannot do that forever, you have to get the spending in line with the income. It would be impossible to expect even the richest Americans to collectively come up with $4 Billion dollars a DAY!", 8137, "gRfqjemmaa", -1],

	61899 : ["My favorite game is Heavy Rain. It is a very intense, story driven game where you play as four different characters trying to find a murder called the \"Origami Killer\" This is my favorite game, because your choices effect everything and there are many different endings. I love it because it's so original, and I have never played a game quite like it. I also like action games, too, like assassins creed 3, which I am currently playing. My favorite counsel is actually the ps3. I know a lot of gamers prefer Xbox 360, but I just feel ps3 has better exclusives (like Heavy Rain)", 8146, "GkVYbY9Laa", 0],

	61911 : ["Trying to keep her all to yourself and away from the public will only drive her away. Maybe she is just polite but why is she giving people her number and possibly misleading men about her status? I know some guys think it's a compliment to tell their guy friend that their wife/GF is hot, but I agree, it's better not to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Let your GF know that it makes you uncomfortable to know men are flirting with her, whether or not she thinks she is flirting back. And if she asks what would make you more comfortable, tell her -- if it's a reasonable request like letting men know she's seeing someone if they ask for her number, then I would think she'd be glad you said something. If she is upset by your honesty, then I would ask her how she would feel if you were texting other women while out with you. That should help her see your point.

	61918 : ["I don't see what was disproportionate in the soldiers' reaction. I suggest you read some testimonies given by the soldiers who landed on that ship. They described it as lynching, many jumped off the ship to save their lives and many others were attacked with metal bars, knives, firebombs and more. Only as a last resort and at the last minute, they were allowed to use their firearm. They didn't even come prepared as they were only armed with a gun and paint-ball guns. Not assault rifles or anything of that sort, since they came down to talk but were assaulted with deadly weapons and only attacked back in a \"kill or be killed\" situation.  Also, besides the warnings prior to the convoy setting sail, they were warned while sailing before the soldiers took over: Edit: First of all - As far as I know they weren't going to sail through Israel's territorial waters so stopping them there isn't an option. The ships were stopped as they were heading directly into Gaza's territorial waters in an attempt to break the siege. They were warned about it in advance more than once. If not to be petty, the issue of whether it happened 2 km to the east or to the west doesn't really matter. The result would sadly be the same as the people on the 6th ship was planning to attack the Israeli soldiers no matter where the ship would be. Obviously, Israel wouldn't allow them to enter Gaza's territorial waters and stopped them when there was no other side.", 8137, "GDwMdfqjaa", -2],
	61919 : ["I find your comments interesting. Being Canadian I do not know the exact details of what is now going on in International waters etc. but the points you make are very disturbing. You know what really disturbs me about this whole Israeli - Palestinian conflict.  Please correct me if I am wrong!   All actions, from the beginning, were made because the Israeli people were told that one day they would again live on their \"homeland\".   How were they told?   By Religious instruction.  I believe it was in the Bible.  As you can tell I do not know details and am repeating something that I have heard over the years (78) back and forth during this long and disturbing conflict. Sadly, human beings have put up lines between what they have decided, are countries.  They have put up lines in Oceans and even in the sky (no fly zones etc.)   When Astronauts first went up into space, they remarked that the beauty of the planet was not disturbed by dividing lines between countries, etc. How sad that people are still fighting over dirt as to who exactly it belongs to. How sad that religions assist by saying \"I am right and you are wrong\". I am interested in reading many answers to your question that give us different perspectives of this disturbing event. I do not side with anybody because I really do not know who did what.  I am saying that this world will never , ever heal itself when so much hate is thrown around between countries and people.", 8137, "oMF6bXCZaa", 1],
