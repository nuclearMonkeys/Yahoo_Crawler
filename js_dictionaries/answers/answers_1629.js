	87112 : ["Back then, nobody thought slavery was wrong.  It was completely normal and accepted.  Throughout most of human history, slavery and servitude and a society where some people are at higher levels than others was the norm. It was a very new thing for the U.S. to be formed, and for western society to change in general, to a concept of egalitarianism (born out of the philosophers of the Enlightenment age).  From that point onward, there was a steady march to a generally accepted notion that all men are created equal - and from that concept came the notion that, if slaves are men, then what rational justification is there that they be involuntarily subjugated? It's a new concept, my friend.  You want to focus on Christianity as the culprit, but believe me, slavery was the HUMAN norm, not just the Christian one. And, deciding that as a society we no longer want to view slavery as the right way of things is just fine.  Christianity doesn't prohibit slavery as a matter of God's will, but there is surely room for men to make rules governing their own behavior.   We can make laws and rules that have to be followed whether or not God specifically cares one way or the other.", 9254, "None", 1],

	87115 : ["You are erroneously presuming that consciousness is the end point of energy construction.  Known universal energy construction progresses through levels of complexity, from let's say pre-photonic > photonic > particle > atomic > molecular > organic molecular > life > consciousness.  Your error is consciousness-centrically presuming that the progression ends with consciousness level of complexity and therefore, a creator is consciousness and can be perceived through consciousness.  There are more levels of complexity observable in reality that ensue the energy construction of consciousness.  By objectively analyzing the similar mechanics with which energy ascends from all levels of complexity to the next level of complexity and extrapolating with those common mechanics onward from the level of consciousness, one can perceive the next objective level of energy and beyond, perhaps not comprehending those levels, but at least perceiving the general outline along which energy strives to evolve beyond consciousness.  By objectively analyzing the entire course of energy rather than confining the exploration within consciousness-centrality  and subjecting ourselves to the self-serving passion of consciousness divining itself, we may perceive more of what might be considered God.  But, to presume to be able to prove the existence of a God through consciousness as a consciousness is as silly as inorganic matter presuming to have chromosomes.", 9253, "None", -2],

The first step that I urge you to do is to go meet some americain muslim women, I think this will help you feel sure and secure because in the begining of conversion you feel some kind that you are a stranger, but know that you will be not. Know that in becoming Muslima, you will please God, and in return all your past sins will be errased and some will become double reward <good deeds to start with in your account> Thanks God for  your interest in knowing the truth. Emma, Know that more you are looking for the truth  with open mind and with open heart, you have nothing to loose, and Know that God will guide you more and more until you be sure with no doubts.also know that it is of your right to search for the truth.and more you will be close to it, more satan will try to make you in doubts, more people will try hard to put you back into ignorance. we have one God, and he is just and will never commit injustice toward us. we agree that he is seeing, hearing us and knowing what's in our heart. so if we die believing in this, can God punish us for it? we are 100% right. know that God is not the author of confusion, so his message will call for unity and if you see in christianity there is too many groups, one believing in jesus as God the son, others jesus is God, others both believes, trinity, unitarian ....and that you find in a single street many churchs everyone thinking that they are on the truth. is that Unity? the danger is that these sects are divided upon their beliefs about who is God?wich bible is true?. in islam they all agree about one God, one book,and one prophet  who was enough to  convey the message but there is some sects but without a real threat to the main belief that there is one God and we have to submit to his commands, <a sect is just an innovator in the religion of God> and in the day of jugement the one who didn't invent and innovate in the religion of God will be succesfull.  to make God happy is to obey his commands and not innovate new things,and strive to please him We believe in jesus peace be upon him, but the jews don't. We believe in Muhammad pbuh and both christians and jews don't. If you want to understand the message of Jesus, read the Quran, than read the bible, but read only the words coming from jesus lips only, but with your interpretation based on the Quran, so you can understand his sayings( in making sure that jesus is just a man and a great prophet, while God is different, nothing is like him). I will give you an example in a form of question with answer: Q/ why God sent prophets? A/ because no form of worship will be accepted by God only what he told his prophets to teach. So we can understand then the verse of Jesus pbuh. <<  no-one can access GOD without jesus.>> the same thing in Islam ,no one can say that he worships God only through the teaching of Muhammad pbuh. If you worship God your way it will not be accepted from you because you can't force God and because he already sent you many prophets. that way we understand that all the prophets were muslim.<submitted to the will of God>and you can't worship God only through them. Jesus can't be God because God has one way to save the world, not many ways. is it fair that the people who lived at the time of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Ishmaeel,....Moses strived hard to please God , followed the commands of God while the christians follow nothing of the commands and allowed all things that God made unlawful ( like drinking, drugs, adultery, gambling, usury,....) some muslims do this bad things, but they know that they are forbiden by God, while christians do them thinkingthat jesus died for their sins.<it is a sad surprise for them in the day of judgement if they don't change now> Q/ what do you think if you were born in the amazon forest far away from civilization, (and looking at the stars, the sun, the moon, the sky, the rain, the sea, the mountains....) will you recognize that there is a pwerfull thing behind these creations, or will you discover that God came to save us? A/ I will say that your head will be full of questions, who created these thing? for what purpose? why I am here?......but you will know that there is something appealing to you. Q/ If we find out that there is another earth somewhere in the univers with other people like us, and they are sinner. do you think God will send prophets to guide them? or send another son to die for them <while he is in need of nothing>? If so why he created them ? A/ If you see there is no reason for God to come and die to save the world<while he can't die, he is eternal> lets read the verse in our way:<< God so loved the world that he send himself to die for our sins>>!!! why creating us.? this can't be. If you sin you need to ask God for forgivness because he is most merciful, most forgiving. Q/so, why God created satan then? A/ If God wanted to save the world the way the christians claim, he would not have created satan to tempt us, to whisper to us, to make us worship others than God. so why creating satan to mislead us and push us to sin, and God can't control him only by coming and die or send his son while God can't have a so  and specially a human. Jesus never said that I am God, worship me. if so why then God didn't make it clear to us without falling in doubts, mysteries, misconceptions...., son of God was just another way to say a pious one, close to God, a believer..in Hebrew language ..read the bible you will find many son(s) of God. can God let you die with mysteries with you? God has many attributes that are perfect, like the most merciful and forgiving. the christians give him imperfection, they said you can't be saved only because jesus died for our sins. so God is imperfect then. ( how about jesus didn't die on the cross and God put somebody who looks like him on the cross , so jesus is alive and will come back to call all people to the truth and no more sects and divisions) God is powerfull and can do anything , but christians claim that he needs a son to die to save the world. again they make him imperfect. they say God of israel is different than God of today. again they claim impefection to God. God knows what will happen in the future, if realy God had a son like they claim, he will save him, not let him die , becaus God knows the future so he could have change the circonstances but because he has no son he let things happen like he predicted they claim a not knowing God God gave you the choice, a perfect brain and heart to choose between right and wrong. who ever will be arrogant to the message of God , he will be blind, dumb, and can't understand. who ever keep his heart open for knowing the truth, God will give him light, and I think you are one of them . keep like that. just keep asking questions to yourself and I am sure that you can answer them if you use logic and your heart. <don't forget to keep asking God for more guidance> Muslims believe in all the prophets, it is a pillar of faith, you are not muslim if you don't accept Moses, jesus, Adam, and all others. God choose them because they are the best of mankind. God is most wise and he knows wich man if he gives him the message he will convey it perfectly, the prophets are all muslims, they all suffered and were insulted in a period of their life. Muhammad is the last prophet of God , even dead he still being mocked , insulted by people of other believe this is why he is the seal of the prophets until the end of time with the Quran as the eternal message from God not altered and polluted by man's hands. Muhammad is a prophet for all mankind. May God help you. for more help consult theses sites. try to print", 9255, "None", 0],

	87122 : ["It does NOT make sense to ask who created God, because then you are logically obligated to ask who created God's creator, who created THAT one's creator, etc., ad infinitum, ad nauseum. In order for God to BE God, He had to have created this MEST universe. (MEST = Matter, Energy, Space and Time). In order for God to have created MEST, He can not BE MEST. He can not consist of that which He created. God is neither matter NOR energy, but something altogether different. Jesus said \"God is spirit.\" Furthermore, God can not be limited to space or time. He must transcend that which He created. (An explanation will follow shortly). What this implies is that God is infinite in scope, and eternal in duration. By way of explanation, a painter is not constrained to the canvas to which he applies his paints. A painter transcends the flat canvas. If an object on a canvas were to suddenly gain intelligence, it would be very foolish of it to say that the painter is subject to the laws that govern the canvas - the way the paint is applied, the colors, the texture, etc. Space and time is God's canvas, and matter and energy is the paint He uses. The scientific laws of physics, chemistry, entropy, the laws of thermodynamics, the law of cause-and-effect, etc., that rule in this MEST universe do not necessarily apply to that which exists outside of MEST (i.e. God).  To say as much is as foolish as saying that a painter is stuck on his flat, 2-dimensional world that he created with paint and brush. So no - it does NOT make sense to ask how God began.", 9252, "AA11849917", 2],

Yes, there are guidelines for having slaves in the old testament; once again this was only the culture, not the religion.

	87131 : ["Start with the Quran, read it and try to understand it as best you can, and pray to God for guidance while you do so. From there on the beliefs change from person to person. Some will tell you it is not ok to dress how you consider \"normal,\" while others will tell you that simply dressing modestly is perfectly acceptable. Some will tell you all music is sinful (haram), others will tell you only certain types of music are sinful, and still others will say all music is allowed. Some will claim hijab (covering the head) is mandatory, others will claim it is a choice and that hijab means more than this. You can figure all of those things out later though, as far as what path is truly the one that you are meant to be on. Don't let the many differing opinions discourage you. When I converted, I tended to get \"lost\" the moment I tried to understand the differing beliefs.

So I would encourage you, whatever path you choose, to go get a Quran. Read it with an open mind, and do your best to understand it. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you are concerned... using ones mind is given importance, and there is no shame in trying to understand what you read. Everything else is secondary to what is within this book, as it is only this book that is the literal word of God. After you start there, just pray for guidance, and go where God and your heart lead you. One more thing... those who offer their advice and opinion do not matter, what matters is that you follow God.

He just is and always has been and always will be.   It may depend on what you believe if your thinking about how the world began. I, personally, believe that God created it. Whether he used the big bang or not, I don't know but God works in mysterious ways and who am I to say how it happened or not, I wasn't there, obviously haha. I don't quite believe in the big bang though because Ive studied it and remember its not actually proven, hence the term Big Bang THEORY. Science can only go so far, the big bang and other theories provide ideas of how the universe was created, however, in all the theories they originated from something in the beginning. The big bang theory for example was created by a massive explosion involving a force and matter and anti matter. It is said that there was no time and space before this, however the would have had to have been if there was matter and force acting upon it, also there would have had to have been time for thee explosion to occur.  Life is a very complex thing. We will never know how it actually happened, but there are too many wonderful things on this earth that are indescribable and no words could do them justice.

I might be wrong about that, but as I said I just cannot even imagine how there could be an absence of time.

Not only did God exist before the Big Bang, it was God who created time!  Michael Poole, Physicist says that there was no time or space before the Big Bang.  The Big Bang brought time and space into being.  Augustine (4th Century) said that creation was with time, not in time.  God created everything including time.   Prof. Frank Russell Stannard, Physicist, believes that creation is a theological concept.  Science studies the origins of matter and energy.  They are not the same thing.  Theologically, creation is God's act of bringing into being everything that there is and sustaining it in being.  Science studies the processes that resulted in the universe.  God explains the ‘who?' and Big Bang explains the process, the possible ‘how'? Dr Denis Alexander, Immunologist, explains how, for scientists, a theory is a map on which data fits and makes sense of the world.  This is why science can't deal with the unseen, the unquantifiable.  Life on earth is based on carbon and with carbon-based life you have to have life and death.

When you really truly understand who God is and who you are, it becomes clearer, the grace that he had shown towards us becomes clearer and when you have that revelation, you cannot help but fall in love with Jesus. :) Check out this Youtube video please, it probably will give you a more understanding. It's how I really understood it all by watching this! ", 9256, "None", 0],

It is impossible for us to understand infinity because we only things and humans who begin life and die or any thing will after time stop to exist. Nothing in the world is infinite. All that had a beginning will have an end. But the same thing could be said to God. So it does not make sense to ask how God begun. God did not begun. he was there before the Big Bang or creation and will always be. Only our soul which is part given by God that will not end.", 9252, "ORmrJXRxaa", 1],
	87148 : ["If God existed before the Big Bang at the beginning of time, does it make sense to ask how God began? ---no. But prove God existed at the beginning of time.  Things can only begin to exist in time, ---so you say. I doubt you're a big expert on 'things that exist outside time'. Hard for the brain to wrap around that one. I know that 'begin' has a temporal meaning but still, might want to look into that.  but time itself had a beginning in the Big Bang. ---prove it.   Wouldn't anything that existed before the Big Bang be timeless and immaterial? ---only if time began with the BB.  Additional Details Lola, the Big Bang is creation, and all Christians recognize God as the creator and cause of the Big Bang. ----rubbish. Creationists for eg. Gracie, God is not energy. Energy, along with time, space, and matter, began to exist at the Big Bang. ---prove it Zanmatto, since time, space, matter, or energy did not exist before the Big Bang, yet the universe had to have a cause (since it began to exist), ---universe can't have just began when time began ? Universe can't be 'self existent' ? If you posit an attribute as being possible, which you do when you slap it on God's Butt, then it could just as easily be on the Universe's Butt.   it is reasonable to recognize a timeless and immaterial cause that preexisted time ---you're assuming time had to have a beginning. It's basically \"We'll call it God./No, we'll call it the universe.\". Irrelevant b/c there's obviously nothing worth WORSHIPING since 'God' won't lift a finger to help us and since we only THINK we know of his existence from being unable to answer certain 'beginning of all existence' questions. Oh, and some holy books which are 'holy' b/c they're full of holes.  because a cause must precede its effect. ---in normal physics as we know it, yes, it does seem so.  It seems reasonable to say that before time was timelessness. ---seems to make sense in a purely grammatical way, yeah. 4 is a concept. Are you saying 'God' is just a concept ? OK. Fine. 'God' is a concept. Yeah. No argument with that.", 9252, "None", -1],
	87149 : ["There is an old Far Side cartoon captioned \"The Big Sneeze Theory\" where God sneezes the universe into existence.

However, I will have to say this, not all Atheists are ok with homosexuality- but that does not make them believe in God.  That is an erroneous statement, in and of itself.  People who are atheists, do not believe that there is a God.  They don't feel that they have to answer to someone that does not exist. Unfortunately one day they will realize that He is real, but instead of asking a question like this, why don't we that do believe live in such a way that would encourage others to repent of whatever sin is hindering them and come to know the love of Jesus that we know?

	87153 : ["I'm not sure which argument objectively qualifies.  But subjectively, the argument from consciousness, weighs most.  Before my conversion I was an extreme skeptic.  Starting from a universe made up of matter/energy and nothing else I just couldn't make the leap to conscious awareness being reliable.  Kant's Critique had pretty much rendered reason incapable of grasping reality as it is.  Science to me was just a complex game of trial and error with no ontologically fixed basis or conclusions.  What we call knowledge was to me just convention.  I admit I was naive.  The weak anthropic principle tells me that our very existence proves we do have access to the real world-- knowledge if you will.  But I hadn't considered it then.   Inanimate matter becoming self-aware?  And, really, everything else we are and do hangs from that.  If it happened by purely physical processes, nobody has a clue what the mechanism might be.  But that doesn't trouble me.  I don't like God of the gaps arguments.  Rather, I just don't believe in luck.  And let's face it, possessing consciousness is the equivalent of winning the universal lottery.  That kind of coincidence trips my B.S.ometer.  I'd never buy it anywhere else in my life.  Why should I buy it here? not a very astute philosophical argument.  But I still find it compelling.", 9253, "Z6j6Zq9waa", 2],

Matter can not be created or destroyed so, where in the hell did it come from?  Some might say saying God did it is to easy but it is a theory.  It can not be proven that everything came from something that has always existed but everything I know seems to lead to just that conclusion.  Is it more believable that the universe made it's self, or that is was made my a force that has always been? : also, it does no make sense for a place to exist while having a rule the everything has to come from something but yet that place its self comes from nothing.

Go there with the mindset that you are to be enlightened and learn more about God and yourself and purpose on this earth..
