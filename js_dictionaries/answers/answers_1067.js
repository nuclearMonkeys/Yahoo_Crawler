	58828 : ["My guess is probably the antenna (which is usually a wire in around the display) is broken or become detached from the board. It is like the second thing you take off when you open a laptop (most) but cracking the case and putting it back together is not usually easy.  So I would take it to a repair shop to see if that is the problem. An easier way to debug it is to use a usb/wifi adapter.  They are really cheap, usually $30.  Get one that is 802.11ac.   If that one works, you can use it and forego your onboard.   If it bothers you, then you can fix it and stick the adapter in a drawer for the next time.", 8169, "ul2uMCzWaa", 0],
	58829 : ["It depends on the type of WiFi you have, but one solution would be to switch over from the 2.4 GHz signal to the 5 GHz signal. Both your laptop and your router would have to support this feature at the same time. The 5 GHz band has some additional signal integrity features and is less prone to interference from other nearby WiFi routers. The downside is that it is less capable penetrating long distances than the 2.4 GHz one. However, it seems like distance isn't the problem here, but interference from the walls and floors and ceilings. 5 GHz won't travel as far, but it can usually travel better through the walls. Alternately, there is a type of networking kit called a \"powerline ethernet\" which uses the power lines of your house to transmit data. This means that you don't have to go through the trouble of threading ethernet cable through your house, as it'll simply use your power grid itself as the network wiring. You would put one adapter near the router and connect it through ethernet. And then you would put the second adapter to your room, and attach your laptop through ethernet as well.", 8169, "bz34wCGSaa", 1],

Buy your own modem as well.  Get one on their approved list (they manage it so it needs to be on that list).  Get one that has 32 channels down by 8 up. More channels, the more stable your speed in my opinion. IF you buy one of those $40 pieces of trash, you will be unhappy.  You get what you pay for and if you don't pay, you will be unhappy.

	58832 : ["It's true that electricity doesn't care what color the insulation is. What the standards do is assign meaning to the colors and the pins on the interface. In a simpler world they'd just be using the USOC standard designed for voice phones: pair 1 in the middle, pair 2, 3 and 4 spreading out from there. AT&T modified that so that the outer pairs weren't split so far apart in the connector, minimizing the chance for crosstalk, and that's probably why pairs 1 and 2 aren't so close together. Then comes the rest of the communications industry, who wanted a standard not controlled by AT&T. In comes the EIA/TIA 568 standard... based on what AT&T was doing. The main difference is that pairs 1 and 2 are together so that they are backwards compatible with voice wiring. With the AT&T pattern so widespread they grandfathered it in as 568B. And the rest is history. 568A is preferred and what you must use in government contracts.", 8171, "None", 0],
	58833 : ["Using the twisted pairs as pairs is essential; each pair functions as a \"transmission line\", a bit like a coaxial cable but balanced rather than one half grounded. As with coax, a properly made pair has a constant impedance and very low signal loss over long distances. Random wires just do not work the same. Other than that, the only thing that matters for it to work is having the same pair on the correct terminals at the other end. Using a particular colour code just makes it easier to faultfind or reconnect thing is future, as you can look up what colours should go to what pins. The specific colour arrangements are for compatibility with other or older systems, if the wiring is eg. in an office building and may be used for phone or other purposes.

Be there for her as much as you can and I can't believe the police got involved! When I was in middle school a girl told me she didn't want to be friends anymore so I stopped talking to her and hanging out with her, next thing I know she was constantly harassing me and making death threats towards me and starting rumors about me. I wish I could have talked to my mom and that she could have comforted me but all she told me was that middle school is hard, and that I have to be strong and get though it and forced me to go to school.

On 2: your actions in that situation seem to be born from panick, as with the first dream.  I would ask the same question as before: what event or events in your life caused the same feelings?  Present and past. I can at least suggest that you realize (just consider) that you are no longer in that panick-inducing situation IF no present situation is causing the same feelings. In my experience, how you feel and what it relates to in your current and past experiences is key to understanding your dreams. It's your mind creating those experiences subconsciously based on your conscious and unconscious experiences. I'll give you a personal example.  I dropped out of high school twice, got a G.E.D. after the second time and made a pretty good life for myself after that. I had recurring nightmares of being in high school and panicking about just being there for over a decade after leaving high school for good.  Those dreams were all about how I felt: panicked. Once I realized how I felt and that I was no longer in that situation, and wouldn't be there again, those dreams stopped. That is the recurring theme in understanding my dreams.  I always ask myself what I feel in the dream, and think about past experiences that the feelings and thoughts remind me of.  That always leads me to a resolution.", 8157, "JBf83nJ7aa", 0],
