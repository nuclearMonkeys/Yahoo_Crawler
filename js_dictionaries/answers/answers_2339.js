I have a 7 yr old son. Some of his favorite things to do are: go for walks and collect things...bottle caps, pine cones, pretty rocks, etc that he finds along the way. You can then use these to make collages when you get home. Anything to do with WATER! Save a couple of the squirt type dish soap or shampoo bottles..go outside on a warm day with a bucket of water and have a squirt battle with these! Water balloons are also a favorite! hot wheels cars (i think all little boys have a collection of these) if playing inside take a big piece of cardboard or use tape and tape several pieces of paper together. Then lay it on a table or the floor, get out crayons or markers and draw a village...roads..stop lights, stores with parking lots, etc. Then drive your cars on it. **cars are the most fun however to play OUTSIDE with. Find a inconspicious place in the driveway or side of the house (make sure its ok with the parents first and dont put it somewhere it will easily get stepped on.) use an old teaspoon or an old household paint brush (1 in or 2 inch work best) and use them to make \"roads\" by clearing small paths. These are awesome cause they actually look like tiny miniature dirt roads! a small patch of grass trimmed short with scissors and some plastic cows added makes a field. small weeds left in the ground become bushes and trees, you can even use small rocks to line your roads or to make boaundaries for buildings, fences, sidewalks, etc. Use your spoon to dish a small dent in the ground...add water and fashion a \"bridge\" acorss it for the cars. This game can last for hours or even days of the weather and people walking dont get to it! sock puppets! then put on a puppet show. modeling clay or play dough GI Joe guys are great fun to play with. drawing pictures and making up stories to go with them. bike riding passing baseball or football any kind of arts and crafts that is not \"girly\". my son loves to make puppets, gifts, bookmarks, he even loves to scrapbook with me...but he wont do jewelry or anything else he thinks of as \"girly\"  growing things. Get a pack of seeds pf an easy care flower...like marigolds and couple paper cups..plant seeds, sit them on a windowsill where they will get light and water them every day. When they are about 4 or 5 inches tall, replant outside. thats just a few things...hope they help ya out", 10722, "AA10268903", 0],

Here is a way to treat pimples and blemishes on your face. Make a cup of hot tea. No need to add sugar this time. Then, put the cup onto a a table and steam your face with the hot tea vapor. It is better if you cover your head and the tea cup with a towel, so that your face  will get maximum quantity of the hot tea vapor. Do it for about half an hour or until the tea gets cool. Do it once a day. I have done it myself and it works in just a short time.  To reduce bags and dark circles under your eyes, put a used tea bag onto your eyes. Leave it there for about 20 minutes. Do it daily and you will see the results. One more thing, never scrub your face really hard when you have pimples because this will make it worse. The pimples might pop out and spread around your face. You should scrub your face really gently. Good Luck!", 10725, "fkJS5oDLaa", 0],

Here's my mental picture of it- dark charcoal grey background, with all the text on the page white, except for the top of the page where it says \"the fashion blog\" which would be really big, pink, and lowercase :) I hope that made sense lol... anyways that's just my idea! You could do an outfit of the day, trend of the season, maybe a weekly \"vs\"? For instance one week it would be \"Forever 21 vs WetSeal\", then next week \"American Eagle vs Abercrombie\". You could write about the pros and cons of each store, post pictures of your favorite items from those stores & why you like them, then set up a poll where your readers could actually say which brand they like better:) so it would be interactive. You could use random pictures of popular celebrities and rate their outfit from 1-10; like that section could be called Celebs: Hot or Not? haha Idk.... Just ideas! And then try to write every day or almost every day just talking. Like, you could say \"So I went shopping this afternoon, and saw the most gorgeous boots at Express! Well, they were beautiful until I bought them and my dog ate them\" so it would be about fashion, but still fun and everyday, you know? Anyway these are just ideas!!!
