I would not reload aluminum cased ammo because some aluminum alloys do not anneal leaving the same surface as brass.   Brass has a substantially higher melt point than aluminum that makes suitable reloading. Fire your aluminum cased rounds one time and you will have very little, if any, problems. Not impossible to reload a quality aluminum cased round...just needs to be done by a more meticulous than average re loader that has the right equipment and experience using that equipment.", 4480, "ggaHVSjaaa", 6],

Been on yahoo answers as a teen since 2007. Yahoo answers was great back then, until they started changing their site encouraging trolls and so on. Uhg.  I remember glacier wolf and some others who answered my questions back then. I started off asking a bunch of questions about Mosin Nagants since it and a .22 were my first rifles. I think I annoyed people sometimes with them. Sorry about that guys lol.  When I came to the hunting section/guns I was so ignorant about guns people thought my severe n0oBness questions were me being a troll. I just had no idea about guns or anything, so I came here to find out. I know I guess some of those questions were really dumb, but this place is about learning and I've learned a whole lot since then.  Well, its not too important on who I am, I had a bunch of different avatars, one of them was one of my emo/goth high school days selfies, everyone started commenting on how I looked like the next school shooter so I changed it lmao.

Maybe that would be true if there was still stuff to buy, but all the new fear mongering by the democrats still wont affect the current empty ammo shelfs and empty gun racks. That's why I always chuckle when hearing, Biden did this or that... or new gun control this or that...spur on a new surge in gun sells. What gun sells?! You need product on the shelves in order to have a \"surge\" in sales. My favorite LGS went out of business a month ago because he had sold out of EVERYTHING, and with no new stock of ANYTHING coming in to replace it, he had to close up shop.

	28856 : ["I think, from the UK perspective, it takes two - horse AND jockey.   And it actually has more to do with the jockey than the horse.    A good jockey, with the advice of his trainer if he's not regularly on that horse, will know whether he has a hold-up horse under him, with the ability to produce a burst of speed during the final couple of furlongs, or one that he has to get out front from the start and hope the horse has the stamina to last to the line. Thinking on this, the UK term would probably be 'a hold-up horse'. Jamie Spencer was/is good at judging a race, coming up from the back of the field.  On the other hand, Frankie Dettori was/is a master at going out front and dictating the pace - provided he had the right horse under him!!", 4490, "iNsBFkZ3aa", 1],

	28867 : ["While looking into this matter further, especially before answering, I found that Eric Guillot sole purpose for using this particular name was NOT at all innocent in nature. It was actually intentional. Definitely a wrong move!  To elaborate further:  Eric Guillot reportedly chose the name \"Grape Soda\" because of a feud with a black TV announcer for TVG network, Ken Rudulph. Eric Guillot, a trainer of 30 years, tweeted on New Year's Day a picture of the horse with the message: “This colt will run next week and has unique name in honour of a TVG analyst.” At the end of the tweet was a black fist emoji.The Jockey Club, who look after the registry of horses in the US, ordered the name be changed and banned him for running a horse with a ‘racist' name. However, in my opinion something like this should have never gotten this far in the first place. Then again, I believe some in the racing industry may not have known that particular name was a racist slur. The problem is Eric Guillot did, and apparently used it as such, which makes this and his behavior unacceptable! I feel The Jockey Club should also bare in responsibility as it's their job to stop this in its tracks so to speak.

As I stated you obviously do not know how to throw a spin kick. This is where a actual instructor is needed. If you knew how than you would not ask. And i am not going into he sequence on the kick.
