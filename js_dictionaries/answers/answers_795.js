To be on the safer side, I'd suggest about 2-3 hours a day of both studying and PRACTICING. I can't emphasise how important that is! Practice, practice, practice. I can promise you that you'll do great with this! :D + You didn't ask but Khan Academy's SAT practice is so useful. Study with that and you're pretty much done.", 6356, "tQt1N0Zzaa", 1],

	44148 : ["No. There's an interview with two state governors on CNN where the governors talk about how there aren't enough tests, and they need more testing before they can open up their states again. They had a conference call with Trump and other governors where they told him this. ", 6358, "cbMTODDZaa", 0],

	44154 : ["The schools are not going to leave all 2020 high school seniors just hanging, canceling exams doesn't mean they won't graduate or get a HS diploma. They and Their parents should be seeking answers. I am sure the schools will inform families of their decision.   ", 6360, "0WASp0bHaa", 1],

Even if they never get a pretty piece of paper (which is all a diploma really is), it won't matter. Every school keeps a copy of a student's official school transcript, and the transcript shows if they graduated and when they graduated. They can get a copy of their transcript, if they need it for employment purposes. Employers are interested in seeing the transcript; they're not interested in seeing a diploma. ANYBODY can have a diploma printed, even if they never graduate;  you can buy one online. A diploma is proof of nothing. Your nieces will probably never even look at their diplomas again, after they get them in their hot little hands. They'll probably just throw them in a drawer and never have reason look at them again.", 6360, "gRZNp2fbaa", -1],
	44157 : ["Online IQ tests are fake, bogus. You need to tested by a professional. People with high IQ still need to be taught.  If you have not had math taught to you, have not had algebra, then your score on precalculus may not be good, even with a high IQ. ", 6353, "0WASp0bHaa", 0],

	44181 : ["It's impossible to tell you what it means because IQ scores are all based on different scales, depending on the test you took. One scale may put you at 130--one may put you at 38. Since you didn't say which test you took, no one can tell you what it means.  Also--scores on IQ tests are not necessarily indicative of intelligence--they are USUALLY indicative of reasoning ability. Although higher-intelligence people often (note the word OFTEN--not ALWAYS) score better in reasoning ability, they don't always--so once again, an IQ score is pretty much subjective and for most people, in every day life, useless. It doesn't indicate how successful you'll be, or how rich, or how much common sense you have.  And by the way--I AM Mensa material. But so what? All it means is I scored well on their entrance exams.

AP exams cost quite a lot of money to take. I have never heard of a HS that  requires students to take the AP exam in May.  But each HS works differently. You do not pass/fail the exam, you get a score 1-5. Most universities require at least score 3 to receive college credits. Many require a score of 4 or 5. Each university is different. Not all universities accept all AP subjects for credit.  And each can varying scores needed for college credit.   Don't take an AP class for the sole reason to earn college credit.

While \"red, white and blue\" is perfectly clear, there may be other phrases in the same paper/story/article/whatever that require the Oxford comma for clarity.
