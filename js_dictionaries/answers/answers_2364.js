I don't invite all the other people to be with me because they are harping about the world or some other thing when I am not able to get out much and I want to have a good time or I want to go to the library when they want to go shopping . I like quiet and they like a lot of drama going on in their lives. We are different people It isn't that I don't like them, we are just different people.IF you attempt to tell them, they will only become butt hurt, and so, I just try to make time for them when I can and make it special and let them know that they are special to me for all the things they do and are in my life, and then I go back to being me. That is the best way I can tell you to do things. But do make a special time for them, an hour that you devote to only them, each of them. It is a pain in the patooty sometimes, but it is worth it in the long run. It allows them to feel special and it lets you off the hook. Make a special day just for the other friends.
