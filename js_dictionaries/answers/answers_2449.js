HYPOTHETICALLY it is possible for you to move at relativistic  speeds in a  thought experiment, but IRL YOU are stationary (You and your location  are stationary) in your  inertial frame of reference, and the light source is  moving  , either toward or away from you, or tangentially, as in your previous question, where I kind of messed up my answer,  but I was trying to make YOU think, rather than spoon feed you the answer. That's exactly what your teacher is trying to by asking the question that way. If you are stationary facing north, and  a light source is moving from east to west., light would be blue shifted  as it moved toward you, There would be NO Doppler shift at the moment the light source  was directly north of you, and the light would be red Doppler shifted as the light source moves west and away from you. Doppler shifts of light are always done by comparing TWO light sources to one another. The laboratory  light source and spectrum  is stationary relative to you, while the astronomical light source is moving toward or away from you so that the light from the moving light source is Doppler shifted when compared to spectrum from the stationary light source.  Your common sense assumptions can be wrong or inaccurate. In science, tiny little details can be very important. Even trained scientists often make assumptions to simplify the math in their mathematical mental model, and that can trip them up. That's why scientists can have \"wake up \" moments when something that has been staring them in the face suddenly becomes glaringly obvious when their PREconceptions or bias or perception suddenly goes completely objective, or they make a serendipitous connection between two seemingly unrelated observations that suddenly click together like puzzle pieces fitting together in their minds. Most people call a moment like that a flash of inspiration. The scientist, after the \"Ah HAH! Eureka!\" moment of pleasure, writes it down or records or logs it  as data point or conclusion, and it becomes part of a science journal article or report presented at scientific conference.", 10976, "None", -1],

It is used for determining the elemental composition of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and for elucidating the chemical structures of molecules, such as peptides and other chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry works by ionizing chemical compounds to generate charged molecules or molecule fragments and measuring their mass-to-charge ratios. In a typical MS procedure a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gas, is ionized. The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles. The signal is processed into the spectra (singular spectrum) of the relative abundance of ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules can be identified by correlating known masses by the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern. :) :)", 10975, "usHYrwozaa", 2],

Similarly it can also be that you are moving away and the light source is stationary. And as the red shift occurs when the distance between the light source and the observer{you} is increased constantly. Therefore if the source is stationary, and you (the detector) are the one moving, you will detect a Doppler Shift. Thank you", 10976, "WQ7U6XdKaa", 1],

Even though you are moving instead of the object, there is still a change in distance occurring. Shifting Rules: Decrease Distance = Decrease Wavelength = Blue Shift  Increase Distance = Increase Wavelength = Red Shift A simple example of this is when a firetruck passes your car.  As it moves toward and then away you notice change in the pitch.  This is doppler effect on the wavelength which is shfting.  The resulting new wavelength is a different frequency. In case, or maybe it will seem to complex, but here is the actual math behind deriving the doppler shift using lambda (the wavelength) and the period of time T. By the way, if you are curious to learn more about waves and how this works, I would suggest looking up the Universal Wave Function.
