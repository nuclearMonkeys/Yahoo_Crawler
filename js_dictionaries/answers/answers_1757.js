I think to effectively deal with your own life, and the people that are intimately involved in it, you have to have a sort of reserve.  I don't have enough patience and understanding to go around if I include everyone I come in contact with, so I just remain polite.  I think that's the best most people can do (without raising their stress levels, blood pressure, and becoming depressed.)  There is a lot of pain in the world. That's just fact.

The word change which he uses is an unknown unless one begins to search for his description of change on the net since television refuses to ask him important questions to which we all deserve the answers. The change I see him guiding us all too is one that will leave America absolutely defenseless and he is planning on bringing known murderers and terrorists  ( which his so called Christian church honors ) to our White House to eat our food and sleep in our beds and to laugh at us from the highest position possible.

	93590 : ["Huh? Havard (US) Cambridge (UK)  Have the best medical schools in the world. Havard has a 7.1% admissions rate whilst Cambridge has a 20-25% admissions rate. The different application systems have led to this discrepancy. In the US, students can apply to whatever university they want, and as many, even if they are not qualified. However, in the UK, each applicant is only allowed to apply 4 or 5 universities, depending on the subject of their choice. So, students who apply to Cambridge think carefully about their choice and are usually all qualified because they do not want to waste a spot. This basically explains the majority of the 13-18% difference. To both these universities people from all over the world apply because they are the best. But to say Americans are leading the way in nobel prizes for medicine and then not give any tangible explaination is silly.
