If they are harassing you on the web site, contain the moderator of the web site.  They will be able to block that person. In spite of what they show you on the TV programs, you can not find a person's physical location through their IP address.  The IP address will only take you as far as whoever their service provider is.  Beyond that you are blocked from finding the actual location of the person, their name, etc.  The ISP is given a block of IP addresses.  Those are handed out as people need them and freed and reused when they disconnect.  So you can not get to a person through through their IP.  The ISP would have to look back in their records and find out who was using that IP at that time.  That takes a court order. Now, the service provider will give you some idea where the person is located.  If the service provider is in San Francisco, for example, odds are the person is also in San Francisco and not in New York or Tampa.  But that is about as close as you can get to them with an IP address.", 7173, "AA11622701", 1],

Also be aware that most summer classes are condensed and require that the students learn the material and do coursework more rapidly. For community colleges, there's less difference, and starting over the summer should be fine.

	51018 : ["Duck is correct. there is NO virus/malware immune OS. The number of viruses that can infect a computer is proportional to how popular that OS is. Windows is the VAST majority of computer (85%+ is all countries) while apple computers have been about 5-8% since the 1990s. Macs are more vulnerable because there is no mac antivirus software so if a mac gets infected they are out of luck. Now stability is a different issue. Mac is generally more stable because there is only a few combinations of hardware that apple has to support. This is more true with the M1 apple devices. Apple already stated that they are going to limit their OS to only work on the M1 class of chips in the near future. Windows is designed to run on BILLIONS of different hardware configurations, so there will obviously be issues with some hardware. ", 7154, "nDJ30tVMaa", 5],

You'll still have students who are mainly there for social reasons, a definite hierarchy of who's cool, all the drama that goes with it, and that kind of thing, often heavily spiced with drugs or alcohol. When you compare that to a college where people live in the dorms and later their own shared apartments or houses, you get a very different experience. Many more are there for an education. Not opposed to having fun or being social animals, but they took out student loans for this and aren't going to waste it.

Likely from having the **** beat out of them by someone like me! Something that reflects the overall experience if not the social scene directly is that in highschool, you have to remember the word for word definition of something out of the textbook. In college, at the upper levels, class looks like discussing the study performed last week that your professor is part of. It's kinda like screaming at the character in a movie to not go down there, but in college, they respond. ", 7157, "u1thfT1aaa", -3],
