I look at it and I see all of those beautiful blue stars in the spiral arms, and I think, what a great place for intelligent life to arise. I previously wrote this comment on this forum, and I got lots of thumbs downs. People said, you can't have life around blue stars! Blue stars are too short-lived to allow life to evolve. True, but we need blue stars to synthesize elements like Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Iron, etc. etc., even Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen! How can we have life without these elements? But it is a fact that Vega is too young and too short-lived to harbor life, unless life came there from somewhere else.  Cheers. ", 7745, "9bab7f0068572ef4366826bbc2c52e30aa", 3],

The average IQ is 100.    There are ranges of IQ with names---although People are getting \"politically correct\" and the tendency has not been to use them---likely out of fear of \"offending\" a potential Voter. or party.

Of course these terms are not used much in public any more as a user would be roasted alive on the altar of political correctness----But in private, Psychologists find this an easy scale to use.----I like the British--they were late to get aboard the PC train--and tend to\" call a spade a spade\"-even their institutions may use these words in their names---like \"Northridge Home for Idiots and Imbeciles\"---quite quaint and amusing.", 7754, "9LmAcLLsaa", 0],

	55719 : ["The short answer is that you might find quite significant differences in structure in the frontal, parietal, and temporal regions of the brain. The reason you might find this would be language. Our development of language is connected to our perception of the world. Some tribes in the Amazon have no concept of numbers ... one, two, three, many is their counting system ... or in Africa some groups would think of time in terms of day and night and seasons. Many words have no literal translation between languages, and grammar structures and tenses can vary substantially. In Irish (Gaelic), for example, there is no real tense for describing 'while' ... so even in English, it's common for an Irish person to say 'he came home, and me eating my dinner' rather than 'he came home while I was eating my dinner'. These differences in language cause structural differences in our brains, so looking at the brains of different 'races' could show differences because of this.", 7763, "BZbvSrwUaa", 2],

You MIL can suggest all the names she wants to.  Politely thank her and name that baby that you pick. Talk to your boyfriend and tell him that you want only him in the delivery room.  You are the boss that day.  Tell him you want him to cut the umbilical cord.  If he doesn't want to, the doc gets to do it.  Talk this over with your doc as well.  Your doc can kick anyone out of the delivery room.  He/she will be fine taking the blame.  Make sure your doc knows you want either your bf or him to cut the cord, no one else.
