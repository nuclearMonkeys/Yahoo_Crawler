	100959 : ["The \"Bride of Christ\", the \"Body of Christ\", and the \"Church of God\" are indeed all the same--the disciples of Christ who are filled with, and led by, the holy spirit.  The reasons that the Church of God can be referred to as the body of Christ now are: * The husband and wife are united in marriage: Matt 19:5 (KJV): And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Matt 19:6 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. * God can call things he has proposed as if they already are: Romans 4:17 (KJV): (as it is written: “I have made thee a father of many nations”), in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which are not, as though they were. However, there is a difference.  After the first resurrection, the Bride is no longer called the \"Church\"; but has become the wife of Christ, and is one with him in the same manner that He is one with God (John 17:22-23)--a spiritual analogy of the union of a fleshly husband and wife. {\"The glory which you have given me [Jesus], I have given to them [the Church of God]; that they may be one, even as we [Jesus and God the Father] are one;\" 23 \"I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.\"} In response to Christiana: The Old Covenant was a marriage covenant between all of Israel and Yahweh God (Not just the Jews, who are only part of Israel).  That marriage was complete at Sini, not to become complete in the future. Jeremiah 3:14 (KJV): Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: ... And in order that Yahweh God become eligible to marry another (the NT Church of God, Spiritual Israel), he had to die: Romans 7:2-3 (KJV): For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. 3  So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. This is (one reason) why the Word of God (Yahweh) became flesh and died, that the previous marriage is broken and he is free to marry another--the chaste virgin, the Church of God (II Corinthians 11:2).", 9763, "AA10052130", 0],

	100969 : ["Concerning Noah being the eighth person, I suppose we could assume that Peter meant that Noah waited until all of his family was on board before he went up the ramp. But what the prophet did, in Genesis 7:11-13, was tell us who, and therefore how many people, actually went into the Ark. He said, \"In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, – In the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, – entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark\" (eight in all). Another very important prophecy is one by Jesus Christ in Matthew 24:37-47. He told us that Noah and the flood was a prophecy of the time just preceding His return, saying, \"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.\" (You might pretend that that servant is a group, or that it could be every christian, but the text itself clearly denies that explanation.) So now we know that Jesus has every intention of appointing a ruler over His household, who will be working at the job when Jesus returns. That is the \"Noah,\" with his seven, for whom we should be watching in response to the admonition of Jesus in verse 37, because that event is one of the major signs of the soon coming of our King. \"Noah\" will be getting a people ready for Him to come. Of course, one must read, and believe the prophecy in Malachi 3:1-6, which declares that God intends to send a man to prepare for the second coming of Jesus, as he did for His first coming. God must do so, for God does not change. In Zechariah chapter four, we are again told of this man which is to come at the end. Concerning the last anointed leader which God will send, He said, \"This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.\" (That is, he will usher in the return of our Lord and King, even as John the Baptist ushered in His first coming.) \"Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.\" (It is in this respect which Noah is called the eighth person: he is in charge.) He is telling us plainly here that God shall send us a man with the \"Doctrine of Christ\" in his hand, whereby he will be able to make the people of God truly upright, and that he will have seven men with him, each of which is wonderfully motivated by one of the Seven Spirits of God, of which we read in chapters 1-3 of The Revelation of Jesus Christ. And why do they rejoice when they see Zerubbabel with his plummet and the seven? It is because the prophesied event shall take place at harvest time, which Jesus said \"is the end of the World.\" When the time of harvest is come, God shall raise up a man, and with him seven Holy Ghost-filled men of vision and wisdom to gather Christianity together as a nation – a kingdom. And Jesus shall come, and take that nation unto Himself, and, sitting upon that throne, He shall conquer, and rule the world, with judgment and with justice, for a thousand years.
