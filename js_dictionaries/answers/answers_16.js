	840 : ["Scientists who study extinctions often ask the question: bad luck or bad genes. So, do large animals have \"bad genes\" or do they merely have bad luck, if they are more likely to become extinct? .But first, we have to decide whether large animals are in fact more likely to become extinct than small animals. Scientific data shows that many small animals have become extinct too.  For example when the dinosaurs were wiped out, a huge number of birds (almost all of them were small)  were also wiped out.  They were classified as enantiornithine birds, also called opposite birds, because their leg bones fuse in the opposite direction as modern, living birds. Not a single species of living bird is an enantiornithine bird. All of the ancient enantiornithine birds were wiped out, and yet none of them was as big as an ostrich.  Therefore large animals do not seem to be any more likely to become extinct than small animals. Further, lots of small dinosaurs had become extinct during the age of dinosaurs, long before the giant meteor struck. Compsognathus and SInosauropteryx were small dinosaurs but they were extinct for tens of millions of years before the end of the Cretaceous. The ancestors of T. rex and Triceratops were smaller but they were also extinct before the meteor struck.  So, it would appear that small dinosaurs did not necessarily have better genes than large ones.  May be they simply had bad luck.  Animals that survived the end of Cretaceous extinction include sea turtles, the largest species of turtles. Also crocodilians survived, and they are not small either. It is true that a whole bunch of large mammals because extinct 13,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, but again, it is not because they were large, but because they were large mammals and because they were living in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lots of large mammals, such as the African and Asian elephants, the rhino, the hippo, and the giraffe survived.  In fact, mammals like horses and camels became extinct in North America but they survived in Asia and Africa.  If size was not the reason animals became extinct, then we must look for reasons why they did become extinct. For dinosaurs and enantiornithine birds, they became extinct because they were living in the wrong place at the wrong time. 65 million years ago, a giant meteor struck the earth at high speed and it resulted in oven-like temperatures on land,. The heat instantly wiped out 100% of the dinosaurs, enantinorithine birds and all marsupial mammals that were living above ground, but because heat rises, small animals that spent a lot of time below the ground (e,g,  shrews, toads, snakes, lizards, salamanders) survived. Another group of animals survived because they live in or near the water (e..g. turtles, crocodilians, frogs, shorebirds, platypus), because water takes a lot of energy to warm up just a few degrees.  So, size was not a critical factor but location was more important as to who survived and who did not.  13,000 years ago, there was an abrupt rise in global temperatures when the last ice age was ended by a small comet hitting North America. Temperatures in North America and nearby Europe increased so much that it killed a lot of large mammals. Because mammals generate their own body heat, a heat wave can kill them if they cannot get rid of the excess body heat quickly enough to avoid heat stroke). Because the temperature increase was more local, large mammals in Africa and Asia that are about the same size as those in North America were able to survive. Elephants are larger than camels and horses, and yet camels and horses that lived in North America were wiped out but elephants that lived in Africa were not. So, it is simply bad luck (being the wrong kind of animals physiologically at the wrong place and at the wrong time) that many animals (regardless of size) were wiped out. As for giant snakes, they are reptiles and reptiles depend on the environment for body heat. When the climate cools, as it did 35 million years ago when Antarctica froze for the very first time, the giant reptiles simply could not stay warm enough because their small body surface to volume ratio makes it hard to gain heat from the environment. The same thing happened at the end of the Jurassic, a large number of large dinosaurs and pterosaurs became extinct when the climate suddenly cooled drastically. The earth warmed up again in the Cretaceous, and large dinosaurs like T. rex and Triceratops evolved near the end of the Cretaceous. Unfortunately for them, bad luck soon wiped them out when the giant meteor struck the earth at the end of the Cretaceous. The meteor impact was so devastating that lots of insects were wiped out too. Insects are anything but large but their small size could not save them because they lived above ground. Some people think that mostly large animals were wiped out at the end of the Cretaceous. They are of course incorrect. Just because museums mostly show large extinct species (because they fascinate the public more) does not mean that large ones are more likely to become extinct. ", 138, "None", 0],

	849 : ["It is to begin with as it takes a good few hours of practice to change gears smoothly and without conscious thought.  It also can take a good few hours to build up the leg muscles just a little bit so that your left leg and foot no longer aches if you're driving in urban traffic where you make lots of gear changes. The skill of gear changing is fairly straightforward, but the skill of knowing how to find the clutch biting point which is essential for hill starts and how to slip the clutch in first and reverse gears for low speed control is the more difficult bit (low speed control is using the clutch, not the gas pedal: totally different to an automatic). It's also a skill which takes a couple of years of  regular usage to ensure that it becomes as instinctive as riding a bicycle. By that I mean that after a couple of years of consolidating that skill you'd have a good chance of picking it up again very quickly if you then drove an automatic for a couple of years.  I'm often amazed at how poor and unsafe North American standards of manual transmission professional tuition are. Too many driving schools teach students to coast to a stop in neutral, to change down a gear during cornering instead of selecting the correct gear before entering the corner and then choosing the correct one as the car accelerates out of it. Engine braking during hill descents but also when decelerating to a stop is also often not properly taught, if at all. Failing to do any of that properly in places like Europe, Australia, NZ, Japan, or Russia would cause a candidate to fail their driving test. I also see too many North American drivers who “ride the clutch” by resting their left foot against it: even a tiny amount of foot pressure can halve the lifespan of a clutch assembly. Driving manual is a skill which is decreasingly important. Even here in the UK and Europe, automatics now dominate new car sales. Also, all hybrids have automatic transmission and electrics usually need no gearbox at all. If you visit other parts of the world then even in fairly remote places you can now usually rent an automatic if you book well in advance. Modern computer assisted automatics get better fuel economy, produce lower emissions, and are *much* cheaper to maintain as they don't need a horribly expensive periodic clutch replacement: the cost of that has vastly increased in the last decade or so as increasing numbers of manual cars now use dual-mass flywheels which are very expensive and often found to need replacing during a clutch change. DMFs push the typical price of a clutch change up from around £300 to over £1000.", 103, "gjUpsUZAaa", 1],
