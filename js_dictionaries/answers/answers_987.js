We buried Rusty our dog 3 feet deep at the bottom of our garden by the pond. I remember like it was only yesterday Â picking out the bluebell bulbs and putting them in a pot. I wrapped him in his favourite blanket and gently lowered him to rest. It was October, cold nights were here but he wouldn't feel them. Nothing could bring him back, nothing would ever replace him we both knew this, I filled the hole and replanted the bulbs. The following year looking out of the window we could see the bluebells they were all over the garden but the ones that we were drawn to were the cluster at the bottom of our garden next to the pond.

Weary and tired of all her problems, she decided to run away. Far, far, far from all that dasterdly hay. Grumpy, lonely and frozen she sat there all alone. She could hear the predators yearn for her juicey loin. She cried: \"Mamma, I don't wanna end up like bacon!\" But how could she? She was not a swine, so she hid up in the tallest pine. Up in the tree, it started to wobble and she felt the needles deep into her raw hide. She looked at the beautiful stars in the sky. \"I wonder if I can reach one of them\", she said and gave it a try. On the head she fell, the last thing she heard was her bell.
