	98903 : ["The mystery's of faith an GOD are beyond human comprehension. Faith concerns questions which cannot be settled by evidence. How can the universe create itself out of nothingness? Given the fact that the universe began to exist, it must have had a “cause” that originated it.Doesn't it make more sense to assume the existence of a Creation. The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be. The answer is that the question does not even make sense. It is like asking, “What does blue smell like?” Blue is not in the category of things that have a smell, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created or caused. God is uncaused and uncreated—He simply exists. We know that from nothing, nothing comes. So, if there were ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence, then nothing would have ever come into existence. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been in existence. That ever-existing thing is what we call God. God is the uncaused Being that caused everything else to come into existence. God is the uncreated Creator who created the universe and everything in it.

They seem very different from each other. If I am understanding this correctly, if you have worm type 1 it did not come from a pet and if you have worm type 2 it could come from a pet or from a liter box.  Hope this helps and Happy New Year to you, too and to your new family coming in the new year.  What are pinworms? (thread-like parasitic round worms) Pinworms are a type of parasite that lives in the digestive system of humans. They are common throughout the world, especially in school-age children. Adult pinworms look like small, white threads that are no more than 0.5 in. long. You need a microscope to see the eggs.  What causes pinworms?  Most people get pinworms by swallowing the worms eggs. This happens when someone with pinworms scratches around the anus, gets eggs on his or her hands (or under the fingernails), and touches you or a surface that you later touch. Then when you put your hand in your mouth, the eggs go through your mouth to your stomach and then to your rectal area.  The eggs turn into worms in about a month. A pinworm crawls out of the body during the night and lays eggs on the skin around the anus. The wiggling motion when the worm lays eggs may irritate the skin and cause itching. Pinworms spread easily in families, day care centers, schools, camps, and other places where groups of people live. If one person in your family has pinworms, others probably do too. Pinworm infections can happen to anyone. They are not related to being unclean. What are the symptoms?  The most common sign of pinworms is itching around the anus. Many people with pinworm infections have no symptoms and may never be aware of the infection. In rare cases, itching becomes severe and may cause restless sleep, loss of appetite, and anxiety. Pinworms don't usually cause serious health problems, and they do not carry disease. But it is possible to get a skin infection from scratching around the anus.  The incubation periodthe time from first contact with eggs until symptoms appearis usually 1 to 2 months or longer. There is no way to find a pinworm infection until symptoms appear. How are pinworms diagnosed?  Your doctor can find out if you have a pinworm infection by asking about your past health and checking the skin around your anus. He or she may ask you to collect a sample from around the anus by using a piece of clear, sticky tape. This piece of tape will be put under a microscope to look for pinworm eggs. How are they treated?  You can treat pinworm infections with over-the-counter and prescription medicines. These medicines can help keep you from getting infected again and from spreading pinworms to other people.  How do you keep from spreading pinworms or getting them again?  To limit the chances of getting pinworms or of spreading them to others:  Wash your hands carefully and often.  Avoid scratching around your anus.  Keep your fingernails short.  Wash clothes and bedding regularly.  Bathe and change your underwear every day.  If family members get pinworms again, all family members will need to take medicine to kill pinworms.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Pet to People Worms  by Dr. Howard A. Mintzer  We are often asked whether people can get worms from their pets. The answer is....yes. And the problem is more common and can be more dangerous than you think!  What Kind of Worms Do Pets Carry and What Diseases do they Cause in Humans?  The most common worms that can be transmitted from dogs and cats to people all have fancy scientific names like Toxocara cati and Diplydium caninum but you can just remember them as roundworms, hookworms and tapeworms.  Tapeworms that we catch live in our intestines, eat our food and pass little white rice-like segments out of our rear end. As unattractive as it is to see one of these worms squiggling out of the hind end of your cat, it is much more disgusting to find it in your child's diaper! Hookworms burrow under the skin and cause itchy rashes and a disease unappetizingly called \"creeping eruptions\". The most dangerous of these parasites is the roundworm. Roundworms cause \"Visceral Larval Migrans\" a condition in which immature roundworms (larvae) migrate through the body. Ten thousand cases of VLM are diagnosed in the United States each year. Most of the time the condition causes little if any illness. However, in approximately 750 cases a year the parasite migrates through a person's brain or eyes causing brain damage or blindness.  How do People Get These Worms?  Children are the main \"people\" who get worms although adults are also at risk. Children get tapeworms when they kiss their pets and accidentally swallow a flea. Hookworms can burrow through the skin. Children who walk barefoot or sunbathers who lie on ground that is infested with hookworm eggs acquire these parasites directly through their skin. Roundworm infection occurs by eating the actual worm eggs. Children who make mud pies, get their hands dirty in contaminated soil or crawl over and play in a litter box and then put their hands into their mouths become infected.", 9678, "ym1YnnyCaa", 0],
