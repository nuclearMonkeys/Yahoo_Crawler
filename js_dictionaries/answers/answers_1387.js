	74953 : ["Of course.  The Supreme Court is supposed to be as apolitical as possible and doing anything in reaction to presidential opinion is being some manner of political.  They can hold their own views but never, ever, express them in such a way as to potentially compromise the public's faith in the judiciary.", 8789, "1l69CCScaa", 0],
	74954 : ["We have a complete seperation of powers in the USA.   The Executive branch works with the Judicial branch and both work with the Legislative branch.      The only thing that keeps our government from falling apart is the voluntary co-operation of the 3 branches.   I don't know if non-attendance by any part of the 3 branches would deal a death-blow to the United States, but I would hope that everyone would at least try to look like they are cooperating. What do you think?", 8789, "aFq0Og2daa", 0],
	74955 : ["Beauty is a relative matter and what one person finds beautiful another will find repulsive. Self-esteem affects every aspect of your life so if you have low self esteem you will probably perceive everyone else as beautiful and yourself as ugly. A person who is physically attractive and KNOWS it has a high self esteem, someone who thinks they are ugly - in spite of being told the contrary - has low self esteem.", 8788, "VGlxxd86aa", 0],
	74956 : ["Yes, just look at what kids are doing these days because of getting bullied.   If it happens and happens frequently, it will have  BIG effect on your self-esteem.", 8788, "y4aoCvulaa", 0],
	74957 : ["Of course it does!!!!  bullying is a big deal, kids commit suicide and develop serious self esteem problems because not enough is done about it.", 8788, "LNLkUXq0aa", 3],
	74958 : ["Maybe.  Why not take the time to listen to him, maybe you will learn something.", 8786, "nub4fUJLaa", 1],
	74959 : ["Great question. You'd think something that BIG would have supporting written evidence from other civilisations in the area at the time. I doubt something like the Red Sea being parted, and STAYING parted for days while 2 million people peasants walked or 'ran' across the soggy silt, would escape the notice of whoever in the area who had 'civilisation'. ~", 8786, "None", 1],
	74960 : ["See the ipuwar papyrus in Leiden. After all the destruction and mayhem that preceded the parting of the sea and the event itself, there likely weren't very many left to record anything.  It is noted that Egypt entered into a bit of a Dark Age right around the time the Exodus took place....it there any wonder if a high percentage of the population, including most of the army was destroyed and the country emptied of its wealth?", 8786, "AA11710118", 1],
	74961 : ["It's the Reed Sea (Sea of Reeds). So you won't find anything about the Red Sea being parted. I don't think you'll find that Ramses II perished in a chariot either. Personally I don't think Ramses is the best candidate, he's just the one who fits the \"accepted\" chronology. But if the \"accepted\" chronology can't even get the name of the body of water right, why should I trust their dates? (Always these people trying to FIND the story instead of UNDERSTAND the story... waste of time...) Peace to you.", 8786, "bNgMvy9gaa", 2],
	74962 : ["Yes, I read it on Yahoo! Maktoob that he was killed in Yemen. I guess it was you who somedays ago asked a question regarding him. May Allah (SWT) give him Jannah! Ameen! @day day:- May Allah (SWT) give him Jannatul Firdous. Points are like money for many of us :)", 8787, "1n4Mgl4baa", 2],
	74963 : ["This animal was an agent of chaos, leading uneducated people into a war they don't understand for reasons they can't comprehend to die for a cause that he certainly wasn't ready to die for.  Good riddance, may he rot in Hell.", 8787, "None", -2],
	74964 : ["O really this is sad i loved him for the sake of allah hes not dead since when? I really really admire him may allah take him to the highest of heavens. ps kels  it was me who asked about him and my question got deleted and i lost some points :(", 8787, "None", 1],
	74965 : ["WTH!! U JUST BROKE THE SAD NEWS TO ME. THIS IS FROM THE FATE OF ALLAH. WE BELONG TO ALLAH AND TO HIM WE WILL RETURN. INSHALLAH HE WILL BE GRANTED JANNAH AL-FIRDOUS. MAY ALLAH FORGIVE HIM, AND BLESS HIM, AND PROTECT HIM FROM THE HELL FIRE.", 8787, "iy6Fv4ykaa", 1],

	74969 : ["\"The Afghan militias have NEVER lost a war\" - Not True And no one had ever landed a man on the moon either so does that mean no one should try or it is impossible? And if you think we will have troops out of A-stan anytime soon (i.e. like in the next 50 years) you are either blind or ignorant.  The military KNOWS that it will take a generation or more for them to be able to function on their own...just like Korea", 8783, "None", 2],
	74970 : ["Probably gonna go on for a while, insurgencies are tricky since our ROE is really limiting and they don't use conventional tactics. Hey yeah I'm on the same boat with you, I'm planning on reuping myself, probably sometime next year after I spent a little more time with the missus.", 8783, "ofASom80aa", 2],
	74971 : ["Nanny Pelosi is loco.   Just like Janet Napolitano now calling the war on terrorism,\"Man-Caused Disasters\".", 8785, "lJHVi1J4aa", 7],
	74972 : ["She is a traitor.   Why don't these illegals stand up to the thugs in their own home country if they are such heros?", 8785, "gMBWqtR9aa", 4],
	74973 : ["Nancy Pelosi is an IDIOT - So are the people from California that keeps electing this witch.", 8785, "57fbb9da33f2c677b05957f815062f52aa", 8],
	74974 : ["Great info, but you forgot to mention that she is the first and only speaker of the house to demand and get, a private jet for her commutes to and from DC and California, extended range at that, because having to stop to refuel would demean her oh, so important image. So much for her desire to stop squandering taxpayers money.", 8785, "BIQrsl4paa", 5],

	74977 : ["Taj Mahal", 8784, "None", 1],
	74978 : ["They are supposed to be apolitical, so it's a bit strange for them to go.  But I guess it's up to them.  I don't think Obama was disrespectful.  He simply said that he disagreed with the decision and asked Congress to fix it.", 8789, "None", 0],
	74979 : ["Bully them, Chicago mob style.", 8789, "None", -1],
	74980 : ["President Obama is not wrong for voicing his opinion of the Supreme Court decision on campaign financing laws.  It's not that he criticized the Supreme Court that bothers me, it's the venue in which he chose to do it.  Rather than doing it at the State of the Union, it would have been more appropriate to have done it in a press conference, or in a statement released to the press.", 8789, "Nejnh1Bqaa", 1],
	74981 : ["Yes because your very subjective at that time. It would lower your self esteem and would continue on to adult hood since what your exposed to atchildhood really does dictate a lot of aspects of your personality", 8788, "ma4otpwTaa", 0],
	74982 : ["Definitely!", 8788, "None", 0],
	74983 : ["yes and I think more so in middle school than elementary school. because kids that young are more than likely to brush it off people start getting all paranoid schizo in middle school.", 8788, "W8JWPuwuaa", 1],

	74985 : ["I like this question; but there is historical evidence that they tried to wipe out evidence of things that the newest Pharoah didn't want remembered.  (i.e., Akhenaton and Hatshepsut) There is some evidence for a Moses-type figure named Thuthmoses (\"moses\" only means \"son of\" and is not a complete name) who may have been a renegade priest of Akhenaton's, and thus supported monotheism.", 8786, "None", 4],
	74986 : ["How could you trust those guys when every last bit of evidence that they existed is gone?   there are no pyramids, no sphinx, no obelisk, no statues, no history!  you are grasping at straws!   look at all the evidence the Bible is true.  there is the Bible and.....the New Testament.....and the Old Testament.  Not to mention the Torah, the Pentateuch and the Bible.  You're silly.", 8786, "9CG362bIaa", 2],

	74989 : ["The ACLU will defend a token Christian or two, but that's just window dressing. The purpose of the ACLU is to break down American ideals and replace them with communist ideals. Everyone knows the ACLU is not for American civil Liberties, they certainly would not defend mine.  Things would go a lot easier if the ACLU and CAIR were disbanded and defunded. Yes, we pay for the ACLU to chisel away our basic freedoms. The ACLU is all for anything against America, and that's the only reason they protect terrorists, and have a fit when a terrorist is on trial, punished, or threatened with extermination.", 8787, "None", -3],

	74992 : ["She is even more of a communist than Obama. She is drunk on her own power and doesn't care a thing about the working people. I think she would look good in a coat of tar and feathers. But we really can't expect too much of her. After her,she's from San Fagcisco", 8785, "None", 2],
	74993 : ["Oh boy.......my friend I hope you are not a Christian, because willful ignorance is the same as lying.  I must say, it is kind of sad that you think people on an anonymous website wouldn't check your facts.  If you want the short version click on the second link, if you want the long version, click the first one. Both expose this as a internet chain letter. not the best place to get your politics.", 8785, "None", -1],
	74994 : ["Give her time, she's gonna get even worse.  She is just another corrupt politician in a position of power who uses her influence for personal financial gain. This is just the tip of the iceberg.", 8785, "399be115381734eda49e566fc563731aaa", 2],

	74997 : ["Can you blame them, after he publicly bashed them and disrespected their position in government (which is equal to his own in balance of power, according to the Constitution) during his last state of the union address? I think they are just returning the favor. Disrespect begets disrespect. When you treat someone with disrespect, their natural reaction is to lose respect for you as well. If the President wants respect, he should learn to dish it out....especially to those who are his equals in power and who even hold the authority to sign out of existence any legislation he signs into law. And...I might add...I'm not sure YOU would be inclined to attend a (voluntary attendance) event in which you could expect to be publicly bashed, humiliated, and disrespected, for no valid reason - while the entire nation is watching - either.", 8789, "WWY7Iy4iaa", 0],
	74998 : ["Plain and simple.  0bama thinks he has more power and control that what he has.  he feels superior to the constitution.   He is also frustrated that an old piece of paper, the Constitution, stands in his way to obtain his socialist utopia.  He is angered that a system of checks and balances has slapped his utopia agenda right in the face.  So he lashes out and that does not set very well with logical thinking people.  This sorry lying deceitful twerp is not getting his second term.  he is going to loose his super majority this fall too.   He needs to resign just like Nixon did. .", 8789, "None", 0],
