	44923 : ["I have no idea what the huge problem is with the teacher. I don't think the teacher did much (if anything) wrong. Yes, you need to help your child, but that means contacting the counselors and seeing what can be done. And then notifying the teacher that the school has decided that the student needs to come in a couple minutes late. From a teacher perspective, just imagine that a student shows up late everyday and you have no idea that anything is going on. The teacher would obviously just think the student is being late because they are lazy and disrespectful. Solve the problem, don't make it worse by accusing the teachers of things that they haven't done or have not been provided any information on.", 6460, "f3d506f1430fab32d23ae661f4553e41aa", 3],

	44925 : ["You should have a conversation with the teacher first. There's 2 sides to every story, and the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. If your son is being called lazy, there's probably some truth to it. He doesn't get to be late to class every day just because some kids are mean to him. He could just wait in the hallway and walk into class when the teacher arrives. You can let the teacher know what's going on, but I have a feeling your son isn't the perfect angel you think he is. There's probably some fault on both sides.  Your son needs help. If he's depressed, get him some mental health treatment. At least have him talk to the school counselor. You also need to teach him to stand up for himself. Reporting it to the school may just make things worse. There's bullies in every stage of life, and once he's out of high school, he won't have the school to protect him. It's better for him to learn how to handle it now. Teach him some fighting and self defense moves, and teach him how to respond to mean kids. When he's an adult in the real world, he's not gonna get much sympathy if he shows up late to work every day because his coworkers are mean to him. Part of being a kid is learning how to handle social situations. He won't always have his parents or a school to come to his rescue. Babying him isn't doing him any favors. Your son is 17. He's almost grown. He needs to learn how to handle tough situations without breaking the rules and expecting special treatment. When a kid is consistently late to class, teachers generally don't think to ask if something is wrong. They assume he's like all the other kids that are late to class. You seem to have blinders on when it comes to your son. Get him some real help instead of blaming his teachers for expecting him to follow basic rules. ", 6460, "None", 3],

	44929 : ["There is no right answer to the question. Someone who might fall back on the logic that humans are inherently animals might say that once a person has chosen a mate, that relationship supersedes all blood relationships save that of parent and child, i.e.: a person's duty to one's spouse takes precedence over one's duty to a parent, sibling, or any other relation. The only exception to this would be if the choice was between one's spouse and one's child. In the animal kingdom, during lean times, animals might resort to eating their young because while it's possible to have more offspring, it's not as easy to replace a mate. But most humans would see it the opposite way - your child is your top priority. We must defend our children, no ands ifs, or buts about it.   Your question implies that a person in a very traumatic situation might somehow be capable of weighing options and arriving at a conclusion using logic. It's not true. Practically anyone in such a situation would have barely a nanosecond to act, and the person's actions would more than likely be based on nothing but sheer instinct. A person who has been in a loving marriage for 15 years who sees his sister twice a year on holidays probably wouldn't grapple with the decision to save his wife. But a person who has been married for 15 months who has no other siblings besides the one sister might - if they two shared a close bond, be more inclined to save his sister and later rationalize that by saying \"Well, I only have one sister and I can always find another wife.\"  In either case, a human life is spared and a person dies. Saving your wife and letting your sister die would leave a person wondering for the rest of his life whether or not he made the right decision. But saving your sister and allowing your wife to die would leave one with the same trauma and the same burning question: \"Did I make the right choice?\"  As for me personally, my wife is the mother of my children. I love my sister deeply and in my father's absence it is my duty to protect her. My relationship with my sister was once so close that I felt her husband ought to defer to me, but now my sister and I both have kids of our own, and my personal family unit of which I am the head - the breadwinner, the great defender, takes top priority, over everything and everyone.  When I married my wife I promised to always be there for her. My sister is a grown woman and she has a husband to protect her. My duty is to the person to whom I pledged my heart, who has birthed my children.  That is the choice that I would make in that short window of time, but I can tell you one thing: The man who took my sister from me would pay dearly for that. He would be begging for a speedy death by asphyxiation long before I was even halfway done with him.  ", 6465, "None", 1],

	44937 : ["Yes! In general, I realized a lot of the health advice (physical and mental) I learnt was wrong now that I am pursuing a science degree. A few examples:  1. \"Natural sugars are healthier for you.\" Not true. They are actually the same as unnatural sugars and your body cannot decipher the difference, it is only an ethical choice whether you prefer \"natural\" or unnatural.  2. Same with vitamins. \"Naturally sourced\" vitamins of any kind are the exact same as ones synthesized in the lab in supplement form.  3. Another example I remember learning is that 100% fruit juice is healthy for you. In fact, one cup of 100% fruit juice contains nearly the daily limit of sugar for average adult women (about 25g), and all the main healthy components of fruit are transferred into the juice. 4. Also, you don't need dairy at all yet they taught me that you needed a few servings of it a day. You can get all the calcium and vitamins and minerals found in dairy in fruits and vegetables. In fact, the vitamin D in milk is added and doesn't even occur naturally in milk. Plus the hormones in dairy can conflict with human hormones so it is not actually the best idea to have dairy every day. I still do because I like the taste and my body doesn't react to it, but a lot of other people are dairy sensitive and shouldn't have it. 5. You should \"do what makes you happy.\" Studies actually show that at the end of your life, old people always claim that their happiness comes from quality relationships. Those who prioritized career, success, and their personal goals and aspirations over relationships reported feeling unhappy in the end, unless they achieved quality relationships alongside. So, it is actually equally important to do what makes others happy, at least those who matter to you, who you want to maintain relationship with. Living your life for yourself and neglecting the needs of those who matter to you will leave you empty. Sometimes you have to give up what makes you happy to keep harmony in your relationships and achieve life satisfaction in the end, like giving up your dream job in order to maintain a healthier \"home life\" for your family. On your deathbed, its your family you'll be thankful for, not your job or individual success. Humans were made for relationship, its what makes us happy. North American society preaches way too many individualistic messages that are straight-up recipes for depression.", 6467, "OiKc9JWMaa", 3],
