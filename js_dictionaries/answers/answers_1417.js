	76465 : ["\"It's like there are a lot of feminists out there who are saying in essence, women have a right to use their bodies as they see fit...unless they are sluts.\" I was waiting for you to make a valid argument, but you completely blew it with that statement, because that could not be farther from the truth. No, fella.  Feminism absolutely supports a woman's choice to be promiscuous. We fought for the pill, partly to become sexually liberated. It's the Right Wing, anti-feminists who try to maintain the good girl bad girl dichotomy, not feminists. Try again. Steve: Social movements are made up of people , but people are not tenets or ideologies. Feminism isn't a  based on the words of some woman on Yahoo Answers; please don't be silly. Feminism is an ideology comprised of abstractions, theories and philosophies. As with ANY social movement, divergence happens among followers, however the core beliefs of feminism have stayed intact.  Divergence doesn't mean the movement was never valid. It doesn't mean that it's followers are confused or wrong. It means that the process of cultural evolution often makes it difficult for everyone to be on the same page at all times.  If you want your question to be taken seriously, start by telling the truth. Edit: Seriously though, Steve I was open to hearing an academic approach, but you basically just said \"feminists make hookers feel bad, so they are teh prudes just like Puritans!!!\"  How anti-intellectual can you be? If you understood the context that the anti-porn crusaders based their arguments upon, maybe you'd see why it doesn't work, but even as a Devil's Advocate I could do better than that... Edit: Ok, I'm off, but you're utterly clueless and sadly passive-aggressive. \"This is exactly the kind of moral righteousness I'm talking about--it's not always sexual. It's the moral righteousness that I see as inherently Puritan.\" Oh BOOHOO. Moralizing plays NO part in the feminist movement. It's only in the minds of defensive and ill-informed anti-feminists that this is true. At no time did you give a valid example of where that exists. You say feminists are morally \"righteous\" because someone on the internet zinged you and that simple action validates your theory about something so complex? Get a grip and an education.", 8852, "None", -2],
	76466 : ["I haven't notice feminists abstaining from sex (if that's what you're talking about) anymore so than anyone else.  After all, feminism is all about the freedom to make choices. As for Puritanism, if a woman chooses to abstain perhaps its because she values herself & and wants to be 'pure' for her husband.

I have to admit I dislike hip hop, but I don't hate it because it's still music, and a real music lover likes anything with a beat I guess... I think that hip hop and rock are against each other because of racism, because most hip hop 'singers' are black, and most rockers are white, with some exceptions, like Eminem, and the black rocker guy whose name I don't know Ohh and the reason why I dislike hip hop is because I think they have no talent, because most of their songs are just talk-like, no singing at all...  I do know that some rock songs are all screaming and that makes no sense, but most rock songs have beautiful meaning no matter what the instrumental, and the singers can sing (I don't know if hip hop songs have meaning because I have never listened to them, because they don't sing at all)", 8845, "cnrJGrD9aa", -6],

The only negative thing I'd have too say about hip-hop is just when I start to get into a cool break that I know and love, it's over and on to the next. Sometimes I'd like to hear more than a 20 second snippet. Oh well! I partied with Kool Herc awhile back, and loaned him several LP's for one of his shows. For those of you who don't know, Kool Herc is THE founding Father of the hip-hop genre.

Its basis is the political awareness that there are uneven power structures between groups, along with the belief that something should be done about it. There are many forms of feminism... Feminism has been principally a movement within the Western societies in the 20th Century. Some limited advances have been made in some non-Western countries; but the movement has been principally Western in origin and effects... Feminist history in the United States In the United States, this view had begun to evolve by the 1830s. Early feminists active in the abolition movement began to increasingly compare women's situation with the plight of African American slaves. This new polemic squarely blamed men for all the restrictions of women's role, and argued that the relationship between the sexes was one-sided, controlling and oppressive. Most of the early women's advocates were Christians, especially Quakers. It started with Lucretia Mott's involvement as one of the first women to join the Quaker abolitionist men in the abolitionist movement. The result was that Quaker women like Lucretia Mott learned how to organize and pull the levers of representative government. Starting in the mid-1830s, they decided to use those skills for women's advocacy. It was those early Quaker women who taught other women their advocacy skills, and for the first time used these skills for women's advocacy. \"", 8852, "None", -5],
