I doubt it.  At the age of 7yrs simple addition and subtraction is all he should be able to do. Furthermore , does he understand that 'difference' can mean 'subtraction/take-away' in maths.    So I would not accuse him of being 'dumb' . If he can't do it by 11yrs. of age them he either doesn't know how to do it nor has he been taught properly.", 525, "0cc349e5b23bb03a0dcb7d4307ba36b0aa", 1],
