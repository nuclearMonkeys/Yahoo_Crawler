Won't kill them or even permanently injure them IF you keep them quiet and do the anti-inflammatories and don't make it worse by over-nutrition which makes the growth rate even more rapid. . They are miserable, lame, limping, achey, off their food....It can move from one leg to the other, different long bones get hit at different times.... They eventually grow out of it but it can go on for 6-8 months. Now in breeds that get pano, you MUST cut back on the nutriiton with these puppies to avoid the excessive growth that can trigger pano. Lost the large breed puppy food at 6-8 months. Switch them to a top quality adult large breed.", 10106, "iTx4mxOvaa", 0],

However, if you make a fake facebook account and your real name is Bob Smith and you put your name as, Steve Jacobson on your fake account and you use it as such, be careful because people can report you and when the authorities get involved and see that \"Steve Jacobson\" is really \"Bob Smith\", you can get in trouble for fraud.  Having a fake account is not illegal, but using it to talk to people and trying to meet people or sell stuff using the fake profile can get you into trouble.  The facebook terms of use talk about how it is illegal to misrepresent yourself as someone else which is true, but if you just make a fake account so you can add people who you wouldn't want to add under your real profile just so you can see what they are up to and look at their pictures and stuff is okay. There are a lot of people who make fake or \"dummy\" facebook accounts so that they can set up their business facebook page for example.  The owner may not want a facebook profile, but wants to have his or her business on facebook, so he or she will make a \"fake\" or \"dummy\" profile so that he can set up his or her account for his business.", 10105, "None", 0],
