	14312 : ["First of all, plan your meals, and do so before you start your shopping. Check your sale ads (pretty much all are available online these days) and plan your menus around what's on sale. Recognize that buying in bulk can be cheaper in the long run if you can manage it. A family pack of ground beef can be 20-50 cents cheaper per pound than a single pound package is, so buy it in the bigger package, divide it up at home and freeze what you aren't going to use right away.  If you have $200 for a months worth of groceries, that's about $50 a week. While that's not a lot of budget, it's very manageable for a single person. You aren't going to eat fancy food, and if that's your total food budget for the month you don't have much wiggle room for splurges, like eating out, fancy coffees, or drinks with friends. But from a grocery standpoint, there are lots of cheaper eating options available to you. You can make things in larger quantities and either eat for several days, or freeze smaller portions and thaw and reheat later in the month. Meat is expensive, but other protein sources like eggs aren't. You can get a dozen eggs and a loaf of bread for less than $5 total, and that covers your breakfasts for a week or longer. Dried beans and rice are cheap, and last a long time. Cooking them is fairly simple and you can jazz up the flavor with spices and seasonings. Again, spices can be kind of expensive as an upfront purchase, but they should last you for quite some time. Learn things like how to roast a whole chicken. Whole chickens are usually less than $1/pound (compare to chicken breasts which can be $4/pound), so you can roast one, eat part of it that day, pick the meat off the bones and use it for sandwiches, chicken salad, pot pie, or a stew. You can boil the bones with some veggies and make chicken stock for soup.  And pay attention to what you are spending your money on. Convenience foods and prepared things are much more expensive than doing it yourself. And drinking anything other than tap water is probably costing you more than you realize.", 2393, "KESlvKqQaa", 2],

Amen\"; release the fingers; hand down by ur side); u bow down on ur knees (knees together), then put hands on the floor just touching each other, then forehead on top of backofhands; as soon as ur forehead touches the back of hands, get up super fast showing allegiance to Christ (and not the devil). do 2000 times during the night against witches. 'cuz witches work hard for satan (by praying like three hours); you have to show them respect by outworking them; u feel me? but of course when u tired u could pray the Jesus prayer at least three times every hour (don't sleep 4 more than 1 hour; wake up and pray the Jesus prayer three times; then u can rest a little bit; in case witches pray real hard to satan, then u have to pray to Jesus as many times as possible); thank u; forgive me rudeness.", 2397, "None", -2],

I'm still more creative than most people in my world, but I feel like I'm holding onto a shadow of what I once had. I am not as creative as I was. I believed in magic! I believed in   Claus! Not just that, but people were fun. They were more creative and (at least I felt like) they really wanted to be around me and not just for a good time like drinking and partying, but with an aim to truly build long-lasting friendships. I could inspire people to cross into their imaginations and build castles and great empires! Now whenever I even suggest doing something fun, going here or going there, building this or reading that people aren't just disinterested.. They're annoyed at me. But I got to tell you... My childhood was never fun because I went to amusement parks or went on water rides. It was fun because I went through the forest in my back yard. It was fun because I climbed trees and took my bike along the streets of my neighborhood. What's this about you miss going on the boardwalk and the beach? You're an adult, save the money and go to the beach. Since you're the master of your own life as an adult, you can save the money and the power you need to go to the beach if you want. How does a beach make childhood fun? The beach is fun because the beach if fun. For any age, not just little kids. Geesh I think you don't understand what makes childhood fun. The lack of responsibility makes chidhood fun. (And also boring.) The fact that as a kid you can explore, learn and grow without fear of paying bills makes childhood fun. It is the element of wonder, hope, excitement and energy that makes childhood fun. Not the landmarks like water parks and beaches. We have to move on, kid.

	14326 : ["Okay, you are new to being an adult, so I'll clue you in, not everyone had a nice childhood. Some people had no parents, bailed/washed/checked out parents, or grew up in orphanages, or foster homes. Some kids were abused and had no place else to go. Many kids all over the world have to work in sweat shops so shits like you can buy the **** YOU were given as a souvenir when you were taken to Disneyland. If you had some good times, great, but are you entitled to whine about not being a baby anymore? Sorry, no. Adults work because the system is a grind. It used to be that if you got a decent job you could go on vacation. Now people are too in debt to get married, or have kids, or sleep nights wondering where food for next week will come from. Disneyland! I've been there and some of it was fun, but for the most part I didn't just want to have people catering to me, I wanted autonomy, and independence, and to be a meaningful part of my own world.

On both my doses I did not queue. I think there are a few places where they are doing drive through vaccinations where you do not leave your car. Obviously, these are outdoors but you remain in your vehicle.
