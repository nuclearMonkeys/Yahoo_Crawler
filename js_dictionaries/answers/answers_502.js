I remember googling \"Foonblotz\" and some other \"answers\" system pulled up with my answers, word for word, and it wasn't YA. I'm suspecting that's at least one reason why YA is shutting down -- tired of giving free exposure and publicity to douchebag copycats who lack anything but cut-and-paste skills.
