I don't know....I don't think so...my name is Jordanna and, although its a girls name, Jordan can be either.  2. Do you think those names once used on girls should be lost to the boys  I don't think its fair on boys to be called Hillary or Evelyn ....girls can get away with unisex names more than boys can.  3. Do you think it matters at all what someones' name is Only if you yourself don't like it....but it can easily be changed. No point going through life with a name you don't like.  4. Do you think people make assumptions based on names before they know them (not when they meet, but based on paper). Is this why girls are being given boys names to give them a chance in job apps and college? Possibly but I doubt it....when reading an application form there are other 'giveaways' as to whether it is a male or female. 5. Do you think names influence attributes?  Again, no I don't think so.....except in the case of extremely feminine names given to males....that might. 6. Do you think that if we had a more equal society that mom's would be actively using more traditionally boys names on girls? No, I don't think mum's go out of their way to give their babe a unisex name....I think it's more of whatever seem to be fashionable at the time. Unisex names like Edwin/Edwina; Jack/Jackie; Andy/Andie; George/Georgina or Jo/Joanne etc have always been popular. ;-)", 11496, "G6lQUsZtaa", 2],

In fact, there is a good chance he gets expelled.  Private schools do not have to comply with US Dept of education guidelines regarding trans students. Those US Dept of education guidelines instruct public schools to be supportive of transgender students.  However, in some conservative area they can still drag their feet doing so, even if you have parental support.  This is much less of a problem in liberal areas of the country. College is a whole different kettle of fish.  Most colleges and universities today, public and private, are accepting of transgender student or at least they try to do the right thing.  The exception is religious, mainly conservative Christian, colleges. My advice is he not come out in high school unless he has parental support.  Reason being other students could bully him.  And, without parents pushing the issue, the school might not do the right thing.

	141268 : ["I prefer names that are clearly girls' names.  My daughter's name is Raina Elizabeth, Raina meaning \"queen\" in Spanish - so her name is \"Queen Elizabeth\".  I wanted to name her after a strong woman.  She should be proud to be female.  I think giving a girl a boy's name implies that to be male is to be superior.   I still feel sorry for a girl I grew up with named \"Thomatrius\" - a poor attempt at hiding disappointment when the expected \"Thomas\" turned out to be a precious daughter instead.  I was thrilled to have my sons, and just as thrilled to have my daughter - I felt that their names should reflect that. People do indeed make assumptions based on names.  That's why I chose unusual first names for our kids - Asher, Raina, and Oberon.  Hopefully they won't have to deal with any preconceived expectations.  (as in, \"I knew a Donna in high school.  She was really rude!)  Most people who meet my kids have never known an Asher, so he can't disappoint them in that respect.", 11496, "hNJfnB4saa", 3],

	141270 : ["It is normal to be scared, I am scared (I'm a MtF not transitioned yet, I'm sixteen and I am waiting to turn eighteen). Everyone is afraid, because of different reason: How will I look after the transition? What will I say to my friends and family? How long is it gonna take? How much will I pay for it? Will I regret it? Will I have second thoughts when it will be too late? Will people figure out I was a girl (or boy, in my case), after the transition? This are the most common questions, and you have all the rights to be worried, all the reasons. But if you feel you were born in the wrong body, the only things you can do are: accept it and live unhappily for the rest of your life, or change the things and see how it goes. I have decided to trust God, because there's a reason I feel what I feel, there's a reason I am who I am. Believe me, you have to think A LOT about it, but ask yourself this: Will I have more regrets if I transition, or more if I don't?", 11497, "uR0hjZYCaa", 2],
	141271 : ["It's normal to feel scared. Perhaps a part of the reason could be your mother treating you like you have a disease, or something fatally wrong with you. I understand it may be hard, but perhaps you're better off staying stealth until you're able to move out of the house and away from your mother. You may find yourself happier and more comfortable with transitioning. Also, it doesn't help when your mother is telling these stories of people who've suddenly regretted their transitions. It doesn't happen often and I personally don't know of anyone who has regretted it. Many older people have transitioned, there's no time limit on it, so take your time and see how you feel after a while. You're not mental or sick in a psychological sense, however gender dysphoria is a condition that can be cured with therapy and perhaps surgery and hormones.
