I only got to know one childless great aunt as an older teen.  The rest I have only said hello to at family funerals.  I'm not sure why you expect to be provided with \"service relatives.\"  ", 7621, "SHiRD91Oaa", 0],

	54641 : ["Aside from the straightforward questions of wealth through violence (and all the media course vocabulary);  they passed laws against monopolies that were reversed in the '80's- laws that would have protected from some of the centralised wealth and knowledge and power that the world lives in now; they filled, at least London with beautiful parks and green spaces without which London would not be a fraction of what it is. Education was valued, cherished and encouraged; rightly or wrongly individuals invested their own wealth in experimentation, discovery, expansion and in humanitarian endeavours. Ideas that lead to ideas- Frankenstein was written by Mary Shelley yeah [?] and the 'Pre-raphaelite brotherhood' contained a number of 'sisters' also- for all the traditional values and patriarchy, exemplary women still continued to find ways of demonstrating their worth... Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale- it would be a great long list were there the time to invest in searching the names; all Victorian. Here's a different idea: when things are 'forbidden' it makes them somehow 'spicier'. The downside of casual liberalism [perhaps the wrong term] is that when 'everything is ok' -nothing is 'naughty', and how can a person recapture naughty when the very concept no longer exists?

Newspaper articles can be a great help, but require some deep digging to find.  Church records can be a big help if you know where to go (having that murder helped, since the entire family used the same church).  Learned when/where he went to college, but they never responded to my queries despite offer to pay.", 7615, "4d3a7bbc1dffd218b8922b7e1819ce90aa", 1],
