Windows is not the best for sure, but costs NOTHING to repair, all the software you could need is available for free from the internet!. All of the information is available for free on the net! If repairs 'pay the salary' how come she has not enough money to buy a mac then? Does not pay that much eh! And it is not Windows that people are repairing (unless they RECODE the whole of the operating system) but peoples mistakes. These other o s's are good but you need a level of programing knowledge to maintain them and the average user cannot easily rectify issues. Mac's are not ideal everyday computers for the average user! (I know I use them!) Don't get me wrong I HATE windows alot of the time BUT it is the most common and supported O S out there, with the largest software database bar none. Back up 'Avast with a decent firewall (built in your router and or 'online Armor') and practice 'safe surfing' !!!", 11499, "N3KZQhlTaa", 0],

	141553 : ["I love all of these answers.  Some if not all have taught me something about myself.  But one thing I know about people is that they have such a fast life that they take so little time out to stop their \"mind chatter\" and listen to their heart.  I know of myself that it is possible to stop and look at my own reactionary self that gets caught up in the competition of our collective reality.   It is possible to see a part of yourself that is reactionary.  It's the same part of yourself that pulls when others push or desires when others move ahead.  There's a part of us that some have called the inner child or the voice that has dreams that feel really good and benefits others also.  Some folks use dowsing rods and yet others use kinesiology to access this masked voice.  It is possible to peal back the hard outer shell of the protective consciousness to reveal the subconscious hidden self.   This is where childhood dreams and aspirations lay hiding from the cruel world and past resentments and pain cling to our bodies.   To access this part of yourself takes time because once you open the subconscious you must process the feelings as they come up into the open.  But it's worth it.  For your true self and dreams await the return of who you once were as an innocent child that was taken away by the harsh reality of adulthood.   Sorry if this ended up sounding more like a parable than assistance.  It takes a different vocabulary to access the heart.  That's why poetry is still around today.  The logical mind may not understand what the heart longs to hear.", 11502, "AA11229410", 0],

	141562 : ["Consider this an excellent time to recognize that your operating system is defective. I recommend replacing it with one of: Any of these will be more reliable, less susceptible to viri, uses your hardware more efficiently, and they're all free. Personally, if I had some money, I'd actually buy a Mac.  The total cost of ownership is less than that of Windows, (initially it costs more, but reliability, security and viri issues inevitably make Windows cost more).  The level of frustration is always lower than with Windows. If you must run a windows app, then you install Fusion or any of the other PC emulators and run windows in a virtual machine.  You ONLY run that app on that virtual machine.  You browse and do everything network related on the host Mac to keep secure and virus free. Its true, I spend more time on Windows than Macs but that's simply because my job is to fix computer problems, and, frankly, that difference in cost of ownership PAYS MY SALARY.  Perhaps I should be advertising Windows just to keep myself in business. I suggest the various free-wares because, well, they're free and although they are harder to learn than the Mac, they certainly are more reliable than Windows.", 11499, "8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa", -4],

	141565 : ["Yes, but calling it inner can be misleading. It may be that your inner self is as much outside. We feel that we are inside the bag of skin we have control over, but where exactly? Where is the person who feels the feelings, sees what is seen, thinks the thoughts? Do not the feelings and the feeler, the seer and the seen, the thinker and the thoughts arise together? Are not the lines between all things abstracts, created by the use of words? We may call a thing a foot, but a foot does not come into being on its own. You did not come into being on your own, it is necessary for you to have consumed some life of this world, to sustain your own. Life did not come into being on its own, but grew out of the forces that made the planet and the universe. Thus it has been said,\"See all things not in the process of becoming, but in being, each implies the all, when one sees beyond the imagined self, one sees the true self, and becomes the whole world.\" Or as they say in Tibetan Buddhism \"Tat vam asi\".
