(not to say that atheists do not have standards---I know they do, that is not my point)  I think it is quite horrible for Christians to respond to anyone with insults.  However, as you said some are fake believers.  Some may not believe in Christ.  Some may just be immature.  It would be nice if all could answer or ask questions without insults.  However, this is a public forum...yet private....no one really knows anyone.  So, some vent.  Some perhaps have wanted to call a nonChristian a jerk for a long time but never would face to face.  This too shows immaturity and a lack of understanding.  I don't think asking if atheists understand \"turning the other cheek\" better is fair.  Sure some do. Some do not.  Ya know if you get a terrible waitness one night at your favorite restuarant...do you assume all the waitresses that work there have bad attitudes?   You are correct that Christians need to let people see the Christ in Christian.  They also need to study more so they are not offended by questions that challenge their beliefs.

The tourist offices will give you that information.  Probably on the home page. Okay, so I just searched each country and currency, and no.  They aren't on the Euro, which means that if you buy Euros, you will have to pay to have them exchanged into the verious Kroner, and, since they each have their own currency (just because they're all called crowns, doesn't mean they have the same value...if you take a US dollar to Australia, and try to spend it, you will have to make an exchange.)  they probably aren't all that convertible.

Many Christians have a wrong idea of holiness. Usually it consists of a list of negative commandments. Almost always. these commandments are not found in Scripture but are rooted in someone's idea of what a Christian should be. Unfortunately, many people consider themselves righteous because of the things they do not do.  There is also the matter of hypocrisy. Examples can be found of people who profess to be believers in Christ yet their conduct is hypocritical. Jesus had very strong words for those who claimed to know Him but practiced hypocrisy:  But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against others; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in (Matthew 23:13).  All Christians denominations have their traditions. Some traditions have been elevated to the place where they are equal with Scripture. This is unfortunate because people cannot separate the human-made things from the commands of God. During the time of Jesus, the distinction between God's commandments and human-made traditions had become blurred. Jesus denounced the unbiblical traditions of His day:  Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? (Matthew 15:3).", 8340, "a08fef2750d99baebe3284a388c734c5aa", 0],
