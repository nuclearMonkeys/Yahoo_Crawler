	99740 : ["The key is the word \"evidence\".  When you go into court, rules of evidence include testimony, eye witnesses, what people have seen and witnessed.  In fact witnesses are a key form of evidence and historical analysis. Most of the people who argue there is NO EVIDENCE totally discount testimony and witness, leaving them only with their own experiences and senses.  They then demand that evidence be presented within the context of their own experience, and that they agree with it.  Then it gets further dressed up so that only \"proof\" will be accepted.  A formula or something that proves, from within the laws of creation (i.e. physics, mathematics, etc.) God exists.  This itself is illogical, since the creation is subject to the laws of the Creator, but not the other way around.   Hope you restart/rethink your conclusions.  There is a God, a Creator, and he is a personal God who knows you by name.

No doubt, Xbox live is a good platform for online gaming but can you use the Xbox as a media centre like the PS3? Nah, ignore those idiots who claim one console is better than the others.

	99766 : ["Yes, these are clearly straw man arguments because they misrepresent the theist position. To \"attack a straw man\" is to create the illusion of having refuted a proposition by substituting it with a superficially similar yet unequivalent proposition (the \"straw man\"), and refuting it, without ever having actually refuted the original position. These are clearly false analogies to God.  No one claims that   Claus, unicorns, or dragons create the universe out of nothing, make life from inanimate matter, or create man in their own image.  No one claims that these fictions are omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, or all good. In short, they substitute mockery for reasoning. Congratulations on another fine question probing the facile arguments of the antitheists. Cheers, Bruce", 9708, "Sn0CViR7aa", 1],
	99767 : ["It's a perfectly legitimate comparison.  These are all things which were said (and fully believed) to exist at one time, and we now know better...most of us.  The lone exception is   Clause, who is an exaggeration of an actual person who once lived. Dragons, incidentally, are actually in the Bible, and are therefore fair game.  Why don't you believe in dragons? The comparison is perfectly logical.  They're all myths that have been asserted as truths, and have later been abandoned due to lack of evidence.  Nobody is saying that the God that you believe in has a mane or a horn, and is therefore comparable to a unicorn--but can you prove to me that he doesn't? I'll concede that there are better comparisons to be had.  The \"why don't you believe in Zeus\" argument is a good one, and perfectly valid.  The point there is to make the believer admit the reasons why they do not believe in the countless other deities, and then apply that same reasoning to their god of choice.  I'm sure you're familiar with it, as it's brought up in this category daily. I don't think that the arguments are straw-man fallacies.  Rather, I think they distract from the actual point--there is no proof needed, unless you're asserting your beliefs to others as true.  What you believe for yourself requires no proof or reason whatsoever.  It's only when you assert your beliefs to others as true that you owe an explanation.", 9708, "33e56a1b3cc94692d0deab27709cf4beaa", -1],

	99781 : ["The concept of any of those beings, including God, is transmitted from person to person without any verifiable reference to anything that exists outside of human thought. That's why it's common knowledge that   doesn't exist. The only difference between God and   is that some people refuse to acknowledge that the two concepts are cut from the same cloth. In short, there's no factual basis for assuming that God's anything but another imaginary being which people sometimes believe exists in the world. The same applies to children who believe in   and adults who have and probably still do believe in things like leprechauns. That more people believe in God than believe in the others doesn't make the case any different.", 9708, "hWi899Itaa", -1],
	99782 : ["So, by common argument, prove that  , unicorns or leprechauns do not exist. Why is it that you refuse to believe in a horse with a horn on it's head but you believe that an omnipotent, omniscient, compassionate being that lives outside time and space made everything and has a master plan that includes allowing innocent children to suffer?  You are right, it's not a perfect analogy, if we said that leprechauns created the earth in 7 days, created man and all the animals, went on a genocidal rampage and condemned everyone to Hell for not believing in them, that would be a better analogy. Again, with reference to  , whilst we accept that there probably is no  , we cannot disprove his existence.  However, like God, we can say that he does not exist as advertised by common folklore.  There may be an entity called   that puts pearls inside oysters (improbable but possible) but we can say that   does not come down our chimney.  There may be a God that gets some perverted satisfaction in starving millions of children (improbable but possible), but it's safe to say that God is not compassionate. It is both logical and reasonable to say that causing the suffering for countless generations because of one couple's scrumping spree is completely disproportionate.", 9708, "vsfJyDxiaa", -1],
	99783 : ["Steps    1. Take your own likes into it. (In other words decide which you prefer.)    2. Make sure you have someone you know in real life to play with otherwise you will most likely get bored. You can always make friends on-line though! Even though they probably wont like you, and stab you in the back in GOW.    3. Try the systems: Try the xbox 360 & PS3 thoroughly and see which you like better.    4. Follow your instincts: if you owned an Xbox and liked it; go with it's next gen counterpart. Vise-versa if you had a PS2 and liked it more go with its counter-part.    5. See which one has games that appeal to your tastes. (I.E: If you're a huge Final Fantasy fan and can't wait for final fantasy XIII, then buy yourself a PS3. If you're huge fan of Halo, get a 360. [edit] Tips     * Make sure it fits your budget. For instance Xbox 360 is cheaper at only $350 but PS3's 40GB version is only $400!     * Consider the systems extra features. (PS3-built in Blu-ray capability+ it has cheaper accessories and has many things built in that 360 doesn't , Xbox 360-larger storage space+loads of downloadable content.)     * Listen to your instincts. Your friends may have different opinions so stick with your own.     * Pick up a gaming magazine or two (OXM, Gamesmaster, etc) and see what they have to say about each system.     * Xbox 360 is an online system and has a full online community, but you have to pay an extra service fee. The Playstation 3's online service, the PlayStation Network is free, although Xbox Live is preferred by some more than others.     * Consider a Wii if you dislike either of the two. However, graphics are not comparable to the 360 & PS3.     * Keep in mind the extra things you may have to buy if you go with the PS3.     * The Xbox has a tendancy to break so be careful.     * Xbox 360 is prefered by most gamers.     * Have fun! [edit] Warnings     * PS3 has a fail rate of .2% (Citation needed.)     * Wii has a fail rate of 1%     * Xbox 360 has a fail rate of 33%", 9710, "None", 0],
