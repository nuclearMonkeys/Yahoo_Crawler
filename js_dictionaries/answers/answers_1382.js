Life could be long, u could loose your mother too, then, how do u manage your affairs. If u have a good plan maybe your mother would understand. Your mother knows the problem, but there seems to be no good solution. No need to rock the boat. A non providing husband is better than no husband, at least we can hope that he changes, with the situation demanding inputs from him.

	74707 : ["yes it is true,over 60% of divorce cases now days are initiated by women.usually the term WALK AWAY WIFE SINDROME applies.i feel that it comes down to the general exceptance of divorce in our society,it was a complete taboo in the 50s and 60s and maybe even in the early 70s to get divorced.because of this break down in moral standards couples don't try hard enough to solve their marriage problems,it's easier to walk away than it is to keep your marriage vows that you made,commitment for life is so easily forgotten.even if you are not very religous you made a legal and spiritual contract in marriage.do the 10 commandments ring any bells!any maritual problem can be resolved (except physical abuse)with time and effort,so put in the time and the effort to save the marriage,try,try and keep trying until all things are resolved and the marriage is back on track again.it is worth every second of effort that you have to put forth to remain happily married,till death do we part.", 8775, "7ZAFg2w1aa", 0],

It's interesting how you can be pro-\"choice\" and \"women's heath\" and keep government out of a woman's decision to do what she wants medically with herself (even though all of the effect of an abortion is to end the life of a person that isn't the woman in question) and then support Obama care which, by its definition and intent is to take away medical choice from not only women but men too and place it in the hands of the government.  I'm not a Christian but I don't recall Jesus running around killing the unborn.  \"THE ECONOMY AND JOBS ARE AT A HIGHER LEVEL NOW THAN THEY WERE AT BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED\" You're just wrong.

	74719 : ["I think you had better join a Bible study before you attempt to use the bible to justify your political beliefs. You can't take a few verses out of context and make them fit your agenda.  And by the way more people are on food stamps and receiving entitlements under Obama.  Unemployment is falsely lower because many people have run out of unemployment benefits and have given up on looking for work.  Last time I checked the job fairs and the newspaper job listings were dismally low.  We still have a housing crisis.  Obama's asinine policies have made this recovery slower and more painful than is should have been had he known what the heck he was doing.  The debt levels under Obama have grown more than all previous presidents combined.  You Obama supporters will continue to support this failure irregardless of the facts.", 8776, "kH0k8mo8aa", 1],

In the Bible, Jesus NEVER ONCE talks about having government USE FORCE to COMPEL OTHERS to pay for the POLITICALLY defined \"needy.\" He NEVER ONCE suggests FORCING OTHERS to make sure the sick are taken care of AS DEFINED by POLITICS. He NEVER ONCE suggests FORCING OTHERS into ANY of the things you mention. BTW - you are literally 100% certain you cannot cite ANYTHING Obama has done that OBAMA didn't say was a BAD idea for the economy. We're more than 2 million jobs SHORT of what we had when Obama was elected. Look at the chart OBAMA published that shows how high unemployment would be over time if we DIDN'T do his plan. OBAMA'S prediction is that PRESENT unemployment would be about 6% if we just left things alone.", 8776, "ASXeYOjAaa", 3],

If you look up these Executive Orders, you will see that they don't exist!! You are using as your reference, a website from an individual that is trying to start a conspiracy. I do not trust my government much at all, and love when the truth about corruption and abuse come to light. But, you are spreading lies as if they are the truth, with no factual basis. Go to the OFFICIAL whitehouse/government websites whose links below give you all the info you need to discount this crap!! The very first one you list, EO 10990 was amended and codified many times, and is currently Executive Order 12196--Occupational safety and health programs for Federal employees. Can you see how stupid people in America are to go along with such nonsense? I'm a gun carrying, Libertarian who will never let my government run over the Constitution nor personal Liberty!

	74727 : ["WOW you got all that from Youtube? any time I look it's all little videos. Some quite funny but none too factual. Your questions is a little confusing, as FEMA like other USA organisations does not cover Mexico or Canada, both of which to date are separate countries. There seems to be no great movement of people out of the US, in fact there is an influx of immigrants, legal and illegal both. Canada's population appears to be fairly stable. Mexico is the main provider of people moving to the US, so I guess you could call those people \"leaving Mexico\"....but on your statements, they are jumping out of the fryng pan and into the fire....you are expecting them to be running away from FEMA etc but they are wlking right into it. On the other end, ie further south, people from other neighbouring countries are moving into Mexico in huge numbers. Every country has arrangements for emergencies as big as a nuclear attack. But it takes that nuclear attack to bring the arrangements into force. Luckily there is no nuclear attack on any country imminent that we know of. To me it is comforting to know that proper arrangements have been made in advance, as the panic at the time would not be the best time to start thinking what to do. The powers of FEMA are a lot less worrying than their apparent ineptitude in handling a much smaller disaster, the Katrina incident.", 8779, "BYm9KzQvaa", 1],

	74729 : ["No.. I don't want government forcing people to accept a definition of marriage either way. Marriage is a cultural thing and not every group of people or every state has the same culture, so the federal government has no businesses banning or legalizing marriage of any specific type.  If an individual state wants to vote to determine what they want \"marriage\" to be then that's fine. People like you also really need to open your eyes to the fundamental conflict between the sides on the issue of abortion. One side sees it as killing a child or preventing life while the other side does not. The \"what a woman can do with her body\" is an extremely overused phrase because it tries to sidestep and toss away real concerns people have. People aren't against abortion because they want to control someone's body. They are against it because they believe it as a form of murder which should not be someone's right.   Jesus preaches of voluntary generosity and caring for the needy... doing it out of your own good will. Government run programs and decisions do not count.  People helping people is what counts. People aren't against helping other people. People are against being forced to pay for government programs that may or may not even be run well or effectively targeting the people who truly need help. People should be able to have full freedom of choice of where they want to donate their time and money in order to help others.", 8776, "d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa", 1],
