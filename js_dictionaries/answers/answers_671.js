	37377 : ["It's an extremely BAD idea to have ANY cat declawed. If the cat is scratching their claws, then they need a scratching post to do it on, so as that they will do it on the post instead of on the furniture. It's a totally normal behavior for cats to scratch their claws since it's done to mark territory, keep their claws sharp and remove the outer 'shell' to keep them healthy, a bit like a person trimming and filing their nails regularly. If the cat is clawing your arm, it may simply be to get your attention, similar to tapping someone on the shoulder to get their attention. If that's a problem, try ignoring the cat when they do it and praise them when they're not. Having their nails clipped and getting nail caps may be of benefit as well.  Declawing is painful for the cat, because it's not just pulling their claws out. It actually involves amputating the distal phalanges of the toes, so is the equivalent of cutting off the end bits of your fingers!  Also, it doesn't solve behavioral problems. In fact, it actually can potentially make things worse. Owners who declaw their cats often do so thinking it will reduce aggressive behaviors, but it can make cats become hyper aware of what they have left. They typically then will resort to scratching with their back claws, and they also will bite a lot more as a result.  It also causes problems with inappropriate elimination i.e. toileting outside of the litter box, because digging in the box hurts them! Hope this helps.", 5539, "UjX7SRmUaa", 1],
	37378 : ["i'm with the user who said that there could be something wrong. my cat only ever scratched her rope tree that i made her when she was a kitten and i had redone it quite a few times. she started to scratch up my mother's antique chair out of the blue when she was about 10 and we tried everything to get her to stop, but she wouldn't. she would also not take pets as often and didn't eat as much as she normally did, along with her new scratching. took her to the vet because she scratched so hard, her claw split and was bleeding. gave her a checkup, vet suggested xrays because he said something sounded off, and turns out she had a huge growth on her intestines. luckily, it was not serious at all, just a tumor that was removed, but she was trying to tell us something.", 5539, "None", 3],
