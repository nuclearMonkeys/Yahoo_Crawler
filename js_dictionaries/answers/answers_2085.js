When I'm with her by myself during the day sometimes I will just put her in her bouncy chair and let her cry for a few. Sometimes she will cry herself to sleep rather quickly. We don't do this often.

Concrete is overkill and a tad pricey if the fence is long, unless of course its in a place where it will take substainial abuse.....as in holding cattle. When you  tamp (take a long pole and pack in the excavated material) you may run short, its best to mix a little sand in with it. so its about 50/50 sand/clay mix. If you are in a sandy area, you can get bag drymix (its much cheaper than conc.). Pour the dry mix in the hole, tamp it good so the post is secure (1 bag per hole, hole should be min 3' deep) and fill the rest of the hole with excated material, Afterwards water the holes....the drymix will turn into a kind of concrete,also will suck moisture right out of the ground.

	110050 : ["Gee, lots of answers already on this one. I'm inclined to agree with Chloe. What a lot of people seem to be missing is that it is not about whether your little boy will be ok, or whether you are doing the right things to prevent it or not, but that it is about how phenomenally tired you are. More than that, this shows how you are beyond tired and already fatigued. Wonderful mummy you definitely are, and rightly frustrated. When my second child (of 4 children, and he is now 9) was 6 months old the same thing happened to me. He was a shocking sleeper and I lay down on the bed to feed him, just so I could rest a little while I did. I did not even realise that I was so tired. I had no intention of falling asleep and was not even aware that I had until I heard the thud of his little body hitting the ground. Oh the horrible feeling in my stomach as I tried to work out if he was ok or not. I was so upset I was in tears myself and I did blame myself. My husband was (and is) like yours. He blamed me too. Any time anything happens to the kids (even if he was watching them) seems to be somehow connected to me (in his mind anyway). I think it is his way of absolving himself of any guilt he might be feeling. I think it could even be possible that your husband does not want to admit to himself (and certainly not you) that he feels a bit guilty that he has allowed you to get so tired (by not helping) that this could happen. I think it is really important that at this time you get some support from wherever you can get it. When my little boy fell off the bed it was my wake up call (no pun intended!!) to stop trying to do it all on my own. You have to be on the verge of complete exhaustion to doze off without realising it, and when you are like this you are risking your own and baby's health. You need sleep sweetie. Do you have any family or friends you can ask for help, not around the house necessarily, but even just to watch him while you get some shut-eye? You need to let the thing with your husband go right now and look after baby, and you can't look after baby if you don't look after yourself first. Dealing with hubby is just going to take energy you don't have, and it's something you can talk with him about when you've recharged your batteries a bit. RIght now you'll probably say things you regret later. Just accept (for now anyway) that he doesn't (and may never) understand what you are going through. Only others who have been there can. You WERE watching baby, just your eyes couldn't do it any more. You are NOT a bad mum. You have been giving of yourself so much that your body is telling you to stop. You will be amazed at how much better everything will look on the other side of some sleep. Thank God little ones are so resilient. Please don't let this eat at you, but do use it as a warning to take care of yourself.", 10116, "U52wnsebaa", 5],

He will help you to sin less if you just ask Him.  You won't be able to stop sinning completely until you are with Him in heaven.  Just don't get a hard heart.  As soon as you realize you have sinned, confess it immediately to God and ask His forgiveness and cleansing.  Read a portion of the Bible (New Testament first)  and pray daily.

You're certainly not alone in this.  The problem is that it doesn't account for the other things He said.  Stuff about being the Son of God, the resurrection and the life, the judge of the world...  Since all of these statements are mixed together in the very same documents, how do you separate them?  The gospels are reliable when they report Jesus saying things we like, and unreliable when He says things we don't?    I guess it boils down to the old \"Lord, lunatic, or liar\" argument.  Either He was who He claimed to be or He doesn't deserve our respect at all.    Obviously you don't have to accept my reasoning.  Consistency is, after all, the prison of the small minded.  I do think that Christianity is consistent with the records we have of Jesus.   But that doesn't mean that everyone who admires Jesus has to be Christian.  I'm pretty sure He would be fine with your embracing His ethical teaching even if He was saddened that you didn't accept His identity.   peace", 10117, "None", 2],
	110059 : ["The Bible contains certain truths, but it is an edited history book written by imperfect historians.  Also, it does not focus on the achievement of enlightenment and the \"truth which will set us free\".  There is a book called \"A Course in Miracles\" which explains Jesus' teachings as they were originally intended by the one person who knows what those teachings were supposed to be.  It is a masterpiece, probably the most important book ever written.  It has certainly changed my way of thinking about the meaning of life and how to find the truth.", 10117, "s3DhJ4i7aa", 0],
	110060 : ["I understand completely. I respect the teachings of Jesus but I also respect the teachings of Buddha, Tao, and many others that spoke the same message, \"go in peace and be good to one another and to the earth\". I do not hold much faith or belief in a book written by humans, inspired by a religion or belief, during a turbulant time as when the roman empire was declining and moving out of Europe under the rule of Nero. Trying to justify a belief with it \"written\" and using it to rule and govern by is just asking for trouble, but trying to live a life of peace and honoring the teachings of a person or persons that personified the message is a different story. People have to remember, up until Jesus' birth, most of the bible is copied and reworded from the history in the Torah or the first \"holy words\" by the Jews, then there is Jesus and his life (missing about 15 years give or take) and then they resume with the concept of the Jewish faith and some of the Islamic faith mixed in with some Paganism to finish it off to give people an idea of how the earth will end and be reborn to amplify the message of hope under their Deity. The message is a good one, Jesus', but so are several others of that time period. If we will stop trying to recite \"chapter and verse\" to prove our points and our belief ( in other words take our beliefs from our hearts and minds and not from a book) we could be honest with ourselves. Wan't it said that a man is known by his actions as a tree is know by it's fruits? Don't need a book to know that. And the word \"gospel\" is not reciting a book, but by your own words and actions do you \"speak\" the truth and tell the story of your personal experience.", 10117, "YfwgvPaCaa", -1],
