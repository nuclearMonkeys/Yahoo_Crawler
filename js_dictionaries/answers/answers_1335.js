Corporation chiefs said the host of the Radio 4 flagship programme should not have accused researchers at the University of East Anglia of ‘distorting the debate about global warming to make the threat seem even more serious than they believed it to be'.

	72344 : ["LOL jim z thinks it is not possible to predict climate. I wonder if someone were to ask what is the climate of Antarctica, would anyone say \"warm and rainy\"? I mean, just because it hasn['t been warm and rainy down there for around 50 million years doesn't mean it won't be in the next few weeks right? Gambler's fallacy notwithstanding, they must be DUE for some good weather down there, yeah? In my opinion, which is based on a very limited knowledge of statistics; it is to do with the amount of data which is used to make the prediction. A weather prediction is based on a few days of satellite monitoring for a given region. As we all know, they can be wrong. A climate prediction is based on long term observations for a given region. These may also be wrong, but the larger amount of data reduces the likelihood that the prediction will be wrong. Only when you get anomalous behaviour does the likelihood of an accurate prediction start to drop. This is because the prediction is based on numbers and not guesswork. But since climate forecasting is incorporating anomalous patterns, the uncertainty increases exponentially as you get further into to the future.  Think about a patch of heathland that is burned out. Within a few days there will be plant life sprouting from the ashes. If you made a prediction about the abundance and diversity of plant life that would be sprouting after two weeks based on what was present before the fire, there is not much chance you'll be correct other than which species are present or absent. However if you predict what will be there in two years, given favourable weather conditions etc, then you can expect there to be a similar vegetation structure as pre-fire surveys indicated. Going beyond that, you can predict how the site may look 50 or 100 years after fire if the pre-fire survey site had been unburned for that long. The succession of vegetation structures is very well understood and uncertainty will relate mainly around stochastic events like the introduction of invasive species or other forms of disturbance such as storms, disease etc. Ecological prediction just isn't something that is done on a regular basis unless there are vulnerable species being assessed in the area. Anyway there are a multitude of mathematical tools to help make predictions. My enviro science professors used to joke about how they \"worshipped at the tomb of Thomas Bayes\" since his methods are so useful in making predictions now that they finally have computers powerful enough to make them. With the amount of effort and money being invested in climate science, the room for error will get smaller and smaller.", 8680, "None", 3],
	72345 : ["The skeptics current explanation is a combination of natural climate variability and GHGs.  Natural climate variability possibly includes all of the factors you have mentioned and maybe more.  Climate is a result of a complex interaction of events.  To look for just one driving factor is simplistic in the extreme. Currently, the global warming alarmists use a back inferencing step in which any warming unexplained by the GCMs is attributed to GHGs.  This is entirely bogus.  It assumes a comprehensive knowledge of the climate which does not exist. The Schwartz study indicates the climate is not nearly as sensitive to CO2 as once thought. You ask if the planet should not be warming many times faster and the answer is - not necessarily.  Climate sensitivity is overestimated.

	72358 : ["I think the question could be better phrased. Climate is less precise in that it is an average over long periods of time, so an *accurate* prediction of climate is a different goal than an *accurate* prediction of the weather. That said, since weather and climate both measure rainfall and temperature, the law of large numbers might be the answer you're looking for. In a stable system, chaotic variations around an average will accumulate repeatedly around that average. If an average is changing, something is causing the system to change and it is no longer stable. Or, a baseball analogy (I don't know why these aren't used more often in this topic). How many home runs will Big Papi hit next year? About 30 (if he gets & stays healthy). How many will he hit on a given night? Between 0 and 3.  Papi's home run count has been trending downward since '06 because something is changing. He is getting older (sigh).", 8680, "OU5i4Fxkaa", 2],
	72359 : ["I like to think about dumping a sack of marbles onto a slightly sloped surface. In that case it is extremely difficult -- even feasibly impossible -- to accurately predict how each marble moves and where each one will finally settle. It is simply too chaotic, the initial states are too imprecisely known, and it gets exponentially worse as you add more marbles.  But if you know the angle of the slope, then it is very easy to predict the general direction and even the average acceleration of the whole bunch, regardless of how many there are. Some will move faster or slower than average, some will bounce away onto their own trajectories completely, but all are equally affected by the same gradual acceleration in the direction of the downward slope and so the overall average movement can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.  And so it is that knowing the chaotic states of daily weather is not important for calculating the overall basic response to a stable and precisely-known radiative forcing.", 8680, "aWTo9K22aa", 2],

	72375 : ["The prediction value depends if you use a small or a large (and ancient) set of data, and if you try to predict on a long term (climate warming) or at a ponctual time (weather). A) In short term studies to predict the evolution of a system, you have to deal with uncertainty and probablility of evolution of each component of the system. But each component has not the same importance in the evolution. So your analysis can deal with less (but the right!) parameters/components to predict well at a short term ponctual time. Considering more parameters/components will only-slightly improve your prediction at short term, but will be needed to predict at a longer term (case B), including prediction over a lasting periode (trend). (yet, if you do not have the right initial data or the right model, the prediction is highly unpredictable!) Longer the term of prediction is, more components are involved in the system evolution, all acting together: more parameters and states should be accurately measured, and models should cope also with (non-linear) interactions. Our intelligence and models are more limited to solve such complexe equations, where on butterlfy wing can resonnate everywhere... So prediction of the system evolution is hard, and unaccurate at a defined time of the sytem evolution.  But the prediction is more probable about the variation range of the system!, because all components and parameters are connected in a large system, making their individual degree of liberty (ddl) constrained: the ddl of the large system is greatly reduced. Unpredictable evolutions of each components must remain coherent, making all prediction errors correcting themselves.
