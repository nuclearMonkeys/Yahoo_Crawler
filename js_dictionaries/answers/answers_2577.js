And there have been thousands of Gods throughout time, so what makes us think any one is the \"right\" one? 2) Big Bang Theory is the best explanation we have right now. 3) Atheist.  I used to be Catholic. 4) No, because atheism doesn't have any of these things.  When I was Catholic though, I never did understand the Trinity, especially the \"Holy Spirit\" part.  And now I know that in the Eucharist ceremony, the bread and wine LITERALLY becomes the body and blood of Christ... which sounds like cannibalism.  And Catholics supposedly have only one God but they can pray to any number of divines, including the Saints, and the Virgin Mary. 5) Pantheism, because it's basically atheism. 6) I'm comfortable with atheism.  It just makes sense and I could no more believe in some deity than I could in the tooth fairy. 7) Your consciousness ceases to exist.  Your body rots.  And yes, we can know.  Because your consciousness is merely a product of synapses firing in the brain.  When you die, your brain ceases to function and there is no brain activity.  You can think of it as turning a computer off.  It's not like the computer has a spirit that goes off and keeps running. 8) No.  Because the dead are dead.  Unless we find some way to bring the dead back to life. 9) No.  No evidence and their existence is illogical. 10) It makes sense. 11) Playing video games.

The Big Bang, since it is the theory that best fits such phenomena such as background radiation, red-shift movement of galaxies, etc. 3. None (agnostic atheist) 4. N/A 5. I have found little objectionable in Buddhism or Shinto. 6. I explored multiple religious theories when younger but found nothing ultimately pursuasive in any of them. 7.

The universe as we know it is probably the result of an expanding singularity, commonly known as the big bang. However, why there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists at all in other words, is a question that seems deep but is unanswerable by definition. Whatever you find to explain existence would have to exist itself and therefore need to be explained. 3. I don't 'claim' any. I do occasionally self-identify as a Quaker, but if someone were to deny my \"Quakerhood\" I wouldn't argue with them. 4. Well, Quakers have few shared doctrines. The ones there are: the inner light in all people, pacifism, equality. I don't think I truly understand any of them, but I do think they are true. Many Quakers also are theists, or even believe in Jesus' salvation of us by sacrifice. I disagree with them on those points. But, they are not core tenets of Quaker faith. 5. Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, Judaism, European traditional faiths, Islam... all over. 6. I accept I will never be certain. It's part of who I am. I would love it if there was a Quaker meeting in my town I could attend though. 7. I think we cease to exist, but I'm not sure. No I don't think we can know for sure. 8. I don't think so. 9. Absolutely not. Hard to explain why not, just see no reason to. 10. Very difficult question. I feel it's true, that's really all there is to it. 11. Worship meeting, meditation and discussion are all important. 12. I think it is important to people, but I don't think it has all that much effect on how people act. 13. I come from a non-religious household. I went to a Christian school for most of my primary school and came out of that somewhat Christian. As a teenager I was into new age beliefs. As a university student I came to identify more as an atheist and later found the Quakers and felt at home there. 14. I think they are useful metaphors sometimes. I doubt they have any kind of physical or otherworldly existance. 15. It has been generally positive. I've been in Uganda and met mostly religious people there, who welcomed me into their community with open arms. They debated with me quite fiercely and nearly endlessly, but never once tried to exclude me or place special conditions on anything I did, including teaching their children.

Yes, came in contact with specter like thing that i assume was a demon or angel (it just looked at me and vanished in thin air after whispering quite loudly \"stay\"\" 10.)Hope 11.)Meditation/self reflection 12.)Helpful (there are bad seeds though just like in everything else) 13.)Christian, I learned to tell the difference between what god said and what man says he said. 14.) Yes, not sure what heaven and hell actually are, but if you lived a good life and helped others i think you go to heaven along with everyone else. But if you created pain and sorrow all your life and only cared for the world and the things in it. Its hell. I believe only very bad people go to hell (murder/rape and such) 15.)n/a ~your welcome", 11226, "isErXryiaa", 0],

I also used to think breeding mixed-breeds was a good thing (creating new breeds); didn't take me long to gain a different view on that one!", 11225, "uKOYK1Lvaa", 4],

I've tried everything... \"Your dog is too young, she will die!\" and of course this link:  I'd think that alone, the fact that your dog lives longer if they haven't been bred is enough to get owners to change their minds. But some people just don't care. Me? I'd go to the ends of the earth to give my dogs the happiest, healthiest lives possible, living as long as they can.

	134716 : ["Well as much as i feel that not everyone should be breeding, in fact most of the people in America should not be breeding. I in fact am a breeder of 3 years now. I am a responsible breeder that doesnt breed for money cause that is a sure fire tell for a BYB or PMB, which i certainly am not. I have only had 3 litters of puppies spaced out, 2 weim, 1 bulldog. There really is nothing that you could say to stop me from breeding. Cause i know the truth, people stop breeding the dog population drops to 0, plain as that. Yes that would take many years but still it would happen. And i know none of us want that, cept for PETA idiots. People like who you describe have given us such a bad reputation its sickening to the stomach. Its gotten to the point where most breeders are shunned if they say they are breeders. Some are even afraid to admit it, and it shouldnt be like that. Yes there are many in shelters and rescue but thats not our faults its the irresponsible owners fault. There the real problem, stop them and hey maybe this so called problem might just stop.  I have gotten offended by some of the people here, and yeah sure tell me to go away if i feel that way but so what i have just as much right to be here as the lot of you. Im offended by some because lots here want to become byb's, and on the other hand, it sickens me to see the extent of peoples frustrations and anger being projected on an innocent person looking for help. It shouldnt be that way, not here, not anywhere. Here it is a community, a learning community. We are here to help people with our knowledge, if your tired of listening then you dont have to answer, its not required that you do. Y!A doesnt click on q's by itself you have to do some of the work. Well all of it really. This constant bickering is getting nowhere and i just cant help but feel sorry that the world has gotten this bad, theres no need for it.  Seriously there is nothing that can be said to change my mind. I highly enjoy whelping litters, and raising puppies. I love seeing the new owners faces when they come see the puppies for the first time. We raise healthy puppies, thats that. Edit- To change BYB's minds your gonna need lots, your gonna need hard core facts. The facts of breeding. The harshness of things going wrong and much more. BYB's can be quite stubborn", 11225, "P8Q39vA4aa", 1],

	134721 : ["- His name's Benson - He's got the sweetest most understanding personality I've ever happened across in a horse, and I'm not just saying that because he's mine =P We also have a very close bond, closest than I've ever had with a horse. It's a wonderful thing. He's always happy to see me which is lovely, it's always nice to be welcomed with a soft nicker even when you AREN'T carrying food on you =3. - Again, sweet and understanding. Also he's very rarely in an \"off\" mood or is grumpy, no matter what I do to  him =P I consider him just an over-sized dog really, he comes when called and loves to go for walks  - He's a GORGEOUS Thoroughbred - He's a horse =) (16.2hh) - Gelding  - Yes. We had a bit of a bumpy start together, but now he's the only horse I'll ride =P. However, there's no riding at the moment because he's recovering from a nasty abscess =( - No shows yet, mainly because of his slight lameness due to the abscess, there's always next season though =) SO many memorable times with this sweetie... the one that's freshest in my mind happened last week: I was walking the parameter of his paddock, checking it for holes, things he can cut himself on, wires and what have you (as I do every week). He had been keeping a rather close eye on me as I went around, and when I rounded the corner he literally moved to see what I was doing; ever so curious =P. Anyway, I was just wandering along intent on looking for any potential hazards and I tripped over a bramble (I'm actually quite clumsy) and fell flat on my face. I was perfectly alright, but Benson cantered over to me and proceeded to give me a thorough going over to make sure I was alright. To this day he won't let me go alone and insists on walking along with me when I'm checking over the paddocks =) Also, he likes to indicate when I should feed him by picking up his bucket and dropping it at my feet, or over the wall if I'm not in the paddock with him. It's pretty cute, because he does it every night at 7, when it actually IS his feeding time =)", 11224, "None", 1],
	134722 : ["My horse Trigger (Triggie) is my best buddy. He is a 8 year old blond palomino quarter horse gelding. Before seeing him I had never wanted or had a horse in my entire life I was 28 years old. He was 3. We learned everything together. We have a small dairy farm with 40 organic grazing cows and Triggie and I go out twice a day and bring them into the barn for milking. He loves to chase the heifers! lol. We go on long trail rides and we also go into town and have lunch at the park, I bring a few apples and carrots for him. Usually there are a few kiddo's who want to ride, so I just walk them around on Triggie. One of my most favorite moments with Triggie was at a team penning practice when he showed me moves I had never seen before, he was like riding a roller coaster, changing directions so quickly!", 11224, "AA12126370", 1],
