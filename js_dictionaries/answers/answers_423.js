Unfortunately, conditions are not always ideal. If you restrict yourself to fossil fuels (or even biomass), the problem gets quite complicated. you have to consider both the costs (environmental as well as financial) of the fuel an the costs to clean up afterward. When I was heating my house with a wood stove (using wood saved from the landfill), I would sometimes have a pot on top of the stove. Place it correctly and it can act as a slow-cooker. Although the wood did put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the ash served to sweeten the soil on my garden (or as grit on my icy sidewalk), so there was no solid waste to dispose of. The landscapers who supplied me saved fuel by not having to haul the wood to the transfer station. I got my exercise without having to go to a gym. And the landfill lasted a wee bit longer by about 600 cubic feet per year, based on my average usage.", 3707, "DVdX6I4kaa", -1],

Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 3716, "None", 0],

The science is out there and widely publicized.  Also Sweden the green energy being the thing that debunked the whole grid turned out to be a lie and that is widely publicized. Sweden uses wind turbines and put out a statement for how to use them in cold weather.

And because you apparently can't charge an electric vehicle during the day, for some reason. All power generation sources have drawbacks.  All power generation sources have things that can be done to alleviate those drawbacks.  Unlike virtually every other source, the only thing that can be done to alleviate the drawbacks for fossil fuels is to stop using them.
