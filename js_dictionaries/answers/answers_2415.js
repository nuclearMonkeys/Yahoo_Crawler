You can also ask someone, like a neighbor or friend, to help you out with that. Or hire a dog walker. You can also look into doggie daycare.  I don't understand why people are freaking out so bad, I mean, there's so many dogs in shelters that would be HAPPY to have a home, even if it means spending 10 hours alone.

How could anyone believe that all of the complicated functions of life in this universe could have been created by spontaneous explosions of chemicals. If you think about it, you'll realize that the creation of matter itself doesn't make sense at all. How could chemicals exist in the first place!?! Sooo...  I know that people will say that the Bible was made by men, but I just can't believe that some of the wonderful, perfect things that are stated in the Bible could even be thought up by sinful, imperfect humans.  No, the Bible didn't just fall out of the sky, for that Lillian s person; God used human's hands for his tools. But, how could you believe that men thought up those beautiful things? Why would anyone waste their time writing something as huge as that just to help sinful people? I'm sorry, but that's just not something that any human being would do. No person can find it in their ruthless hearts to make a story that tells of someone forgiving the very people who killed him. My answer got a little longer than I wanted it to... but I wish everyone wanted to have the king and friend I do. I think a lot of people just think God is this big mean judge. He's not.

Try reading the bible, i know some people say that it can't be true because it was written by regular people like you and me, but the bible was written over a span of 2,000 years, if you read it it fits together just like any other book. Most of the people who wrote the books of the bible didn't even know each other or live in the same life time. So how does it fit together, that's what i can't tell you. Personally, i would go to church for at least a month before you decide if you think God exists or not...

Man found in Palastine 400,000 years ago (Homosapien) Also, in equivalent and relevant terms of time, why have we technologically evolved over the equivalent to 5 days? HERE'S THE MATHS! Lets say 30 years for modern technology. So: 30 years Multiplied by 10 Divided by 400,000 years = 0.00075 So 30 years is 0.00075% of 400,000 years Now 365 days in a year Multiplied by 400,000 = 146000000 Days. 0.00075 Divided by 146000000 = 5.1 Days.

Because not only are you going to be left with poop and pee on your floor, but things might be broken because dogs who are left alone tend to get into things lol.

Dogs are like best friends, they love to be around people and have the chance to play and go for walks. He might get bored during the day without anyone around.  Have you thought about getting a cat? They are much more independent. They do like to have time to themselves and would probably do fine while you are at work.

We don't strive to be perfect, rather we strive to be better.  Better than man. Proof of evolution.  As we continue to push ourselves, man will evolve into what was once thought of as perfect.

	126601 : ["When I was taught something in school, I suppose you could say I had to have some \"faith\" in the teacher to believe him or her.  But the difference is that the things we're taught in school can be verified.  Obviously, I'm not going to try to verify 99% of it because it is beyond my ability, intelligence, and/or desire.  But if you take anything you are taught in a public school to an expert, 99%+ of the experts will agree.  And if there is disagreement among the experts, you will be told that in school also.  It is still possible that some things taught in school are erroneous and will later be shown to be false, but when that happens, you'll be told the new thing.  So everything you learn is going to be true based on the best scientific evidence available to us. Faith is based on information in books written a long time ago.  People claim that these books were written by God, but their only evidence for this claim is a circular argument.  The books themselves say they were written by God.  Different religions get their faiths from different books and/or different interpretations of these books.  So the supposed \"proof\" of one religion is \"proven\" false by the proof of another religion. Please explain how a devotion to God gives me excellence in everything?  Are people who believe in God better at things than people who don't believe in God?  Much less being better at all things?  Are their any studies to show this?  I certainly never heard of any.  Are baseball or football players going to do better because they cross themselves?  What happens when the players on opposing teams both cross themselves?  Who does God help, or do the crossings cancel each other out and it would be the same as if neither player crossed themselves.  I can tell you for a fact that people who don't believe in God are much better at rational thought and critical thinking, because they rely on the best evidence available rather than someones narrow interpretation of one or more books. As far as everlasting life, how do you know?  Are you basing this on a book or books whose author is unknown?  Or whose author is known only because the book says who the author is and you just believe it blindly?  Have you ever met anyone who died and came back to life to tell you what it was like? Science is based on unbiased experiments using the scientific method.  It is true that some scientific statements that are thought to be true are later proven false, but all of this is done within the scientific method.  As we gain more and more knowledge and learn more and more about our world and universe, sometimes scientific \"beliefs\" can change.  But to me, that is even more evidence of the validity of science. Religious beliefs never change.  It doesn't matter how advanced we may become and how sophisticated our experiments are, but if the book you believe in (or the people interpreting the book) says something else, then you believe what the book says and not what science tells us, no matter how strong the evidence is that shows that you are wrong. Perhaps you're right, and there is no such thing as evolution, and the earth is only 6,000 years old.  Maybe the first people lived hundreds of years to as old as 969.  Maybe people and dinosaurs lived at the same time.  But all of science agrees that the earth is about 4.5 billion years old, the dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago, humans have been around for a few million years and evolved from the same common ancestor as modern apes, etc.  So for your book to be correct, God had to have created such an elaborate scheme to set up DNA, carbon dating, and most of science so that everyone would be intentionally misled into believing in science rather than this book.  We must have had an incredible diet and exercise regime to live hundreds of years when until recently, the average lifespan was 40.  Even now, the average lifespan is about 75 and no one has been proven to live to 123. So what do you expect us to believe?  Overwhelming scientific evidence from probably tens of thousands of experiments and scientists, or the set of books and interpretations that you happen to believe - and most likely you believe what you believe by accident of birth.", 10899, "d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa", 2],
