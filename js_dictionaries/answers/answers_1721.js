Firefox automatically does daily backups (json files) of your bookmarks and saves them according to its respective user. The JSON file is contained within the folder \"bookmarkbackups\" of that user. So if your Windows username is \"BILL\" it would be under \"C: Documents and Settings BILL Application Data Mozilla Firefox Profiles xxx.defaul... (\"xxx\" being an alphanumeric string that differs from user to user) Since you just re-installed (non-formatting) Windows all the folders containing the JSON backups should be intact. As long as you didn't erase anything in the \"Documents and Settings\" folder you should have the auto-backup, of the moment right before you fixed your Operating System, hidden in the respective folder.

	91763 : ["I think it's a very creative idea, and I can see the appeal of the juxtaposition of a delicate, beautiful dress with the black Converse, but I think that in time you may regret the decision. Have you ever looked at prom pictures from back in your parent's day when it was trendy for the guys to wear ruffled shirts with their tuxedos and the girls to have blue eye shadow, and sort of cringed? Converse sneakers are hip right now, but like most fads, their popularity will fade with time. I would strive for a more elegant, timeless look for your prom that will be less cringe-inducing to your future self.  That's not to say that you should abandon all creativity. I think the makeup and nails will be striking with your dress, and will give you a distinguished look.  You could always bring the Converse shoes with you and change into them towards the end of the night after the photos have been taken and the main event is winding down. The dress and the shoes would be quirky and fun, but better suited for the After-Prom than the main event.  If you really, truly, want to wear the Converse for the whole night, though, then do it. I'm contemplating getting a henna tattoo of a peacock on my back, out of sight from the camera lens but visible to everyone else, and though some may raise their brows or tsk-tsk and call it a fashion faux pas, I think I'll absolutely love it.  Whatever you wear, I hope you have a fabulous event and memories to cherish.  ~ Pax / Peace : ) Edit:  I neglected to mention the belt in my original answer; I love it and think it would compliment the dress smashingly.  In regards to your added detail about the shop assistants at the Karen Walker store wearing Converse chucks: bear in mind that they are on their feet most of the day, and so for practical purposes more comfortable shoes are necessary. I imagine that for special occasions like the ball they would recommend wearing more sophisticated shoes. If you really didn't want to wear heels, then maybe you could wear sexy booties like these:  : )", 9409, "XOnSRoR2aa", 4],

They have no medical care--you are sitting on a potential health hazard.  If something like rabies or some kind of bacterial infection made one of them sick it would run out of control through all of them and eventually infect other pet cats in the area.

	91770 : ["My friend Josh is the same way. He acts like a cold-emotionless rock. I had a lot of faith in him because I knew he was an incredibly smart guy, but then his stubborn and headstrong attitude went to far and he just completely started blowing off my feelings and how I felt. I don't think you are the kind of kid who just goes and talks about your emotions openly. SO if I were you I would apologize to that person you hurt, because I have a feeling that you can rely and trust that person to listen to you and understand what you are going through. It's sometimes a good thing to be emotionless, but if people are saying that they love you and you have no response then dig deeper into yourself and find out why you are being this way. Often times this happens when kids' parents are divorced or they have a tragic family life. If that's the case, then show everyone who you really are. If you don't care so much, then you won't care who you really are and how to show it. Fix things that are going on in your life which are like baby-steps to your main problem.  All in all, before you do something think hard about what you are saying/doing and how it could come off to someone. And if you slip up, then apologize and tell them you are just out of it. I think that you should find something you enjoy to do. My friend Josh enjoys rapping to Eminem (lol) so try to find things to keep your mind off of it. and if you are comfy doin it then talk to someone. stay true to your friends and JUST BE YOURSELF! in the end...do you WANT to care if people love or hate you for being yourself?!", 9407, "e3d546c8313dcda9c0318e4014cc54e8aa", 1],

Do you have Christian friends who will pray for you? This is important. Ask Christians to pray for you, and to know what God wants you to do now. Please do not hurt yourself.

	91774 : ["This is exactly why a lot of Christians don't teach their children about   Clause or the Easter Bunny. So you believe that maturing means giving up your belief in God. You put God in the same category as   Clause and the Easter Bunny. When parents tell their kids that there is a   Clause or Easter Bunny (I never did) it is not because the parents believe in them. They are fantasy characters meant to give some fun and \"magic\" to the holidays--although I've never understood the idea of someone sneaking into your house while you're sleeping even if they leave candy or presents as something other than creepy. And it's understood that one day the child will learn that these are just fairy tale characters. Parents who teach their children about God are passing along our sincere beliefs to our kids. To assume that something is false simply because one cannot produce the genuine article is naive. Reality is more than what we can pick up with our senses. We teach our children about love. Can you see \"love\"? Not the signs or effects of love. Show me love itself. You can't. Yet love exists. It's not unhealthy or immature to realize that there is something or someone who is bigger, stronger, more powerful than us (humans). And it's not against our nature to realize that there are things beyond our comprehension. In fact, it is this part of us that inspires us to try to learn more.  The fact that we can't see God or produce Him for proof doesn't change the fact that He exists. We see the world that He created. We see and feel His presence in our lives. We see what He does for us personally. We know that God exists in the same way that we know that love exists.", 9411, "r3TYEHMbaa", -1],
