	58708 : ["A \"basic\" computer primarily intended for internet access, assuming you're looking for a desktop running Windows 10, or laptop/Chromebook, could cost you as little as $250-$300. A decent \"basic\" computer capable of playing modern graphically intensive games meeting the minimum recommended developer specs needed to run many of today's most popular games at low to medium quality settings would cost @ $1,500. You'll see some of these potentially as low as $1,000 - $1,100 during promotions and deals at Dell, HP or Newegg and other resellers. You'd possibly have to consider a new monitor and headset capable of displaying and hearing the output delivered by the new GPU and sound chipset. There's no point in getting a gaming PC that you can't see or hear properly, in my opinion. As others have implied, a computer for \"basic\" internet access vs. a capable gaming computer are like comparing a beat up 1966 Dodge Dart to a 2021 Ferrari. The Dodge Dart will eventually get you to where you want to go, with the transmission slipping, the car constantly stalling out, and the brakes squealing all the way to your destination. The Ferrari, with vastly improved internal components, will get you there about 80 times faster, efficiently and powerfully with a cost that reflects its performance.", 8149, "None", 0],
