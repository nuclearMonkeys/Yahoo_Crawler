So - it isn't just the \"exhaust\" from the unit - it is also the CONDENSATION that you need to deal with.   If you want to place an air unit in the door way to the room - you would need to brace it in the TOP of the door frame and place something under it to catch the condensation.  You could then walk under the unit instead of stepping over it to get into the room.", 3077, "None", 0],
