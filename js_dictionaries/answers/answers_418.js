When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 3681, "None", 0],

	22900 : ["Both. There are applications where hydrogen should already be being used but the electric car will probably not be practical due to limitations of creating hydrogen filling stations (unless there is a surge of government money behind it). Making charging stations for electric cars isn't really that hard as electricity is already everywhere. Sure you could add hydrogen to gasoline places but that also means they have to be built. More trucks to deliver the hydrogen, etc.", 3670, "f3d506f1430fab32d23ae661f4553e41aa", 4],
	22901 : ["Hydrogen will never be used.  It is highly flammable and big-time dangerous.  EVs are not the future but the government will spend a ton of tax-payer money trying to shove it down our throat.  EVs do NOT have the torque of ICE cars.  Electricity can never be used in semi-trucks, tractors or construction equipment.   EVs cost a ton of money and like wind-mills and solar, the rest of us have to subsidize it so a few can be smug and think they are better than us.", 3670, "r6oMZ4iyaa", -2],
	22902 : ["Probably both, as well as biofuels, and maybe other technologies we haven't even figured out yet. I suspect electric and biofuels will dominate, for the most part, for standard consumer cars.  We can already make reasonable petroleum substitutes from organic waste, and as the remaining oil gets less and less accessible (and we start actually taking climate change seriously), and the technology for turning things like garbage and agricultural waste into either liquid fuels or biogas improves, we will stop using mined petroleum in favor of bio-sourced petroleum equivalents.  Biodiesel is already stupid easy to make, from things like used cooking oil.  And electric cars are increasing in range, and charging stations are more widespread, so most people will find electric cars adequate to their needs within a few decades at most, with biofuel as a backup for people who want or need more range, or have other specialized requirements (eg live in a remote area with inadequate electric infrastructure). For freight, I suspect it will be a mix of hydrogen and biofuels, mostly things like liquified biogas.  Electric motors would not be optimal for things like semis, except in a setup with some sort of fueled generator, since they need to be able to go very, very long distances, with minimal fueling time.  But transportation trucks would probably be less resistant to fueling that needs to be done by a trained professional, and at a reduced number of actual locations (rather than on every street corner).  So, hydrogen and/or LNG engines for trucks and trains. Air travel is... pretty fussy about fuel source, so I suspect it will be the last holdout, for a while at least, on using fossil fuels, before eventually converting to biofuels (and maybe things like fission power).  Possibly also hydrogen, I'm not sure of the weight to energy profile for compressed hydrogen.", 3670, "s90qOj5Baa", 0],

	22916 : ["Most cars hold about 80lbs or 35kg of fuel. Cutting that weight to 25% but having to go refuel more often will consume fuel.
