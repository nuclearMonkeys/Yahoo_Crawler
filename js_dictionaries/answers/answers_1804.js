	95974 : ["My favourite shows are Supernatural, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: New York and CSI: Miami. I do love a few names from each show. Supernatural - Dean, Samuel and Lilith. Dean is my number one name of all time and I'm really hoping that I get the chance to use it one day. I wouldn't use Samuel in addition to Dean because they're brothers on the show and I'd find that weird for me. Lilith is a darkly attractive name. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation - Catherine and Nicholas \"Nick\". I know they're fairly common names, but I adore them. I also love their characters. Catherine was a favourite name way before I started watching, but Nicholas is a recent favourite and I have no doubt that it's due to Nick Stokes. CSI: New York - I'm not huge on any of their names, actually. CSI: Miami - Eric. True Blood is also responsible for my fairly recent interest in the name. I was never a huge fan because here in the UK it's typically associated with the elderly. After watching these shows I've got myself hooked on the name. I've always found it quite handsome, but now I find it usable. So... Yes. I'd use each of the names mentioned above :)", 9569, "zgXpomfCaa", 0],
	95975 : ["This is my personal opinion. Yes. I do believe the Attitude Era is overrated. I don't mind if people say its the best era of all time, BUT ONLY if they gave each and every era a chance. If you look up the Golden Era, Rock N Wrestling, PG, New Generation etc. and still say the Attitude Era is the best. I can respect that. As long as you gave the others some considerations. So to me, its overrated because I feel most of the biggest following it has are people that don't take the other eras in account. This works the same way with wrestlers. This wrestler is overrated because this guy or that guy was never taken in account. They are praised so much (term for overrated) but its pointless if thats all they have witnessed. My favorite era is the Golden Era, however, I started watching wrestling in 2004. So I wasn't even around. At some point and degree, I can say the Attitude Era was great, but I took a lot of consideration and believe the Golden Era is better. Its just who I am. To me, the Attitude Era is overrated because of their storylines. Yeah they were great and all and certainly unpredictable, but that just changed WWE too much and I hate that. I am more a \"wrestling\" fan, meaning I want to see matches more then storylines, and to me, the Golden Era delivered a fair amount of both wrestling and entertainment. As for the Attitude Era, it just seemed more like entertainment then wrestling. And no, I don't call matches during the attitude era \"wrestling matches\" but brawls. I'm not a huge fan of that. Thats just my personal belief. I don't blame the attitude era or any thing, as it was a bad time for WWE. Fans wanted sex and violence at the time and wrestling was annouced as fake to the world. They had to do it. But to sum it up, Although the attitude era was very entertaining, its overrated because , to me, it did not deliver great wrestling matches. Fights, but not good wrestling matches.", 9568, "None", 0],

	95977 : ["*ring announcer is shouting as the crowd is cheering* \"Ladies and gentlemen,from Romania please welcome FALLEN DIABLO! *walks to ring* Yes ladies and gentlem,for many months me and Dark Demon have been fighting eachother,making eachother's life a hell.Blood,sweat tears have all been a part of our rivalry but fortunately for him he won't have to suffer anymore in the future because we are ending this right now!You see my dear audience tonight the demonic structure of the cage shall make your blood pour out of your body,making you stay in pain *pauses for a second* and Demon you better what the fck flies out of your mouth because I am not the one who will be afraid of you.You see Demon a wise man once said \"Who is more foolish, the child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light?\" well the answer to that is you.You are the child that doesn't want to get out of his fantasy world.You always stay in the darkness,never doing anything else Demon but a man named Martin Luther King Jr. said that \" “Darkness is only driven out with light, not more darkness\" Do you get it Demon?Using all these darkness bullshit against me will not affect me.I remember when we used to be the best of friends.We either go at the night in bars to get some girls,either we didnt do absolutely anything all night,leaving to our houses.Demon you see when you betrayed me,that was the biggest mistake of your life.You don't betray guys like me,I am the one who made you big.If it wasn't for me,you wouldn't have won so much tag gold,if it wasn't for me you would never be where you are today.Demon I'm the one who made you,it wasn't you,it wasn't Schmitt it was me.Demon listen closely to my words because they could very well be the last you hear.Demon just don't cross the line too much and trust  me,if you make it out alive I will never forgive me.Ussualy when someone betrays me like that,I never forgive them.You see Demon revenge is sweeter than life itself. So think fools.And that is what I am a fool,I was a fool actually believing we could be friends,thinking you could change from sitting 24/7 in corners thinking of absolutely nothing intelligent that actually makes sense. You see Demon the pain I was caused during my life is nothing compared to what I will do to you tonight.Demon,in the depth of winter, I finally learned that there was within me an invincible summer,the summer that brings light to the souls of the world.You see Demon,I was walking backstage and I saw you in a corner with a devilish smile on your face.I just want to tell you that you really should laugh now because I will make you cry later.A great friend once told me that when you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.That's exaclty what I did,looked in my heart for a delight I was always waiting for,but I simply couldn't find it. Ah Demon isn't it foolish of you to not come here say anything in response?I assume you do what you always do:lock yourself in a dark room full of smoke saying that \"it's the delight of your soul\".You hear me,light will rise your soul,whereas the darkness will do nothing than harm to you.But I can't do anything to help you,this is the life YOU chose to live.I will not do anything to get you away from that because I will not intercact with you again,I will do it only to cause you more suffering and make you scream in pain because this it looks that you love to live like that.With that being said Demon be prepared for the fight of your life,and be sure that I will use absolutely any way to make you feel like you should have never crossed paths with me,and the cold metal of the cage will be a easy way to make you bleed.So Demon better come here like a man and face me to end it all! EDIT(response):Demon please don't start again with that same old story with MN.MN knew that he made the smartest decision in his life by making an alliance with me.You see Demon that was the past and we cannot change our past. We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way. We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.You should stop acting as if life is a rehearsal. Live this day as if it were your last. The past is over and gone. The future is not guaranteed.That's what I always thought when we two were teaming. Please don't bust about how \"you gave me another chance\".It was all planned by Schmitt so we could fool TWIO.Unfortunately you couldn't do anything for us to win gold.It was ME who gave you a second chance.I wanted to screw that team,go for better thing but no Schmitt wanted me to team with you AGAIN. But Demon those are times far away buried.You see YWWA will witness the rise of a new sun,a new God to protect it from eternal damnation.Nothing,fire,serpent venin,rain,snow absolutely nothing will stop me from taking away your soul.I shall make you Demon wish to die in that moment,wish you never even thought of meeting me.Demon the moment when the cage lowers,that's the moment when I let the rage out of me and when that happens I am unstoppable,a force that will never be destroyed!
