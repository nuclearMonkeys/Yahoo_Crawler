Also, it is the only one I see who guarantee the accuracy. Another thing I would like you to know is that \"Chinese Calligraphy\" is an artform, but you can not find the artform by using dictionary or by typing.   It means, even I can do translation as I am a Chinese who knows English, I still can not have your name in \"Chinese Calligraphy\".  Most Chinese do not practice calligraphy art.  \"Writing Chinese\" and \"Writing Chinese Calligraphy\" are two different level things...    It is another reason I suggest you to go check out www.chineseinkdesign.com.....  They have names/words translated into different Calligraphy forms directly. And you should also check the following sites to get more idea of what you are going to ink: Good luck", 10331, "96fbce8c74f6100d2b0859b6ca061857aa", 0],

I never knew my grandfather on my dads side (or most of his family) as he died when my dad was still young.   So that is what got me started.  Lots of time, and lots of money.

Also someone who enjoys reading and writing because there is a lot of that involved.  Well that's me anyway. I am a middle-aged English woman and I started my family history research 21 years ago. While recovering from an injury and waiting for the painkillers to kick in, I distracted myself by sorting out my mother's numerous cousins which necessitated drawing my first family tree chart. My grandfather's parents had 15 children and 37 grandchildren, so we made a lot of mistakes in that first tree. When I went back to work I began consulting the national index of births at the General Register Office in London in my lunch hours.  The civil registration indexes were in huge tomes with a handle on the spine.  It was quite dangerous working there - once while I was standing at one of the long desks perusing a death index some idiot trying to carry two volumes at once (which was against the rules) dropped one of them on my back! Then I discovered that I could search the census on microfilm at the Public Record Office, also near where I worked.  The census search rooms were in the basement in a series of small rooms down a long corridor - with the thick walls and tiny windows high up it was like dungeons.  I started taking the occasional afternoon off work as lunch hours weren't long enough. I was thrilled when I found my great grandparents in the 1881 census (the most recent one available at that time).  I got to know some of the other regulars and we would share our successes and failures and congratulate someone who had finally found their ancestors after weeks or months of painstakingly scrolling through microfilm. I have relatives still living in the county where many of my ancestors originated so it was easy to find the opportunity to visit the County Record Office and consult the parish registers of baptism, marriage and burial, often handling the original books wearing special gloves, as few of them were microfilmed then. I have got all my lines back to the early C19th, some back to the early C18th.  I lost interest in going abroad long ago, and I now spend all my holidays in the UK in places where I would like to do research.  I alternate days at the archives with days sightseeing, though my days out are often spent visiting churches and clambering about in graveyards. Hard to say what my motivation is, once I started I just couldn't stop and have been addicted to genealogy ever since. When I can't get back any further I just branch out sideways and find all the relatives I can.

I enjoy going through old Church Registers, and seeing the actual signatures (or their marks!) of people who are just names to me. Am never happier than when there are old documents around. Basically I am so nosey. Don't only want to know what happened, but why, and the result. I have found out many things that were family skeletons I'll bet my parents never knew. Am sure my ancestors are turning in their graves at their secrets being exposed. Unfortunately sometimes that means there are more questions than answers.

	112915 : ["Some people acquire the role of victims, and this coupled with appropriate behavior, acts as a psychological 'invite' to others to bully them. There's a good book called 'Games People Play' by Eric Berne, who developed Transactional Analysis many years ago - it simply and clearly identifies the many psychological 'games' that are common place.    You'll find this in good bookstores, Amazon etc :  We become skilled, from our childhood, in being able to pick up on others personalities, as well as the games that they potentially initiate.  We'll typically run through the same psychological strategies and sequences millions of times through our lives, as there is a huge number of people out there ready to join us. Typically, victims enagage in what are viewed more child ego states, than adult. and the persecutors may take on a critical parent type role, in order to complete the sequence.   But we have control and choice over our behaviors, and we can move into a more adult state,  where we are more authentic and natural, and stop such interactions from happening. I hope this helps introduce you to the concept of psychological games,  and roles that people frequently take on board in their lives, in order to 'play' them.  We unconsciously select others to engage with in this way, and switch between internalised identities, with pre-formatted strategies, in order to affirm our beliefs about ourselves and others, such as I'm no good, you can't trust others, etc.  Games ultimately are a method to avoid intimacy - our authentic real selves with comparable others - and self awareness if a great way to start to take control of our lives, our behaviors and, ultimately, what we get from life and our relationships with others.

But in addition to what they;re raised on, they are exposed to other food choices when they are with other kids, at school, and in the media.  At some point they will have to make their own decisions.  Inevitably, if you deny a kid something, they will want it more. If they've never been allowed to try things at home, they're going to jump at the chance to do it somewhere else.   It's easy to control what a preschooler eats,, but eventually they have to eat in other places.  I think that by giving them healthy food the majority of the time and letting them eat whatever they want occasionally, parents can teach them that eating is not an act of self-discipline or denial; it's something we do to stay healthy AND to be social, enjoy food, etc.   Parents should talk to their kids about how to plan meals and pick foods.

It has led me to some surprises (have a living half sister - yet to make contact) and has been endlessly fascinating.
