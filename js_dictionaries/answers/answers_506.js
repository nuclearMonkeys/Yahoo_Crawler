	28293 : ["Not sure about spiders, but a few years back I heard my terrier making a ruckus in my backyard.  I went outside to find her with a baby possum in her mouth, violently thrashing it from side to side. I shouted for her to stop and she ran into the house, leaving the poor little possum lying twisted and motionless on the grass.  I poked it a few times with my toe but there was no sign of life, so I grabbed a shovel from the shed to scoop it into the trash bin. The moment I got it off the grass, the little guy hopped to his feet, looked at me and began sprinting up the shovel handle towards my hands.... Let me tell you, the \"Matrix\" and \"Crouching Tiger\" guys would have been proud of the back flip and flying kick I executed to boot the shovel and suddenly-resurrected passenger clean into my  neighbor's yard.", 4402, "280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa", 1],

	28296 : ["1 thin comes to mind. If you try to swing it you WILL hit something. Chances to get stuck with a tool like this in something would increase when used inside. You may hit  ceiling, a wall, piece of furniture or even worse the loved ones you are trying to defend. When a tool or a weapon becomes dangerous to user or those you defend it becomes either too dangerous or it becomes useless. Leave it as a tool not  weapon. You would be better with a baseball bat or machete. Another is to look at the mess this would create. And the fact if multiple attackers and this tool is buried and stuck in a individual you just gave up your weapon. Another useless weapon being stuck in enemy. Poor choice. Would be better to learn to defend without a weapon first. Than learn simple weapons like knives and short sticks (think Kali or escrima). Short sticks like in Kali can do a lot of damage fast and not messy like the garden tool you want to use. Also it is too big and bulky, easy to trip over if let near a door or night stand. These are things you did not think of. When a tool or weapon imposes danger to user that tool or weapon becomes useless when needed in life threatening situation. Since chances of you getting hurt or killed is increased by use of a tool as such. Also another is this is a 2 handed weapon or tool. Which means you already on loosing end in struggle for life. Making you a better target when you try to swing weapon. Another is ease of use and recovery. You might as well use a sledge hammer. You can not recover in time if you miss with weapon or you need to restrike. This means if i were to attack you at home right now. And you with you tool. Even with me not having a weapon, I would take that weapon from you and beat you and your family to death with it. Why? To make a point that is a tool and a useless weapon that will not keep every one alive but instead would get you and them KILLED.", 4397, "None", 1],

To answer your question, first understand a few fine principles in any physical conflict is as follows: you will get hit if you don't hit back, the hitting will continue there will be blood if they don't tap out , knock them out Be the aggressive one if it's gotten to that point, no need for peace talks. violence isn't the best option but know it is an option. 3 things to remember close the distance between you and the individual, gain a dominant position and finish the fight. Enhance the gateway to your career path with Global MBA. The best way to win is to hit the attacker in the nose with the palm of your hand, in an upward motion, as hard as you can. This will break their nose, or at least seriously hurt them, and stun them for a moment. Everyone, no matter who they are, will be in a lot of pain and won't even be able to see very well when their nose has been smashed. This will buy you enough time to get away, or if you can't get away, it will stun them enough that you can land a few more solid hits to finish them.", 4391, "kwKqS1dlaa", 1],

Jiu-jitsu, on the other hand, was designed to be used defensively, not offensively, offense being contrary to the ways of jiu-jitsu.  So, if you are a pacifist and you have dedicated yourself to strictly using your martial art to defend yourself, to take down an opponent who is attacking you, then jiu-jitsu is likely to be more effective, but if you aren't a pacifist and want to be able to go out and attack someone, to be the attacker, and take them down, then krav maga will be more effective.

	28334 : ["My answer is referring to graded stakes races, which are thoroughbred horse races in the United States: Obviously, interference is against the rules, with or without a Jockey. Horse racing is a very dangerous sport. However, I don't believe there has never been a case in history that a race horse that lost his jockey caused a problem on the track by interfering with other horses. It's, also, fact that it is very rare for a horse to lose his jockey. These are quality horses, and even without a jockey trained race horses know where the finish line is, and will make it there by the end of the race if allowed. When horses workout on the track, they're always asked to run hard until the finish line. It is what they know, horses are very smart and they learn. Thoroughbred racehorses love to run and they enjoy beating the other horses. Horse-racing enthusiasts like to say that the jockey accounts for 10 percent of a horse's performance on any given day.  As indicated the outriders will try and catch the horse and pull him up. In any event the rule calls for disqualification if \"a leading horse or any other horse in a race swerves or is ridden to either side so as to interfere with, intimidate, or impede any other horse or jockey.\" If the horse loses the rider after the break and before the wire, the horse is disqualified, not least because he is abruptly carrying substantially less weight and a horse must cross the wire carrying the same amount the rider weighed in at before the race. With that it's important to have a jockey. Jockey's can help a great horse win. The best jockeys know an animal's strengths and weaknesses. Plus, the best jockeys will understand these differences in the horse they ride on, and the other main contenders of the race.", 4406, "552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa", 5],
	28335 : ["Most jockeys know how to avoid loose horses in running.  This happens more often in National Hunt races in any case **, and if the horse falls and gets up again, it eventually runs out (around the fences) rather than keeps on jumping without a jockey onboard.  More proof to me, that horses were never meant to jump!!   If this happens on the Flat, it can cause chaos, but again I've never seen one prevent another horse with jockey from winning. I guess you are referring to a specific race where you live? **   Which is why the comments made here by people outside the UK.   LOL.   We have no 'outriders' to collect loose horses.  And we don't pony our horses down to the start either which I think is much better as you can see the horses' paces as it goes down (to the start).
