For the latter, get a computerized one that you can program; don't limit yourself to just the handful of stitch patterns on most machines. For the former, doing mostly construction, not machine embellishing, my basic Viking has been a good reliable.  It coped just fine when I made my Elizabethan corset. I plan to get just 2 more machines other than that one: a good serger, and a fancy embroidery machine once I have $5000 to blow on the one I really want.

They are also very reliable. My mom has had hers for over 30 years, and it still works like a dream. Her model came with a set of cams for patterned stitching, and a full range of other accessories: feet, buttonholer, blind hem attachment, ruffler, smocker, can't remember everything. Good luck, and happy crafting. Singer used to be pretty good, they sold out and in recent years has become less reliable. JMHO.", 11395, "bc826fef08e82e1ba0f9b3c29a0afd7eaa", 0],

	138628 : ["I'm going to ignore the answers above me since they're trying to be all proper in their response. They really need to stop their Disney view on life - no, there isn't someone meant for everyone, no beauty isn't necessarily in the eye of the beholder (individual variations exist in what exactly beauty means to the individual and in that sense, it is in the \"eye of the beholder\", but society does have an overall objective definition of what beauty is). And it is this objective definition that I'm going to delve into since that is the cause behind you stating that your question is a 'factual' one, when it really isn't. Beauty, at least in our society, is determined by culture and media. Whether you like it or not, we're essentially brainwashed into what we regard as beautiful. In certain cultures over the world, people find girls that are overweight to be beautiful because that's how they've been raised to believe. White individuals are all over the media, along with black and hispanics. Indians, it is significantly less. Indian men are slightly more in cinema than Indian women (Kal Penn, the guy that plays Sayid in lost, etc., whereas the only Indian woman that comes off the top of my head is Kelly from the Office). Therefore, it's even worse for Indian women to have any kind of light. Furthermore, Indian society in general values a successful career more than many other races. Indian women are generally very intelligent. From being controlled by the British and even their own men to becoming very successful - I see this as a very beautiful development which I can't find anywhere. However, this forces a lot of Indian women to become bookish. Anyone who knows the power of make-up knows that it can make any mediocre or ugly girl look like a queen, which is the case with so many white girls, black girls, hispanics, etc. Indian girls pay less attention to their appearance unless they're formally going somewhere where they need to look good. Therefore, this adds to your negative opinion. Also, there are various Indian girls that do take care of themselves, and they're simply gorgeous. And because Indian people generally pay less attention to their looks as a whole, many people will tell you that they're either really beautiful or really ugly, that there is no middle ground. However, such is the same case for any race, except that putting on make-up is making it seem otherwise.", 11393, "None", 6],
