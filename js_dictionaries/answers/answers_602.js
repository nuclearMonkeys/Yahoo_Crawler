Our disallowed goal was definitely controversial, but glad to see us get the job done TBH, I just hope we can secure onto second spot. Despite the above, Ryan makes a good point about the CL, we need to improve, it doesn't do us much good to qualify for the CL if we go out at the group stage - semi-finals of the EL is fine, but we need to be able to do that in the CL most of all and we'll get the added bonus of not playing on Thursdays too, despite the quality of the teams in that competition, being superior in general or at least we should expect that.", 5155, "92cb2sq7aa", 0],

I think it was also Neymar who led the parody of Haaland's celebration last year right? I mean you have to admire it he always has a point to prove Neymar does, but what's the point in gloating if you don't get the trophies to back it up? This has been PSG's problem for years they act as if they are champions for getting through a tie or getting a big first leg win. I wouldn't mind seeing them win it this year because Neymar is a great player, as is Mbappe. Keylor Navas also a massively underrated goalkeeper a big fan of him", 5156, "q1BX2eXuaa", 1],
