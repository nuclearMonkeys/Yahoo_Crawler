I feel sure this is the reality you're trying to impress by way of the analogy but its really not sufficiently different from the actual world as we live to provide the fresh insight and \"seeing it again for the first time\" experience that an analogy is suppose to give.   That being said, you really do Christianity a disservice by insinuating its just a system of random facts.  An informed, honest individual would have to agree whether you believe Christianity or not, it does have a degree of internal consistency and makes sense if you accept the basic premise of it. Also, you neglect the possibility there really is a God.  If there is then you have to admit that that God should have the right to get to know His creation on a personal level and that process would be perceived as a religion by some.  If there really is a God then you have the added element of this supreme Being confirming the true and proper way to those who are open to Him although it may be in a way that we wouldn't expect.  It wouldn't just be a matter of two different opposing belief sets.  One would be true and all others would be false.  Skeptics say this is intolerant but isn't all truth exclusive?  So, what it comes down to is, is there a God and has He chosen to allow us to know Him.  What would YOU say to an almighty supreme Being if He revealed Himself and called you to lay down your arms, fall on your face and call Him Lord?

The old testament has 333 prophecies about the first coming of Jesus Christ and 456 specific details about his life(all written between 400 and 2200 years before he was born). The 4 gospels in the new testament(Mathew, Mark, Luke & John) tell the story of Jesus. Had those 4 gospel writers chosen to not write their gospels, we could still have re-created the whole life of Christ just from the old testament(all written before he was born). In fact, that is how the christians preached the gospel in the first 20-30 years after the death of Christ. They preached it from the old testament because the new testament was in the process of being  written. The story of Christ is all there in the Old Testament including some details about His life that are not even mentioned in the New Testament. Can you show me some prophecies about Judy Crower?   Then you have 27 books in the New Testament about Jesus Christ, all written about 2,000 years ago. You also have all of the writings by the church fathers about Jesus anout 1900-2000 years ago. You also have writings from that time right up to the present by christian believers and writers.   You also have a lot of secular non christian writers from that time who mentioned Jesus. As far as extra-biblical writings about the life of Jesus, writings confirming His birth, ministry, death and resurrection include Josephus, The Babylonian Talmud, Pliny the younger's letter to the emperor Trajan, The annals of Tacitus, Mara Bar Serapion, Suetonius's 'Life of Claudius' and 'Life of Nero' and also Thallus. Read Dr. Gary Habermas. He's written a number of books mostly on the resurrection. He goes through all these.   Now lets look at Judy Crower. You've got historical revision writings about Judy Crower going back 10 generations. That's just 400 years. Therefore, you can look back at the historical records and you'll see Judy Crower back to about the year 1700. Before that, She doesn't exist. But you can find thousands of writings about Jesus before 1700( and therefore, before there is any record of Judy Crower).   I can show plenty of historical evidence for Jesus Christ.

	87696 : ["Who denies it? Not me... Christianity needs to be mocked and ridiculed at every opportunity. Think of it as a Public Service. It is the moral responsibility and ethical duty of rational people to protect vulnerable minds from being contaminated by Bronze Age myths and willful ignorance. Beyond that, Christianity represents a HUGE THREAT to the well-being and survival of our country and to the whole world... and so it must be confronted. I prefer the term 'rationalist', or 'free thinker', as opposed to 'atheist', 'agnostic', or 'unbeliever', since the former capture more of the people who think that religious beliefs are stupid and irrelevant than do the latter. Those terms capture the main reason that people BECOME rationalists... i.e., they have learned how to THINK properly. Once someone learns how to think properly, religious belief is one of the first casualties. Religious belief... particularly the Abrahamic death cults of desert monotheism (Judaism, Christianity, Islam)... simply cannot withstand the glaring light of reason and critical thought. It just evaporates. Poof. The fact that Christians assert and promote such ridiculous beliefs is a clear indication that they CAN'T (or WON'T) think properly. Rational people recognize that SOME of the people (a few) who visit this forum are truly, sincerely seeking answers... with an open mind (willing to honestly consider alternative possibilities), and with intellectual honesty (willingness to freely question and doubt their own presumptions). That being the case, it is the MORAL OBLIGATION of rational people to HELP them keep their minds open, and to make them aware of some of those alternative possibilities. Inevitably, those alternative possibilities DO NOT include things like a 6,000 year-old earth and heaven, a solid 'firmament' structure (the sky) separating the earth from heaven (terrarium earth), talking snakes (with legs) and donkeys, a shepherd staff that turns into an asp, demons chased out of people and into pigs, friendly spirits, evil spirits, walking on water, multiplying loaves and fishes, food falling from the sky, conception by a ghost, people raised from the dead, the sun stopping in its tracks, parting seas, people being bodily sucked up into heaven (which, by the way, lies on the 'other side' of the sky), world-wide flood that drowned the earth to a depth of 40 feet above the tallest mountain, creating people from a dust bunny and a rib, a magical tree of knowledge, god speaking from a burning bush... and ritual cannibalism, by eating god in the form of a cracker.  ****************** \"A thorough reading and understanding of the Bible is the surest path to atheism” ~ Donald Morgan ****************** So, when someone comes along in a PUBLIC VENUE such as this one, regurgitating dogmatic slogans and bible verses, and the myths, superstitions, fairy tales and fantastical delusions of a tribe of ignorant Bronze Age fishermen and peripatetic goat herders, and declares them to represent some kind of cosmic 'TRUTH' (without the least bit of credible evidence)... well, by golly, that just HAS TO BE confronted... and scorned... and ridiculed. *********** \"Myth has been needed precisely because we were not in a position to understand the universe on its own terms, through the language of natural law and direct examination of its workings on a material, rational level. Once that process of understanding is completed—and we are well on our way to achieving that—the use of myth can be discarded. Its continuing retention is already proving to be counter-productive.\" - Earl Doherty *********** \"I am treated as evil by people who claim that they are being oppressed because they are not allowed to force me to practice what they do.\"  ~ D. Dale Gulledge *********** In order to have a rational view of the universe, it is necessary that one possess the mental faculties that facilitate reason, logic and critical thought. The things that are entailed by Christian beliefs demonstrate, beyond any doubt, a LACK of those faculties. Christians do serve a useful purpose in this forum, though... as a classic 'bad example'. They obligingly trot out assertions about impossible happenings and circumstances, and magical delusions, and glaring misconceptions about science and nature and the universe... which can then be rationally confronted and exposed, and their preposterousness revealed.  ******************** \"A country without village idiots is not worth living in. Without them there is no way of knowing who are sane. ~ Oliver St. John Gogarty ******************** \"The god who is reputed to have created fleas to keep dogs from moping over their situation must also have created fundamentalists to keep rationalists from getting flabby.  Let us be duly thankful for our blessings.\"  ~ Garrett Hardin ******************** Rational people are NOT trying to CONVERT Christians; we are trying to protect people FROM Christians, and the insidious mind killing delusions and willful ignorance which they seek to spread, as if they were some kind of organized, dogmatic insanity virus.  However, rational people generally DO respect everyone's right (in the privacy of their own minds) to delude themselves in whatever fashion they may deem fit.  Science, logic, reason, and critical thought have long been regarded (by religious people) as the enemies of religion. Considering that those are the tools of highly intelligent people, it should not come as a huge shock to learn that intelligence (or lack of it) has some connection to religious belief. In fact, there are about 40 studies, conducted over the past 80 years or so, that reveal a statistically significant NEGATIVE CORRELATION between intelligence and religiosity. In plainer language, that means that they found that the more intelligent a person is, the LESS likely that person is to be religious... or, conversely, the LESS intelligent a person is, the MORE likely that person is to be religious. If you think about it, those findings make a lot of sense. Intelligence tests mainly provide an indication of reasoning ability and problem solving ability... logic, reason and critical thought. These are the very qualities that see through religion, and recognize it for what it is; i.e., religion cannot survive the glaring light of reason and critical thought. This was well understood by important figures in religious history. This is why the early church destroyed all the 'tainted' (non-canonical) writings, which were in conflict with dogma... Greek philosophy, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, engineering... all the good stuff. By this means, Christianity dragged humanity directly into the Dark Ages, and set back human progress between 800 - to - 1,000 years. (If it hadn't have been for Christianity, Christopher Columbus would probably have been going on a mission to set up a mining colony in the asteroid belt, or something like that, rather than trying to prove that the world was a sphere, and find a shortcut to the Orient.) Just to illustrate the point, let's see what Martin Luther, the 'father' of protestantism, had to say about 'reason' and secular knowledge: \"Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed. Faith must trample underfoot all reason, sense, and understanding, and whatever it sees must be put out of sight and ... know nothing but the word of God.\" ~ Martin Luther \"Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but -- more frequently than not -- struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God.\" ~ Martin Luther \"There is on earth among all dangers no more dangerous thing than a richly endowed and adroit reason... Reason must be deluded, blinded, and destroyed.\" ~ Martin Luther \"Reason should be destroyed in all Christians.\" ~ Martin Luther Christianity is essentially a criminal business enterprise... in fact, it is the world's longest running and most successful Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) scam. The product they are selling is the illusion of 'salvation'... and the 'pay plan' doesn't kick in until after you're dead. Meanwhile the VICTIMS (having been deceived into believing that it is their God-given duty) are out there busily recruiting MORE victims. What a racket! FORTUNATELY, it only works on those who are gullible enough, and sufficiently lacking in critical thinking skills, to fall for it, and buy in to the prepackaged delusion. UNfortunately, THAT accounts for about 75% of the population of the USA. (There are a lot more people who DON'T know how to think properly than there are people who DO know how to think properly.) That is why there are a lot more religious people in the USA than there are 'Free-thinkers'... including Atheists. Also, Christians are generally too dense to realize that proselytizing (spreading the 'good news') is a key element of the Christian MLM MARKETING PLAN, which was instituted after Christianity lost the political power that had previously allowed them to simply torture and kill anybody who did not comply. Now, they obliviously try to just pester and annoy people to death, through persistent obnoxiousness. If you stop to think about it, you will realize that Christians are very much like the Borg, on Star Trek Next Generation: \"You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.\"  I would not be surprised to learn that thoughts of Christianity provided the 'creative spark' for the Borg concept. Interestingly, statistics on supernatural beliefs count the USA on a par with backward, developing Third World nations, rather than among modern, advanced industrial powers. ******************** \"Selling eternal life is an unbeatable business, with no customers ever asking for their money back after the goods are not delivered.\" ~ Victor J.

If one of the halves were raised atheistic by your standard they would just believe because they were taught it.  I think your point is that Christians might be wrong... I think the overall point is that all men could be wrong and it is wise to consider the rationality of your own beliefs. I would only caution people in one thing.  When weighing your beliefs make sure that you are weighing the things that you actually profess. If you are a Christian there are a lot of things that people say we believe that simply are not accurate. I don't think we have to spend time analyzing those issues.  The best question for a Christian is \"Did Christ rise from the dead\"... it all stands or falls on this.", 9268, "YcDL1C1naa", 5],
	87709 : ["To answer the question... \"Christians, can you admit that the following argument shows you can be wrong about god?\" I can admit that that hyperthetical \"experiment\" investigates human desire to look to a god, for faith, for assurance there is something bigger than us, beyond us. I can admit that placing a belief system into the lives of experimental subjects will inevitablly produce faithful followers. But in reality I can also witness that God, the living and real God has made a visible and real difference in my life.  At the end of it all, If my faith leads only to nothing then I have lost nothing. If my faith leads me to be in the presence of an awsome and almighty creator who knows my whole life inside and out and knows me as a friend too, then I have gained everything!

	87710 : ["Your thought experiment has been tried, most recently in the Soviet Union and China.  Under the official atheism of communism, religion was viewed as the opium of the people, and generations were raised to be atheistic freethinkers. Without the positive influence of Christianity as the basis of freedom, there was no check on totalitarian rule.  All freedoms disappeared, and wide-scale political imprisonment and murders became commonplace. Christianity survived in these countries because it is true.  It is not an ideology imposed on people, but the historical facts about God coming to live among his people. One final point:  Christianity would never dream of imposing totalitarian rule such as you envision. Only the atheistic mind could entertain such ruthless fantasies.
