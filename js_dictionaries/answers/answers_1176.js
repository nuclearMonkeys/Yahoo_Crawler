I too lost my dog this year, she was 13 and absolutely perfect, she had no vices and I love her so much.  I too felt guilty when she died but I knew she wasn't happy. She had too much wrong with her. You're definately not crazy but a caring loving person. just remember the good times and the unique bond you had. in time you may feel like giving a home to another dog and life will have a meaning again but you'll never forget  the dog you've just lost.  Keep a photo around and recall the funny things she did.  be glad you had her rather than sad she's gone.", 8245, "788891c2a24a649e4d6a39438ec61884aa", 1],

Losing a pet is no diferent than losing a close human friend, but too few people understand that.  You take as long as you need to grieve.  I STILL cry over my horse, who died 25 years ago.  No, the pain isn't as bad, but it still hurts sometimes.  Give yourself a little time, and don't be afraid to ask for help.  There is nothing wrong with you.

You have been through so much unspeakable pain and then now to lose your best friend .... there just are no words for it I had to let my dog go, I think of it as showing her the road to Heaven, she was so very ill, it causes me such pain now to just think about it, to write about it, there are so many memories that you just can not touch because they cry out in such anguish as you can see by all the letters you have received you are not alone in your feelings ... hopefully this band of support will somehow give you some sort of comfort like a million arms in the darkness holding on to you please feel free to email me if you ever want or need  to talk  I will keep a light on for you", 8245, "K7Y8x3Xdaa", 2],
	64297 : ["Caninequeen you should have put in a tissue alert before typing that one :) Im so sorry for the loss of your dear Anna. I know this is little comfort but very few will beable to help you out and tell you what time is a good time, because we are all so different in our greiving and it sounds like loosing your Anna is a really big deal.......and that is OK.  We love our animals like they are our own babies, and the ache you feel can last for a long time. I lost a very loved pet (cat) 11 years ago, and still often think of her and even shed a tear now and again (just typing this now is starting me again) and I thought that i could never ever replace her, I did get a new \"friend\" a couple of months later, because like you i was feeling a void in that companionship, but didnt feel a bond for a long time.  Emma (the new friend) is still with me today, and with time she has become really really special and important to me........I call her my angel cat because she seemed to forgive my initial rejection and tried and tried untill i could no longer push her away, she seemed to know why it was happening and how i was feeling. I strongly believe that our pets are very intuitive and without words understand when our hearts are aching, and wait patiently by our side untill the ache starts to dissapear and then when there is room in the heart again, they snavel it up and help you heal, but never expect you to forget.", 8245, "None", 0],

It doesn't seem like you are ready for a \"relationship\" with a new dog. You seemed to have had a very strong bond with Anna and are not ready to develop that bond quite yet. I would wait a little..give yourself some time to grieve. Yo will never get over Anna and you will never replace her, but you do need to be emotionally ready for the next relationship...that's only fair to not only the dog but to yourself.

Below are two links with some useful information about the grieving process that may help normalize how you're feeling. I'm sure if you decide that this isn't the time to get a new dog, you'd find a good home for her. We can't tell you what to do since each of us grieve differently. You may develop feelings for this new dog once you sort out your feelings also.  See if there's any support groups out there near where you are that may also be very helpful.

	64300 : ["I feel the same way you do . I have a cat and for some reason I don't have the same feelings that I had with my other cat. I got a new cat 6 months later that was like 5 years ago when I got my new kitten and now she is a cat.  I have been told by a Vet to wait 6 months to 1 year to get another dog or cat. Just think you brought in a new puppy and just give it a lot of love. I did that with my cat and I have given her a lot of love and she is happy. She makes me laugh. Give your dog a loving home with you and give it lots of love and play with it. How long after you got your dog? Give it time and give the dog loves.I had to make the decision and I talked to the Vet and other people and that helped.  There is web site that you can get on to talk to people and they can help you deal with this or you can talk to a Vet and ask them or even friends that will help you. It worked for me. I hope this helped and I will pray for you and your new dog.", 8245, "None", 0],

	64302 : ["This just happened to me this morning with a Boxer puppy. 7 weeks old. Been on just hard kibble now for for 2 days. I was able to bring her back by performing the Heimlich and had to do mouth to nose. I noticed her choking because she was well choking. I thought she would cough it out but in less than a minute she was on the floor unresponsive. After this she had a large amount of frothy foam that was bloody coming from her mouth and nose along with very fast shallow breathing. my wife has her at the vet right now and I'm nervous as hell. She was basically dead in my arms and I was able to bring her back. It should be rewarding but now I worry that maybe I damaged her trying to revive her. Just my 2 cents. Puppies can choke on any dry kibble. Dogs can as well. I race harness horses and they choke too. There is not much we can do about it. Anytime a solid is going down a pipe there is the possibility of blockage. Ask a plumber.", 8245, "tYFORKIVaa", 0],
	64303 : ["The same thing happened to me last year. I thought I was ready and then I just could not bond with the new puppy. I had no good reason for it because she was so cute, house trained, was already learning to sit, wait, etc... she wasn't a barker or anything but there was just no bond. I did place her in a new home because I wanted her to have the love she deserved. I don't know what is best for you, I felt a lot of guilt but it was best for both of us.

	64304 : ["The Rainbow Bridge Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... Author unknown...             It is hard to let go and u may never love another animal as much as u did Anna. Get a cuddler breed they might help you i mean all dogs are way cute and being able to snuggle with it alot is a bounus. Good luck, you'll see Anna again some day.

	64307 : ["Oh my friend i so totally understand where your coming from, i lost the best friend i will ever have in my life, my wonderful mum, she died  on January the 6th of this year after a very short battle with Lung Cancer and it still feels like somebody has ripped my heart out and smeared it all over my face! When mum first passed away it didn't seem real, i felt like i was on the outside looking in and is wasn't really happening, and i kept thinking I'd come home from work at 6pm and she'd be the first person I'd see when i walked through the door and then it hits me like a bl@@dy freight train that she's gone and i will never ever see her again and the hurt and the anger that i felt when she first passed away kicks in all over again. My friends have all been brilliant, my mum was a strong Irish lady and family was very important to her and many of my friends and my 3 brothers and 2 sisters friends virtually lived at our house and mum was like a 2nd mum to them all, and her sad un timely death really hit them hard as well. My partner has been brilliant and if im honest if he hadn't have been there for me over the last couple of months i think i would have gone clinically insane, some days the pain and emptiness i feel inside is so over whelming i feel like giving up and joining my mum, other days i feel fine and can cope with what ever the world and his wife wants to throw at me. People each deal with greif differently, some people can talk openly about the person they have lost, others find it hard as it's to upsetting for them and others around them. I talk about my mum a lot, she was the person who gave me life, loved me unconditionally, stood by me, beleived in me and made me the person i am today, she was  an amazing lady and i will never ever forget her and will never stop loving her. You do what feels right for you, if you want to talk about your dad, do it, if you need to cry, cry, dont bottle things up inside and smile on the outside, it's still so early for you and what your going through is a normal part of the greiving process. I dont know how long it will take me or you to get over the death of our parents, but i know one day we'll both be able to think of them and the heart wont feel as though it's breaking  and the dark cloud of anger/frustration will slowly lift, it will take time, but it will happen. I hope this has been of some help and i apolgise if i have waffled on. Take care.XXXX", 8245, "c9c6728a1851854f18d400e7f8246eecaa", 0],
	64308 : ["I lost my mother 10 months ago and honestly you can never really \"get over it\". There are a lot of things my mom won't get to see me do like get married and have kids, my bf and I had just bought a house a few weeks before she got sick and she never even had a chance to see it (she lived in another state).  No matter what the circumstances are no one will ever be able to understand how you feel, it wasn't their loss it was your loss, my bf is a very caring person but he can't say anything that will make me feel better when something triggers that uncontrollable grief.  I totally understand that bottling it up makes you more angry and frustrated and you probably take some of it out on your bf b/c you feel like he isn't being supportive enough, I have felt that same way but it may be more beneficial to talk to a professional grief counsellor or phycologist/psychiatrist.  Our significant others can't understand exactly how we feel, it wasn't his parent that died, it doesn't mean he doesn't care for you.  But I do think talking to a professional will benefit you.  As for his mother telling you to get over it, you should kindly tell her that everyone reacts to things differently and you love and miss your dad so much and she should understand that and if she doesn't then she is a cold person and u should ignore her.  I'm sorry for your loss, I know how truly hard it is to overcome the loss of a parent.", 8245, "None", 0],
	64309 : ["Dear Annier, I lost my Dad a few months ago to cancer, too.  No, you are not unusual to feel grief now.  Your Dad was the first and most important man in your life for years.  He held you when you first came into this world.  He was proud to watch you grow up and turn into a beautiful young woman (aren't you glad he lived long enough to see all that?).  To turn your back on a lifetime of your history with him would be cold and uncaring.   Your partner and his mom, however, are rather cold people.  Perhaps this situation should raise a few red flags for you about them.  Even if they didn't have good relationships with their fathers, they should RESPECT your genuine grief and love for your Dad, and they don't seem to be able to do that.  Examine your relationship and make certain that your partner isn't over controlling about all your likes and loves in life.  If he is, he needs to go.  You are a full and complete person, and you don't have to have his permission to think, love, feel, respond, care or grieve.   Good luck, hon.  I hope your grief grows lighter as the days pass.  Yes, you are normal that out of the blue it will hit you.  Does me, too.  I cry and feel a bit better, but there is still a huge empty place where my Dad once stood.  I guess it will always be there.  We deal with it and continue with our lives as best we can.   Hugs, Darlin'.", 8245, "8f7484cd58d5ae1f35f8ec33cbe9d727aa", 0],
	64310 : ["Reading your questions and people's answers made me cry. My daddy left me 10 years ago, also because of cancer. He was the one that I cared most and admired. He was the wisdom of the family. I trusted him most, but he was chosen to leave. I grieved for a very long time. You have all the right to be upset. My then boyfriend, now husband is the type like your partner, who is kind of \"cold\", purly because first he is a guy, more so, he is the type that doesn't like to open himself up. Two, he hasn't experienced enough to understand. Now he is a daddy, and he is much more sensitive. I believe you have ppl around you that can understand your feeling (like all the ppl who answered your question here) So don't be angry, because the feeling of anger will just hurt you more and make you a grunchy person. Your daddy is watching  you from somewhere, so be happy for him. He will want to see you become a stronger person and carry on what's he left. Take care!", 8245, "w1fguFUjaa", 0],
	64311 : ["I lost my mum 5 years ago when i was 17 it was very sudden and very unexpected it was the hardest time of my life and i know exactly how you feel. Mu mum was also my best friend and now there is a big hole in my life that will never be filled. i know how it feels when people say get over it they are obviously very heartless and never lost anyone they are very close too. I will never get over my mum dying but i have accepted it and it does get easier with time even though you don't think it will. I bottled it up for a very long time as i was to busy trying to be strong for my dad who was very unstable at the time but it is not good to bottle things up. i have times now where i just burst in to tears it could be a song or something somebody says that sets me off. I know it feels like people have forgotten and moved on already but people deal with it in different ways and that is just there way. You will come to accept your fathers death but you won't get over it. He is your dad and no one will ever take that away from you.

	64312 : ["sweety, only TIME will heal your wounds.  It is always difficult when we lose a loved one.  Especially a parent.  What helped me to get beyond it sometimes was not to remember how he died, but how he LIVED.  Those memories can never be taken away from you.  When my gram died, I was devistated.  She had pancreatic cancer, and was sent home with hospice to die in my parents bed.  I never realized that death was such a PROCESS.  Watching her die,didn't hurt as much as me having to live without her.  Her absence from  daily routines was hardest to bear.  I just look at the beauty in the heavens, and mother nature and KNOW  that she is in an awesome place.  Whenever I think of gram, a beautiful butterfly will flutter ever so close, and I know that she is visiting to tell me shes happy and that she is still near us.  Perhaps it seems everyone else got over it so quickly, because life is so full of our own worries of work money health etc.  Adult schedules don't leave a lot of room for grieving.  If you want to \"moan\" to me about your feelings, feel free to e-mail me.  I'd be happy to listen.  I can promise you that it does get easier with time.

	64313 : ["My mother died in 1977 after I left home and got married. I still feel that lost. Its human to miss someone you love. Now your grieving and it hurts. It will for a while until you are ready to be at peace with what you feel for them. Grief is one of the strongest emotions we feel besides love. You will begin to cope with it better as time goes by, don't worry, it's only been a little while since he crossed over. That's what we Indians call making the trip over. (We believe you go on to live in the spirit.)  You are feeling the way you need to for the stage your in. I don't agree with the people who tell you to get over it. I think that's insensitive with all due respect, I think they should be giving you alot of hugs and understanding at this time. It helps when people can sympathize with you. No, I mean it, we need compassion at this time in life, and never to be told not to feel grief or lost when someone dies that we love, that's just not good consideration for others. Your ok and what your feeling is healthy so maybe it's better to get into some grief counseling because the people there are all experiencing what you are and it is supportive. Do it asap, by the way you can still talk to your dad from your heart and say anything you want to about how you miss him. Never mind the people who don't understand you there will be people who will in the grief counseling.
