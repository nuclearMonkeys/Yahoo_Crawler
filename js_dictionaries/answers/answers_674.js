	37521 : ["If you are thinking long-term then its better to rent.  If nothing else a mortgage is paid off after 25 years, you pay rent til the day you die. Buying also gives you more 'freedom'.

Generally, the pay for entry level jobs is not very good, but the expectation is after a few months or a year, you can get promoted or move to a different company willing to pay for the experience you now have. If your question is, \"how do u get a supervisor or manager job paying a decent wage with no experience?\" the usual answer is, \"You don't\".

Now highlight what they're looking for in all of your past experience on your resume. Yes, tailoring your resume is going to take longer but you'll get far more responses.
