	123019 : ["I first came across YA in 2007 and at that time, it only served as something to kill my time with.  About a dozen answered Qs later and after my first BA, I was hooked for here, I found a community where people can freely express their ideas and help others while learning something themselves.  For me, there is something fulfilling about that reciprocity.     Real people.  Real answers.  This is how YA works and this is also what makes it unique.  It's knowledge-sharing at its best since most answerers have first-hand experience about whatever it is that they are sharing.  The site is also broken down into categories so an asker can easily get help and an answerer can also easily find his niche. What makes it interesting is the fact that its users are from all walks of life.  The exchange of knowledge therefore is made livelier as these people have different personalities and varying views on just about anything.  What makes it special for me is that for YA, I made the leap of faith.  I am very wary online and I refrain from meeting anyone I met on the Internet but when YAPpers (Yahoo Answers Philippines users) thought of a get-together to organize a   party for street children, I dropped my online anonymity to meet people who I previously only know through their avatars and online writings.  This, I think, is the most important role YA has played among us – gathering us in one forum to ultimately do something good for others.  You may click here for my blogs about our 2008 project:  Forever too, I will be indebted to YA for it is the platform that paved the way to my meeting some friends.  Friends I met during our initial get-together and the succeeding meet-ups thereafter.", 10733, "FZBlel09aa", 3],

	123029 : ["It is legal to fire someone by telephone. The fact that it was done via text message is a big indication that your boss is a poor manager. She should have had the decency to talk to you at the office.  At-will employment is a doctrine of American law that defines an employment relationship in which either party can break the relationship with no liability, provided there was no express contract for a definite term governing the employment relationship and that the employer does not belong to a collective bargain (i.e., a union). Under this legal doctrine: “any hiring is presumed to be \"at will\"; that is, the employer is free to discharge individuals \"for good cause, or bad cause, or no cause at all,\" and the employee is equally free to quit, strike, or otherwise cease work. I did come across an article at hrtechnews.com where a woman was fired via text after she made a complaint about sexual harassment. An employment tribunal didn't look too kindly on the circumstances or the method of the termination. The company had to pay the woman the equivalent of about $120,000. You might consider a free consultation with a lawyer to find out if you were wrongfully discharged. It sounds like the termination was a result of you asking for a raise.  I think you should go into the office and talk to your boss. You deserve to know why your position was eliminated. You should have a termination agreement with all the details. It's awful the way your employer is treating you. You might bring a small tape recorder concealed in your purse when you talk to your boss. Maybe you can get some evidence to bring to a lawyer. If you had any personal belongings at the office, you should be able to collect them.  You should be entitled to be paid for your unused vacation time and possibly 2 weeks pay in lieu of notice. If your position was eliminated, you can file a claim for unemployment compensation. Most states allow you to file the initial claim online. Good luck.", 10738, "s0fNjjp6aa", 0],

Those numbers can get pretty big, pretty quickly. Try drawing yourself a diagram with each person he slept with having slept with two other people. EWWWWW. You probably don't want HIV, STDs or any other nasty strings of letters, so if you do decide to sleep with Casinova, make sure you're using a condom, and don't count on him to bring it.  I think you'd enjoy more waiting until you meet another guy that you have a lot in common with. Then if you decide to have sex it can be a much deeper experience. Sex is best when it's about emotional connection. That's not to say it can never be good otherwise, but it is always good to keep the possible consequences in mind. I bet you'd be happier in the long run if you wait for someone else. Also, in general, I think once you've moved on, to keep moving.

Having sex with a \"ladies man\" puts you at a much higher risk of contracting STD's.  Is he worth dying for?

They were very reputable and caring.  Their comments when I recently reconnected with them by email out of friendship were that most the reputable swingers in their group no longer swing because the risks are way too high. So either get over your shyness and ask the hard questions, and insist on seeing the test results, OR... don't start seeing him as you've already decided to give in to him sexually... which is sad cause your description of him as a ladies man sounds like he doesn't value you, and only someone who truly values you deserves to have sex with you.", 10735, "veDvtYhJaa", 0],
