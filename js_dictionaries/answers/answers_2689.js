I have a problem with the number 9 and 10.  Has Gary Payton retired? If not, he is IN.   I could also go with Mutombo for all his shotblocks and playing for like 35 seasons.   Maybe Paul Pierce for being a leader of the Celts all this time. Also, and this may be strange, what about Grant Hill? He was a great player early, and even though he was injured a lot, so was Bill Walton, but Walton made it on the strength of what he did accomplish and his college career. Grant Hill was also awesome at Duke. Lebron James and Dwayne Wade need to play more seasons to be considered. And Tracy McGrady simply has to get out of the 1st round of the playoffs, otherwise he might not make it.", 11452, "4c33048119df1af09b8f3831ae927a7daa", 0],

Unfortuntely, when there's difficulty in a marriage, and then all of a sudden there's a new baby, life goes into overload.  However, caring for an infant makes a woman feel almost invisible because her life, especially in the first few months, is only about (breast)feeding, diaper changes, and putting the baby to sleep.  With the lack of sleep and the limited amount of personally time, women need EXTRA pampering and attention to keep from disappearing.  Sounds like she was just going thru the motions of a routine boring life, and the old flame has brought some excitement and a spark back into her life.  She's feeling alive at the moment, probably something she hasn't felt in a very long time.  Hard to say what you can do at this point, especially if she is adamant on going to see him.  Don't blame her if she does.  Maybe she just needs to get it out of her system.  Who knows.  Maybe you can reflect on what your position was in all of this, and if you weren't as attentive and loving as you should've been, try giving her what she needs now before it's too late.

	140317 : ["When our male Saint Bernard was four months old a little kid on his bicycle hit him while my husband had the dog out on a walk.  It was on Memorial day and there weren't any vets open in the area, so we had to wait until the next day to take him.  We just left him alone in quiet place and cleaned up after him.  Unfortunately his hind leg was broken and he had to have surgery.  He had three metal pins put in his leg that held the bone together til it healed. Between the first surgery and medications the bill was over $1200.  We opted out of the second surgery that would have removed the pins.  (We were told by a number of vets that it was safe to leave the pins in the bone and that surgery would have cost over $750.)  Because you don't know what happened or where the break is (if one happened) you probably should just leave it be.  (Our Saint's break was in a completely different place than what the vet even thought.)  Your dog will naturally protect that leg and try to make things as comfortable as she can for herself.  From what I can remember about what they told us about the calcification you should be fine with a two day window.  We were told that we would have had to keep our dog's leg immobile for three weeks if we would have opted out of the pin surgery and splinted the leg. (which would have been nearly impossible)  Good Luck! If the leg is broken there are situations,or places in the leg, in which a cast will not be an option.  (as was the situation in our case)   The splint would not stay on, (why it was impossible) so there was no other choice but surgery.  Also, there was no apparent swelling.  I don't want to scare you but really to prepare you for the vet visit.  You know it could be that she just strained or sprained something.   FYI - our Xrays ran $100 for three pics.  We priced them at another facility and they ran $125 for two pics.  Ask alot of questions about billing prior to the treatment.  We were quoted the $1000 dollar figure prior to the surgery so they had to stick to that after.  Had I not gotten that quote they would have charged us nearly $1400.  But keep in mind we spent over $200 on medications,  and our Saint was a pup who only weighed 50 pounds at the time.", 11457, "None", 0],

	140334 : ["It's just like a human break. They can still cast it tomorrow.  If the skin isn't broken, I would demand a cast rather than pins.  This is simply because introducing foreign materials into bone and opening the skin has a monumental risk of infection versus simply setting and casting.  The surgeon at the vet clinic here always wants to put in pins while the older vet avoids it unless there is an open fracture.  I think the casts just turn out better. There is less pain for the dog that way, plus they seem to heal faster with fewer problems.  If it were my dog, I would always choose the cast. If she were my dog, I would give her baby aspirins for pain and inflammation until she could see the vet in the morning.   Do keep her off the leg today though. You can apply ice off and on if she will let you. If you feel comfortable immobilizing it, that would be a good idea. And you are going to get lots of nasty responses here.  But honestly, you probably aren't hurting your dog at all by waiting until Monday morning.  I have seen the vet wait for a day to fix a leg many times while the dog is immobilized and given pain medicine.

Now, how to do that to a dog and make the dog leave it on, I really don't know.  If you just wrap it with ACE bandage, don't wrap it too tight because swelling will cut circulation off from the foot.  If you wrap it tight, you should be able to slip a finger between the wrap and your dog, and it should be removed at least every 2 hours and reapplied ( but you have to consider how much pain this will cause the dog).  If it is broken, in 2 days infection could be starting, but they would probably put the dog on antibiotics anyway if it has to be fixed.  There is a controversy over giving dogs aspirin for pain, so I wouldn't give it anything for pain.  No Tylenol!  Dogs are tough animals, and I'm sure it will be o.k.  If you leave her home alone, I wouldn't wrap the leg.  If it hurts, she won't walk on it.  More important that keeping the leg safe is eating, drinking, then peeing and pooing.
