The financial costs associated with the operation will make the recent stimulus package look like pauper's change...not to mention the fact that, even amongst Republicans, it is politically unpalatable and most people do not share your viewpoint.  Also, I can't believe that you are calling for a revolt.  I have no idea what you hope to achieve by this, as most people support our President.  I, for one, have never loved my country as much as I do today and am proud that we have a president who is intelligent, charismatic, and represents the working and middle classes.. Finally, there's nothing wrong with undocumented immigrants being in our country.  Yes, they have kids, but thanks to our naturalization laws, their kids are automatically U.S. citizens if they are born here (jus soli, look it up).  So deporting a bunch of \"illegals\" does not address the problems associated with their U.S.-born, U.S. citizen children.  Not to mention the fact that we would be left with millions of orphans thanks to political expulsions, the whole policy is once again extremely unpalatable even to the most conservative voter.

	85344 : ["Short answer: Yes, the media should be reigned in. Start watching BBC news or PBS. Long Answer: The media is another arm for the administration at this point. Their major sources of \"expert information\" tend to be those within the administration and so discounting the administrations tend to hurt their credibility by proxy. Also, anymore the media will catch flak for reporting honestly by advertisers, the government, and lawyers. The election coverage has become an event not unlike the Superbowl. It's a ratings bonanza and you could tell by all of the high tech gadgetry they implement, which looks like it was designed by a \"hip\" compsci major right out of college, that it's become a big joke that relies on bias information on both sides to attract viewers. You can thank Reagan, Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes, advertisers, and the subsequent competition of other media conglomerates for this fact. Another large issue contributing to this ridiculous election coverage are the myriad of different polling sources. Firstly, no right minded individual should believe polling data regardless of it's implementation. The polling data is never effective and you'll notice over time that it's almost always way off in terms of who it projects as the supposed front-runner. The media gets their talking points from copious amounts of sources and it's called spin. After every election debate, for instance, there is a big room called the \"spin room\" where a handful of people spout off spin and talking points relating to the candidates and these points become spread like a virus throughout all the associated journalists in the room, then spread even more quickly to the associated press, MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, etc which is then spread rapidly to the affiliate stations which is then transmitted direclty into every home in the country. The fact of the matter is, media has become a joke in this country, objective news is difficult to come by, and our materialism can be considered the root cause.

The media forms the candidates and puts up the front runners by whomever their bosses who own the station favor. People don't realize this. For instance, Time Warner and Ted Turner own CNN. Both are advocates for John McCain. FOX supported Rudy Guiliani. Rupert Murdoch owns FOX. People need to do research, and they vote emotionally and ignorantly in my opinion. Nothing personal, but we cannot elect leaders to our country based on these two factors. Here it is, we haven't even reached Super Tuesday and given the rest of the country to vote, and we already have front runners. Where did they come from if voters pretty much voted evenly on all of the candidates, with an exception of a point or two. The media denies having anything to do with it, but I thought entrance polls were illegal during elections. And here CNN boasted about running entrance polls. How effective are those? They also declare winners hours before the polls close. I live in the midwest, and with only 30% of the votes in at primaries in Florida and NH, CNN was declaring a winner. I volunteered in the last election in 2004 and got to see how elections work in the background. Many people would be shocked how much wheeling and dealing goes on.
