	131020 : ["Hola! Del autor Jeffrey Archer, te recomiendo el libro Kane & Abel.  A quienes definen la idea central como un romance; personalmente, aunque debo reconocer que tiene un toque un tanto romántico, el trama es más bien psicològico.  Para darte una idea de lo que trata y como escribe el autor te dirè que: se trata del destino de dos hombres nacidos el mismo dìa en dos continentes distintos, en circunstancias y vidas socio-èconomicas muy distintas. Por cosas del destino - por asi decir - sus vidas se cruzaràn, y el trama te tendràn en suspenso y jugando a Sherlock Holmes :-)  El libro, al principio, se divide en capitulos intercambiales, en las cuales Archer, narra la vida de cada uno de los personajes de su obra.  El autor hace buen uso de la sutileza, la dinàmica, y la ironìa, para mantener al lector deseos@ de continuar la lectura.  Te recomiendo mucho este libro.  A mi me encantò... tanto asi, que lo he leido 3 veces, y eso que mi copia està en francès y no me gusta la lectura en este idioma :-)  Si te decides leerlo, me encantarìa saber tu opiniòn.... ojalà y al igual que a mi, te guste. Pero es obvio que no todos tenemos los mismos gustos, por lo que me encantarìa saber, si es que no te gusta, cuàl fue el motivo.  Suerte! P.S./ Me daria mucho gusto, tb el saber cuales son algunos de tus libros predilectos, y que recomiendas a otr@s lectores... pues la lectura tb es una de mis pasiones.  Gracias a ti, y a todos quienes te ofrecen una respuestas... ;-)", 11089, "AA11103363", 1],

He doesn't need 12 days off, or even 4...he comes out and gives it all every time...its just a matter of getting run support. Hurricane Ike has nothing to do with this, the Astos have played in Milwaukee before so I don't understand how that could be it, every team is tired once in a while but they should still be able to crack a hit.

	131037 : ["Apparently, you skipped a couple of paragraphs of the Geneva Convention. Any inhabitant who takes up arms in the face of an occupying force is considered a protected person. They do not have to wear uniforms, carry arms openly, or anything else. Remember the French Resistance? That is what Iraqi insurgents are. Secondly, it is a violation of the Geneva Convention to remove prisoners from the country in which they were captured, except in extreme circumstances to protect their well-being. In such cases, they are to be removed to a neutral, third party nation, who is not involved in the conflict. As for extending Constitutional rights, we have not. The Geneva Convention, again, states that prisoners cannot be tried by military tribunal. Their trials must be conducted in a way that is consistent with the laws of 'civilized nations'. That means that they have a right to a lawyer, confront witnesses against them, see evidence, communicate privately with counsel, and participate in their own defense. All of these basic tenets of law are what the American government was seeking to supress. They didn't even want the prisoners to be present at their own trials. Absolutely nothing about the process for trying someone in international courts or anywhere else would affect their citizenship, whatsoever. It wouldn't matter if we tried them in the US, the Hague, or anywhere else. You are clearly misguided. Oh, and BTW, EVERYONE has rights. Remember how we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable right? I don't think that the Founding Fathers were referring just to Americans.
