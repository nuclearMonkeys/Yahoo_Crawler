I'd say that if you have the proper training and understand the behavior of sharks it probably is safe. Most shark attacks result from people being mistaken for sharks' natural prey and when they realize they have made a mistake they don't continue to attack. Obviously this isn't always the case and the injuries from a single bite often result if a fatality but the fact remains that there are thousands of people that spend time in the waters of sharks and very few experience a problem with sharks.¬†", 3842, "None", 6],

You may not care that your president is destroying the alliances every president has spent his time in office building on and improving. Pulling out of multiple international agreements;  Paris climate agreement - Iran nuclear deal - Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that included 12 Pacific Rim countries - North American Free Trade Agreement - UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural organization - the United Nations Human Rights Council - the UN Relief and Works Agency and who still continues to threaten to leave NATO. Maybe you don't care Trump is denying the biggest threat to our children survival, to our very planet.  Maybe like him you are amazed when you meet people who care about what happens when they die, as his comments showed when he met Prince Charles, who has spent his life working to make the planet a better and safer place. Maybe you can sleep easy in your bed when your government is inflicting child abuse on the children in their care at the border.  That you don't care that your government, the richest country in the world does not supply these children with beds, enough food and water, soap, nappies and access to washing facilities. Maybe you can sleep easy when your president lies to you almost every time he opens his mouth, that he insults the leaders and people of America's long term allies and fawns over the worst murdering dictators in the world. Many liberals find these and the other actions of this president keep them awake and active trying to change things, but that is what people who really care about their country and have empathy and compassion for their fellow man do.", 3848, "AA12022384", -2],

I'm not fond of Lex being in the Horsemen, but I get that they were trying to put him with experienced veterans and get him better.¬† He just seemed too much like the all american quarterback to fit in in my opinion. 3. This one is the standard to me.¬† Flair's at the helm, Arn and Tully are teaming immaculately and running interference, and Windham represents a promising future. 4. I liked Sting in the Horsemen, even though it always seemed like a short-lived concept.¬† This might be the first iteration of the faction that I came to know as a kid.¬† Tag on the legendary rivalry between Sting and Flair, and you have the makings for legendary booking.¬†¬† 5.¬† Once again, Sid doesn't fit in retrospect, but I loved this lineup as a kid.¬† I was a huge Sid mark though. 6. Poor Paul Roma.¬† He wasn't a bad wrestler, and he was a good enough looking guy, but he just didn't have that Horseman swagger or natural ability between the ropes.7. This one may have been one of the best 'modern' lineups.¬† Pillman added chaos and inevitably inner turmoil despite constantly being a died-in-the-wool Horseman faithful.¬† Benoit was Benoit, and Benoit simply made sense as a part of the Horsemen. 8.¬† Everything was great about this one on paper...except Mongo.9. Didn't really last long enough to make an impact, but having Jarrett in the horsemen isn't a horrible idea.¬† Or at least it's a better idea than Roma or Mongo. 10.¬† Didn't last long enough to make an impact and still had Mongo in it.¬† Would've loved a Flair, Benoit, Malenko, Hennig lineup.¬† Perfect was a brilliant idea for a member, but he turned almost immediately for nWo11.¬† Great lineup, but really didn't get the push they deserved.", 3852, "7sa6B6Qhaa", 1],
