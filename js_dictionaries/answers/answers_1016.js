	56285 : ["Soil types are not directly related to fertility, but capacity to be fertile is strongly related to the mineralogical composition of the soils, and soils with high potential nutrient storage capacity do tend to have higher nutrient contents, so fertility is somewhat indirectly related to soil type. Also, \"fertility\" depends on the needs of the target plants as much as the provisions of the soil, and drainage capacity and moisture retention capability also impact \"fertility\". So, it is complicated and there is no direct ranking that can be done which is meaningful.  It is useful to know aspects (characteristics) of the soils with regard to ion-exchange capacity, drainage capability, moisture retention rates, and so on, as part of the evaluation.  In effect, the only real generalization is that the more diverse mixtures of minerals and grain sizes tend to be the most useful for agriculture.  Monomineralic sands are crappy for most plants (some actually like them though), but loams or clay loams can be very good for cultivation. Enough mud (clay, correct types of clay) to be able to chemically absorb nutrient components and release them to plants eventually, and enough fine porosity to allow for moisture retention, yet enough coarse porosity to allow for fairly rapid infiltration of water from the surface.  too much \"mud\" leads to hardpan, but not enough mud leads to overly dry soils. It is a complicated enough issue that most people who study agriculture have at least one course (if not multiple courses) on soils and the ways that soils can differ, and ways that human interventions can augment or improve natural soils to make them better for agriculture, and of course the various tests one can make to define what needs a given soil likely has. I went to a state school that had such degree programs and took a few of those courses, because this geologist was interested in the subject for other reasons. There is no \"One-size-fits-all\" answer, though.", 7829, "WbVE1cXKaa", 0],

People with lake cottages that take water from the lake will use it to flush and even shower, but usually won't drink it (not if they are wise, at least).  There tend to be microorganisms in the water that can be a problem if you drink the water, but you can kill them with some treatment (dilute bleach works). The interesting thing, of course, is that many cities on major rivers have always taken their drinking water from upstream of the city, and dumping the sewage downstream.  They tended to ignore the fact that upstream for them was downstream for someone else.  This is why we have such complicated systems for treating both our drinking water and our sewage.  It is way safer.  Cholera plagues aren't very fun, and dysentery isn't very pleasant.", 7825, "WbVE1cXKaa", 1],
