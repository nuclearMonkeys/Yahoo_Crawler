If this doesn't happen, try to get some pebbles or marbles and place in the nest box for her to sit on because it is not good for the bird to keep laying. It is not good for the eggs to be removed every time she lays them either. Just leave her be. They generally do a wonderful job of finding out and discovering on their own.

	117958 : ["The blade itself isn't shorter than the boot, just the sole plates. If the sole of your boot is 11 inches long, then you would get a 10 3/4 inch blade. The 10 3/4 is the length of the part that gets screwed onto your boot, the length from the top of the toe plate to the bottom of the heel plate. When you get your skates, use a tape measure to measure the length of your soles and then buy your blades 1/4 in shorter. That is, if it is worth it to replace the blades depending on the condition of the boots. I can't and no one else can just tell you the measurement because every model is different. I used to get PVC scuffs on my Riedell Red Ribbons and I always used rubbing alcohol to get it off. Instead of polishing my entire boots, I use Kiwi Scuff Cover that I got from Wal-Mart. I am not sure if the insoles are washable, depending on what kind they can usually be replaced for a couple of dollars. You can maybe try a damp rag or some of that foam carpet cleaner that turns into a powder that can be vacuumed when it dries. Club 2000 blades are not the best and should be replaced.  What you need to replace it with depends on your level. I don't know how old your skates are. How much did you spend on these skates? It could have possibly ended up being cheaper to have just bought a newer pair of skates instead of having to replace the blades and recondition the leather. If the leather is dried out it will not have its support because it loses its flexibility. If the leather is cracked, the leather conditioner will not work, but if it is just a little dry, it might. I would check out the return policy just in case because it might be more work and extra money than it is worth. Several people buy older models of skates with no issues including myself but it all depends on how, where, and how long they were stored.", 10523, "mjidg1nwaa", 0],

Step two: keep a lot of extra sources of calcium in the cage for her sense laying eggs depletes her calcium. Step three: if you have to seperate the birds. The only problem is there is probably something else in the cage she is laying them in and if you remove everything she could possibly use to lay her eggs in, she may stop.

	117983 : ["i have owned 4 mice i absolutly LOVED them i prefer mice. i think they are more friendly. not saying hamsters are not but i honestly think mice are more friendly than hamsters. some names i think are cute are: Mardi, Luckie, Frappucino, Dork, Chip, Cashew, Carmel, Zookie, Tom, Jerry, Sugar, Sunshine, Survivor, Swirls Despite the natural fear they seem to evoke, mice are playful, happy animals that make great pets! Inexpensive to feed, house and care for, you'll be surprised at how easily even you may warm up to a furry, little mouse!  Some will love to run on wheels and act playful, while others will be shy, and prefer to build a comfortable nest in which to hide. you will need to pay careful attention to their mouse's personality, in order to provide the proper materials and care.  It is unnatural in any environment for mice to live alone. Those mice which are forced to live alone are generally bored, withdrawn, lonely and miserable. But when i had my mice they were alone. but i played with them alot so they were fine. There are many varieties of mice, including satin, curly haired, fancy, long haired, and more. Rodents like to stand on their hind legs, run and play. For this reason, whichever type of housing you choose, it should provide enough space for those basic activities. Aquariums are the most inexpensive form of housing, and the easiest to maintain. They are resistant to gnawing, digging and provide adequate room. If you use an aquarium, you'll also need a wire rodent cover to prevent inventive mice from escaping. Wire cages can be used, but since rodents like to dig, be prepared to clean up bedding that has been tossed out from the surrounding areas. Mice are easily bored, and will need to be provided with entertainment. One, two and three level housing units can easily be placed inside your aquarium, which will help to stimulate your mouse and also allow him to establish a colony. Play wheels, balls and mice toys are also sold in pet stores. Bedding or litter will need to be added to the mouse house, as well. Bedding provides some insulation, warmth, and helps to absorb waste matter. Wood shavings make a good choice for mice, though you should avoid cedar or pine shavings, as the oils in the wood can irritate your mouse's eyes and skin. Aspen chips or shavings, shredded paper, unscented paper towels and unscented toilet paper are all oil-free, and make excellent, safe bedding choices for mice. Bedding should be changed once a week.  Mice should be given fresh water at least once a day through a water tube or bottle, which attaches to the side of its home. Water should never be given in a dish. Food often depends on the individual mouse's tastes. A mixture of seed or pellets, specially made for rodents makes for a hearty diet. Food should be added to a ceramic bowl twice daily. Never use plastic dishes, as the mouse will chew on it.  you should handle your mouse daily to get it comfortable with you. if you dont your mouse could be come timmed when you try to hold it and it could become an agressive mouse.Never pick your mouse up by the tail. Always scoop them from their belly, providing support for their feet with your other hand.  Mice may be one of the smallest pets in the world, but they also come with big odors. Fresh bedding, sprays and mice-friendly treatments are available commercially to deal with this problem.  The life expectancy of a mouse in the wild can be as short as weeks or months. Pet mice, properly cared for, live 3-5 years. good luck with your new pet hope i helped <3", 10523, "35Em3Ul6aa", 2],
