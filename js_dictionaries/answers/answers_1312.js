For example, if you see a blank space just, unmarked, and it won't load at windows startup. 2)Go to normal mode, and upgrade the Antivirus, if you don't have any, get AVG or Nod32, I always use AVG 7.5, it's free, simple, and more than good. After installation, run an update and a complete scanning and eliminate all the virus, Trojans and everything bad in your PC. 3) Into the \"Control Panel\", go to \"Add or Remove Programs\" uninstall all the software that you don't know or that you don't want, for example, programs with **** in it's name and such. 4) Upgrade your Internet Explorer version, de ver. 7 is a little bit better than the Ie 6, or, if you want to really use a good Web Browser, download and install Mozilla Firefox, it's safer than any other browser in the market today. If all this does not work, consider to Repair your Windows or format it and install it again. For the next time, remember to always use Firefox, and don't click everywhere :-)", 8612, "None", 0],

	71214 : ["Here's my list of things I like better about the 3DS XL compared to the 3DS: -Larger screens, obviously.  -It has a matte finish, which means you really don't see fingerprint marks on the outside.  -The stylus is located on the right side instead of from the behind like it was on the 3DS. Seems annoying to have to reach to the back to get the stylus out rather than from the side. -Better look, IMO. I mean, I look at a picture like this of the 3DS:   and it just doesn't look that great. I think the 3DS XL looks much nicer. -The screen snaps into place at 2 different angles. So when you're opening it, you'll hear a click at one angle (about the angle you'd open up a laptop at), and then again at a larger angle (like a standard gaming angle). -Less glare (going more by word with this one, as I never really used the 3DS). -Better 3D. I went to the store one day a few weeks to see what the 3DS looked like and what the 3D looked like, and it took me like 15-30 seconds to angle myself with the display one to see the 3D effect. It really isn't hard to see the 3D on the XL. -Better device colors. Having seen the display 3DSes at stores, I really wasn't that impressed with the colors. They're alright, but nothing special. I also wasn't that impressed looking at the pictures of the 3DS XL colors on Nintendo's website. But when I pulled out my blue 3DS XL, the color looked amazing. I was and am REALLY happy with the color and wouldn't change a thing about it if I could. So try not to judge the color by the pictures they have, because they're a far cry from how great the colors actually are in person. I also checked on youtube, and you still can't see how good the colors are in videos, you just have to see it in person. -Better battery life. -There are probably some other things I'm forgetting. Regarding what the person with a bad case of nostalgia said, the screens look fine. I was worried about pixelation (as well as portability) before getting mine. But once I got it, I saw there wasn't a problem at all. A few things might look more pixelated, but most of the time (nearly all the time), you won't notice unless you're comparing the systems side-by-side. In other words, your enjoyment isn't going to be interrupted with thoughts of \"This is really bad quality\" or anything.  As for the person that suggested it might not be as easy to take with you, that hasn't been the case with me. The day after getting it, my family went out of town for a couple days. We did a lot of walking around and I kept my 3DS XL either in my jeans, shorts, or the inner pocket of my track jacket, and it fit completely fine in all of the pockets. There wasn't even a little resistance in trying to get it in or out - it's basically just as easy for me to put my 3DS XL in my pocket as it is for me to put my phone in (and that's just an Octane). Same applies for when I'm taking it out of my pocket. My DS lite was fine when I used it (I never owned a 3DS myself); I never was troubled with it being too hard to see or anything. But I prefer the bigger screen now that it's available. And if the screen looked too fuzzy or pixelated on the XL, I wouldn't want to use it. But that isn't the case. So I think the 3DS XL is better in basically every way.", 8614, "lMrkUewdaa", 1],
