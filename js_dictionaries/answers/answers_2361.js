We should be able to appreciate the wisdom that comes with age and understand that either gender can be distinguished as they become older.

	123887 : ["\"It's all relative\".  Every speed is relative to something else, an 'absolute' velocity is meaningless, when no reference is given you can assume that the speed is relative to an observer on earth, so a spacecraft travelling at 0.5c is doing so relative to the earth. The idea of two spacecraft passing both at 0.5c is an interesting one.  It doesn't mean, as you would think classically, that one is moving at c relative to the other (0.5c + 0.5c), as this is not possible (well theoretically it is but make one travel at 0.6 and it is easy to see that the classic case doesn't work) We need a formula for the addition of velocities which is v(rel) = (v1+v2)/(1+(v1*v2/c^2)) This doesn't allow velocities above c, usefully.  You can plug in v1=c, v2=c and you find their relative velocity is also c!  This is against common sense but it works, its to do with time dilation between the two.", 10760, "None", 3],

My mother started having contractions. I did not like this. I turned into a monster. I was constantly kicking, fighting, sinking lower and lower. I spiraled out of control, and was quite literally turned upside down and my life fell into one of confusion and despair. I couldn't fight it any more. I just kept sinking lower and lower, and I lost my physique. Eventually, I hit rock bottom, and there was only a bright light.

You wake up in the sealed room below with any piece(s) of Laboratory equipment you want.  Are you on Earth or being taken back to the aliens home planet? Suppose you were in a sealed room.  The room could be sitting motionless on the earth or it could have a soundless, vibration less rocket motor that we cannot tell if it is firing or not.  If it is firing it is accelerating the room at 9.8 m/s^2  Is there any experiment that we can do that will allow you to figure out if the room is sitting motionless on the earth or accelerating through space at 9.8 m/s^2?  Turns out there is no way to figure out if we are sitting on earth or accelerating through space?   Now carry it one step farther.  Think of riding in a car.  If you look out the window it appears that the scenery is moving past you car.  (The sun appears to rise.)  Suppose the room above had a window and you could see things moving past the window.  Could you tell if you were moving, the things were moving, or you are both moving?  If you say \"yes,\" how could you tell? From this we must conclude that all motion is relative.
