	80807 : ["My wonderful girlfriend & I had been dating for a year, so we decided 2 get married. There was only one little thing bothering me. It was her beautiful younger sister. She wore very tight miniskirts, & was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, & I always got more than a nice view. One day her \"little\" sister called & asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, & she said she had feelings & desires for me that she couldn't overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. She said, \"I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, & if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.\" I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned & made a beeline straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Then my future family was standing outside, all clapping! With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, \"We are very happy that you have passed our  little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.\"  And the moral of this story is:  Always keep your condoms in your car.", 9041, "AA12073245", 3],

On the other hand, if we just give people health tips and get rid of anything that might make a person gain weight, people will not be happy about that, either. I don't know if it is a mixed signal... I think there is enough information out there about health, and I also think that if people stop making excuses for themselves it's really NOT difficult to determine what is healthy and what isn't. Nobody needs a magazine to tell them that eating an entire pan of triple fudge brownies isn't so great on one's health! People don't want to always be guilted into avoiding desserts and sweet foods, though. And if it isn't a constant thing, there is nothing wrong with eating cake, cookies, a Big Mac, etc. If I see a good cake recipe that I want to make for a birthday, I already know that it's not healthy, but as long as I (or who I make it for) doesn't sit down and inhale the whole thing, it's not a problem.

Taking off down the motorway, he floored it to 90 mph, enjoying the wind blowing through what little hair he had left. ‘Amazing!' he said, enjoying pushing the pedal to the metal even more. Looking in his rear view mirror, he saw a police car behind him, blue lights flashing and siren blaring.' I can get away from him – no problem!' thought the elderly gent as he floored it to 110 mph, then 120, then 130 mph. Suddenly, he thought, ‘What on earth am I doing? I'm too old for this nonsense!' So he pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the police car to catch up with him. Pulling in behind him, the police officer walked up to the driver's side of the BMW, looked at his watch and said, ‘Sir, my shift ends in 10 minutes. Today is Friday and I'm taking off for the weekend. If you can give me a reason why you were speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you go.' The man looked very seriously at the policeman and replied, ‘Years ago, my wife ran off with a policeman. I thought you were bringing her back.' ‘Have a good day, Sir,' said the policeman.

If any mischief occurred in their town, the two boys were probably involved. The boys' mother heard that a preacher in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The preacher agreed, but he asked to see them individually. So the mother sent the 8 year old first, in the morning, with the older boy to see the preacher in the afternoon. The preacher, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, 'Do you know where God is, son?' The boy's mouth dropped open , but he made no response, sitting there wide-eyed with his mouth hanging open. So the preacher repeated the question in an even sterner tone, 'Where is God?' Again, the boy made no attempt to answer. The preacher raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, 'Where is God?' The boy screamed and bolted from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him. When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, 'What happened?'

	80852 : ["You seem depressed & insecure both but, I do not think you need to go see a Therapist, as others have suggested.. Of course you deserve all those good things, everybody does. Insecurity will cause one to have repeated thoughts, bad thoughts.. that seem to destroy you. This is all easily fixable though. I think you should care less about what people think about you, I think that is most of the problem in most people. They care so much about what others think or feel, they drive themselves insane in the process. There is no need to falsely create sexual feelings for someone you have no chemistry or natural attraction with. These weird men you are attracted to stem most likely from the people you are either hanging around or what you falsely deem to be attractive. I notice a lot of women hurt themselves for these men like you do, because they go after what they blindly notice. ie: loud, obnoxious, sick humor, nice clothing ETC. Do you like the ones that cause everyone to laugh? Do you like the guys who show you SOME attention? maybe it's the small bit of attention they give to almost everyone you crave so much? When you are insecure, we want attention, sometimes.. good & bad attention. If you found someone who you have natural, blissful, connections & chemistry with, your heart would be fulfilled with GOOD attention. These good guys who are interested in you, aren't going to give you any kind of bad attention, if they are honestly good that is. They won't give you tons of attention right away, either. The weirdos shower attention and compliments down right away. My advice for you in that department - Meet people & make friends, don't have the intention of attraction at first thing (this can trick you into feeling attracted to them) don't believe everything they say, observe their actions and beliefs. When you start meeting people without the intention of a relation, it'll come to you. Insecurity causes anxiety btw. Are you a believer? Satan likes to cause Insecurity in ones who let him, daily. Some go after a nice fashionable sense as well, sadly. Start looking on the inside of people, start conversations & find someone caring, someone you will have plenty of similarities. Find someone who likes the things you like, feels the way you do about important issues, someone who believes in what you believe, someone who will fight for what you will. Stop driving yourself insane, breathe! Do something for yourself to boost your confidence level, Outside & inside. Do NOT hang out with people who will try to demoralize you, not associating with them will make you happier. Since you work with them, you can observe from far away, missing a opportunity to feel close to them is NOT a loss for you but a huge win. The people who say you are worth nothing compared to them, come on... Totally immature, childish and horridly untrue. They look like fools in Yahweh (our creators) eyes. & yours. Arrogant isn't even what they are, they are trying to convince themselves with their words, I'm sure their insecurities are worse, maybe point that out to them. :) PS: Don't EVER try to find a relationship with someone you meet in a bar, party, or at work. It NEVER turns out good & they almost always wind up being psychos & perverts.. exactly what you described. It'll never turn out the way you want it too, you cannot change a person, you cannot change their horrible way of life either. Change yours instead.", 9046, "o1FM8Rvuaa", 1],
