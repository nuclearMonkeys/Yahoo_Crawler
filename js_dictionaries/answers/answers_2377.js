When my husband died suddenly she was the first person (besides my children) I called from the  Emergency Room. She raced to the Hospital from her office in no time.

	124666 : ["Advice:  Don't get knocked up. Don't do something with a group of people just because they are all doing it and you don't want to feel left out (this means smoking, drugs, drinking, etc.) Don't act like a smartass. Be yourself. That's about it. There is NO difference between high school and junior high, other than academically. There are still the higher grade levels that \"run the school\" and are all high and mighty, and there are still the awkward students that all the older grades can pick out with their eyes closed.  I mean, unless schools are run extremely different in the states, you have no need to worry other than about your classes. I agree with Elle too. I don't know the whole order of who's who, since here we call the students by their grade level. 10th graders are the 10th graders, 11's are 11's, you get the point. The 10th graders (or whatever grade your high school starts with - never understood why in some places, high school starts in 9th grade. Here, that is still junior high. Or middle school as it is known in the states), they basically will always think that they are awesome and cool, when really you aren't. It's nothing against you, it's just fact. Basically, the 10s are like chickens with their heads cut off, while the 12s are like deer. Being in your final year, you find that grace, you get into the groove, and you pretty much get the whole drama-highschool-crap stuff imprinted into you. So you walk around without being so scared as you are when first starting out.  I remember thinking I was pretty awesome (being a 10th grade emo douchebag was definitely not me being awesome, but instead something I regret), mainly because in my last half of the year I was mostly friends with the 12th graders. Grade 11 is the average year, where you are still an annoying kid who thinks \"i am so awesome\" but you are also someone that sees now annoying the lower grade is. Ignore all the drama, don't become a part of it (I have been there, it's not worth your time) and just.. Don't think about it. I actually spent my last year as follows: First part, I mostly sat with some friends (the \"offbeats\" I guess. I was able to strike up friendships very well with the stoner types, although I am not one myself) and discussed how disgusting and idiotic high school was. Last part, I spent it with some new friends that I met in guitar class and just enjoyed being with them, without actually considering it as being in high school.", 10804, "None", 0],
	124667 : ["Okay, you're probably not gonna get serious answers, but I'll answer seriously, just because I feel like it. :-) Anyway, high school can be AS FUN as they say it is in tv shows and whatnot, but it can also be very difficult, it really depends on how you start off your first year, your first impressions on people last like a life time -_- well at least for me. Anyway, you are going to meet a lot of people LIKE you or very UNLIKE yourself, so be prepared. There are going to be fakes, liars, cheaters, druggies, nerds, etc. You should just be YOURSELF, all the time, and get real friends, the ones that will support you no matter what. Also, you should never cut classes, bad. Get more involved in school, something I didn't try to do...but really should have. Join extracurricular activities, clubs, sports teams, etc. Whatever you like, you know? Don't regret like me... The high school years and how fun it is, all depends on how you want to make it...for me, I made it sort of dull and boring and tiring...and didn't get to be myself that much, because I didn't let myself be...there is going to be drama and all, just avoid it...just try your best.

	124668 : ["omg lol  I'm gonna be a freshman this year too! Here's some advice that can help: The obvious: Do all of your homework. Don't ditch class. Come to school every day. That kind of stuff =) And Some stuff to watch out for: If you're pretty, guys will come to you! Most will be overconfident jerks that will try to win you over just to sleep with you. No kidding. Stay away from them! Don't jump into a relationship too fast! That can ruin your academics and can lead to a lot of drama. Don't be too shy. That can be misleading. But also don't be too sIutty! That can also be misleading but most girls won't have a problem with that. Other than that, keep a good personal hygiene, relax, have fun, and enjoy your High School years! Good luck!
