It's just a compilation of primitive, middle eastern fairy tales.   Taken in its context, and without the ridiculous, childish claim that it is \"gods word,\" and it's an entertaining, and x-rated insight into Jewish and middle-eastern mythology and culture thousands of years ago.

As we know that the Nepalese people are mostly dependent on the agriculture sector which shows the capability of the people.

They are working as the machine and the politicians of Nepal are taking and sucking that amount as the tax.  Major Causes of Poverty in Nepal 1. Youth Awareness 2. unskilled manpower 3.

We have the example of a young boy killing a giant with a sling shot and stone.  We can appreciate that God has used many different strategies in warfare when needed. When Jesus came to earth, warfare ended for all who follow Christ. We who are students of the Bible, are peace makers, even loving our enemies as Matthew 5:43-45 tells us we must.  We take very seriously the work of \"preaching good news about God's Kingdom in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations,\" as Jesus said would be done, before the end can come.--Matthew 24:14 and Mark 13:10---Jehovah's Witnesses are the only ones, that I know of, that are doing the will of God in preaching as He told Jesus to do.  I invite you to learn more about what the Bible teaches from the international website, www.jw.org and Bible Teachings > Bible Questions Answered.  Millions of Bible studies are in progress from North Pole to Antarctica and beyond. IF you believe what you learned, you can request your free personal Bible study online or from the next witness who knocks on your door or by visiting your neighborhood Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses.

It complicates their lives immeasurably. You like famous people and royals - watch the series \"The Crown\" about Princess and then Queen Elizabeth II's life, the trials of being famous, especially of being royal; and the effects of the abdication of her uncle on her life, and the effects it had on her relations with her sister Margaret when she was forced into the role of head of the Church of England.  She didn't have much control of her life. Then there is the movie \"The King's Speech,\" for instance.  King George VI [Elizabeth's father] was not happy about having to be famous; it was a great challenge.  His brother King Edward VIII abdicated and forced the reluctant Bertie to take the throne; he took the name George as king.", 4763, "54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa", 1],

	31150 : ["The suffix \"gate\" is used for a scandal. This wasn't a scandal, and we don't even know that the tale is true. As best I could tell, it was never reliably sourced by the media that printed it.  Frankly, I doubt she would ever have been shown a tiara that wasn't available for her to wear. In any case, it was apparently the emeralds that were the issue -- they were, or possibly were, Russian in origin and provenance, though again, the media that made this claim didn't explain why that was supposedly a problem.  I can't be sure, because I didn't read the actual tabloid stories, only references to them.  There may have been some explanation in there somewhere, though I wouldn't bet on it. Perhaps some association with the Russian Imperial family? Just out of curiosity, why did you put the word \"provenance\" in quotation marks?
