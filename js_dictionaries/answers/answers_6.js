Once it is in the fuel injection pump that pressure is increased to 13,000 PSI.+/-1000. .  So you see how you are talking out of your butt? I am being nice. with my wording. Something is severely flucked with the return line from the fuel supply pump back to the tank. \"Somewhere the flow has stopped. .  As the supply pump supplies more than enough fuel for the injection pump to use so the excess either piddles on the ground >OR SOME DESIGNER TECH SAID \"let the excess circulate back into the fuel tank on a Loop like they do in all other vehicles\".  That way no loss of fuel and we can use low pressure rubber hoses to make the loop and only need ONE high pressure fuel pump, thus SAVING MONEY. . And so it came to pass \"that is the system\" you are checking. The low pressure side fuel pump. . This is beyond you and beyond me because I can't see WTF is going on. without testing.  To say the low fuel pressure pump is flucked is being simplistic.  Then it was flucked since DAY 1. for even a reading of 20PSI is high. . I am guessing that it is the fuel pump is faulty and always has been so or there is a fuel screen or filter you missed and it is clogged up solid. .
