A:marijuana is vastly becoming know for its medical purposes and congress is working with millions of people to come to an agreement about the drug B:Alcohol we tried to ban it once it only lead to more corrupt people and alot more violence-Al Capone an chicago ring a bell for those times. C:Tabacco was apart of early settlements and even though laws are becoming tougher about where and when people can use this drug there will always be people whom want it and since its been here as long as we have congress will never ban it On a personal note-I used to love to smoke marijuana it is a natural product that can change the world for many different medical conditions-its been proved to help asthma patients by stopping inflamation-helps cancer & glaucoma patients deal with pain. Alcohol made me a violent person whom many in my community wanted to stay away from me or lock me up-so i quit drinking after 84 underage drinking tickets-since then i have not beaten anyone up or gotten any tickets As for tabacco I used to smoke but because of my asthma its not a wise thing and I quit in 2005 however after 6 months w/o any nicotine I was locked in a moveing vehicle with 2 smokers and the car stopped at a gas station i picked up a tin of chew and havnt stopped yet.", 8159, "DtbeSSuGaa", -2],

Have you visited? simply asks whether the visit has happened. Have you visited yet? suggests that the speaker feels confident that the visit will occur, or may have already occurred. If I know that you were planning a visit to the new zoo, I might say,\"Have you visited YET?\" to show that I know it's inevitable that you will visit.  It can also suggest that the speaker thinks that you are under some obligation to visit. A parent might say to a kid,\"Have you done your chores yet?\" In other words, your doing them is inevitable. If you haven't already, you will. It is going to happen at some point. Are you done yet? often suggests impatience on the part of the speaker, or at least that the speaker thinks you should be finished.

Mankind might not yet have discovered the good use (God's purpose) of every plant but it must have one or God would not have made it.  Some plants are for food for man and/or animals. Some are for medicines.  Some plants are meant as companions for one another so that one protects the other from various pests whilst the other one does the same for the first one, thus preventing a failed harvest. Marijuana is one of those plants which man has found a use for which is, almost certainly, NOT the use for which God intended it.  However, if I am correct, marijuana is also called Cannabis (isn't it?) and trials are going on at this time to use cannabis to treat multiple sclerosis and a few other things.  Some people are using it for that purpose now (although it will be considered illegal until the medical trials are completed and might then only be available on prescription. Everything on this earth can be used for good or evil and man, being naturally evil, will often take the wrong course.  A plant which can be used to ease pain can also be used to cause pain so why would man choose to use something in a harmful way rather than waiting until the safe way has been determined?", 8159, "mCy1jIEvaa", 0],

I was going out with this guy i REALLY like and he agreed to take me weeks in advance. It's a really hard drive there and i was nervous bout driving myself) I even planned on paying for gas. I tell him the time to meet me and he tells me that it's just too early and that he can't do it. I ask him for just this once can he be more accomidating since i really like this guy. He declines. At the last minute, I find a ride over there thinking that atleast my friend can give me a ride home. He knew that the date ended at 6:00 because my date had to go to work then.  He doesn't answer any of my calls until right at six. He then tells me that he can't make it. I'm stranded in a huge college town that i've only been to once years ago. I beg him to come telling him that there is no other way. He still says no. I am stuck for 4 hours until a family member came. I'm still extremely pissed.
