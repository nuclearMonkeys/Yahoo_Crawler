In fact, Olympus boxed itself into the tiny 4/3 sensor format and sensor prices dropped, the world moves to full frame, Olympus simply cannot keep up. It was sold to prevent bankruptcy.

That is a very good price for a very good camera. Canon cameras have an advantage over Nikon because the lower end model Nikon cameras cannot autofocus with older lenses that need an in body autofocusing motor. Canon cameras have always have the autofocus motor in the lens, so there are more older autofocus lenses available for Canon cameras than for Nikon cameras  It is best to restrict your shopping for used Canon cameras to the 30D/40D or xxD series because they have better viewfinders and built quality than the Rebel series cameras..For fashion photography a wide angle to telephoto zoom lens may be the best option.  An 18-55 zoom lens would do for a beginner.

	49735 : ["On Earth, we have a rather dramatic transition from gas (our atmosphere) to solid (the Earth's crust). That sharp transition creates a medium in which we can easily move through the air but receive enough resistance from the solid that it can support us - we can stand on it. On Jupiter there is no such transition. Instead as we work our way down through Jupiter's atmosphere it just keeps getting denser and denser. Eventually the gaseous hydrogen becomes liquid hydrogen. We keep descending and it becomes denser and denser until that liquid hydrogen becomes a super hot liquid metal. If we kept descending, we likely would eventually come to a solid core. But the interior pressure on Jupiter is millions of times greater than on the Earth. The heat and pressure would have destroyed us and our spacecraft long before we got to that core. The extreme density of the liquid would have made it impossible for us to even propel ourselves towards the core.", 6984, "None", 0],

	49748 : ["Ravi, thanks for your A2A. I'm going to say mostly because of the amazing quality of construction, the huge sensor, and the fact that they are practically handmade and sell very few units, so the price per unit goes up a lot.Because of the legendary build standard, Hasselblads have always been quite $pendy. I had three of them, 500Cs and a CM when I had my studio, all used (could never afford them new), all with large Zeiss 80mm Planars, six backs, prism finder, and all fully adjustable camera to camera. They were my wedding cameras, and it's near impossible not to get that many copies for filming weddings.This even if anything stops at a reception, the families can never even know that it has happened. Only pick up a random one and head straight ahead. The medium square shape of Hasselblad allowed for enormous enlargements and the cropping could go either horizontally or vertically, or not at all; in the original square, we also addressed enlargements.Today, Carl Zeiss optics, plus big $ensor$, still have that amazing build quality and interchangeability. Base price is determined by sensor scale. Note the price differences between tiny-sensored and full-frame cameras. Twice the region of a 24x36 mm full-frame is the wide 48x36 mm sensor on a Hasselblad digital. I assume that's because the medium format sensor is rendered by integrating (somehow)Sensors for a full-frame. It's no longer square, but it's still big, and that can, at least technically, mean better picture quality.", 6994, "nJJW6R2Haa", -2],

	49750 : ["Depends on who is maintaining the system, the retention rules of the system owner (residence, small business, medium business, large business, department at the business, school, government agency or whatever. Example 1: The 8 camera system at my house retains up to two weeks. One camera is always recording, the others record for 5 minutes when ANY of the cameras is triggered by motion. If something \"interesting\" happens, I get that video from the NVR and store it on my computer. In this example, what is the storage duration? The two weeks on the local Network Video Recorder or the weeks/months/years on the computer? Example 2: The company I used to work for had a 20 camera system. All cameras recorded to a large hard drive. Every month, the hard drive was replaced with another hard drive. There were 60 hard drives in the \"rotation schedule\". The newly full (actually only about 75% full) hard drive would be stored off site and the oldest hard drive at the off site secure storage would be put into the recorder, format, then set to record. So... 60 hard drives divided by 12 months = 5 years. Example 3: A friend has a \"clock hidden nanny cam\". The SD flash memory card she uses can store up to a couple of hours of video. It is easy enough to swap cards... or record new video over the oldest video. We don't know which camera surveillance or \"duration\" you are asking about.", 6994, "HySNnkXAaa", 2],
