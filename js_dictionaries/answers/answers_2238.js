If he is, when he's screaming, do not talk to him, do not yell, do not go check on him. If you're in the room with him, quietly walk away and stay out of his sight until he is done. Then come back in to the room and praise him. Male cockatiels are very vocal, and very smart. If he learns that you give him attention (by talking, yelling, etc.) he'll continue to scream. And yes, yelling is an incentive for him. Believe it or not, you look pretty funny when you yell, and it entertains him.", 10513, "0d03492f980d7892688e2ed5ea390d3baa", 1],

What I have learned with mine - is he gets louder when by a window - and since you have two - he is feeling protective. He might be hearing other birds - and telling him that this is his space.  Try turning a radio on near the cage - that will take the sounds of the other birds away and you might have to change stations - to his liking. Mine is VERY picky. There are several really good searches about this - use www.goodsearch.com and you can donate to your favorite cause. Good luck!", 10513, "baea33c64630744fecd4dd2237879656aa", 2],

There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc. We own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment. FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery <= costly bec not readily available like Dells... and FYI I also ran into a similar problem when attempting to upgrade the memory. Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site... Hope the Above Info Helps!", 10515, "UV8bN0Giaa", 0],
