Unfortunately , The chances of wining best in show are very slim lets say on a , Doberman, Rotty, Staffy, or boxer with natural tail and ears. Mostly due to the fact that the tails and ears were cropped and docked when AKC accepted these dogs into their club 50 years ago.  Maintaining an original form is why there is a AKC or CKC.  A true AKC breeder will not sell any pup unless a tail, dew claws are done.

Don't ever buy from pet stores; the help is clueless and the dogs usually have issues. We lived in Tucson for a long time and there are plenty of shelters in that area. I am all for adopting from shelters to save a life, but due to your child's special needs, you should consider going through a good breeder. When you adopt an older dog from a shelter, you can never be sure of the temperament or behavioral issues the dogs might have. The animalplanet.com website has a \"what breed is right for me\" test that will show you what breeds best match your needs based on size, exercise lever, energy level, protection, etc. That you are looking for.

Having said that, I couple years ago I adopted a black lab who had been in a hoarding situation, 50 cats and the lab in one house with an elderly woman, I felt very bad for the cats, dog and woman involved.  I ended up adopting the dog since I wanted an older dog who I knew would get along with cats and thought this would be perfect.  The dog was wonderful and after a few weeks I noticed a lot of strange behaviors I had never seen in other dogs I have had, turns out the dog had been at one time an assistance dog for someone who had epilepsy.  The dog was the most gentle, intelligent and \"tuned in\" dog I have every had.  The dog was very good at reading people and signals since her job had been to alert the person with epilepsy that they were at risk of having a seizure.  I don't have epilepsy and neither did anyone I know but just the fact that the dog was so well trained and patient was amazing. I tell you this as a suggestion, you may want to look into adopting a former assistance dog.

To start on a positive note, I want to assure you that with proper help from a professional, you will gradually start to feel better and believe it or not start feeling happy, BUT, you have to want to help yourself, and that includes dropping the attitude and cooperating with the psychiatrist.  If you have to ‘shop' around for one you like and can share your feelings with (honestly) make the effort to find that person.  S/he is going to be a BIG part of your getting your depression under control. The things you've done and experienced in the past are in the past and that is where they should stay.  Now, as for the guy you're seeing, get rid of him ASAP!!  He is obviously making your depression worse.  No person deserves to be mentally abused.  Kick him to curb.  I don't care if he tells you he is going to change – HE WON'T. When one is in a depressed state, it is extremely difficult to stay focused on anything.  I would bet that you failed English and don't ‘get' Math is because you unable to concentrate.  I believe if you get the professional help you need, you'll find you are able to concentrate and can then take the appropriate steps to make sure you are on the road to graduating with your peers. Being shy has a lot to do with the lack of self confidence (another symptom of depression).  Oftentimes depression is coupled with anxiety, unfortunately.  Your psychiatrist can help there too.  I believe you would also do well in group therapy.  Don't dismiss it, just think about it.  Believe it or not, there are so many people (children, teens, adults, seniors) that suffer from depression, BUT it is treatable. You believe you fail at everything you do because that is what depression wants you to believe.  It's a disease and if you don't get it under control, you may just truly convince yourself that suicide is the best option.  Suicide is NEVER, EVER the answer. You may be asking yourself, “How does this lady know how I am feeling?”  I know because I've been where you are.  I have suffered from clinical depression since my early 20's and there were times I never thought I would get out of that deep, dark hole.  I landed in the hospital twice because I wasn't making any sense at all and just wanted to die. I know first-hand you can overcome depression because I am living proof, BUT, again, you have to WANT to help yourself.  Start right now – make an appointment with a psychiatrist. People care….

Dogs can be very soothing to people who have conditions like autism, so it might become a valuable best friend there. Especially a dog such as a retriever or a labrador. PetSmart isn't the best place to \"adopt\". A proper shelter will be able to help you more and match you with the perfect dog. Look around your local neighbourhood for the best shelter, I cannot help you much since I am in the UK, so that is all I can suggest. Best of luck to you!", 9352, "8OaZAujLaa", 1],
	90264 : ["First, no one should be treated like that when looking for a dog. You are looking for a new member of the family and that should be a good experience.  There should be no problem with your son as long as you find a calm dog, but one that wont be pushed around.  It is good that you want an older dog, not a puppy, because you can tell how the dog will act.  Try not to get a very hyper dog or a very timid dog, because these will get ryled up or scared very easily.  Before you go to see the dogs with your family, go and see if the dogs meet your requirements, then bring your family afterwords.  Be sure to lay down the rules with the dog and kids asap and be very firm.  With your case, I would reccomend a smaller to medium sized dog because these tend to be the friendliest and calmest dogs, but that really depends on the dog so that may not always be the case. Good luck and have fun with your dog!", 9352, "qsZxZbWbaa", -1],
