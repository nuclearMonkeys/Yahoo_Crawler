	57881 : ["You were reading?  Source?  URL? This is your interpretation of what you read, and I agree the consent rules in college are confusing. YOU are confused. Where I think you are confused is the difference between what appears to have happened vs. what actually happened. If a woman is terrified and says she consents BECAUSE she is terrified, she isn't really consenting, is she?  Consenting under duress of, say, violence, isn't consenting, is it? So this gets very confusing when later on she testifies that she SAID yes,  but she didn't want it.  This doesn't mean she didn't want it after the fact, it means that she didn't want it before the fact but, basically, lied to him. Of course, people have different reasons for feeling compelled to have sex beyond threat of physical violence, and clearly women absolutely have used the above ambiguities to absolutely lie and turn \"regretted having sex\" into \"was raped\". But it is quite possible to apparently consent to sex and actually be raped. In the world of miscommunication, it is certainly possible that people misread each other and in my mind, it's really hard to throw somebody in jail for the crime of misinterpreting what is going on, but again, just as a person can turn regret for sex into rape, so too can a person deliberately misunderstand. The big reason we have judges and juries is to determine the credibility of witnesses - and yeah, women tend to appear more credible than men in such environments.  That is, women can get away with lying more than men can. It's not that she can legally decide after the fact that she didn't want sex, it's that she can lie about it and probably be believed. *THAT* is the double standard you should be pissed off at.", 8020, "8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa", 1],

Be very choosy of who you want to have sexual intercourse with, because there are many mentally unstable people out there and you don't want to end up fvcking someone who may later accuse you of rape.  Or may end up actually raping you. When my kids leave home, I will be having this talk with them, regardless of how cringe worthy it'll be for both of us.  I'd rather they were informed about these pitfalls, than uninformed.  Take responsiblity.", 8020, "BGj3gzuRaa", 2],

	57885 : ["Its the idea that men have entitlement and rights, but not being able to provide one example of legal discrimination against women in the US today while there are dozens against men. The following is defined as equality by those complaining about the patriarchy and are currently legal under our ACTUAL matriarchy - It's all about a mothers rights, but no fathers rights. Women being treated like princesses in prison and men being treated like animals. Female prison guards humiliate and degrade men with strip searches, shower supervision etc, but female prisoners get privacy and respect from male prison guards. Bodily choice for women, but forced genital mutilation for boys, referring to women's rights to their bodies in terms of abortion, but boys being circumcised without choice. Female reporters and staff allowed in men's locker rooms, but privacy and respect for female athletes. This is the definition of feminist equality.  Is this an example of the respect that feminists claim MEN don't have for the opposite sex? Its women getting everything in a divorce, and men being torn away from their children Female sex offenders being slapped on the wrist, but male sex offenders being incarcerated the rest of their lives Its men being sentenced to more time for the same crime than women. This can be researched under the US government and shows that women don't get held accountable to the level that men do. Women having the right to use the men's room, but a man who walks in to the women's room is arrested for being disrespectful and perverted. Men use urinals, but that's still not enough for women to have basic respect for men's privacy. Its a feminized education system that cripples natural behavior of boys, makes being male a crime in school, then girls claiming they are smarter. Why is it when two people under the age of consent have sex, only the boy is charged with doing something wrong? Its women being allowed to drown five children and using the fact she is a woman to get away with it - Andrea Yates Its women being allowed to use domestic violence as an excuse to murder a sleeping husband, even though there is no evidence of domestic abuse - Mary Winkler Its the extensive abuse of restraining orders to vilify an innocent man and get leverage in a divorce. A restraining order against a man can be served even without his knowledge or an opportunity to defend himself. Its men being jailed for defending themselves against an abusive wife, but called a wimp if he takes the abuse Its women demanding respect from men, but never having to respect them in return Its women having the choice between abortion, adoption, dropping an unwanted baby off at a hospital, raising the child with a father, or raising the child without a father, but the only choice men have is to agree. Its 3 innocent Duke Lacrosse players losing their lives because we don't ever think a woman could lie about rape - let alone prosecute her for doing so. Its women labeling men as abusive when the US government has shown women cause more child abuse than men. Its female rape being horrendous, but male rape being funny and made in to comedy movies. Rape is a legally accepted part of the justice system, but only against men. Its just about every TV show being allowed to humiliate and degrade men, but women complaining and calling it sexist if they were treated the same. It's more health care spending going towards women's health than men's. Breast cancer receives 7 times the funding of prostate cancer. There are three departments of women's health in the US government, but none for men. However, men live an average of 5 years less than women when the genders used to have the same life span. Its allowing women only clubs and banning men only clubs It's doing everything we can to help girls in math and science, but letting boys fall further behind in everything else. It's defining equal pay for equal work as men playing five sets of tennis, but women only playing three. Maybe women claiming 3=5 is the reason for the above point Its cutting men's sports in college in favor of women's sports that have no interest Its female murderers being mentally ill, but male murderers just being evil Its claiming men walk out on their family when its actually women who file 80% of divorces Its men being portrayed as evil, stupid or buffoons on TV and all women being perfect or superior. Its women wanting equality for their gender, but men being called chauvinist pigs when they want equality for their gender Its fixing the education system when girls are failing, and blaming the boys when boys are failing Its women being allowed to level false accusation against an innocent man without consequence. Read Duke Lacrosse and many other examples. Feminism has installed this right to women through the courts. Its a man being a chauvinist, sexist pig when he doesn't respect women, but a women who doesn't respect men is an admirable, strong and independent woman. Women remove male role models from their sons' lives, then when their sons behave badly, the women blame \"patriarchy.\" Stereotyping girls as inferior to boys in any facet of life is \"misogyny\"; stereotyping boys as potential batterers and rapists is a public service announcement. Women insist their husbands assume the responsibilities of being a full parent, but as soon as a woman files for divorce, he is just an ATM. Its feminists not being able to provide one example of legal discrimination against women in the US today. ", 8021, "0598aff171be5b3a01a9295637d229edaa", 2],

It looks at the leaders to notice that they are male, then assumes that the male leaders will grant power to all men, just because they too are males.  This completely ignores the reality that men compete with each other for power at the top, for starters. It then looks at the remaining power structure, as in the senate, congress and judiciary, which is currently 30% female, and ignores that to still call the entire system a \"patriarchy\". The truth is that common men have no more \"power\" than common women do.  If we actually lived in a patriarchy then men would have some sort of legal authority or dominion over women.  This means some random guy could go up to Oprah, or a female senator and tell them to step aside so that they can take over their positions. The entire feminist premise of \"the Patriarchy\" is an unfounded assertion.  It posits that all men conspire to give themselves some sort of control over women, and provides anecdotal examples with no actual proof of any kind.  That is a conspiracy theory. .", 8032, "aSm9xSn3aa", 5],
