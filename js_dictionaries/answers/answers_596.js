	33629 : ["The way he thematically wins - i.e. joining a brand-new team and winning the Super Bowl right off the bat (after a very rocky start that to me looks more and more scripted)... I think of the movie based on the game \"Quiz Show.\" I mean I get it. WWE is scripted. I don't think the NFL has ever officially said officially that the sport itself is NOT scripted... so going the very technical way they could've simply made is think it isn't... without asking... so that in the event that it is... they (the league) would be guilty of no wrongdoing. I believe mental focus and mentality is a huge, huge part of sports... as I used to play them as often as possible when I was younger and had friends... but for a guy to waltz into an organization and flip the team better than a coach... that's kinda shady to me. It was a little too storybook. If he won the SB with Tampa say - the 2nd season with them if the script were patient enough... I probably wouldn't have typed any of the abovesaid.  If my conspiracy theory is correct it really justifies itself because the commissioner literally had to hand him the trophy after Deflategate so - I hope some will rub their chins about this - not that it has anything to do with anything besides just knowing whether or not something is scripted or not. No one could claim damages I don't think... since the question was never really asked.  They couldn't really say 'I bought tickets to games based on them being real competition!' because the league could say 'We never said it was...' Behind every setup is an elaborate thing... and perhaps humble men willing to be in a bad spotlight for just a temporary, uncomfortable amount of time... that will easily be forgotten when the benefits arrive.  This is all just my humble opinion and wild imagination. I look up at the stars at night and my brain just gets flooded with so many ideas - including but not limited to how I could possibly leave this planet. ", 5109, "749a489dda09a15d224ff2a0f3c8b462aa", 0],

	33633 : ["Quite a small move. I really like Watkins when he first came out, and thought he was criminally underexploited in Buffalo because of bad quarterbacking.  But after his 2nd year, Watkins has seen declining performance and health every year.  He's basically depth at this point.  Hoping he gets his act together and miraculously returns to his early career form is just wishful thinking. I think it shows how desperate the Ravens are getting.  They've taken swings at just about every big name WR that has signed and been turned down every time.  Sometimes for LESS MONEY.  It seems to indicate what receivers think either of Lamar Jackson or of OC Greg Roman.  Or both.", 5111, "3Cd8Iq5gaa", 1],

Heading into the draft, there's no guarantee that the front office isn't going to do something else dumb this year under the guise of \"looking to the future\".  I think the Packers grind their way back to the playoffs next year, but won't have a deep run.  And sometime early the following spring, he announces his retirement.", 5121, "oZkGVsMDaa", 0],
