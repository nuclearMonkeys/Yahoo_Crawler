As has been said here, this is why so many dogs end up with behavioural problems. Okay, most will 'tolerate' this sort of a solitary life, but dogs are social animals, and condemning them to being left on their own for so long isn't the life I want for my dogs!! Okay, circumstances can mean this has to happen, and obviously keeping them like this is preferable to having to think about rehoming them (been there, temporarily) but it makes me weep to read of all the dogs, these days, who are being brought into this sort of situation deliberately. I know it's more and more necessary for people to be working full time these days, but in that case, surely more thought should be given to whether it's fair on the dog/puppy, to be having them in the first place. Cats cope with living a solitary life, in the main, dogs don't. I didn't have a dog until I could (afford to) give them the life I feel all dogs deserve. I'm not placing all the blame on owners here - I'm shocked at the fact so many breeders are willing to send their puppies into this situation. I didn't - or at least I made certain arrangements were being made for somebody to come in during the 8 hours, to be with the puppies I sold.", 10009, "nCiWkZosaa", 0],
