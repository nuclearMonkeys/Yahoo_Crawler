(1) write a balanced reaction .. (2) convert everything given to moles .. (3) determine limiting reagent .. (4) convert moles limiting reagent to moles product .. (5) convert moles product to mass product.  this is theoretical yield in mass .. (6) % yield = (actual mass recovered / theoretical mass) x 100% the idea being, the coefficients of a balanced equation give is MOLE ratios of chemicals in the reactions.  So we can use those values to convert between moles of the different substances. ********* in this case, we're given % yield and asked to find actual yield. the only difference then is in step 6. *** 1 *** balanced reaction .. 1 Cl2 + 2 KBr ---> 2 KCl + 1 Br2 *** 2 *** moles .. 35.1L Cl2 @STP * (1 mol / 22.41L @STP) =1.566 mol Cl2 .. 1.50L KBr * (3.50 mol KBr / 1L ) = 5.25 mol KBr *** 3 *** limiting reagent.  There are 3 ways to do this.  In this case, the simplest way is to divide moles available by coefficient of balanced equation.  Whichever ratio is the lowest belongs to the limiting reagent .. mol Cl2 / coeff. Cl2 = 1.566 / 1 = 1.566 .. mol KBr / coeff. KBr = 5.25 / 2 = 2.625 since 1.566 < 2.625, Cl2 is the LR *** 4 *** convert moles LR to moles product .. 1.566 mol Cl2 * (1 mol Br2 / 1 mol Cl2) = 1.566 mol Br2 *** 5 *** theoretical mass Br2 .. 1.566 mol Br2 * (159.81g Br2 / mol Br2) = 250.3g Br2 *** 6 *** actual mass Br2 .. % yield = (actual / theoretical) * 100% .. actual = (%yield / 100%) * theoretical .. actual = (35% / 100%) * 250.3g = 87.60g and finally, we want to convert that to mL .. 87.60g Br2 * (1mL / 3.10g) = 28.2mL ", 10993, "AA11915874", 1],

You could also post on freecycle       People often have them lying around collecting dust - better to put them to use than buy new ones. You can use raffia for the baskets, or hay instead of the plastic grass (unless you already have some then of course reusing is best). Try and use your own sliver ware and plates too if you're serving food - as well as cloth napkins etc if you have them.
