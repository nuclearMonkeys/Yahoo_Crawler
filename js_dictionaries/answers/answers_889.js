	49499 : ["Any camera shop will do it for you. It's commonly recommended that you load the film in shade or in a dimly lit room.  There's zero need to go into a totally dark room.  I've loaded film for decades out in bright sunlight and never had a problem.  The film canisters are 100% light proof.  The reason it's advised to load the film in low-light areas is just in case you do something wrong. The process can be confusing and frustrating at first.  You don't mention the model of Pentax so you either have a point and shoot or you have an SLR. If you have a point and shoot: 1) Place the canister inside the camera and pull the film leader just enough for the tip to reach the marker on the other side of the camera's insides.  This marker is often a red square or red line. The mistake people make doing this is that they want to absolutely make sure that the film gets loaded, so they pull the leader beyond the marker.  Ironically, this causes the camera to fail to load the film.  So never pull the film beyond the marker. If you have an SLR, then you either have an old manual focus type or an auto focusing type. If you have an auto focusing SLR, the loading procedure is the same as a point and shoot camera.  You will know that the film is loaded properly because a \"1\" will appear in the LCD screen on both types of cameras. If you have a manual focusing SLR (e.g. Pentax K-1000, ME, ME Super), then the film loading is a little trickier.  What you need to do is pull the film leader out just enough for the tip to slide between the take-up spool and the bit that holds the film tight to the spool. Next, close the film door. Next, gently rotate the film rewind knob clockwise to up any slack inside the film canister.  Do this without pressing the rewind button on the bottom of the camera. Next advance the film by rotating the advance lever.  You might have to trip the shutter in order for you to do this.  Because you have already rotated the rewind knob to take up any slack inside the film canister, as you advance the film, the top of the rewind knob MUST turn because it is physically matched up and connected to the film spool.  As the film is pulled out, the spool must turn and so must the rewind knob.  This is a sure-fire way of confirming that 1) your film is loaded properly, and 2) you have film in the camera.  If you're ever uncertain if there's film in the camera, simply gently rotate the rewind knob clockwise (without pressing the rewind button on the bottom of the camera).  If the rewind knob stops and won't turn, you know there's film inside the camera. If these steps don't help, go onto Youtube and do a search for loading 35mm film.  It does not matter if you are using a Canon, Nikon, Minolta or Pentax manual-focus camera; they all use basically the same system to load and rewind the film.", 6965, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],
	49500 : ["You can tell if the film is loaded properly or not by watching if the rewind knob rotates or not. Many of the newest film cameras have automatic film loading and built-in motorized film advance. You just need to pull the film leader out a bit and close the camera back. Some of the older Pentax cameras have \"magic needles\" you just put the film in between those thin white posts, make sure the film is between the top and bottom film guard rails and close the camera back. If all else fails, give up film and take pictures with a digital camera. I cannot figure out why anyone would still take pictures with technology that is over 100 years old and that costs more money to use than the newest technology. ", 6965, "None", 0],

	49513 : ["There are different types of film and digital cameras such as point-and-shoot types, SLR/DSLR, rangefinder/mirrorless, and even medium format.  For the most part, these cameras work very similarly to each other in their respective category. The basic difference is that analog cameras use film and digital cameras use a sensor.  Film has silver halide which reacts to light hitting it, while a sensor has pixels which also reacts when hit by light. The biggest difference between film/digital is the user experience. With film, you had to wait for the film to developed and then printed, and of course with digital you get results in seconds or less.  This has greatly reduced the time and cost needed to learn the fundamentals of photography.  A photography student could easily shoot 15 rolls of 36 exposure film per week.  Over the course of year, a student could easily spend more on film than what they paid for a digital camera. Mistakes common with film are now history with digital cameras.  No more taking photos without any film in the camera.  Today's digital cameras will warn you that there's no memory card inserted.  No more accidentally opening the film door exposing and ruining the film.  No more need for darkrooms with toxic chemicals that stain your clothes.  The computer is your \"darkroom.\" And, of course, the sharing of images is now ubiquitous.  But with film, you had to make double prints for a set to mail to grandma.", 6928, "OczpbeMdaa", 0],

	49523 : ["Camera is just a tool.  As with any tool, it has its specific uses.  The problem that I have answering your question is that you make zero mention of any photo/video needs.  It could be that both of these cameras are going to be totally inadequate for your needs, or maybe they're both overkill, or just right.  Who knows? Are you concerned with image quality?  Probably.  Are you concerned with high ISO performance?  Maybe, but still probably.  You can compare image quality and ISO performance of these cameras here:  You mention overheating which is only an issue for those making videos.  If you need a camera for video, the G7X is not going to be a good choice for this very reason.  You'd be far better off with a compact camcorder than any digital camera at any price which includes the $6,000 Nikon or Canons.  The one and only reason to NOT get a camcorder for video and instead get a digital camera, is that you need that shallow depth of field look that can only be obtained with larger sensors such as APS-C and full frame.  If that's not part of your needs, you should avoid digital cameras and just get a camcorder.  A camcorder will cost you a fraction of the price while providing superior functionality, far better workflow *(e.g. not having to wait an half hour while the camera cools down), and better final video quality. One of the things that makes the G7X Mark II bad for video is that it does not have either an external mic or headphone jack.  Both are required for those who are using the camera for video.  The G7X Mark III does have an external mic jack, but no external headphone jack.  The last thing you want is to have created a video just to find out that the audio was unusable for whatever reason. The reason (as far as I can tell) that the Mark III is more expensive is that it can shoot in 4K while the Mark II can't.  Based on a side-by-side comparison of main features, there's little to no other difference between these two cameras:  Personally, I think the G7X line is far and away over priced for what it provides.  The image quality (as you can see in the link) is meh to unacceptable especially outside of the center of the image. Camcorders are about the same size as this point and shoot.  The image quality will be superior.  The lack of problems of a camcorder such as overheating will save you time and frustration.  However, if you have to get a digital camera and use it for video (something that it was never designed to do well), then consider one of the high-end Panasonic cameras like a GH4 or a Sony A7S II/III - however even the $3,500 Sony A7S bodies are overheating.  Why?  Because they are still cameras and not designed for video.  Yeah, you can use them for video, but at the expense of a lot of problems, delays and overall headaches.", 6962, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],

Jewish degenerates become politicians (or similar high rank in society). In Germany during Hitler time, it was eight times. Hitler, Stalin (aka Jugashvilli which means son of Jew), Roosevelt, Churchill were all Jewish degenerates. Hitler had many Jewish coworkers as homosexual partners.
