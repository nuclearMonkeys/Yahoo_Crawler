You've seen one, you've seen 'em all.  Who the hell cares? Did you know that grown-up women wouldn't DREAM of having a bachelor party with strippers? The very idea is repulsive.  And boring.  And embarassing.  I don't know who your creepy friends are but... eech!   YUCK! PS:  No self-respecting man would go to such a place,  either.  A man who frequents such places would NOT be a good bet for 'husband material'.  Can you say \"slimeball\"?

People hate O.J. because we had to sit through his trial ad nauseum and couldn't get away from it. Or, if you look at the victims they were very sympathetic. Also, O.J. had a record of domestic violence. And, yes, his smug, self-satisfied expression was annoying. I put him in the same realm as Scott Peterson -- people hate him, too.

	67604 : ["Libertarian One cannot legitimately assume the \"Necessary and Proper\" clause has any meaning beyond reinforcing the enumerated powers of Article 1 of the constitution.   The founders unanimously voted down a purposed clause that would have allowed Congress to legislate based on perceived necessity.  They settled on the \"Necessary and Proper\" clause because of it's specific implications with regards to the enumerated powers. Both Federalists and Anti-Federalists rejected the idea that Congress should have the ability to determine the scope of their own powers.  The Anti-Federalists understood that unfettered federal authority to expand the enumerated powers of Article 1 was a threat to State's rights and autonomy as well as individual freedom.  Federalists saw the clause as affirmation of the Congress' rights with regards to enforcing and carrying out the enumerated powers of Article 1.
