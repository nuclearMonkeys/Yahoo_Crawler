Certainly ready made, junk furniture is created with a fine ground MDF and often contact paper type laminate over.    MDF paints well enough, and you can finish edges with molding.    It would also be as strong or supportive as the best grades of wood you could install. It isn't my fave, but it obviously works and is widely sold. If MDF isn't to your likeing you can use pine plank, birch or other veneer ply, which has a sweet looking grain to it for staining.    I'll assume, with all due respect that as a built in, you want it to look like a quality piece. You can, depending on the level of effort you wish to expend, make it look decent with many materials ranging from bargain to expensive.
