I got hooked, first for my kids sake, then sheer obsession with solving puzzles.. now, I research anyone who walks within 15 feet of me.  I hang out here to help others, and looking for challenges.  For me, it has become my brain exercise.  I am a dinosaur on the topic.. in other words..when I started, I didn't have a computer.. there was no internet.. and most of the work was in libraries (cranking microfilm), writing letters, hunting down relatives and grilling them (the older the better), and eventually all the vacations just \"happened\" to be where I could stop at a cemetery or courthouse.   In the mid 80s.. computers started on the market.. my first computer was a Tandy coco, no hard drive/ floppy drive. Storage was on cassette tapes and modems (no one had heard of them then) was putting the phone handset onto a gadget.. and long distance calls by the minute. I discovered bulletin boards.. my husband discovered huge phone bills. But we considered it worth the investment. Sure made it better when \"long distance\" charges went out of vogue. I learned a lot about computers on the side (got tired of asking hubby how to do this/that, or waiting for him to come home from work).  The thing about genealogy.. we are all different in interests.. but EVERYONE has ancestors..good ones, bad ones, indifferent.  You learn why grandpa from the 30s was so frugal, because you learned about the Depression. Whoever or whatever your family is/was, they help you realize that you are connected to history.  Oh.. I am 60 now. One thing about it now, is that I can do my stuff while sitting on my rear. And I love interacting with people (this is a great way to meet them).", 10329, "7ONKVbbiaa", 4],

They are escape artists and most cannot be trusted off leash! ...don't like to walk or exercise, but would also like to keep their house in one piece! A bored husky is a destructive husky! A tired husky is a good husky! ...can't stand getting dog hair on thier clothes, funiture, carpets, counters, beds, food, etc...and don't like to vacuum. Sibes shed regularly, and twice a year they literally \"blow\" their entire undercoat out, we are talking bushels or fur here! ...like to keep their lawns perfect. Sibes like to dig, mine digs for and frequently kills mice and moles in the yard. The lawn looks a bit like a minefield. ...have small animals, ie cats. Huskies have very high prey drives and although some can be trained out of it if they are raised with animals as puppies, many can not and will chase and kill small animals! ...don't have a lot of free time to spend with a dog. Some dogs do fine on their own for many hours a day. Most huskies do not. They have a high instance of separation anxiety and often howl, or whine when left alone (not great for the neighbors). ...are looking for a protective or \"watch\" dog. They love everyone and since most don't bark much they make lousy alert dogs. They are NOT protective dogs by nature. ...don't have the time or knowledge to train a \"stubborn\" animal. In reality they are just very independant and intelligent, but it can seem like stubbornness when you tell them to \"come\" and they look at you and then walk the other way. And the most important group of people who should not own a Siberian Husky...those who have not done ALL of the research to find out exactly what the dog will need and if it will be compatible with their lifestyle before getting one!!!! Huskies have a high rate of surrender for some or all of the reasons I mentioned above. My girl was pretty damaged from living in a cage 24/7 when we got her, it took us 6 months to get her to start trusting people, esp men again. No matter what breed you are interested in you MUST read, read, read, and ask questions of current owners, breeders, or trainers that might be able to help steer you towards or away from a certain breed!!

	112934 : ["I live on the North Shore and work in the city so all the info below relates to the North Shore.  This is the easiest place to get to the city from in all of Auckland because of the ferry services, there is one from Devonport, Bayswater, Northcote & Birkenhead & they all take only 10 minutes so no traffic hassles (costs $35 for a 10 ride ticket or $115 for a monthly pass). A beautiful, peaceful way to get to work, especially in summer & in winter not so bad as the ferries are big so they don't rock around in rough weather like you think they would & they are rarely cancelled due to the weather (only once last year & once the year before during storms to my knowledge).   I don't have kids but my friend recommends Westlake College (they have a  separate school for girls & boys) & one of her kids is going to be a doctor so the education must be good.  She also likes it that her 2 boys turned out so polite & respectful through going to Westlake Boys (just as well for her as she is a single mother).  There is also Takapuna Grammar for boys only which I think is the only private school on the North Shore.  I have also heard Rangitoto College is good.  Rangitoto and the Westlake School's are not private ones but Westlake is apparently as good as a private school.  Bear in mind kids from private schools can turn out snobby & you may not want your kid to turn out like that.  Avoid living in Birkdale & Beach Haven as those are the bad area's (although Coastal Beach Haven is fine & parts of Birkdale are fine.  Don't live in Northcote unless you're Asian or you won't fit in (it's pretty much a Chinatown & also there are some bad area's there where the state houses are with alot of unemployed people, drug sales, etc, but nothing like the ghetto areas you get in your country or course).  The North Shore is mostly white people so not very multicultural like the rest of Auckland (which is a bad thing I think).  Alot of South African's live on the North Shore, particularly around Browns Bay.  Takapuna, Devonport & Milford are expensive area's.  There are great parks/bushwalking area's on the North Shore like Centennial Park (lots of Kauri tree's & tui's (awesome native birds) & other birdlife, the Kauri forest there is right on the shoreline with views of the city skyline & there's even a beach to walk down to.  Also apparently Le Roys Bush has glow worms at night time (a local secret - have never been so can't verify it). Beware of the parks & bushwalks in Beach Haven though as there is a criminal element there sometimes (but nothing like the USA though you understand).  You can contact the education department (just google it on google.co.nz) to find out more info re the school's though.  Re the guy above recommending Sydney, it depends what you're after, if you have kids you'd probably prefer here.  I lived in Sydney for 3 years & yes the nightlife is good but I think it's the same nightlife as Auckland's quite frankly.  Sydney was way hot & humid with huge bugs & dangerous spiders, etc & we don't have that here.  Also more crime there & people aren't polite & can be quite aggressive (pushing ahead in line, etc) & you might get smart **** comments re being an American (they are very outspoken & tactless there).  Go there on holiday while you're here & you decide (although living in Sydney is vastly different from just visiting as when you visit there's not much time to notice the daily things that can irk you when you live there).  The down side of Auckland is it rains alot & February is the only reliably good weather month if you're having visitors want to come from overseas.", 10333, "None", 2],

	112936 : ["lawls no boasting, but I'd suggest my school: St Cuthbert's College, because we have some of the highest-rated pass marks in the country; 90something% pass mark, 30something% excellence NCEA and IB. That's in epsom, on this side of the bridge. on the other side, north shore, the well-known safe private school is Kristen College, i think it's near Albany. Westlake highs and rangitoto are VERY well known among students for their promiscuousness, half of the stories probably aren't true, but lots are, and we all use NCEA.  Takapuna Grammar is quite good, public. a very good public school for highschool boys is Auckland Grammar. It uses cambridge and NCEA. VERY competitive. The well-known private schools in Auckland are as follows: St Cuthbert's College (girls), Epsom St Kentigerns College (co-ed), Pakuranga Kings College (boys, co-ed yrs 12-13), Otahuhu Diocesan School for girls (girls lawl), Epsom/Remuera Dilworth school, which is right beside Diocesan.

Another oddity was that many people in marching band were popular. i.e. they hardly feel under the nerdy, awkward stereotype.  4. You also described the popular students very well as that it was similar here too. ( fashionable, funny, slutty sometimes, they drink, do sexual stuff to get attention, skip class but get good grades).

	112957 : ["As an athletics coach, I'm always happy to read about parents that are concerned about the health and eating habits of their children. However, your friends rational may be a little off-base. The fact of the matter is, food itself doesn't make for fat or lazy kids. Excessive amounts of daily calories, and the lack of nutrients is where most people go wrong. Children requires lots of calories, lots of proteins, and healthy fats. I see no reason to deny a child pizza or treats every once in a while. Just don't make it a \"food group\" like some do. Personally, I love your food list!!   2 yr old children aren't vegetarians. They are fed vegetarian foods, which is fine, but they need to be sure there is enough proteins included with this diet as well as other essential nutrients. This is very difficult to do on a restrict vegetarian or vegan diet. A child's nutrition and developmental needs should always be met before any religious or other indoctrinated diets.  And it has to be said, I would wiggle all over if I were fed tofu and rice cakes as well. Yuck!", 10336, "q4MR2lvAaa", 1],

The whole healthy eating thing should be desired by the child- I mean, if they're at a restaurant with another family, they should choose to eat something healthy instead of junk. This is accomplished when the child eats mostly healthy, but the parent allows ice cream and cookies for desert on occasion. If all cr@p food is withheld from children, that's all they want away from their parents. Does that make any sense? *crap! i knew i was doing something wrong!", 10336, "vXaBfga0aa", 2],
	112959 : ["\"My\" breed is the Samoyed. People that shouldn't own one: Those who cannot deal with lots of shedding. Those who don't have the time to groom them. Those who can't commit to all the exercise. Those who aren't dedicated to training (apparently Sammies can destroy houses easily). Mainly it's the grooming though, there's just so much that needs to be done and if it isn't you get matts and the coat doesn't \"work\" properly as a thermos. Generally though, Samoyeds do fit with a wide range of people. Fortunately I haven't met any Sammy owner who shouldn't, but there is a first time for everything. On the plus side though, they aren't a common breed, so few people know about them so if they do want one they do a lot of research. I found this: So...You want a Samoyed Are you interested in buying a Samoyed? Then, you've already heard how marvellous they are. We think you should also be told that they do have their shortcomings, and may not make the ideal pet for everyone who is attracted to them. Samoyeds are a gregarious lot and need the company of other dogs or of people at all times. If you work all day, or have room for only one dog . . . don't buy a Samoyed.  While capable of strong affection for his family, the Samoyed is also very friendly with strangers. So, if you want the fierce loyalty of a one-man dog . . . don't buy a Samoyed. The Samoyed is not a watch dog.  If you want a dog with aggressive guard-dog instincts . . . don't buy a Samoyed. At least once a year Samoyeds shed their coats. If you like fur all over the house and in the very air you breathe, then fine. If, however, you value neatness at all times, then . . . don't buy a Samoyed. Samoyeds have a natural proclivity for digging holes in backyards. If you take great pride in your landscaping efforts . . . don't buy a Samoyed. Samoyeds are truly JOYFUL dogs and want to share their joy by vocalizing their achievements and desires with everyone!!!!  If barking is a negative in your world, don't buy a Samoyed! Of all the shortcomings to be found in Samoyeds, the most dangerous to the pet owner is their tremendous desire to RUN.  But the very first dash that a puppy makes across the road could be his last run, anywhere. A Samoyed, for his own protection, should be kept confined or under control at all times. If you are one of those people who think it is cruel to kennel a dog, or keep him confined in his own backyard . . . don't buy a Samoyed. If you have read this far, honestly feel that you qualify on all counts, and are still determined to own a Samoyed, then we take great pleasure in welcoming you to the fold. Join the rest of us in the smug complacency of knowing that we own the most beautiful, the smartest, the most nearly ideal dog in the world . . . the SAMOYED!", 10329, "2co8VRwMaa", 2],

Anyone who would do any less than I,should  never have a Dobermann.After rescue-ing him from my neighbor,I brout him back to health.Before that, I studied hard to be an expert at canine behavior. I would only work a few hours at night,so I could be there,and continue training. I put up a 6ft fence on an acre and a half of property,so he could go out when he wanted,to'patrol the border'.I bought him the best kibble money could buy, and added organic turkey or chicken. Taught him what NOT to guard.Spent 22straight hours teaching him 'no bark', unless the person put his foot on our property.Allowed him to use his uncanny intelligence,every bit. I did not throw him away as he aged and got sick, gave him mouth to mouth resusitation,special immune booster when he had terminal cancer,and a tumor the size of a football.He totally recovered and I was inteviewed by Animal Planet for over three hours.Always slept in bed w/me,even when he was incontinent and slept in dog pee together.Lastly,I gave himALL my love,in the way HE would understand it.
