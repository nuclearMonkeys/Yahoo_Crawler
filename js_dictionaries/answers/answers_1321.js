	71677 : ["Reverend Jeremiah Wright Jr., Minister Louis Farrakhan, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and Reverend Leon H. Sullivan are Jim Crow's worse dream and nightmare. Many of the rights and privileges that African Americans accept as second nature and casually take for granted are the benefit of struggle(s). During the famous 1963 March On Washington, the rest rooms in the Bus Station(Washington, DC) were clearly identified with white and colored signs.  Today the signs are gone. Jim Crow is so deep in the character of custom in America that even African Americans slip into clutches of denial.  It is easier to accept the injustice of disparity than it is to challenge the economic divide.  There are clearly defined black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods.  Many black neighborhoods have definite disadvantages to survival.  Many white neighborhoods have definite advantages to survival.  Too many people in America are comfortable with this arrangement. Few people black or white know the history of segregation in the United States.  Without this knowledge mis perception and mis speak are commonplace.  People most affected by the disparities of economic and social injustice are complicit in their own discrimination.  Jim Crow custom has conditioned many to be happy with the status quo and the futility of change. Vocal exposure of economic and social dispartity is viewed with Jim Crow suspicion.  Since 1898 Wilmington, NC - Race Riot, Jim Crow custom and practices have sought to defer and deny African Americans access to political power.  African Americans could be lynched or shot for attempting to register or vote. Currently the method is to discourage African American and Mainstream voters from considering an African American candidate on the basis of customary Jim Crow rhetoric. Minister Louis Farrakhan facilitated a Million Man March.  Organizing an event of such magnitude is out side the realm of Jim Crow validation.  Things which Jim Crow can not control are inherently evil. The 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott was a clearly flagrant challenge to segregation in public transportation.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a \"Trouble Maker\" for facilitating the organiztion of this \"Non Violent Protest\". Dr. Leon H. Sullivan ushered the release of political prisoner Nelson Mandela.  Aparthied was brought to an end by activites which included the \"Sullivan Principles\".  African Americans operating out side the scope of Jim Crow validation are supposed to be inept on global affairs. Reverend Jeremiah Wright Jr. follows a tradition of struggle with uncomfortable and unpopular issues.  Reading the 1968 Kerner Report and the 2008 Eisenhower Foundation review of the Kerner Report suggest the Reverend Jeremiah Wright is doing what Americans are historically supposed to do.   Challenging government's failure to address economic and social need is fundamental to America.  It's Patriotic to seek  effective representation in government.", 8635, "JjU6IdnDaa", 1],

The relative batting, bowling, fielding and overall strengths displayed by both the teams in the series are given below: South Africa - 1,000 / 1,000 / 1,000 / 1,000 England - 875 / 911 / 804 / 884 England's team selection was not good enough I think. Already they are suffering because Flintoff is not available. Pietersen did not fire. Should they have dropped Bopara ? During the last one year, Bopra got 7 test matches and in 10 innings scored 460 runs at an average of 46. Should they ignore this performance ? Agreed that he did not have some good matches but we need to see performances over a period of one year to determine the level of the game a player is playing before dump him.  Major batsmen like Strauss (4 matches, 7 innings, 170 runs), Pietersen (4 matches, 7 innings, 177 runs), Trott (4 matches, 7 innings, 190 runs), Prior (4 matches, 7 innings, 158 runs) did not bat well enough. Bowling of Sidebottom (1 match, 2 wkts for 98 runs) was wayward. The 8 wkts Onions took for 366 runs in 3 matches was not good enough. Swann performed superlatively (4 matches, 6 innings, 171 runs, 21 wkts for 659 runs, 3 catches) and should have been declared the man of the series. The remaining english players performed moderately. South Africa also had its share of non-performers like Ashwell Prince, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell and Makhaya Ntini. But overwhelming performances came from Steyn, Morne Morkel, Paul Harris, Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis which led the series.  On the whole, SAF played better cricket and desrvedly won the series.
