However, I'd recommend from personal experience to pay for hosting from a well-known company like 1&1 or a local website design business near you. If you just want to place your business on the web, try Google Sites or Yellow Pages.. then all you have to do is buy a domain (www.example.com) which only a few pounds a year!

My daughter is 16 months and getting a few new teeth in so we have been up a couple times a night again for the past month or so.  I was so tired the other morning and actually put a whole egg in the pan instead of cracking it!  I was laughing so hard...........I can't believe I did that. I must share this to because its hilarious.  When our daughter was a newborn my husband woke up with her one night.  He was so tired that he forget to put on a new diaper when he changed her!
