John Ashcroft and Mary Beth Buchanan tried to elevate their careers (and egos) by targeting Tommy Chong and making an example out of him.  The screwed up thing is they had to resort to one of the worst cases of entrapment I've even heard of, and a 12 million dollar operation (tax payers money of course) to even pull it off.  Tommy Chong didn't do anything illegal, they practically forced his son's company to give in to something by extreme manipulation ('shipping' legal merchandise, 'purchased' in California to one of the three only states that doesn't let you 'sell' glass pipes/bongs, etc. in their state... after being denied numerous times, they finally went to California and bought a HUGE order and left it there saying they would be back to pick it up but never came back, causing logistical problems for Tommy's son's shipping and storage, etc...  you can guess what happened eventually, they shipped the merchandise thinking \"well, they did buy it here, so we don't even own this stuff at this point, that should be okay I guess...\"  wrong!  After getting them to admit they shipped the merchandise finally on tape (over the phone), they stormed the warehouse like it was a HUGE drug bust involving dozens of FBI/ATF/DEA agents, etc..   and of course, made a mega deal over it.  This led to the arrests of like 56 others (in the paraphernalia business, but in the end, Tommy Chong, the only not having any priors whatsover, got the longest sentence, 9 months prison, no less... and a lengthy annoying probation, fines, etc. Besides politcs, there are other reasons, but most all of them selfish... like being an industry wanting to kill competition in hemp manufacturing (that's a biggie). Hemp (preventing competition which could come from the highly versatile crop) is probably the biggest reason it became illegal originally. Read this... ", 8159, "AA11519766", -2],
