	122473 : ["First you should be able to do a \"bridge\"  That's like a back bend except you start from lying on the floor with your knees bent,  feet flat on the floor, and hands flat on the floor on either side of your head with fingers pointing toward the lower part of your body. .  Then you push up into the bridge / backbend.    That way your body at least gets used to being in the position ( though often the feet and hands end up farther apart this way than on a real backbend where you start from standing) So try doing bridges and each time,hold it for at least 15 seconds.  Then there are a couple ways you can practice.  One is to first do a \"half backbend\"  using something like a couch or a low bed behind you,  and bend over backward and then \"land\" your hands on the couch / bed.  That gets you used to bending over and touching a horizontal surface,  but  you don't have to go all the way to the floor.  Another technique is to continue to practice backbends against a wall,  but  every day ( or every few days) bend over just a LITTLE bit farther before you touch the wall.  Soon you will be almost totally bending all the way to the floor. so your body will be more accustomed to bending very far back without touching anything.  At that point you will almost be doing a full backbend.  It still is a good idea to have a spotter the first time you try a backbend for real.  They should put one hand under your lower back and the other hand on your side.  Really you're not likely to get hurt if you are flexible and strong.   Remember your hands are going to catch you ,  as long as you use your arm muscles .       ( I am not saying don't use a spotter the first few times;  it's still a good precaution  and may help you feel less scared. ) You also might feel more  steady if you first try it with your feet spread a bit, like about the distance of your shoulders.  Then after you get used to that,  you can start doing backbends with your feet close together.", 10716, "W3rXCrr9aa", 2],

I knew I wanted it to represent my Hispanic background, so I was looking for a mix of Spanish and English words, which is how Viva Fashion (or Live Fashion) came about.
