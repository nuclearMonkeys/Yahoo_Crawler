They could have waited till the water was out, cleaned it up, then sold to an auction with no prior indication of the car being in a flood.  Many people will buy in a state that did not have any hurricanes, thus not aware that the car was moved to another state to be sold. With a flooded vehicle, odds are you will always have electrical problems that will never go away.   And NO, insurance won't pay, since the damage occurred before insuring it, just like insurance won't insure a house that caught fire and the damages were not fixed.   Good appraisers can see prior vs new damages w/out telling them and with your description sounds like in a flood that a good body shop/appraiser will see and not pay now or in the future.   Your only option is to file suit from whom you bought it from for failure to disclose it.", 1950, "IXtiKaOYaa", 1],
	11706 : ["If you report it, they ask when the flood damage happened.  If you tell the truth and say that it was before you bought the car, then they tell you that it is not covered by your insurance because insurance only covers things that happen after you buy the car.  If you lie and say it was after you bought the car, then they have you arrested and sent to prison for insurance fraud. In general, it is a very bad idea to report it.  If you are terminally ill and will die within the next few days anyway, then it is merely a waste of time to report it.  If you expect to live more than a few months, then it is an even worse idea, because reporting it will waste time and cost you money or your freedom.", 1950, "MmTe8W8uaa", 0],

It was in the local stories that you would find out that the guy who drove the wrong way down the interstate and killed 5 people, was an illegal alien that had been deported 3 times and had 7 prior DUI's. You know, those little details Yahoo always forgets to include. People better wake up and start paying attention. Quit thinking that every story on Yahoo that is based on information from an \"anonymous source\" is true. When they list that, you can translate it to: \"This is what we want to believe, but there are not facts to support it.\" I want to hear both sides of the story.
