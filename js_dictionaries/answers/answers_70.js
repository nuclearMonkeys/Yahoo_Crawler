Back in the mid-1800s, the leaders of the United States of America (as opposed to the United States of Mexico) thought that it was their divine duty to form a single country out of the entire continent of America (North and South). Their dream was to convince every single colony to get rid of their European colonizer, and join the Union. The first step was to inform European \"old countries\" that they would no longer tolerate any colonization (or recolonization) of any territory in the Americas. Thus was born the \"Monroe Doctrine\" (which got that name after Munroe left power). Unfortunately for the USA, the first colony that did liberate itself from its colonists (the French) was Haiti: they were run by blacks, they were catholics and they had just banned slavery. Three strikes against them. And thus the dream faltered on the first attempt. Around the same time was born the American \"value\" of Manifest Destiny: white, anglo-saxon protestants in the USA brainwashing themselves into believing that God had given them the role of diminating all other races all over the world (sounds like Hitler, doesn't it). Combining the two, the residents of the USA started calling their country \"America\", in the hope that they would occupy (and dominate) the entire continent.", 583, "524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa", 0],
