My take on this is that women like it when a man \"takes control.\"  (within bounds, of course)  Don't ask if you can hug.  Man up.  Just do it.  If you hug her and she rejects you, then that's something for the marriage counselor to figure out.   Sounds like there's passive aggressive behavior on both parts.  It's the worst kind, I think, because you can't move forward in life if you're worried about protecting yourself.   Try not to be so wrapped up in her reaction to you - keep your focus on yourself.  It's the only thing you can control.   Good luck.", 9905, "gzdCNB1naa", 2],

This test caused a postponement, in the start up, until May 2008 while stronger magnet reinforcement was added. On March 21st 2008 a legal challenge was mode in United States District Court for the District of Hawaii by a group of seven concerned individuals, attempting to prevent the start up of the LHC until an operating safety report had been published. However, the LHC did not go on line in May but is expected to be on line by the end of this month (June 2008).  The cost of the LHC has spiralled well above the original construction cost estimate!   What might go wrong? The LHC is intended to look for the Higg's boson and physics beyond the standard model of particle physics such as super symmetry and dark matter/energy candidates. The standard model does not predict that the LHC will produce mini-Black Holes; however, if physics beyond the standard model is found to hold, then mini-Black Holes might be possible. These mini-Black holes might be produced at a rate in the order of one per second. According to the some calculations, these ‘holes' are harmless because they will quickly decay via ‘Hawking radiation' and explode into a shower of particles. The problem with ‘Hawking radiation' is that it too is unproven physics and, thus, might not be a correct explanation for the disappearance of mini-Black Holes. An unlikely, accumulation of mini-Black Holes could be a ‘small' problem.  Finally, the more complex the machine the more likely it is that something will go wrong. It is reasonable to say, that, the 'teething problems' faced by the LHC are not over yet. However, a ‘dooms day scenario' with a mini-Black hole disaster is very, very unlikely!", 9906, "vSkqJ813aa", 0],

In that case holding pain longer makes us weaker, because we  are holding this feeling all along that we dont get to feel other emotions because this is more dominant than the rest.So the more we hold it,the more we are likely to suffer the pain and more it corrodes our self confidence and self esteem, better let it go", 9907, "pZTVMsP3aa", 3],

The woman has been feeling ill for a while and comparing yourself to a child needing a hug is very immature  (you are not a child and children are in a different kind of relationship with your wife than you).  I don't understand why it took you till last night to not sleep in the same room as her, do you want to get sick?  Saying you needed a mutual hug when she didn't want to give it is pretty selfish.  You want her to fake wanting to hug you, seems you are insecure in your relationship with her.  Petty to not say goodbye in the morning when you left.  It isn't a marital obligation it is being a decent human.  Do you get that the woman is sick?  People when they are sick don't act like they would normally.

(look it up on google) Either way she seems to have little respect for you as an adult, let alone as her partner/husband. You need to redress the balance of power somehow. try and stop becoming controlled by being more assertive in expressing your needs and asking her to acknowledge them and of course acknowledge what her views are by echoing them back to her.
