The country overall will be about 75% White because we still have millions of baby boomers who are still alive, but White children are already under 50% of nursery school pupils.  Imagine. All those centuries Britain ruled the waves, brought many inventions, started the first Industrial Revolution, won and lost numerous wars, Churchill squandered Britain's empire to defeat the Germans..... all so low IQ Africans and Muslims could be mass imported in the second half of the 20th and 21st centuries to replace the British population.  Anonymous.... it's called right of conquest. Europeans conquered the Americas and Australia fair and square, just like the Romans conquered Britain. It's not our fault your people were too primitive to fight back against the Spanish, British, Dutch, and other European groups that stomped all over your people a few hundred years ago. What's happening to the West is worse because we're not being conquered by more advanced people. I'd be kind of okay with that, because that's natural. We're being sold down the river by traitorous scum of the worst kind and subversive ethnic groups in the name of capitalism and liberalism. People who want to save money or make a quick buck have ruined this country. There'd be no blacks and Muslims in Britain if they weren't invited in. I hate their presence but I don't hate them for doing what's natural. I hate the people who have allowed it to happen.", 76, "None", -2],

It is a good idea to get an eye exam for other issues like the heath of your eyes and if you need correction or not. You should get an exam because it is possible that you might need to wear glasses and never know it if you are borderline.

There is a membrane in the master cylinder that expands and contracts as you apply the brakes, that is what gives you \"feel\" at the lever and that relies on an amount of air but it is not air in the fluid. I suspect your problems are more likely to be at the pistons and guide rods in the caliper, it probably needs a good clean or, better, a strip and service.  Failing that it could be a piston in the master cylinder.

I once thought that I had a bad caliper because it was slow to release.  It ended up being a bad brake line flex hose.  It looked good on the outside, but a rubber flap formed on the inside of the hose acting like a flap valve.
