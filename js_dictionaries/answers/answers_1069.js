They also didn't want to talk about how a woman that committed her crimes only got 25 years and charged with second degree murder when she clearly should have been charged with first degree murder and gotten life.  It should be noted that Donna Hylton talked about how raping women is wrong at the march and yet didn't say a word about how it is wrong to rape men. Apparently raping a man with a metal rod is fine, but don't do the same thing to a woman. lol How do you think feminists, liberal corporations, and democrats would respond if men held a march and invited a male rapist to talk? I bet democrats would ban men from holding such a march again. ", 8163, "15coUBsxaa", 2],

Edit: Nick D, where in my comment did I say anything about forgiving a woman who killed an old man? What I was saying was the the person had served her sentence. It does not mean I agree with it.

It has to be one specially made for use on sensitive electronics. The \"497AJM\" is such a vacuum. Do a web search for it. If you use a vacuum not specially made for electronics, you risk causing damage from electrostatic discharge. Next, use compressed air to blow out remaining dust.  Chances are you don't have a 497AJM or an air compressor, and you are not going to get either.  If you don't have an electronics vacuum or an air compressor, buy some cans of dusting spray, and use that. Observe precautions on the label. You can also use a soft brush. But, it should be \"ESD Safe.\" If you use a cloth, it should be an anti-static or non-static cloth.  And don't worry about the stain.
