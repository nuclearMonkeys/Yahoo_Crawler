Has the Air Cond plumbing been switched out to accept the new type refridegerant. Do the belts and hoses look well maintained? My advice is to go ahead and find newer model with fewer miles. Older cars, even Toyotas with that many miles that have not been well maintained can turn into a money pit and leave you stranded.

	139115 : ["One afternoon in September of 2009 I was babysitting my youngest nephew and we were watching an old video of Monday Night Raw during the Monday Night Wars. I think it was the one when DX invaded WCW. But wrestling had nothing to do with why I found this section. The old commercial \"How many licks does it take to get to the centre of a Tootsie Pop\" came on the television. The owl did the whole 1...2...3 and ate the Tootsie Pop. My nephew kept bugging me asking me how many licks it really did take to get to the centre of a Tootsie Pop. He insisted a \"Gogo it\" so I Googled it like he asked and the first link was to Yahoo Answers. I clicked it and read him most of the answers ( it was an open question ). Most of the answers were random numbers or the 1...2...3 but one answer was \"Why is this in the wrestling section?\".  The commercials were done and so was my nephew's interest in the tootsie pop. So I scrolled up to the top of the screen and saw that it said Sports > Wrestling. Interested I clicked on the Wrestling link and saw all of these questions and answers. I didn't join and make an account, I just read the questions and answers. ( Or in other words as someone in this section says \" I creeped everyone \" ). About a month latter a question caught my attention and all the other answers were just agreeing with the ignorance of the asker. So of course I made my own account thought of the best first name ever (Nick) and answered the question. I got Best Answer too. Now about over a year latter I have come along way from \"creeping\" every users answers and questions, and I just put in my own opinion and now have made it to the top of Yahoo Answers Canada. ( I never said I wasn't cocky ). =p WQ- I would use the word Canadian because Christian is Canadian. I'd also use the word Peep. So either Canadian or Peep. BQ- When the time is right? I have been crazy busy recently and I know I will become a lot more busy within the next couple of months. So I think I'll be done in the near future. I'll leave my mark on Y!A though don't worry about it. (Yeah I'll probably do a take over like almost everyone else does when they leave, I'm creative). BQ2- I remember The Main Event too. I think the first users I noticed when I started here that aren't around anymore are: Hannah Hardy, Madison 3:16, LPSR and MAG. They all had good questions and answers I don't see them that often anymore though.", 11417, "S0u3HKzhaa", 0],

BQ2-Same as you,i always used to like TME :).Back then he was like my favorite User tbh.Too bad when i started going to chats he left.But well not much i can do now about it.But all i know is,TME owns.He had a cool username,display image.His source was a cool catchphrase (The \"And here's your main event\" one).And was a great user.I think every now and then TME still comes to Y!A.If TME comes back again,i think i wouldn't wanna miss it.Lol i sound like a Fan right now.But yeah.TME owned.", 11417, "H7p09fL2aa", 3],

Start the car cold and turn on the AC just to see if the right hand fan works. Your fan(s) don't have a clutch, they're electric. You have to find out why your radiator fan doesn't work, because that's the problem.
