	6106 : ["Average Americans (lower middle class, two income family making less than $70,000 yearly as a family unit)  can have pretty good lifestyle because American jobs are so diverse. An American has many options that make it easier to have enough income to provide for a nice home, vehicle, vacations and full pantries/fridges. America exports many many different products/services (food, cars, steel, milk, pharmaceuticals, clothing, wood, silver, gold, cotton, cattle, liquor/beer, movies/tv shows, computer components, financials, oil, natural gas, chemicals, military, ammunition, baseball bats, fabric, and on and on and on) and all these different export avenues require/hire/employee people to work jobs. In America it is possible to find any job doing just about anything that interests you if you want it bad enough (go to college, live in the state that has the jobs in your area of expertise/desire to hire, etc). By not relying heavily on only one or two exports in a country (few exports leads to too few jobs and a glut of people with the same qualifications all fighting for too few jobs), America drives the ability of regular income earners to live good lives. And living decently doesn't mean it's perfect or easy. It often takes meticulous budgeting and juggling in order to create and cultivate that fine line between living pretty good and definitely praying you have no medical or financial emergency in the future that tip the balance and see a family destitute/homeless in a matter or weeks or months never to return to good life. Yes America has and does borrow too much money  and yes economic depression can and has destroyed American way of life more than once in its past and is always a looming future threat. As to why other big exporting countries not doing as well, that could be for many reasons such as exporting too few things or exporting things that become obsolete or because their leaders mismanage the import/export process leading to dissolution of trade treaties, constant in country warring, to name a few. America has a massive, efficient and deadly military that protects the American way of life that will always secure America's place on the world stage as a desirable trade partner. And it's always easier to have a good life if one lives in a free as democratic first world nation,", 997, "XW52v2HTaa", 0],
	6107 : ["Good question.  In a word, capitalism.  Capital means the produced means of production. In order to produce with any capital good, even a stone axe, man has to delay his gratfication.  So for *any* wealth to exist, above the level of hand-to-mouth subsistence requires capital, which is responsible for all mankind's living richer than the other animals.  ALL the wealth that the average American can afford, is *necessarily* because of the accumulation of capital.  And capital is the name for how much the productive goods would sell for, expressed in money.  How is America is getting so much money to do everything they do? Money in the narrow sense means actual dollar notes. Money in the broad sense means all financial transaction, and all the physical wealth it commands.  They are getting the physical wealth - i.e. all of America's capital - from processes which require and presume private ownership of capita. The first principles of economics distinguish between two basic ways of acquiring wealth: the economic, and the political. That's why it's also called political economy. The economic means is by homesteading unclaimed natural resources, to produce goods with them using one's own property or labour, and the voluntary exchange of goods and services. Capital means the produced means of production; and capitalism means the private ownership and control of the means of production. Much of America's wealth comes from the history of such private capital to the present moment. The effect of capital is to increase productivity: more goods for the same cost, or the same goods for lesser cost. The effect is to make more outputs for given inputs. The effect is to increase wealth across society as a whole, and to make everyone richer. Why America? Because America inherited a framework of laws based on English law *before* the first English settlement in America. Both America and England share in common the law before that. So they both received from our common ancestors, such law as freehold, sovereignty, allegiance, fidelity, leasehold, contract, tort, equity, trusts, presumption of innocence, writs against governmental error, constitutions of government, rule of law, prerogatives of the Crown - the foundation of the entire edifice of modern statehood and international statehood. These institutions protect and enable the growth of private property by VOLUNTARY means only, because transactions based on aggression or fraud are illegal at the ommon law which all the English-descended whitefeller states On that voluntary basis, lies the whole ethos and praxis of capitalism. The second main way of acquiring wealth is by taking someone else's property or labour by force or threat. This includes both the criminal means, and the political means.The state is a legal monopoly of crime. It's basically a gang of criminals, a protection racket, that grew so big it could over-awe tall the other criminal gangs.   Being based on aggression against person and property, it is inherently criminal, and we can expect no less of them than an epidemic of large-scaled crime by the State, which is exactly what we're seeing. Once the state's stranglehold in productive activity extends to a legal monopoly of the issue of money as fiat currency, and of lending money at interest, there is no way to avoid politics being driven by a huge kleptocratic and technocratic class, implicating the entire society, and openly committing enormous crimes, such as war and every kind of sickening open corruption at the highest levels. Which is what we're seeing. The most important by far of all these means, if the Federal Reserve in America, and central banks around the world. The reason is because it gives a government the power to hock the entire population into debt. Basically it acts as a huge vacuum cleaner sucking the wealth and labour and time and life of everyone, all around the planet, who use money. If a sh!thole country, like Zimbabwe, prints money, its reach will be limited by the small demand for the zim dollar. But when the USA prints money, the effect is to take a cut out of the labour of every man and woman around the world. Its reach and rapacity are virtuously infinite. DOLLARS - as in greenbacks, and any fed lending of them - are the export. Since, at the very least, all the countries of the world have to buy fuel in US dollars. What kind of a goodly-sized racket do you think that might be hmm? Thus the US government, by doing what it criminalises as felony for anyone else, can steal the blood out of the veins of the suffering working class, all over the world, at the rate of inflation by mere prerogative of the Crown, the reception of which in English law is the root of American sovereignty, and statehood, with all the implications for private capital of the existence of the American state - the biggest criminal organisation in the history of the world. Why aren't other nations who export much, so rich? Because ... supply and demand. Nations, or anyone, produce a lot of stuff that other people put a low value on, will not get rich like that by comparison with the USA. The capital of the USA is much more complex and productive than a mere rock taken out of the ground. For other nations to be able to benefit as much from America's capital, they need to have minimal standards of property rights. Most of them fail this, compared to the common law heritage which the  British Brits, and the American Brits, have in common. Yes America is spending too much, and yes there's going to be a big depression. The other nations are in earnest to avoid and dethrone the dollar. When it does, America's economy will collapse back down to what it was, if there was no monopoly of money and credit raping and strangling the world's economy. But you can't send the feds to arrest the crooks - they ARE the feds!Both major parties are identical in their support of this. To audit it is out of the question, let alone to abolish it. But America's economy won't only collapse back to what itself can generate without, in effect, taxing and dominating the entire world by inflation and petrodollars. It will also have a depression lower than that, while capital is liquidated and invested in other more productive uses - changing gold taps into tractors, that kinda thang. ", 997, "None", -2],

	6131 : ["I'm not an economist, and someone who is, will likely find a LOT wrong with my explanation, but here is what I know. Capitalism is good from the standpoint that you work, and you get money. If you do a good job, you are promoted and then make more money. If you work hard, you get noticed, are valued, and then get a raise. Capitalism encourages people to work hard and to do a good job.  If a small percentage of people are hoarding resources, I'm not aware of it, I guess.. I don't see this happening, not on a large scale, at least.  Now let's talk about socialism - which is just the gateway to communism.. with socialism, everyone gets a paycheck - terrible workers, lazy workers, people who don't work etc.. all get the same amount of money..the problem with this is that it's unfair to me, a hard worker! Why should I work my tail off to make the same amount of money a loaffer gets?!! People will just stop working - it's human nature to be lazy.. here's a story to illustrate.. a friend of mine was in a communist country and went to a shoe store. He asked for a shoe in his size and without looking the two shoe salesmen said, 'we don't have your size\" - furious, my friend went to the back of the store, found the shoes in his size.. those salesmen, they just couldn't be bothered to help or work - that's all.. that is what socialism leads to.. and when no one works, we all start to starve - and don't forget, people are crooked - the elite will never suffer the effects of socialism - it is a crime in Cuba to eat beef - but the rich do. It is a crime to eat lobster, but they bring it in by the boat load for the rich..  The problem with any system then, is that it is run by people. :-) People can be corrupted, and those at the top, often are! The solution, as I see it, is that we need to keep capitalism (keep people rewarded for doing good hard work), but then be kinder as a society and help the truly downtrodden - we don't do that, as a society.. we say that they gov't should help them etc.. when really what is needed is for us to be a more generous society.

Contraceptives = abortion;using contraceptives for one year = five aborted kids.Miscarriages happen because of high heels; cesarean because of pants (second generation cesarean will be infertile).Unbaptized aborted/miscarried/unborn babies burn in hell until Final Judgement; if pregnant, keep the kid and deliver at home because kids are chippedusing IVs and vaccines in hospitals. Dentists and doctors chip patients secretly. Ultrasound leads to mark of the beast; don't do ultrasound, please. Abortion leads to breast cancer; a demon is released from hell for each aborted kid. Dogs can become possessed; don't keep dogs inside your home [Pelageya of Ryazan]. Walmart has technology to administer mark of the beast to those who have cat bacteria in their stomachs/brains; stay away from cats [Athanasius 3rd of Constantinople]. Next false flag is the Statue of Liberty. Above earth there is ice (dome); when rockets go up they bring ice down from upper sky to lower sky; ice stuck in lower sky will fall on us during Apocalypse. Earth is flat; earth stands on three stalactite pillars (The Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin; underneath this ice there is a bubble; and then the abyss. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreamsare from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Apostle John (who wrote the Book of Revelation), Enoch, Elijah, resurrected Seraphim of Sarov, and resurrected Sergius of Radonezh will preach against the antichrist. Humans were created about 7530 years ago. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level; they will get out through sinkholes and lakes; to kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Scientists don't see dinosaurs under our level because of radiation. Sinkholes happen because people dig for resources underground and because earth is heating up. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite peopletobehealedinsidetheirUFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)moon 2)inside fake mountain Kailash (Tibet) 3)in lake Baikal in Russia 4)in Atlantis which is underneath double ocean floor of Mariana Trench (Pacific Ocean). There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old [Lavrentiy Chernigovskiy]. He flies super fast; deceived people will say: \"Christ is here; Christ is there\" when he's flying from one city to the next very fast. He wears gloves to hide long nails.

Antichrist will trick people that he can do mountain moving and resurrection using holograms/hypnosis; fire from the sky is real because of pollution gases in the atmosphere. Antichrist will have food only for 6 months; then he will feed his 666ed people flourfrom mashed up turtles (Tavrion Batozskiy), but this won't be enough because 666ed people are 10 times as angry and 7 times as hungry as normal people even though 666ed people became shorter (3-4 feet tall = 80 - 120 cm)because nanochips do function of organs (organs diminish) [Nilus Myrrhgusher].

During Apocalypse,Christians will eat dirt from under pussywillowtree as it's filled with tears of Theotokos VirginMary; this water will flee if a 666ed person tries to get it. Barcode is Druid black magic curse; QRcode is Mayan curse; when food is scanned, it becomes dead because laser is a substance from demons. Don't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Unforgivablegreen666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (WorldPassport). It doesn't just have to be during this procedure (could be anything you sign up for or anywhere where there is a secret scanner); biometrics (fingerprints, eyescan) or getting picture for passport are very dangerous because they could mark you secretly.

Chipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, greenmark by isotope rays is given on forehead/wrist. Food stores will isotoperaypeopletoo. Antichrist will also release prisoners/insaneasylumpeople tomarkpeople. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with OrthodoxChristians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can'ttrack you; burn documents because they're fromSatan. TheMostHolyTrinity gives you a name during baptism; devil gives an antiname during antibaptism (ex. SocialSecurityNumber). People who die with these Satanicdocuments go to concentrationcamp in hell to await FinalJudgement; once the BEASTComputer is burned down, souls will be released for FinalJudgement.

Prophecy from halfamillennium ago describes FinalJudgement like this: Jesus was very upset with people who had littleboards (plasticcards) in their hands because they wanted discount from the antichrist. Givetocharity in the name of ArchangelMichael; he rescues people from temporaryhell twice a year [at midnight September18-19 and similarly on November20-21; pray at these times on your knees remembering the deceased by names (adding \"and relatives by flesh up to Adam\") so that they arerescued if they're in hell] (orbringsthemupalevel, that is, to a level with lesspunishment;eventually, people arefreed).

Inflation generally requires a surge in demand for goods and services, and that's not happening (at least not yet). If we see a post-COVID surge in the economy, we might have more inflation.  CPI Inflation in the US is only at 2.2% for 2020, which is pretty manageable. The USD value in forex markets has declined a bit over the past year, but it's currently down only about 3% from this date last year.  If I were in your position, and considering whether to sell a home or keep it as an investment, my main consideration would be what I think the local real estate market is going to do, and how much it might appreciate in value (or not). ", 1014, "WvFJh2GAaa", 0],
