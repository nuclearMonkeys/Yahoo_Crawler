	74906 : ["When I hear in the news of a person being bullied to the point of suicide I feel like I could have helped them if they would have been able to read this. So if you know of anyone being bullied please ask them to read this it might help them. Thanks If I ask you a social question and I put these 2 phrases in alphabetical order. Then I ask you to pick the one that means most to you and then rate both questions giving them a number from 1-10, ten being the highest and one being the lowest? The question is. What means most to you respect earned or respect given? Stop here and answer this before going any further.  What I have learned is how and what a person picks and rates each one of these questions shows what they are inside. A person that picks Respect Given is bullied or has been bullied in their life. And a person that picked Respect Earned was a bully in their life. Now there are 2 kinds of Respect Earned. They see it as either they are out to earn someone's respect or people need to earn their respect. The most tattooed word in prison is the word Respect. That is why they are there in prison. They have wanted people to respect them and so they do things that are wrong and then they are caught and put with others that are like them. Because like attracts like.  The minority of people that pick Respect Given are picked on because they are looked as weaker to others. Because they will give respect no matter what happens to them. These people need to read this and learn to earn a person's respect. The greater the distance in the rating of the 2 phrases makes them a bigger target to the people that pick respect earned as a higher number.  The majority of people that pick respect earned first have a greater chance of being a bully and or the bystander in a situation when someone is being bullied. Also it is the same as before the greater the distance between the 2 phrases when they rate each one then shows how much more of a bully they are and or will become. The bystander is earning the respect of the bully by not doing the right thing in a bad situation. Because the person that is being bullied never earned their respect. Also with doing this test with this social question I have found that the people that are really good in their community that others are drawn to because of how good they are. You know the people that everyone likes, that they have picked the 2 phrases equally or one number out from each other. I believe this goes with the phrase a well-rounded person. So to help the people that are bullied and who are the bullies we need to mentor them to raise the opposite of what the rated the highest. So the 2 phrases become equal and hopefully everyone that here's this tries to bring the other side of them up.", 8788, "gbX2ZApqaa", 1],

The air strike last Thursday hit children who were collecting scrap metal on a mountain in the province of Kunar, which borders Pakistan. A local police commander said that the six children killed by the US bombs were aged six to 12. Another child was seriously wounded. After a much-reported decline in US air strikes, attributed to orders from sacked US senior commander in Afghanistan Gen. Stanley McChrystal that were designed to reduce civilian casualties, such strikes are back up again. According to figures released by the Air Force, US warplanes flew 5,500 “close air support” missions in June and July of 2010, compared to 4,600 in the same months last year. With the Obama administration's Afghanistan surge having brought US troops up to the full strength of nearly 100,000, together with another 40,000 troops from NATO and other allied countries, fighting has intensified and casualties among both US troops and Afghan civilians are up sharply.

	74931 : ["I know from experience what works best with bullies...and you are right, violence should be met with violence. I was bulled from the age 11 to 14 by the same group of kids. Most times I fought back but they always outnumbered me and I could never do much damage to any of them before they all got me down and beat the crap out of me. At 14 years old I started taking Tae Kwon Do lessons and Aikido lessons. I got good at avoiding them or seeing them coming so I had time to run. I did that until I hit 16 and was 1 year away from my Black Belt. I figured I was ready. The next time I saw 3 of them behind me as I walked home from school I did not run. I turned around and took it to them. As they began taunting me I punched the first kid so hard in the nose the breaking sound was clear. The other two were stunned so I took advantage and kicked one in the groin knocking him to the ground. The third one I just laid into with a flurry of punches and kicks until he went down. I then proceeded to do what they had done to me for years, kick them when they were down...and I kicked them damn hard. I left them all there bloody and beaten. Cops came to my house and I told my story...been bullied for years by the same kids and cops or adults could never stop it so I finally took care of myself. Cops said all 3 kids had to go to the hospital and my dad said \"Good, lucky for them it wasn't the morgue\". Cops did not charge me because there were witnesses that saw all 3 kids circling me before I wailed on them. They were all out of school for 3 days. The next day they came to school I decided to flip things...I started bullying them. School got out and the same 3 kids looked behind them and saw me coming with my fists clenched and calling them out...they all 3 took off running. The rest of my time in High School I made sure those kids never bullied anyone again and I did have to kick one kid's butt again. Anyway...that is how you deal with violent kids who bully. Of course typically the bullies I have run across are being bullies because their fathers bully them and the kids seem to need to pass the pain on to weaker kids.  My kid is already learning how to take someone's head off with a kick. He will be taught that his ONLY targets are bullies...and that he is to protect kids who are weaker than he is. No, I am not teaching him to talk to the bullies...I am teaching him how to put them in the hospital.", 8788, "None", 0],
	74932 : ["Yes, constant teasing/bullying does affect's a person's self esteem at any age BUT constant teasing/bullying does way more then affecting a person's self esteem.  I am an adult survivor of lifelong Teasing and Bullying (Peer Abuse) up to this present date in which has resulted in me having lifetime emotional problems and lifetime psychological problems including attempted bullycide (suicide) in my early twenties, chronic low self-esteem issues, Psychogenic Amnesia (Dissociative Amnesia), Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), hard to trust people, keeping people at a distance, being a shy introverted person, depression, being a loner, and etc. By the time I graduated from Senior High School, I was extremely deeply afraid of ALL people (male and female) including some family members due to Teasing and Bullying (Peer Abuse). I will ALWAYS have these problems until I die. My only child is also an adult survivor of Teasing and Bullying (Peer Abuse). The reason why both me and my only child have been bullied is because we both are Persons With Disabilities (PWDs). I have been verbally bullied in various ways including being called \"Mentally Retarded\". The verbal abuse got to the point of where I started believe that I was \"mentally retarded\" and I started to write notes to myself in school saying that I was \"mentally retarded\" and that \"I wanted to die\". The teacher found one of my notes and contacted my parents and I was sent to the school psychologist. I was also humiliated in class by students and a teacher on separate occasions in front of other students in various ways, socially isolated, socially ostracized; lied to, laughed at, pranks pulled on me, attempts to intimidate me, and etc.  I have been physically bullied in various ways. I been spit on the face, shoved hard against the school bus, had my hair pulled from behind, choked from behind, efforts to try to rip my clothed off of me, slapped from behind on my face with papers, trapped in the middle of a circle formed by bullies, chased after by bullies on bicycles, attempts to shove me into the opposite sex's bathroom, an attempt to drown me, items stolen from me, rocks thrown at me, forced to do oral sex at the age 4 or 5 years old by the next door neighbor teenager, and various other things.  As an adult, I been teased, bullied, sexually abused, physically abused, stared at, had my motor vehicle and apartment egged by former neighbors, unjustified legal harassment by the same former neighbors that turned me into DHS / SCAN on falsified accusations of child abuse which I was legally cleared from all legal charges in which DHS / SCAN determined that it was harassment by neighbors, policed being called on me by the same former neighbors unjustly accusing me of speeding and almost hitting a young child, firecrackers being set off at midnight right beside my apartment window by the same former neighbors, noises being made at midnight right beside my apartment window by the same former neighbors in an effort to scare me, the same former neighbors breaking off metal objects in the keyhole of my apartment front door several times to the point of where the landlord accused me in doing such things even I was completely innocent, same former neighbors calling up my parents by phone saying nothing and holding a loud ticking clock to the phone mouth piece in order to scare my parents which upset me extremely, and various other things.  I been discriminated against, patronized, talked down to, treated like a 5 year old child due to having Disabilities even though I am an adult, was in a book store and I was on my 4 wheel Handicapped scooter and there was a lady that was staring at me and my child and the look on the lady's face can be put in the category of \"If Looks Can Kill\", and various other things.  My child was slapped in the face by a school teacher at school. The school did not tell me and hid the fact for a year in which the statute of limitations had expired after one year. After the statute of limitations had expired, that when the school told DHS about the abuse by the teacher. And DHS then told me about the abuse by the teacher. My child was also approached by another student and was asked for money and the student knew that my child had Mental Retardation. My child has been stared at, and various other things. I have many more stories that I can tell about the \"HELL\" that both me and my only child been through both as PWD children and PWD adults. These are some of the reasons why I will ALWAYS view ALL Non-PWDs (People WITHOUT Disabilities) as \"Outsiders\" of the PWD (Persons WITH Disabilities) Community and why I will ALWAYS see Mainstream Society as \"Outsider Society\". ♔ ♕ ♚ ♛", 8788, "s2aCNJOBaa", -2],
