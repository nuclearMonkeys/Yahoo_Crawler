That sensation is a sense of heightened awareness and it is like a mental high. The first time you are exposed to one of these grand conspiracy theories you will likely feel that way AND every time you tell someone else about that theory, you will likely feel almost as high again. This is the main reason why so many people after becoming interested in a particular theory find themselves stuck there sometimes for years. It makes one feel special you finally understand why you never seem to get ahead: \"I finally get it now, why I never can get ahead... because the government has been working against me all this time.\"   So these conspiracy notions are especially attractive to people who have never accomplished much in their real lives. One thing that seems to be common among conspiracy nuts is their general inability to accurately judge the likelihood of this over that. When you look at the whole \"we never landed on the moon\" theory, its incredibly unlikely for hundreds of reasons and yet conspiracy nuts can see right on past all of that as if its the most likely answer.", 7724, "3ZerbcnEaa", 0],

	55380 : ["Well everything that happened once can happen twice. So, yes, it could. That being said, it is worth noting that only 2 billions year (40% of Earth lifetime. 50% of live lifetime) was with roughly 20% O₂. O₂ has been in enough quantity to be breathable by humans only for 400 millions years. And the 100 1st of those 400 millions, there was, on the contrary, too much of it (we would burn our brain breathing constantly that). So O₂ on Earth is breathable by humans for ca. 300 millions years (which happens to be the period of existence of walking animals with brain...). CO₂ is even worst. CDC says that exposure to 3% (30000 ppm) of CO₂ for 15 minutes is potentially lethal. Even way under 30000 ppm, CO₂ would be a problem, permanently. in Apollo 13, it is when CO₂ is under 10000 ppm that people are relieved. And they were just supposed to breathe that for a few hours, and they already started to feel dizziness and mild confusion. Usually it is said that CO₂ over 2000 ppm to 5000 ppm - depending on the country - is not a safe working environment, because it is already sufficient to make people dizzy. Plus, over that, at long term, you main create brain damages (it has been recently measured that some conference rooms not only have enough CO₂ to make attendees less able to follow complex reasoning, but sometimes even to leave permanent damage...) And that is just for the working day. At home, you should open the windows to try to keep CO₂ under 1000 ppm. I recently worked on CO₂ sensor, for covid exposure detection, so I happen to know that my own home easily peeks at 2000ppm. Which is not good, but I am alive. So, well, let's say that over 5000ppm a human should not live there permanently, and would get brain damage. An astronaut, just visiting could stand it, but not over 10000 ppm. So, for that too, it has it has been ok on Earth for some 300 millions years only. And Earth hosted life for more than 10 times that. So, morale is, even the one biased unique example we know, our own planet, had a life with an atmosphere we could breath without a space suit, for less than 1/10 of time. Imagine what it could be on another planet. So, chances are very very small. Chances to have life on another planet is really very close to 0. (But since the number of planets is very close to infinite, put together, you may say that 0xinfinity may be more than 1).  More among those, in most of the cases would be with unsustainable climate, or unsustainable atmosphere. And on the offside chance a planet have a similar evolution, leading to a similar atmosphere, you may encounter unknown virus that kill you (think of what happened on Earth when people from regions that weren't connected suddenly visit each other. It went really bad for some of them. Hell, even I get sick each time I travel to another continent) But, well, yes, it is possible.", 7727, "d3cd3e0f2e8feaaff79363574632bf96aa", 0],

	55382 : ["Nope. It seems they don't exist. At least not within detection range, and maybe not at all. And FYI, there is far more to \"habitability\" than being in some hackneyed \"zone\". For example, a planet would have to demonstrably be in that zone in a stable orbit for billions of years to even have a chance of it being home to chromedomes. With the astonishing variety of planetary systems discovered, there seems little hope of there being such a planet within thousands of light years of us, and maybe there is no other.  As for that Oumuamua thingo, it's a case of \"here we go again, history repeating itself\", because we have been through this ridiculous routine time and time again: something new is discovered and there will always be some bozo claiming it is the work of space boogiemen. Remember the \"canals on Mars\"? Remember the discovery of pulsars, which idiocy at the time called them \"navigation beacons\". Then there were those hills on Mars which just had to be a face, and a human one at that. It seems we never learn. All the data ever gathered and rationally analysed tells us that E.T's (sic) are obviously NOT out there. We are alone. And the proven fact that we are absolutely alone is a cause for celebration, as the discovery is the culmination of centuries of science.  Fortunately we happen to live on a planet with literally millions of species of life, and there are plenty of fossils to prove that there were many times that number of species on Earth long before the little hairless monkeys called Homo sapien recently swung down from the trees. All these species are proven to exist. If someone is truly and honestly interested in \"life\", then this is the place to look for it and find it in abundance.
