P.S. If you (are not brain-damaged) and know the dog is PRONE to steal food, how about not LETTING it happen, by anticipating the situation IN ADVANCE & then changing your behavior, or being on the LOOKOUT for the theft, etc.?", 4081, "v2MrWQimaa", 5],

My dog runs the front fence line like a junk yard dog but she has NEVER bitten any one.  Her behavior behind the fence is far different than her normal behavior.  She will make a believer by any one walking down the street.  If I were to let someone into the yard she is fine but if you are on the other side of the fence, that is another story. Are you sure you are reading your dog right?  What is his body language saying while he is barking?  Is his tail up in the air or tucked between his legs or wagging a mile a minute?  Are his ears laid back or standing, does he get hackles on his back? Does he pull trying to get to the other dogs?  Does he bow while barking?  Is he snarling?  Observing the body language tell you more than what you hear. He needs to be socialized with other dogs & other people. I think it is just the lack of socialization.", 4082, "18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa", 0],

	25848 : ["I had a Dal that was like this, and no matter what we did, we had to make adjustments to everything every other month so we could get ahead of her immune system getting used to things. It was a PAIN. She was allergic to everything; grass, hay, tap water, and her immune system would get out of whack so frequently that my mom had to change her food every other WEEK so nothing could develop. It's like her immune system saw everything new as a threat and it would take a few weeks for her immune system to say, \"Ok, let's be allergic to THIS now\" or \"Hey immune system, let's just stop working WITH this medication and food.\"  So you and your vet need to get together for LONG TERM CARE and constant attention to her allergies and body. Some months were better than others, but we did not get complacent with ONE shampoo, ONE medication, ONE brand of food. The vet would take away or add on millegrams and change up the medication completely. We had her on a 5 allergy med rotation and steroids, meaning that every month, something changed completely so her immune system couldn't keep up with it and it would HELP her that way. My mom had 6 brands of food on rotation, as well. Some weeks would be raw, then wet, then kibble, the cooked, and all over again, month after month. It's the only thing we could do to try and combat whatever the hell was going on with her. We did specialists, acupuncture, creams, tonics, $150 for 8 OUNCES of organic, all-natural handmade shampoo, holistic vets, serious vets, ER vets, I mean, I think we had every vet on speed-dial within a 25 mile radius!", 4066, "None", 0],

	25854 : ["• \"My 2 pups are being very fussy and hardly eating unless I give them their favorites and hand feed them  \" THAT field is supposed to END with your main question. But YOUR 20 words don't ask us ANYTHING! So I removed the ❔ . • \"Should I let them go hungry for a day or two(I mean leave regular food and not hand feed them, whether or not they eat) or give in and pamper them with their favorite foods?\" THAT should have been in the first field. The answers to your 2 alternatives as main questions are \"NO❗️\" and \"NO❗️❗️❗️\" I suspect that the answer to your bracket will be \"NO WAY❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️\". But because you have told us NOTHING of any use, I first have to ask: 💥Q1: Why do you have TWO pups? 💥Q2: What AGE and BREED (or breed-mix) and GENDERS are they? 💥Q3: What does your \"regular food\" MEAN? How many feeds are you supplying per day, and what does each meal weigh? Which of the meals include pasteurised cows' milk? • \"Update:  @Verulam: yes they're healthy, took them to the vets for vaccination 4 days ago, they're fine. Just being nit picky and wait for me to feed them. Thanks for your advice, sounds good. I will try that.👍\" But you haven't stated WHAT vaccination! 💥Q4: Was this the CORE vaccine (distemper + adenoviris 1 & 2 + parvovirus) given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks old, or when? Was anything else include in that \"shot\"? 💥Q5: Do you live in a district where further vaccines are needed - such as rabies at 18 weeks old, 1 year later, and every 3 years after that? Plus against heartworm? If so, have you discussed those with your vet? While waiting for your update: Depending on Pup's age, it should be getting 3 (maybe 4) meals per day, or 2 meals per day. See:       for the type of meal at whatever age your pup is - but the amounts I list are for GSDs (German Shepherd Dogs) and you'll have to work out for yourself how to adjust the amounts for YOUR pet. A warning: 😝NO REPUTABLE BREEDER would have allowed you to buy 2 pups at the same time. Nor let a pup go WITHOUT a diet-sheet. (Most will give you about 2 weeks' worth of the food Pup is used to, so that it won't get diarrhoea from the combination of being anxious about YOU plus having a strange diet.) So expect that, even with just ONE Pup, you are likely to find that each Pup is susceptible to all sorts of dietary and genetic problems. 👽 NEVER hand-feed your pet👋 EXCEPT to supply a pea-sized taste-treat as you praise it for doing whatever command you've trained it (you are going to have a HELLUVATIME trying to train 2 pups on the same property!) 👽 ALWAYS pick the dish up and either clean it or put it in the fridge AS SOON AS Pup leaves the dish. The ONLY exception is when Pup goes to investigate a noise, then rushes straight back to the dish. 👽 I hope you have already contacted a reputable dog-training club or group and booked yourself in for about a year, to start when Pup is 18-to-22 weeks old so that YOU get COACHED on how to train this pup, and Pup learns to pay attention regardless of what other dogs & people are doing. 👽 I hope you realise that you have just 4 days left before YahooAnswers is locked up and you won't be able to ask for more information, nor to reward (by clicking the [Favourite Answer] label just after his/her answer) the person who tried hardest to help you.  🐕‍🦺Those readers who own (or are owned by!) a 🐕‍🦺GSD are invited to read: then join it.
