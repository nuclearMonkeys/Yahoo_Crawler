	73953 : ["We've had 30 years to see how neo-conservatives talk in campaigns and behave once in office.  They run as strict budget hawks, they ALL pick out a few departments to abolish, and the promise tax cuts to the middle class.  But once in office, the tax cuts go only to the rich and corporations, and they make government bigger, not smaller.  They behave as if debt simply doesn't matter.  We've had three of these presidents already, why would you expect the 4th to be different? If you really listen to Mitt, he makes it almost obvious.  We need more deregulation (of the kind that's caused a dozen major catastrophes in the last 3 years).  We need changes in the tax code that will eliminate progressive taxes and make them up with regressive taxes--IOW a shift in the tax burden from the rich to the middle class.  And we need to double defense spending every year and get into more quagmire wars that cost trillions but accomplish nothing. Many of Ron Paul's ideas are impossible, even if he somehow got elected.  That $1T cut requires cooperation from Congress, and every program that's cut creates political enemies.  You know how the Republicans absolutely refuse to go along with ANYTHING Obama does, even if it's something they want themselves?  Paul would have this problem with -both- parties.  -Nothing -would get done. But he's honest about his chances of winning, so he's not so much promising these things as he's suggesting them as an alternative.  And that's a good thing. Our two parties are way too close together, because they are both sponsored by the same sources.  Paul is really the only alternative that most people hear.", 8754, "55XWsWHsaa", 6],
	73954 : ["Mit has the standard GOP answer which insults the intelligence of all. Remember the big deal made of how the GOP wanted to make token cuts and how hard the DNC fought against those trivial cuts? It's all show and no real debt reduction plan.  I'll have to agree with smartypants for once about Paul's ideas.  First off Paul couldn't get elected. He is such a fruitcase that many like myself would vote for a wet sock over Ron Paul. Even Obama starts looking good compared to a guy who literally said he's OK with Iran having nukes. A guy so delusional that he's good with the top arms supplier, trainer, organizer and funder of terrorist organizations in the world having nuclear weapons is not somebody fit to be in congress much less the oval office.  What really irks me about Ron Paul is his regurgitation of extreme Left wing American hating propaganda.  We did not do anything to the Muslims. Our very first military action as an independent nation was to go after the Barbary pirates who were enslaving, killing, kidnapping and torturing Americans just because we were \"Christians\" and the fighting hasn't stopped since. For brief times as European colonies specific parts of the Arab world have nominally been our allies against other European powers. Never a real friend.  They hate us before Israel existed and if Israel went away they'd still hate us. If Israel had never existed they'd still be flying aircraft into our buildings and blowing up our embassies. Ron Paul has repeatedly said the Arab world hates us for things we've done and repeated the Left wing lies that we are big bad bullies in the world with no redeeming character at all.  I'll be the first to criticize some of the places we've sent military. While I fully supported the invasion of Iraq I've been an outspoken critic of the nation building. We went from heroes to occupiers badly outstaying our welcome in Iraq.  We should have been a better influence on the Shah than we were. Putting him into power that's iffy as well. He did at least as much good for his nation as harm. It'll be a couple generations before anybody can really say whether that was a good move. Ron Paul takes criticism to the level of treason where he ascribes motivations that were just not there, files false complaints about things that don't exist and never did exist. Repeats Left wing lies without doing even the most basic fact checking. A great example of his quoting the number of \"bases\" we have in the world. Not only are %99 of them not military the money used to operate them is so small compared to what we lay out on other stuff that you'd need an electron microscope to find it.  We can cut a trillion out of the budget and do it without too much of a political fight. Things like moving the Gov to open source software, English only, creating performance standards for bureaucrats and getting rid of dead wood,  leaving the UN and or cutting back on foreign aid. Ending the war on drugs. Those are all some of the many places we can drastically cut funding w/o going into long dragged out political fights. Sure we can close/move some bases. We should move our European bases to Poland even if it ticks off the Russians. That'd dramatically decrease our operating costs and we can reduce the size of the bases we move. Consolidate in Asia. Pull out of Japan and Korea and move it all to Taiwan for example.  Ron Paul is picking fights for chicken scratch with some of his ideas. Some are good. Some very good. Some just plain delusional.", 8754, "AA11442722", 0],

	73981 : ["Ray Arcel, one of the greatest trainers in boxing history, worked with 18 world champions including Barney Ross, Tony Zale, Ezzard Charles, Roberto Duran, and Larry Holmes. He was in the opposite corner from Joe Louis in 14 of his fights, and he also personally knew and learned from the great Benny Leonard. Arcel has stated that he considered Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey to be the three greatest heavyweights in history and hedged on picking between them, but here is what he said about Dempsey,  “He should've been the only heavyweight anybody ever thought of when they thought about the greatest heavyweight champion. I mean he had everything. He could punch, he could box. He was mean and determined.”  “Dempsey would have absolutely beaten any fighter who came after him—without a doubt. I know all about Joe Louis and how he knocked guys' teeth out. I have every respect for Joe—I rate him number two. But Dempsey would have killed Louis, George Foreman, any of those guys. What Jack had was God-given—you can't develop the kind of talent he had. “Marciano? Same result. Dempsey would have murdered Rocky. I tell you, Jack would have chased everyone out of the ring. I trained Max Baer a couple of times and often got asked how good that booming right of his was and whether it was as good as anything Dempsey had. Are you kidding? It wasn't even close.\" “Mike Tyson might have got through a round with Dempsey, maybe two. People always asked me what Jack's weaknesses were. That's the point—at his best he didn't have any.” Sam Langford, when asked how Harry Wills (whom he fought 18 times in his career) would do against Jack Dempsey, said in the June 5, 1922, Atlanta Constitution \"Well if he ever fights Dempsey my money will be on the present champion. Dempsey is the greatest fighter I have ever seen. He hits twice as hard as Jim Jeffries and is as fast in the ring as James J. Corbett.\"  Jack Dempsey was a sure killer. A fighter with great killer instinct and the ability and will to finish a hurt fighter. Dan Morgan, an old time fight manager who had three world champions said that Dempsey had the three qualities which produce greatness in the fight ring and make a man a fighter for the ages. These are: ferocity, cold-bloodedness, and gameness. He said, \"There's no place for pity in the ring. Many fighters can't bear to hammer a helpless opponent in the ring. They don't want to hurt him. But look at Dempsey he was probably the greatest rough and tumble fighter who ever lived.\"  The Mauler had a great chin and was able to fight well when hurt and recovery quickly from damaging punches. Gene Tunney said of him, \"Jack could recover faster than any man I ever fought. He was dangerous with a five-second interval.\"  And this was a reference to the \"past-his-prime\" Dempsey that Tunney fought in 1926 and 1927.  In 1950, the Associated Press conducted a poll of sportswriters to name the greatest fighter of all-time, pound-for-pound, and Dempsey was the runaway winner, collecting 251 votes. [Joe Louis finished a distant second with 109 votes; Henry Armstrong was third with 13.] The sportswriters of the first half of the century named Dempsey as the greatest fighter they had ever seen.  As late as 1962, in the Dec 1962 Ring Magazine, a panel of 40 boxing writers tabbed Dempsey as the greatest heavyweight of all time.  Bert Sugar rates Jack Dempsey as the # 1 all time pound for pound heavyweight. Nat Fleischer rated him #4 on his all time heavyweight list. He also considered Dempsey the best infighter and best two handed hitter among all heavyweight champions. Charley Rose rated him # 3. Eric Jorgensen rates him #2. Cox's Corner rates him # 6.

He is changing things, thats obvious by all the people upset, some of it is good, some of it is bad.  Base your opinions on your own research and beliefs and not what you read here. The spending will end and be cut off as soon as the recession ends and those in Congress who know better tackle the debt.   Many people who don't deserve to be laid off right now are, they are not lazy, did nothing wrong and don't deserve to lose their home or health insurance because of it. Unfortionately you are correct that some will take advantage of it. The best way I can put this in perspective is does a child deserve to go hungry because of the stupidity of their parents, if the parent gets to eat too. The problem with education is more complicated, primarily by starting at the top with grants, the theory is trickle down.  Very similiar with what the republicans believe about economics.  He believes if you educate those closest to entering the job market they will have the most influence on their children when they enter the school system. Primarily the problem with education is the family who uses the school system for things other than education, such as baby sitters, and don't get involved with their childs education at home. Banks are being given money to protect the assets of the people who have money in banks.  If the banks fail, we will enter a depression that will last decades.  The banks are already well on their way to recovery thanks to Bush. AIG is being given money because it insured investments that were considered low risk, and many of those are in trouble because of what happened to the real estate market with bad decisions made throughout the industry by both the business and consumer. Inflation in this sense is a good thing.  WE WILL HAVE RAPID INFLATION.  People will be able to pay off home loans easier, student loans easier, and the people who have their money sitting in a safe deposit box will have to start using it again or watch its value disappear, which will stimulate the economy and investment in the companies, enabling them to grow and hire people again. Obama spends too much time talking right now.  The market seems to fall everytime he opens his mouth.  That is because people need to know the rules to invest money.

	73993 : ["The stimulus isn't designed to sustain the economy, it's designed to get it going again so that it can sustain itself.  Right now the problem is that even healthy businesses rely on lending to sustain themselves, and banks are either too cautious or too poor to lend to even responsible borrowers.  The stimulus should give these banks an injection, allowing them to lend, which allows businesses to stop laying people off and operate as normal, which in turn brings more money back into the economy and brings us back to a cycle of growth instead of loss.  Long-term, this is also better because a busier economy means more tax money is collected.  There were also a number of public works projects and tax cuts in the stimulus designed to create a more immediate job growth. Increased unemployment benefits is necessary right now because jobs are being cut daily and the number of unemployed are on the rise.  It is a childish and heartless notion that all or even most unemployed are lazy or somehow cheating the system.  Will some people exploit it?  Yes, but in most states unemployment is not enough to live off of long-term, much less live comfortably, and you can't tell people \"sorry, we know you lost your job and can't find a new one, but that lazy guy down the street isn't trying very hard to work so you have to leave your home and starve.\" Obama also has an intent for education, but the economy is frankly more important right now.
