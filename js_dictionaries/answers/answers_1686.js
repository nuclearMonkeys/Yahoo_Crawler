	89965 : ["Gnostic:  someone who believes  in one of the diverse, syncretistic religious movements in antiquity consisting of various belief systems generally united in the teaching that the cosmos was created by an imperfect god. Deist:  someone who believes that God created the world and left it to evolve on it's own. Deists typically reject most supernatural events (prophecy, miracles) and tend to assert that God (or \"The Supreme Architect\") has a plan for the universe that is not altered either by God intervening in the affairs of human life or by suspending the natural laws of the universe. What organized religions see as divine revelation and holy books, most deists see as interpretations made by other humans, rather than as authoritative sources. Theist:  someone who in this specific sense, conceives of a god as personal, present and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe. The use of the word theism  as indicating a particular doctrine of monotheism  arose in the wake of the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century to contrast with the then emerging deism  which contended that a god — though transcendent and supreme — did not intervene in the natural world and could be known rationally but not via revelation.", 9349, "9LYu6oGAaa", 2],

Wether the killing be murder, self-defense, or otherwise: we must realize even vegetarians destroy life.  That is if they eat to survive, otherwise, they could give Ghandi a run for his money. Yes, folks, plants and vegetation are living-entities as well...why do we refer to patients in hospitals as vegetables?  Because technically they are Living subconciously or by instinct, or by artificial-machine.  Some do recover, but you can't deny the vegetative-state once its present; temorary or not, right? Anyway, I believe 'God' or Moses, was bringing the law to us; to help us realize; we almost have to 'Sin'(miss the mark) in order to survive-long in this experience we call Human.... This was Moses's conspiracy-set-up to help future-converts; feel the need for a Savior, mainly the one of New-Testament fame; but several in between.

As a matter of fact I know that jesus's name transalted into numberology is 666 and that easter and   are actually pagan holidays.    Who are these men that had this much power to change scripture and even ad words that they themselves created?  Emperor Constantine and the Council of Niceae.

Supposively this knowledge was kept from us with our best interest at heart but from what I know, that couldnt be further from the truth.
