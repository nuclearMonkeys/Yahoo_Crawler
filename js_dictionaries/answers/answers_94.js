We call it the equator and say it is 0° latitude as you move away from the equator north or south your latitude increases and is given in degrees (°) and must also say north or south. Each of the poles is at the greatest latitute. The North Pole is 90° North and the South Pole is 90° South. Longitude is at 90° to latitude and is based on an imaginary line running north to south between the two poles and passing through Greenwich in London, UK. It is called the Prime Meridian and is said to be 0° latitude. You can move east or west of it. East takes you across Europe and then Asia. West over the Atlantic and to the Americas. As you move either way your latitude is measured in degrees (°) east or west. When you reach roughly 180° either way you reach another imaginary line running between the two poles and roughly through the Pacific Ocean called the International Date Line. Every location on Earth can be given by stating its latitude first then it longitude. For greater precision degrees are divided into minutes and they into seconds. For example, Charing Cross, considered to be the centre of Londin, in the UK, has the following location: 51° 30' 28\" N 0° 7' 18\" W. Which means its latitude is 51° 30' 28\" north of the Equator.

	4734 : ["There are several ways to make more money. I knew a fellow (I took his class) who at night taught accounting for engineers at a state uni. I suppose he had at least a Bachelor's in Accounting, but given that it was a very reputable uni, probably at least a Master's, perhaps even a Doctorate. His day job was engineer (I can't remember what kind). Most engineers I've known make extra money developing an idea or service at home and selling it to others (usually: other engineers or specialists who need the product or service). That's especially easy nowadays with the WWW. For example: I knew a biomedical engineer who made pH \"probes\" for swallowing (as opposed to nasal insertion). He personally had found it less trying for the patients, and he discovered several doctors and technicians who felt the same way. I knew another who acquired expertise as a roller coaster tester. He would ride newly-built roller coasters with a little device he designed that would record the forces a rider experienced on the coaster, and so he could \"certify\" the coaster as safe to ride (if the forces were never so great as to be a danger to the riders). There are engineers who have become famous authors. etc. The sky's the limit. What moves you? What do you most want to do other than engineering (occupation-wise)? Whatever it is, become an accredited expert. If engineering is your one, true love, then start a fly-by-night business doing something that requires engineering. Specialize in an area that moves you. Or, perhaps the most obvious solution: acquire a doctorate in electrical engineering from a well-respected uni.", 801, "g9g3fOYyaa", 1],

Some are larger, some are smaller, but they all have to cater for what the majority of people in their particular area want to read. It is a service; it's there for you to use if you want to, or not if you don't want to.

	4751 : ["Library boards are answerable to the people of their community. So get in touch with your library board chair, the chief librarian, your city officials. Put your case to your community why this or that book should be in your library.  Personally, I don't think library users need the latest horror books and trash fiction. They need to read real life non-fiction. I have read that libraries in the United Kingdom are closing due to lack of municipal funds. Some are even using for-profit book providers in order to keep a library open at all.  Those book and e-book providers are not answerable to community standards, just their profit margins.  If you have the disposable income, you can buy any book you find in a store. Libraries are funded so that anyone, regardless of income, can borrow materials that assist their learning. Responsible adults - the taxpayers - don't want their irresponsible children reading erotica or slasher fiction. (Are frenzies of bloodletting the norm in the UK?) That is one reason why libraries have children's sections and why books for teens are scrutinized. Libraries are usually accused of not censoring enough. That (gasp!) there are gay characters in this book or that (horror!) there are books about gender and sexuality differences for teens in the non-fiction section. If you want horror, check the books about criminals and criminal behaviour. In my sheltered life, I have read books about murder in the Victorian era that have made me sick, and I am told that Jack the Ripper was a beginner compared to books about recent murders in the UK. Another reason that there are \"adult only\" rooms and \"not to be removed from the library\" stickers are that those books are the most likely to be vandalized or stolen.  It is not worth buying books that others steal, tear apart or write nasty things inside.", 808, "AA11768465", 1],
