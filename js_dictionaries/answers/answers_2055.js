	108513 : ["As a therapist and a rider, I find that the greatest stress to the hip joint is mounting/dismounting.  I once took lessons from a former Olympic Dressage rider, and he shared that as a middle aged man in Germany, he had a fall and had both hips x rayed.  Apparently at 35, his left hip was as arthritic as the average 80 year old.  From that day forward, he mounted only from a mounting block, not the ground, and he dismounted to the right and always kicked free of the stirrups before getting near the ground.  At 70, when I worked with him, he was still riding, still mounting with a mounting block, and reported he had no particular pain in either hip.   Pain in the knees and ankles is generally due to riding with stirrups that are too short, or riding in a stiff western saddle with stiff fenders that have not been turned.   Stretches before getting into the saddle every time is a good idea.  Keep in mind, that stretching HURTS if done too vigorously.  I always tell my patients \"you won't be flexible by Friday\" as stretching takes time to become really effective, often as long as 3-6 months before you can do the stretches with minimal or in fact pleasant discomfort.  Stretching hurts early on as the tissues aren't used to it.  If you ever go to a self defense training class, They will teach you to grab a finger and stretch it backward.  That is a painful stretch.  When you do your stretches, you need to be more gentle at first. Quad stretches, Gastroc stretches, and low back stretches are the standard ones I teach.  For sore hips I also teach Piriformis stretches as that is the muscle that is usually too tight and causing rider pain.  This is a website I found with a casual search.  It's not exactly what I would do, but it's good.  It lacks a set of quick stretches to do just before getting in the saddle, about a 2 minute session I teach.  Add--Remember that not all saddles are created equal.  I have ridden in saddles that were too wide or too narrow for me that nearly crippled me.  I finally found the right fit for me in a saddle, and it makes a huge difference in how I walk after I get off the horse.  Maybe trying different saddles will make you more comfortable.  I like my Sommer, and I thought I liked my Kieffer, but after riding my new saddle, I can't stand the once wonderful Kieffer. add--the dismount hurts?  That can be due to the static stretch the saddle has put on your hips.  I would really like to see you in a saddle with a narrow twist, or a cathedral shaped seat rather than flat-ish as I see many saddles have.  Does riding bareback cause the same pain?  I am really suspicious of the seat and stirrup length of the stirrups.  Does any of this sound familiar?         I would also bet that you have a very tight piriformis muscle, and if you can get it stretched out, you will have significant relief in your pain.  This is a really good stretch, easily done throughout your day, not just before you ride.      Try the piriformis stretch for a couple of weeks, three times a day.  Stretch gently enough that you just get into the discomfort, don't try to push it just as far as you possibly can.  It will take time to reverse this, but in a couple of weeks, you should feel some relief.  It may take as long as 6 months to finally be pain free, and you will have to keep this up for most of your riding life, at least daily. I would suspect you ride in a saddle a little wide for you, and that somebody along the way has encouraged you to grip with your heels and have your toes stuck out, which will tighten up the piriformis and give you pain. When  you ride, think about pushing your heels down and out, not putting your toes in; it's easier to get the proper position this way.", 10059, "5QG9Zrjaaa", 0],

I have never heard of riding being detrimental to hips. The folks I know who had their hips replaced returned to the saddle... they didn't quit riding because of it.

I've always had the best luck with needle nose pliers or a pair of hemostats (surgical forceps).  If the fish is hooked in the throat, tongue, or gill the safest thing to do is cut the line as close to the hook as possible.

If you even go visit the telescopes in Hawaii you need to spend a night at a hotel half way up the mountain to acclimatise.  Astronomers tending telescopes on the mountains in Chili wear oxygen masks as the air is so thin up there.  That's just on the upper layers of the troposphere - not even into the stratosphere.  The higher you go the lower the atmospheric pressure.  If you want further proof that pressure is related to height go to your local swimming pool and try to go down more than 10 feet. Your ears will hurt due to the pressure so you'll have to pop your ears.  The same is true in an airplane - sometimes, especially the smaller planes, if the pressure in the cabin isn't artificially kept just right you can find your ears popping. If however you are still in doubt you can buy a weather balloon from as little as £13 and a manometer for about £25. A GPS enabled smart phone some easily downloaded software to track the smart phone and a friend with a car and permission from your local airport air traffic control to conduct your experiment in a wide open space.  You can then film the manometer's pressure readings and watch the pressure drop off as your weather balloon increases in height. More expensive equipment will give you higher altitudes but that would be enough for you to independently prove that pressure is inversely proportional to altitude.
