Be aware that ofttimes, the fan blade needs to be replaced too due to being out of balance. Or someone not using a fan blade puller tool and bending things. When replacing the fan motor, ALWAYS replace the capacitor! If it calls for a 270V, replace it with a 370 or 440 volt one. 440V is much better for durability. But keep the recommended uFarad rating the new fan motor requires. New fan motors may need a different capacitor. Oh and make sure the new fan motor is the same voltage rating as the old one! Some fan motors are electrically reversible too. Read any instructions that comes with the new motor. If replacing the fan blade, be sure to match up the old one with the new one. They have different pitch angles sometimes. A compressor can make that noise too (screeching). That used to happen with Puron refrigerant systems a lot.

When will the official churches start praying for the false prophet? Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 3529, "None", 0],

In the early days they did not have running water so dirty water was either thrown out to evaporate in the sun as the water was drawn from a well by a bucket.  Bathing was once a month.  No indoor plumbing so chances are good there were several outhouses on the property over its lifetime.  As one was getting half full then dirt was dumped on top of that brown stuff and a new hole was dug several feet away. hole would be 6 or 8 feet deep so it take awhile to fill with solids half way up.     Water utility would not know of the outhouses because that is not a water source but a small creek or diverting a small creek would be something they would have done and know about. Because it is black, tells me it was not clean water.  Scrape off some of the black stuff and take it to a lab and have it analyzed.   Pooh is the most likely result.", 3519, "None", -3],
