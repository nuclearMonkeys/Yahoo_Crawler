If He is Lord of your life then you will obey His commands.  Here's something to think about. Here's the problem.  We have all broken God's Law, the Ten Commandments.  Who hasn't told a lie, stolen, used God's name in vain, or lusted after another person?  We will all stand in God's courtroom one day and answer for everything we have ever done.  If we are guilty (and we all are), we will end up in God's prison, which is Hell.  Maybe you think that's brutal, but look at it this way:  if I lie to my sister, she can do nothing about it.  If I lie to my wife, I will be sleeping on the couch and possibly headed for divorce.  If I lie to the IRS, I can go to jail for a long time.  The punishment does not increase based on what kind of lie I tell, it increases based on the importance of the one I am lying to.  Therefore, lying to God is the most serious kind of lying I can do and deserves the most severe punishment. So we ALL deserve to go to Hell.  The Bible says, \"all liars will have their part in the Lake of Fire\".  Everyone must pay for their crimes, and God's standard is perfection.  None of us measure up.  How will YOU fare on that day?  We will all stand before God on Judgment Day, just like standing before a judge in a courtroom, and the Judge will pass sentence.  So what can we do? Jesus Christ paid the penalty for our sins in His life's blood.  You broke God's Law, Jesus paid your fine.  That means your case can legally be dismissed and you can walk free from the courtroom on the Day of Judgment.  What you must do to receive this free gift is repent (turn from your sin and agree with God that it is wrong) and trust in Jesus Christ ALONE to save you, like you trust in the pilot of an airplane when you fly.  As soon as you do that, God will wipe your sins away as if you had never sinned, and you will be given a clean slate.  The Holy Spirit will come to live inside you at that moment, and will help you change your life to be an obedient follower of Jesus Christ. So don't put it off.  None of us can be sure that we will be alive tomorrow, and once we die it is too late.  Repent and trust in the Savior today.

	127005 : ["I remember seeing the other video of this you linked, of someone else doing the same type of kata. What is the purpose of dropping the knees and bending the back knee? Additionally, what is the purpose behind changing the orientation of the hands when going from chest outwards or back in? I have some ideas I could share, but their usefulness would depend on the answers to those questions. Update: I can only judge your video based upon what I know, so it will necessarily lack a proper contextual understanding of specific mechanics or components present in your kata. The points of similarity I will start first with. It looks as if some of the drop when you perform the \"sink\", if that is what you call it, generates downward force utilizing the body as the main mass. The spine, thus, acts as a stabilizing rod to prevent twisting, rotating, or frontal impact forces from bending your body in such a way that power is lost instead of properly transferred to the target through the wrist and shoulders. Related to some of what I've read about kenjutsu, maximum force from a sword strike cannot be generated when the back foot is off the ground, even if it is on its toes. That would lead me to believe that both feet firmly placed flat on the ground is also designed to generate the maximum amount of force through the contact with the palm. TFT doesn't have pre made katas. Rather it promotes the user to think up of specific scenarios and craft a kata to deal with it. Since much of this has to deal with range and getting in range, it is the steps we take before we strike that must flow effortlessly from a running or walking posture to a fixed and inflexible core at the moment the strike contacts the target. The issue, for me, is that if I don't judge the distance right, the feet won't be in the right place. Sometimes it is too far away and you have to take a baby step. Sometimes it's so close that you won't be able to take another step before you hit him, which would push you back since you aren't balanced. This wouldn't be a problem, normally, since walking and running are skills we have used for a long time. It becomes an issue, however, when we add form and structure, plus targeting, plus striking using the upper body to translate force. Then it becomes complicated. On that note, you may wish to think about changing the length of your strides and varying them according to an imagined object or length. I don't know if that will work or not for you, though. I tried what you recommended with the straight spine. I got the tension in the back quads from the straight leg, yes, but that's normal for what I use. What it seems to do is prevent you from moving backwards, actually. If you try to move backwards with a straight leg and knee like that, and you drop your weight with straight spine, you have created a locked structure that has no give, with the back leg used as a support. What I didn't notice was the inability to bend the spine. I could bend it almost as much as I could in a normal spinal stretch. I tried horse stance, regular TFT stance for attacking forward, cat stance (or at least that's what I heard it was called), but I didn't notice much difference in the ability of the spine to bend. I did notice that it placed different pressures on both legs, of course, but that didn't really affect my ability to lock in my spine so it won't move backwards or bend somewhere else. The kata may have additional components dealing with the spine that may not be apparent, however. Essentially, TFT doesn't teach us to place our back foot diagonal to the front. Rather, it is lined up straight forward, both forward. That can't handle diagonal or twisting forces. Instead, once the user has achieved a strike that covers a long enough distance (enough to totally displace somebody else's body a body length away), a rotation strike against say, the neck, that is diagonal and downward, in a twisting motion, then translates into the house stance. The time of contact with the neck then must be the same as having already translated into the horse stance. Instead of facing the person from the front, now he is in front of your right shoulder (if using a left and down strike with the right elbow/forearm). Then the power behind that strike comes from dropping the entire bodyweight, into the lower form of the horse stance, while maintaining perfect balance. The ability to translate between stances, while having the proper range, while maintaining proper form, thus is something I'm working on. It requires a precision and sense of timing and has to apply to any situation or body configuration. I describe this because that is what I am thinking of when I look at leg work or lower body mechanics. We are taught not to bend the knee at all. If we need to shift the leg, the point of flexibility is in the hips, where the leg joins with the pelvis, and not the spine, knee, neck, head, etc. The reason is because the amount of force generated can be increased by torso twisting or spine locking, but to get enough to displace another human body, regardless of their weight, from a frontal strike and to cause enough depression in tissue, organ, and bone to create injury, the best chance rests in the greatest amount of force possible. It's also an energy saver from when I tested the stance against forward force. Instead of using my leg muscles to brace myself against somebody in front (a force in front), the leg takes care of all of that. It puts pressure on the knee and certain muscles to lock it in, but it saves the muscle endurance for something else. This has to be a triangle form, however, with legs positioned in a horse stance, except you're not facing front, but sideways (both feet and head and shoulders). What I notice from the video, with this in mind, is that if you strike anything in front of you, while dropping your weight, the knee is at the point where it will bend from the force imparted from the front. Bend as in make a 90 degree rectangle and place it almost over the ground. And I say this because if the spine is locked straight so it can't bend backwards any more, then frontal force creates a lever of your body with your knee as the fulcrum. Thus all the force going back from the palm/fist strike, moves the lever of your body until everything goes into your knee. If everything went into the ground with a fixed structure, then the lever would move the target you are striking, instead. I hope that made sense in the context of your training. This is the bad part of video exams, however. What could be tested in 10 seconds requires some odd minutes of written descriptions. Well, I guess that now concludes both similarity and dis-similarity reviews. I'd be interested in hearing what your style says on the matter that I wrote about, however. Other than those points, your basic form looks solid. And if you are using body weight as the primary power source for strikes, then that stomach actually gives you more power ; ) Gravity doesn't care what it is pulling down, after all.", 10922, "opUMLtkQaa", -1],

This enslavement was accomplished because of the racist belief that Black Africans were less fully human than white Europeans and their descendants. This belief was not \"automatic\": that is, Africans were not originally considered inferior. When Portuguese sailors first explored Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries, they came upon empires and cities as advanced as their own, and they considered Africans to be serious rivals.", 10921, "HS5qFgYNaa", 4],

Although the u.s. is often highly criticized for exploiting slavery, it only took in about 12 percent of the slaves compared to Brazils 33 percent). Prominent west african tribes were willing to work with Europeans by enslaving Central Africans in order to gain power. These slaves were also resistant to malaria (due to sickle cell anemia) which was an added bonus. Eventually it became cheaper to replace dying slaves with new fresh slaves breeding a disregard for human life, essentially \"creating\" racism. - so yes, I feel it was \"created\" :) . if you're looking to point fingers, it was the Portuguese who originally began to employ black slaves in mass quantities.", 10921, "AbtFTH2qaa", 0],
