It's in many books I've read: If they say it once. . .they mean it. No matter if they suddenly hate you. Once loved is always loved. & One day you will be able to find someone that DOES tell you that they love you, and you can douce them in love :) (did I use the right douce? douse. whatever lol) That's what happened with my boyfriend. We met, and he had never said I love you to anyone before, not even his family, and they started pouring out, 10 or more times a day. Slowly they died down and one day I asked why. He said he personally hates the word, and though he does love me, it's not going to die. it's the word that will lose meaning. It's the strongest word possible, and it should only be used as sparingly as possible.  As for me, in my family my mom and I say it to eachother every night before we go off to bed. My brother is rarely like that, and uses it sparingly. My dad however, rarely ever says it to anyone besides me mom. & even then he hasn't in a while. It comes and goes for him.  So honestly, I hang out with a loving crowd. I love all of my friends. They tell me they love me maybe once a day, or once a week, depending on if they're happy or sad. It's because I'm always there for them. & Whenever I say thank you, if I love the person, I'll through that in. Because that's who I am. But that's not everyone.", 9950, "PCcbECdZaa", 0],

	106110 : ["How old is she now? In other words, how long am I being asked to wait? Also, why can't I marry her and help her with all these things 'cause I don't think looking after her parents, siblings, and attending school all at once is something she should have to do alone. I support her, \"go to class, go study, I'll take your mom to her doctor's appointment,\" that's what a spouse is supposed to do, help and support, not drain you with further burden. If she can juggle those without me, what a relief still for her when I come along to make the load lighter on her not heavier. Lol, that first answerer doesn't know a thing about women!

Tell her that you would like to find someone else to watch him, because he's to young to be engaging in that type of activity. At least that's what I would do!", 9949, "kHxkN5BRaa", 0],

	106114 : ["first of all i would like to say well done for waiting till you are married, and secondly don't worry about the fact that you haven't had your first kiss yet, i only had my kiss when i was 20 and i don't care that i waited longer than most people that i know, and when they would tell me that i need to get it over with I just told them it will happen when it happens until then i am going to enjoy every day until it comes....But i understand that you may feel lonely but please dont rush yourself just to feel the need to fit in with everyone else, take your time and just do what you feel is the correct thing for yourself.... Your not stupid either, you dont really know what this guy wants he could just want to be friends with you or he could like you, the only way you will get to know is if you talk to him, i know this is going to be hard for you as you have stated that you are a shy person but so am i, you need to try and over come this, it will be hard but will be worth it as for having to talk to the guys first so what??", 9947, "01CkxUQvaa", 0],
	106115 : ["Actually, pretty girls sometimes have a harder time than average girls with guys. Because many many boys are terrified of talking to a beautiful girl. They feel like they're going to get shot down and laughed at.  My mom told me this many times, and I never believed it. I thought she was just trying to make me feel better. But over time, I've had two guys tell me they never tried to flirt with me because they were intimidated. They were scared I would reject them.  So be a little brave, and go talk to a guy. Just as a casual conversation. Also, it's normal to feel left out when you see couples, and feel bad that you haven't had a first kiss. But you will get it. And nothing is wrong with you, you just have to take some initiative and be brave!", 9947, "UPVwBZpWaa", 1],
	106116 : ["Thank you for your question.  Very accurate observations.  It isn't just the liberal branch of the Democratic Party.  Let's not forget the 111th congress.  They rammed health care reform down our throats claiming it was revenue neutral leaving off the doctor fix calling it a different problem.  I always thought doctors were part of health care.  It is more than 2000 pages long.  That alone makes it unconstitutional.  They are supposed to come up with a budget but rather than proposing one and passing it they deemed a budget to be passed.  They did this because they didn't want to have to face the consequences at the polls in November, 2010.  Well it looks like that backfired.  The point I support with all of this (there is much more) is they are unabashedly anti American, anti capitalistic and pro Communistic.  If not they must be insane.  They carried out all of these actions knowing the public did not approve just to show their political power and then tried to hide the fact that they are enemies of the the USA by not proposing and passing a budget.  They thought they had everyone fooled.  They still do.", 9951, "None", 1],
	106117 : ["I am an older Liberal and Liberals were also generally anti Establishment - anti government as well..

	106118 : ["Political extremeness like the weather underground inelegantly used the ideals of liberalism to control peoples emotions so they could dictate their agendas. They created a notion of no shame for lack of morality and promised a world of no responsibility. Eventually people with their protests and chants gave any who signed on the right to carry on selfishly without regard for who or what they effect negatively.

Perhaps, too, it is simply the view you have chosen from your subjective vantage point. All things viewed correctly can lead to results that may be beneficial to others and to ones self. A lie may lead to the truth of the person who has spoken such by accurately revealing him or her to the listener. An uncomfortable truth may lead one to greater understanding of him or her self which may lead to personal growth that is beneficial to all. How one deals with adversity says more about the person than how they deal with what may be understood as the more desired things in life such as happiness, success, material abundance, etc. Do you remember your death from a previous existence?  If not then how do you arrive at the view that death hurts?  Perhaps it is a wonderful release from the pains one might have been immediately experiencing prior to dying.
