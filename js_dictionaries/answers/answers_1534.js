First, it is a cumbersome and poorly defined hypothesis that contains a couple primary and several secondary questions (which all should be separate hypotheses). If you mean does it meet the requirement of falsification, the answer is yes for some. It is false if any of the following is false. 1) there is no increasing temperature trend; 2) there is no relationship between human activity and atmospheric CO2; or 3) there is no relationship between atmospheric CO2 and temperature. The other major component, \"...will cause significant disruptions to both natural systems and human social organizations if unchecked” although too broadly stated are areas of investigation derived from - and may be explained by - AGW Theory. In fact, it is a no-brainer (there is ample evidence from paleoclimatology, paleontology, and archaeology of the effects of major climatic changes on environments and human adaptations) and is the primary reason people care about global warming. ====== Trevor and d/dx+d/dy+d/dz -- I was able to retrieve my answer.

	82364 : ["What is wrong with Global Warming? Why do people think it will be the end of the world? Paleontologists and climatologists all agree that the Earth was much warmer millions of years ago. They also agree that when the Earth was warmer, the tropics covered almost the entire Earth. How can that be? All the alarmists tell us that Global warming will cause the planet to be a barren dessert, how could it be a tropical paradise when it was warm in the past? Well, some of us passed 8th grade and actually payed attention. There is the little thing called evaporation. And when the planet gets hotter, there is more evaporation (70% of the surface is water), which means more rain. This means that Global warming is a good thing. It will provide massive amounts of new farmland and fresh water to provide for our ever-expanding population. We should actually be trying to accelerate Global Warming. Now, let me answer your question: There is no proof that the amount of CO2 we put into the atmosphere has any noticeable affect on the climate. I'm not saying it has no affect, I'm saying the affect is so minuscule that it is irrelevant. CO2 from the beginning of the Industrial revolution until now has increased from 0.034% of the atmosphere to 0.036%. It is quite literally like a fart in a hurricane. More CO2 was realesed in 1 day when Mt. St. Helens erupted than all the CO2 humanity has ever produced put together.

	82365 : ["I found the scienceMag.org article to be interesting and I would like to look at it a little more closely. I don't think anyone can say conclusively whether warming exists or not. In my opinion, anyone who has taken an ostrich position on either side has done little more than put blinders on and stuck their fingers in their ears and is going 'la,la,la,la...\" If scientists cannot agree, the issue is obviously complex. The sad thing to me is the whole thing has become a political football. As for a piece of evidence I would point to a receding glacier that, as I have heard, receded past an old mine shaft entrance and there were found stored mining tools from years and years  (perhaps decades) earlier. The logical conclusion then would be that fluctuations in global temperatures occur and we are in another period of warming. Later this will be followed by another period of cooling and so forth. The real question is how much affect do the activities of man have on these trends. If we are able to ever figure that out, would one volcanic eruption have the same overall effect? If the earth could talk, would it look at our activities and say, \"Whatever.\" I think our pollution and waste in landfills is a greater concern than the prospect of global warming or cooling or whichever way the trend is going. As for Al Gore, he's a politician and whenever he hears a voice of opposition, his response has been to stiffle them instead of debating them. Therefore, Al Gore demonstrates his agenda which is self-enrichment. There will never be serious debate on this until both sides choose to listen and discuss the views of the other side.

	82391 : ["Can the hypothesis be proven? Please take this from a neutral position. I am only going to state what the science tells us. \"Human actions ... leading to significant climate alterations\" - this at the moment is suggested to be highly likely based on scientific evidence. Therefore it would be concluded that \"current research and data suggests that humans are significantly influencing the global climate\". Technically not \"proven\" but the data concludes that that part of the hypothesis is supported. No matter if you agree AGW is real or not, the conclusion stated above will be drawn. \"signficant rise in average temperatures of the atmosphere, near surface and oceans\" - a value for \"significant\" would have to be determined to draw any conclusions. Data and research largely agrees with that hypothesis. Therefore it would be concluded that \"current reserach and data shows that average temperatures of the atmosphere and near the surface have risen at a trend not previously recorded or documented\". I am unsure about ocean temps. If humans are causing this rising trend can not be \"proven\" but no known natural variables have been able to explain the trends observed. Again if you are for or against AGW, the conclusion above will be drawn from the data available irrespectively. \"This rise ... will cause significant disruptions ... if unchekced\". This part of the hypothesis assumes that a rise will occur (the data suggests that this assumption is a likely scenairo , only time will \"prove\" it or not). If it is assumed that the temperatures will rise, it would be quite safe to hypothese the disruptions. The impacts of climatic variability and factors has been measured and observed in the past. The potential impacts from similar climatic variability and factors would be assumed to be similar to past impacts if nothing is changed.

	82399 : ["It is a cycle and here is an article i copied that came out in January. If you're wondering why North America is starting to resemble nuclear winter, then you missed the news. At December's U.N. Global Warming conference in Poznan, Poland, 650 of the world's top climatologists stood up and said man-made global warming is a media generated myth without basis. Said climatologist Dr. David Gee, Chairman of the International Geological Congress, \"For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming?\"  I asked myself, why would such obviously smart guy say such a ridiculous thing? But it turns out he's right.  The earth's temperature peaked in 1998. It's been falling ever since; it dropped dramatically in 2007 and got worse in 2008, when temperatures touched 1980 levels. Meanwhile, the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center released conclusive satellite photos showing that Arctic ice is back to 1979 levels. What's more, measurements of Antarctic ice now show that its accumulation is up 5 percent since 1980. In other words, during what was supposed to be massive global warming, the biggest chunks of ice on earth grew larger. Just as an aside, do you remember when the hole in the ozone layer was going to melt Antarctica? But don't worry, we're safe now, that was the nineties. Dr. Kunihiko, Chancellor of Japan's Institute of Science and Technology said this: \"CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or the other ... every scientist knows this, but it doesn't pay to say so.\" Now why would a learned man say such a crazy thing? This is where the looney left gets lost. Their mantra is atmospheric CO2 levels are escalating and this is unquestionably causing earth's temperature rise. But ask yourself -- if global temperatures are experiencing the biggest sustained drop in decades, while CO2 levels continue to rise -- how can it be true? Ironically, in spite of being shown false, we must now pray for it. Because a massive study, just released by the Russian Government, contains overwhelming evidence that earth is on the verge of another Ice Age. Based on core samples from Russia's Vostok Station in Antarctica, we now know earth's atmosphere and temperature for the last 420,000 years. This evidence suggests that the 12,000 years of warmth we call the Holocene period is over. Apparently, we're headed into an ice age of about 100,000 years -- give or take. As for CO2 levels, core samples show conclusively they follow the earth's temperature rise, not lead it. It turns out CO2 fluctuations follow the change in sea temperature. As water temperatures rise, oceans release additional dissolved CO2 -- like opening a warm brewsky. And i would like to thank C.S. for emailing me telling me that this is all wrong.
