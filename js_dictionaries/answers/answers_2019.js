Talk about the things your grandmother needs help with, and ask everyone to commit to do part of the work. Again, let your parents handle it.

Every C you play (your notation) will be a C#/Db on the A clarinet - so that they both would SOUND like the note Bb.  Yes, the actual PLAYING fingerings are the same - but the keys you play in are NOT - so, everything must be relearned. I have played the piccolo solo for Stars and Stripes so often, that I can play it in the band key - Ab - and the orchestra key - G.  This also comes in handy IF  I ever owned a Db piccolo; I'd play it in G, and it would sound in Ab.   A lot of wind players find that they need to transpose - but for you to learn the ENTIRE Mozart clarinet concerto in 2 keys, at you age, is a bigger task than you need right now.", 9964, "sc4BtGxGaa", -1],

If you don't have a strong stomach, or various smells trigger your gag reflex, then nursing probably won't be a good fit for you.
