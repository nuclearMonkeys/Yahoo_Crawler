I used to have my period off and on like that and then it started to invert and i had my period for 3 weeks and a week break, then it would start again. I met with my doctor and got onto the Pill, and it has helped regulate my periods and flow. I have been on it for 3 years and have never had any problems with it.  As for this so-called \"blood clot\", that is actually just tissue that has built up in your uterus for the last few months because you haven't had a regular period, so it does not get the chance to be released and builds up over time. That happens to me too sometimes, and it is completely normal. A blood clot is very different and should never be confused with what I just described.  I have actually had an ovarian cyst before. One morning I woke up really early and went to go pee, and then I got this insane sharp pain in my left ovary area and was on the floor in pain. I had to be driven to the hospital. The pain lasted for a long time, but it eventually went away. I went to my doctor soon afterward, and she said that I had had an ovarian cyst that had exploded. I didn't experience any pain beforehand, though, although that might be just me.  If you are at all concerned you should make an appointment with your doctor. I would recommend getting yourself on some hormones like the Pill to regulate your cycle. And if you are having excessive pain in your abdomen I would get that checked out too.  Good luck!", 8622, "AA11327037", 0],

	71542 : ["People can be amazing sometimes. Whenever people tell you that eyesight cannot improve permanently, do not believe them. They need to try something first before they say it doesn't work, otherwise they're not being truly scientific. Real science means to try something first before determining whether you are sure of something. If you are taught that x implies y in school, and others tell you that x is y because science tells them so, that is NOT being scientific. How do they know for sure x is y unless they try it first? People (including doctors) are merely repeating to you what they've been taught to believe, rather than what they've tried. This is not true science. What I suggest you do is to do what I did, consider looking into natural vision improvement. Remember that what I just said applies to anyone who denies such claims. I know it works, Snellen eye charts do not lie. I have been able to go from 20/100 to 20/13 because I did not believe these types of people who say that vision improvement is hopeless.  I suggest checking out this book:   It is one of the best books ever written on the subject of vision improvement and the history of the optometry school. Many invaluable gems in that book. It will teach you how to improve your vision permanently, and prevent you from making mistakes that so many people have made.", 8627, "AA10610246", 0],

	71546 : ["Well, I think i know why it was changed; originally Pokemon was a japanese cartoon and it had sex and voilence in it. But then a company called '4 kids' got the copyright and changed it all so it was suitable for children to watch. I dont know why they changed the name but i think that Pokemon sounds more intertesting and different (as Pokemon is set in a different world to ours) and maybe the word 'monsters' they were worried would put the children off the show. Or maybe the editor had to change it because they couldn't take the name as their own.  1) My favorite type of Pokemon is Electric  - and my fave pokemon is either the electric evolution of eve or the 2nd evolution of the sheep pokemon.  2) I think inside a pokeball a pokemon cant see anything or hear anything but they are filled with a relaxing and soothing feelings inside. And they arn't nessasarly a body anymore just the mind. So they can think but they arn't connected to a body. So they are sort of in a nice soothing  half awake state.  3) I think that the classic is what made Pokemon what it is, and i hate all the new clothes and people. They anouy me and i think that some of the new evolutions are abit try hard. And all the girls always wear such reveling tops and clothes. 4) No i do not, i dont think you can narrow down anything to just for kids because i am 15 and i still love to play games and tiggy and hide and seek and imaginary. But does this mean that just because im 'growing up' that i am not 'allowed' to enjoy these games anymore? Who am i harming in the process and what am i doing that is 'wrong' b y playing games and things that always have givin my pleasure and fun as a child, does this mean for the rest of my life i will never enjoy these things that i have grown up with and that i never thought i would have to leave?", 8620, "wJMvHytOaa", 1],
	71547 : ["V.v sometimes dubs work out that way. Pokemon was directed at younger children in the U.S. (7+) so the company that licensed it, edited in such a way as to market off the show. That's just the way they make profit. Heh, back in the day when Pokemon first came to the U.S. (via television screen), it was epic, funny, entertaining, and mysterious to all kids. Above all, it was unique.......even if it was heavily edited.  1)Whats your fave Pokemon type? and your fave Pokemon of that type? >>Emm, I don't really have a fave. type...V.VI'd guess I'd go with normal though. Fave pokemon from that type: Meowth.  2)How do you think its like inside a Pokeball? >>Padded walls and a bullet-proof glass window O.O (watch GoodBurger, it will make sense).  3)Do you think the new series is better or worse than the classic one? >>Well, the dub is REALLY not justifying the series in my opinion. The voices are out of character and much more flightier. I tried watching some with my little bro, but it was rather boring because it just kind of seemed the same as the older series.  4)Do you think Pokemon is just for kids? >>The show? Yes. It's directed to the kids group in America through the wonderful world of dubbing e.e The videogame series: Of course not. It has stuck with people who had their hands on the first Pokemon Gameboy videogame.  nya nya", 8620, "l9uGrfSYaa", 1],
	71548 : ["When every season of Pokemon is dubbed(mainly English dubbed) why is so much of it changed? >>It's just to americanize it.  Americans are lazy and they get annoyed when they have to learn even names for foreign languages (I really wish they would be named satoshi and takeshi and w/e the hell misty is) Examples: The names of the Pokemon, the trainers, the main chars, the Gym Leaders etc. and even the title was changed. Dubbed=Pokemon Original=Pocketmonsters. >>>Actually, Pokemon is just a shortened version of pocketmonsters they use in japan.  [ポ][ケ]ット[モ][ン]スタ Those katakana in the brackets are \"Po\" \"ke\" \"mo\" \"n\".  Japan actually does this a lot because using foreign words that weren't meant for their language make the words way longer (like \"break\" becomes \"bu-re-e-ki\") so they shorten them and stick them together (like remote control became remokon) 1)Whats your fave Pokemon type? and your fave Pokemon of that type? >>>I am partial the the ghosties :) my favorite is probably Gengar or Psyduck 2)How do you think its like inside a Pokeball? >>>lol, have you seen that robot chicken? I think that's what it's like 3)Do you think the new series is better or worse than the classic one? >>>Sadly I only saw a few as a child, and I don't watch it anymore 4)Do you think Pokemon is just for kids? >>>Nothing is just for kids (I'll still like cartoons when I'm 60) but, for me specifically, it's definitely one of those things I'm going to leave in the past so I can remember how \"Amazingly awesome\" it was.  I'm sure if I watched it now I'd think \"this is so childish! Why did I like it?\"  like I said though, mileage varies", 8620, "dYQUQGflaa", 1],

	71565 : ["When a series is dubbed to a different laguage, this is inevitable as the dubbers try to beat it into the frame of their culture. Japanese culture and names are alien to English speaking folks. They have to dub it in such a manner that people find it familiar and can relate to it. They just wanna make sure that maximum people watch the show and most people are not that great anime lovers to be bothered about originality. They totally twist the series and even change the story and relation between characters. Like the Hindi version of Cardcaptor Sakura was a trash. It happens and that is why i do not trust dubbed and censored versions. I like water pokemon best and my fav is squirtle. I think it wud be extremely stuffy and boring inside a pokeball with too much privacy for my liking. I hav not watched the new series. And it depends really.

The 1st three seasons were amazing. After those seasons, I stopped watching it, just because the newer one got annoying & the new character weren't as interesting. They even changed Ash's hat. :( 4)Do you think Pokemon is just for kids? >>No; it is for anyone who still wants fantasy in their lives. It is for the people who are young at heart though.
