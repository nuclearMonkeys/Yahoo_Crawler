	66812 : ["Hi Momo, Don't worry... you and your body sound really cute. However... there's no need to get too obsessed with your appearance, because personality is the ultimate hook for most guys in a long term relationship. You don't need to be drop-dead gorgeous or a perfect 10. Plenty of guys would prefer a cute girl rather than a 10. Why? Because a 10 is usually high maintenance, spoiled, vain, selfish, unappreciative, arrogant, useless... and a 10 would probably also have expensive tastes. So, assuming that you might wish to avoid a few of the more common dating pitfalls... how about some free advice about guys and dating? OK. How do you get a guy to like you, and perhaps want to be your BF? - Make good eye contact - Ask a few generic questions (assignments, homework, whatever) - Be nice & pleasant - Have a friendly smile - Laugh at his jokes - Tell him \"thank you\" if he helps you with a something - Repeat daily Consider the following... what do guys look for in a girl? Different guys look for different things... depending on the guy and his age.  Typical young immature teenage guys: 1. Hot body 2. Cute face 3. Hot body  4. Willing to fall for their lines of crap 5. Hot body Typical players & creeps: 1. Hot body 2. Dumb enough to fall for their lines of crap  3. Hot body 4. No Dad or big older brother to protect her 5. Hot body Typical geeks: 1. Any reasonably attractive female who would be willing to date him Typical mature & decent guys: 1. Nice personality (not too clingy, not too dramatic, not an airhead) 2. Nice body (hot would be good... but not required) 3. Cute face 4. Intelligent  5. Not a sl*t In order to protect your tender heart, it's a good idea to be cautious about the types of guys that you would be willing to date... and watch out how you behave, too. Why? - Because lots of young guys tend to be frogs… not princes. - Because many guys will typically want to go way past kissing if the girl allows it. - Because sheltered and inexperienced girls can be too vulnerable, too impulsive, and too emotional. - Because some girls have poor judgment and believe the lies spouted by a jerk or player. - Because many guys are typically only interested in what's in a girl's panties. - Because some guys don't care about a girl's feelings. - Because lots of guys are frequently focused solely on satisfying their own selfish desires. - Because many girls tend to equate love with kissing and sex (translation - they get their heart trampled), while most young guys don't (translation - they simply say \"See ya later, Dummy!\"). - Because after the inevitable break-up, a young lady will often feel as though her world has collapsed. What are some hazards of dating? Here are a few -  1. Watch out for those handsome players or creeps who might pretend to like you, because you could easily fall for their phony attention and smooth lines of crap. Beware - they'll use your body and then dump you like a sack of potatoes. 2. Decide on your physical limits before you start dating, and stick to those limits. Getting too excited while being alone together with your date or your steady BF is not the time to start thinking about setting limits... your judgment will be clouded, and your BF's judgment will be long gone. 3. No matter what, don't date any older adult guys who pretend to be interested in you. They're even worse than players your own age... and like the players they'll only be interested in one thing... and it won't be your mind.  Don't be tempted to act like a sl*t. If you head down that road, then you'll only succeed in attracting complete jerks who will then proceed to wreck your life... and make your parents really mad at both you and the jerk. Be advised that as time passes, some of your friends and classmates will probably be expecting you to follow whatever path they are traveling... even if it is a stupid path of dating jerks, making out with random guys, or casual sex. Resist that kind of peer pressure. How can you keep your heart from getting trampled? Keep your panties on until you get married. That'll eliminate 99% of the creeps, losers, and players... and mistakes of passion... which will make your life much happier and simpler in the long run. You'll also be protected against pregnancy, STD's, and excessive heartache. Final advice? Don't make too many stupid decisions, don't date jerks, don't drink too much booze or take any drugs, don't have friends who drink heavily or take drugs, listen to your Mom and Dad, read the Bible (the Gospel of John is a good place to start), and then everything will turn out fine. Those are a few things for you to think about, Momo. Good luck!  Signed, WB .", 8356, "None", 0],

	66818 : ["You can cure Tonsillitis in the following ways. A.- AT-HOME CARE Whether tonsillitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection, at-home care strategies can make you more comfortable and promote better recovery.  If a virus is the expected cause of tonsillitis, these strategies are the only treatment.  You will likely be better within seven to 10 days.  At-home care strategies to use during the recovery time include the following:  1.- Take rest.  - get plenty of sleep  - rest your voice.  2.-Take adequate fluids.  - drink plenty of water to keep the throat moist and prevent dehydration.  3.- Take comforting foods and beverage. - Warm liquids — broth, caffeine-free tea or warm water with honey — and cold treats like ice pops can soothe a sore throat.  4.- Use a saltwater gargle.  - a saltwater gargle of 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of table salt to 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of warm water can help soothe a sore throat.  5.- Humidify the air.  - Use a cool-air humidifier to eliminate dry air that may further irritate a sore throat, or sit for several minutes in a steamy bathroom.  6.- Use  lozenges.                                                                              7.- Avoid irritants.  - Keep your room free from cigarette smoke and cleaning products that can irritate the throat.  8.- Treat pain and fever.  - Use Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to minimize throat pain and control a fever.                                                        ------------------------ B.- ANTIBIOTICS - If tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, your doctor will prescribe a course of antibiotics.  - Penicillin taken by mouth for 10 days is the most common antibiotic treatment prescribed for tonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus.  - If you are allergic to penicillin, your doctor will prescribe an alternative antibiotic.  - You must take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed even if the symptoms go away completely.  - Failure to take all of the medication as directed may result in the infection worsening or spreading to other parts of the body.  - Not completing the full course of antibiotics can, in particular, increase you risk of rheumatic fever and serious kidney inflammation.                                                  -------------------------------------- C.- SURGERY Surgery to remove tonsils (tonsillectomy) may be used to treat frequently recurring tonsillitis, chronic tonsillitis, or bacterial tonsillitis that doesn't respond to antibiotic treatment. Frequent tonsillitis is generally defined as:  - More than six episodes in one year  - More than four episodes a year over two years  - More than three episodes a year over three years A tonsillectomy may also be performed if tonsillitis results in difficulty to manage complications, such as:  - Obstructed sleep apnea  - Breathing difficulty  - A peritonsillar abscess that doesn't improve with antibiotic treatment Tonsillectomy is usually done as a one-day surgery.   A complete recovery usually takes seven to 10 days.", 8357, "bee447972f055d41a014f24d7b542a6faa", 2],
