Even today, there are plenty of French people who actually regret that and who follow the British monarchy quite avidly. I know: I used to live there.   And unlike some other European countries, France has not made the use of aristocratic (often formerly royal) titles illegal. They LOVE their various pretenders to the throne and their wives and children. They've got three lines of them, and their media cover their weddings and feuds and so forth with great enthusiasm.

	51798 : ["By history and tradition, a King is considered to be superior to a Queen.  Therefore, a reigning King may have a Queen.  If the Queen is the monarch, as is the case here, her husband cannot be a King, because then he would appear to outrank her.  Therefore, they made him a Prince.  Interestingly, although Elizabeth was a princess when they married in 1947, and she became Queen in 1952, Charles was not given the title of \"Prince\" until 1957.", 7270, "5Z6t8GvBaa", 0],
