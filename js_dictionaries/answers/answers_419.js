It wasn't really a public washroom, they didn't have one, but would let you use the staff one if you said you really needed it. After a couple times I just started going in there without asking, I'd just walk in the back and go in and see the mags. I was like 8-9 years old.

However, bear in mind that any material which is composted probably would break down anyway, and emit the same amount of CO2 in any case.  As far as water pollution, runoff from a large-scale composting site can sometimes be an issue, particularly if it has a lot of nutrients in it.  But in general, composting is considered an environmentally-friendly way to handle organic waste materials, and return organic matter and nutrients to the soil.  If you consider alternatives, such as sending, say, food waste or yard waste to a landfill, there it will produce methane as it breaks down anaerobically. It's also very costly. ", 3685, "WvFJh2GAaa", 0],

In addition, power generation is becoming more efficient / lower emissions. Yes, solar doesn't generate power at night, but it does during the day and contributes to the power grid overall. Coal is decreasing in importance.  In any case, it will still create emissions, but the point is that it's lower emissions than regular gas-powered cars. ", 3686, "WvFJh2GAaa", 0],

Also they want to ban gas boilers and switch everyone to electric heating. Costs will at least double , so given that electric is about 5x the cost of gas anyway, my heating bill could go up 10 fold over a few years. Also, they will need to recoup revenue lost from fossil fuels, so I can see soecial meters being installed for EV charging. It will be like economy 7 in reverse, it will be far more expensive, or all electricity will be charged at a higher rate to compensate.
