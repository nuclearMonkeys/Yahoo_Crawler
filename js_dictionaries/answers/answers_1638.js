	87562 : ["AFTER denouncing the Pharisees for their self-serving traditions, Jesus leaves with his disciples. Not long before, you may recall, his attempt to get away with them to rest up a bit was interrupted when crowds found them. Now, with his disciples, he departs for the regions of Tyre and Sidon, many miles to the north. This apparently is the only trip Jesus makes with his disciples beyond the borders of Israel. After finding a house to stay in, Jesus lets it be known that he does not want anyone to learn of their whereabouts. Yet, even in this non-Israelite territory, he cannot escape notice. A Greek woman, born here in Phoenicia of Syria, finds him and begins begging: “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is badly demonized.” Jesus, however, does not say a word in reply. Eventually, his disciples tell Jesus: “Send her away; because she keeps crying out after us.” Explaining his reason for ignoring her, Jesus says: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” However, the woman does not give up. She approaches Jesus and prostrates herself before him. She pleads, “Lord, help me!” How Jesus' heart must be moved by the woman's earnest appeal! Yet, he again points to his first responsibility, to minister to God's people of Israel. At the same time, apparently to test her faith, he draws on the Jews' prejudiced view of those of other nationalities, arguing: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to little dogs.” By his compassionate tone of voice and facial expression, Jesus surely reveals his own tender feelings toward non-Jews. He even softens the comparison of Gentiles to dogs by referring to them as “little dogs,” or puppies. Rather than take offense, the woman picks up on Jesus' reference to Jewish prejudices and makes the humble observation: “Yes, Lord; but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.” “O woman, great is your faith,” Jesus replies. “Let it happen to you as you wish.” And it does! When she returns to her home, she finds her daughter on the bed, completely healed.", 9267, "Hc1yv8VCaa", -1],

	87566 : ["Who is this man? Well here he is: Epicurus (Greek: Ἐπίκουρος, Epikouros, \"ally, comrade\"; 341 BC – 270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and the founder of the school of philosophy called Epicureanism. Only a few fragments and letters remain of Epicurus's 300 written works. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators. For Epicurus, the purpose of philosophy was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia, peace and freedom from fear, and aponia, the absence of pain, and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil, that death is the end of the body and the soul and should therefore not be feared, that the gods do not reward or punish humans, that the universe is infinite and eternal, and that events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space. The big problem is he doesn't know God. god wants evil to exist so we have a choice for one reason.  Isaiah 45:7, \"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\" So it is a little more complicated than Epicurus could imagine", 9265, "50y7V83Aaa", 0],

We won't kill, oppress, enslave, steal, lie, slander or gossip.

	87586 : ["Did God have a beginning? Ps. 90:2: “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” Is that reasonable? Our minds cannot fully comprehend it. But that is not a sound reason for rejecting it. Consider examples: (1) Time. No one can point to a certain moment as the beginning of time. And it is a fact that, even though our lives end, time does not. We do not reject the idea of time because there are aspects of it that we do not fully comprehend. Rather, we regulate our lives by it. (2) Space. Astronomers find no beginning or end to space. The farther they probe into the universe, the more there is. They do not reject what the evidence shows; many refer to space as being infinite. The same principle applies to the existence of God. Other examples: (1) Astronomers tell us that the heat of the sun at its core is 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000° C.). Do we reject that idea because we cannot fully comprehend such intense heat? (2) They tell us that the size of our Milky Way is so great that a beam of light traveling at over 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km/sec) would require 100,000 years to cross it. Do our minds really comprehend such a distance? Yet we accept it because scientific evidence supports it. Which is more reasonable—that the universe is the product of a living, intelligent Creator? or that it must have arisen simply by chance from a nonliving source without intelligent direction? Some persons adopt the latter viewpoint because to believe otherwise would mean that they would have to acknowledge the existence of a Creator whose qualities they cannot fully comprehend. But it is well known that scientists do not fully comprehend the functioning of the genes that are within living cells and that determine how these cells will grow. Nor do they fully understand the functioning of the human brain. Yet, who would deny that these exist? Should we really expect to understand everything about a Person who is so great that he could bring into existence the universe, with all its intricate design and stupendous size? Is it important to use God's name? Rom. 10:13: “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.” Ezek. 39:6: “People will have to know that I am Jehovah.” Jesus said to his Father: “I have made your name known to them [his true followers] and will make it known.”—John 17:26.

I don't know whether this is the answer you seek, but it was a different way for me to look at this.  First, it was the woman with the issue of blood in Mark 5.  She had a flow of blood for twelve years when she went to Jesus to be healed....but there was so much more than physical affliction she had suffered when she came to Him that day. I started thinking about the condition of this woman's life.  According to Leviticus 15, she would have been declared ceremonially unclean by the strict stipulations of the law.  In many ways her affliction was comparable to being a leper - she would have been an outcast, not able to take part in religious observances or be allowed to have public contact lest she defile someone.  If she had a husband or family to speak of, this condition would have separated her from them as well.  She had even submitted herself to the physicians of the day (whether these would have been Jewish or Greek is uncertain - under Mosaic law healing was accomplished by going to the temple priest to be examined, and for sacrifice and atonement, so these may have been Gentile physicians who tried to help her....if so she would have been even further despised, since Jews were not supposed to have dealings with Gentiles).  I'm not trying to form a doctrine there because I don't know for sure - but it was an interesting thought. Anyway, here was this woman who had suffered for twelve years, who had been outcast, unclean, and now rendered penniless who had no hope, no affiliations, no identity. But then \"He looked around to see her who had done this thing....\" She broke every law to be where she was, doing what she was when she pressed through the crowd to touch the hem of Christ's garment.....yet the moment she touched it, she was made clean and whole.  She was healed, and she instantly knew it.  Yet because of what she had done in breaking the law, she hid herself from Him in fear and trembling.....but of course, none of us can hide ourselves from Him.  He turned to see her, and in making her known before the crowd, He secured her testimony and the proof of her cleansing before others.   More importantly, by calling her \"daughter\" Jesus not only acknowledged His own Deity before the crowd, but He restored her identity as a child of the Creator - she was not only healed physically, but she was recognized and restored as a daughter of the Most High.  In effect, He was returning her to society - releasing her from the unbearably exacting requirements of the law, even though in acting out her faith, she had broken that law. Now consider what He has done for us today.  Of course none of us can keep the law - that is why the law was given, to reveal our sinful condition and point us to Christ.  We have broken the law, yet we have been forgiven and every ordinance of the law removed from our account.  Like this woman, those who believe and reach out to Him in faith can be healed and made whole in every respect.....and just like her, those who believe have been given power to become children of God - sons and daughters in Him.  Through Christ, she was given a new identity that day, and we have been given a new identity in Him today. Again, I'm not sure if this is the answer you seek, but I so appreciate your question.  It made me reconsider these Scriptures prayerfully and examine more closely what had actually happened here.  It was something I had never thought of before, and I thank you for helping me to consider such things now. God bless you brother!

	87609 : ["The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic. Everything must have a creator for creation to exist. \"Who made God?\" can't be answered feel justified in denying that God exist. But the question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, \"Does space have an end?\" Obviously, it doesn't. If there is a brick wall with \"The end\" written on it, the question arises, \"What is behind that wall?\" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe, have faith, that space has no beginning and no end. He is eternal. The Bible informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected. Second Timothy 1:9 says, \"[God] who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.\" Another example, Titus 1:2 says, \"...in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.\" It even tells us one day time will no longer exist. That will be known as eternity. God himself dwells outside of the dimension He created. He dwells inside eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came it came into being. He can move trough time as a man flips through a history book. Because we live in the realm of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God's eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and and, by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrum. Some atheist claim that if God can be infinite, the the universe can also be without a beginning. The illogical presumption here is that the universe has an intelligence in and of itself, because intelligence is required to carry out the order we call creation. If that is correct, the only logical conclusion would be that the universe somehow has the ability to think and to create from nothing. But then we would be describing God. So, in essence, some atheist are presuming the universe is God, or Creator. That can only cause us to conclude the obvious: Some are quite willing to accept that there is some kind of God, creative intelligence, but just don't like the God of the Bible, or any God who has a moral code and condemns those who violate it.", 9266, "wB3AbJyLaa", 0],
	87610 : ["Since you want to rely on a popular science \"authority,\" I heard Sagan say once \"The universe evolved consciousness in order to look at itself,\" as though the universe was in infinite entity, but he didn't say why or even posit the question of why is it doing this, because, like you, he was avoiding the probability of God. The issue isn't whether God exists and if He does then who created Him, and because of that logical fallacy, then why not the universe always existing. The issue is why would and how did matter evolve life. Science also believes the universe had a beginning from the big bang, which you conveniently left from your argument, so they also must believe, logically, that the universe must have an end. What you're doing is saying that the belief in God is illogical to you and that you believe in science's narrow and illogical belief in Darwin. You can believe what you want, but it's only that, a belief, no different than the belief in God. What you're not answering still is how and why is there space, matter and energy, and how could and why would mindless and purposeless matter evolve into living forms of individual “beings” with self-centered egos that they identify with and then struggle to survive and procreate? Life and evolution of humans couldn't have happened by random chance, even over an infinite amount of time, because there is no cause for matter to do that, not unless there is a designer and a purpose for it.", 9266, "WSqwHUskaa", 0],
