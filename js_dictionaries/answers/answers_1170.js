The sheet music attempt was a religious exercise to mimic Mozart's spirit and beauty that is unique to a man who has since passed by.  Though it may be true that some pianist could play better then Mozart-today, I bet the true-muscial-ear could distinguish Mozart's-identity with those of imposter's; wether they so-called 'improved' or 'hacked' his style.

If the adherent is gay, it is fair to suppose that their delusions feature gay extraterrestials.

	64009 : ["To be fair, there is a gross difference between flat earthers and theists. In case of flat earthers, they flat out (pun intended) deny science, because it has been proven over and over that the earth is indeed spherical. It doesn't just have to do with a few pictures that people managed to take from space, it's all about calculations that have been made with the math and physics backing up the theory.  But when it comes to God, science still has nothing in its hands. At this point, it still can't prove nor disprove the existence of God, so science literally has nothing to say about God. I've talked to some atheists here, and found out that although some mock God and the concept of God, they just don't have any reason to believe in God, which is fine and respectable in my opinion. But those atheists who flat out claim that science has proven that God doesn't exist are no better than the flat earthers, because they are DENYING the fact that science still has no say about God, at least not yet. Those atheists are the liars and the hypocrites in my opinion, because although they do follow science, they are also adding to it and crediting it with things that it still didn't even begin to do. EDIT: Oh, forgot to answer the other two questions. Global warming (may it be a natural cycle or not) is real. There is a lot of evidence that suggests pollution being responsible for global warming, and given that the climate change is evident all around us, you'd have to wake up pretty early in the morning to deny completely that humans had anything to do with it. To be fair, I think it's just an excuse for humans to be sloppy and lazy when it comes to taking care of nature and our environment.  About creationism and evolution, let me tell you: I am a creationist, but it doesn't mean I deny evolution. I admit, I did before, but only because I hadn't realized the credibility of it to even be considered a scientific theory (which is as best as you can get in science). The thing is that when it comes to religion and science, I tend to separate both as much as possible whilst still believing in both. The reason? Well, let's be honest. Science has given us so many answers, yet we still have to answer many many MANY MORE questions. If we know less than 1% of the knowledge that the universe has to give us, how can we be so impatient as to answer questions that relate to what or who created the universe (for example)? Or how humans evolved? Yes, science has some answers about these things, which after numerous testing have proved to be theories. But with so many yet so few answers, would you dare to say that respective to what with know today, those answers that we have are definitive answers, even if they are scientific theories themselves?", 8226, "uuDslcoOaa", 3],

Eventually they brought the dessert and I was asked once again   if I'd like to eat some now that I was able to see what it was. I declined once more, declared what they had brought was not chocolate mousse because chocolate mousse was a moose's head covered in chocolate.  I  wasn't just presented evidence. I saw the real thing and declared that it wasn't the real thing because it didn't fit my personal perception.   It doesn't matter how many times someone is presented with evidence of anything.

	64013 : ["Yes, and the difference between circle and a sphere. I am an atheist and I say categorically:  The Bible does not say that the Earth is flat. But, everything that The Bible says about the physical structure of the Earth makes it plain that the people writing those passages believed that the Earth was flat. You give a couple of examples and there are others I have read but can't remember well enough to quote. The phrase, “the four corners of the Earth” is indeed a figure of speech - when people use it today no one assumes the speaker means the phrase literally. There are many figures if speech in The Bible (“Gave up the ghost” being another one) but they were NOT figures of speech before being used in The Bible.  When the people  translated scriptures into English the phrase, “the four corners of the Earth” was used literally. I do NOT believe that in the original Greek or Hebrew (or whatever language was used) a comparable phrase was a common figure of speech and that whoever wrote this text originally chose to write informally and use it. Of course The Bible suggests that the Earth is flat - that's what people believed at the time.

	64014 : ["Sure. Are you aware of the difference between a circle and a ball? The Hebrew word Chug (חוג), used in Isaiah 40:22 means a flat-circle like a coin. The Hebrew word for a sphere like a ball is Dur (דור). The author is clearly aware of the difference. In Isaiah 22:18 \"He will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you...\" Here, Dur is used to clearly indicate a ball. Isa 44:13 also uses mechugah. This term refers to a \"circle instrument,\" a tool used to make a circle, what we call a compass used by a carpenter. So, the wording of \"circle of the earth\" in the original Hebrew seems to indicate a circle like a coin, not like a sphere.", 8228, "8l20dIRXaa", 0],

	64026 : ["I would say that atheists are more likely to accept \"good\" reasoning of the evidence, whereas theists are more reluctant to accept \"better\" reasoning than their own. The Cosmological Argument is very appealing to Christian apologists because they can insert their God as a cause while ignoring natural causes. The reason the argument fails is because it only gets you to anything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist, thus has a cause. While theists can speculate about Gods being a cause, we already have a natural solution to the first cause. Since energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, it is uncaused, has no beginning and no end. Furthermore since all energy can do is \"convert\" into other forms of energy, the Big Bang is nothing more than an energy conversion from the Cosmos (all that exists) that cannot have a cause since energy cannot have a cause. One could argue that the universe always existed in some form before the conversion (Big Bang). If all we are really looking at is energy in different forms, it would be like saying ice began to exist at 32 degrees F, where it is apparent the material/energy for ice was already there. This changes the Cosmological argument from began to exist to \"converted\" into a new form of existence. While there is certainly a \"cause\" for the conversion, we have plenty of evidence to support \"natural\" conversions and none for magical Being conversions. Another problem that the Cosmological argument cannot get around is the natural order of complexity. Energy goes through steps and conversions over time to turn simple blocks/forces into more complex blocks/forces. In other words, all complex existence can be traced back to simpler beginnings because the natural order is necessary and cannot be avoided. This makes starting with a complex cause (God) literally impossible. The simplest building block is energy itself that is found in \"all\" existence no matter how complex and more importantly to this discussion, how simple that existence may be. Matter is just one of many forms of energy, where all matter is energy but not all energy is matter, where light is just one example of mass-less energy. You will not be able to refute my better arguments and yet being a theist, you will not accept my better reasoning because it absolutely refutes the conclusion you desire.

	64038 : ["Interesting point. I'd say it's because we hold our opinions not because we're actually seeking truth, but because we don't seek truth. Many view what they view due to an inherent hate or dislike of others. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, while himself a skeptic and scientist, believed strongly in spiritualism. He wrote books about it, defended it, argued for it, and called anyone who didn't believe in it brainwashed. Meanwhile, Christians didn't. So it's not necessarily about what your views are, but why you hold those views. You can be as logical and scientific as you want and still hold to some pretty crazy views like spiritual possession and mediums talking to the dead. On the other hand, you can be quite level headed and hold common sense views even if you're not scientific.  It just depends on the person. I don't know of any Creationist who says evolution is 'beyond' God's power, as that would mean God Isn't omnipotent. They may just reject it, saying God didn't need evolution, but to say God couldn't do evolution is to mean that God Isn't all powerful, which is against Christianity.  I agree that if you talk about this magical essence that can do basically anything that it gets a bit murky especially if you try to reconcile it with the modern scientific method. Atheists say that Christians like to say \"God did it!\" without offering scientific explanation, but isn't that the same as saying \"quantum fluctuations did it!\" without offering exact details? Sure, God did it. Sure, God did it through quantum fluctuations. Now, can those who claim to hold their views based on science actually show some of that scientific method playing out?", 8232, "Gb2RPE04aa", -2],
