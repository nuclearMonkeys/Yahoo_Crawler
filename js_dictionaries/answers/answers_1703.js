Don't know...call your vet right away, and see if (s)he would be willing to make a house call. This could be normal, or it could be that they are the runts of the litter and she knows she doesn't have enough milk. In any case, I do agree that you should try to bring mom and pups into a better location, such as a basement or garage. Set her up with a secure and warm location and materials she can \"nest\" with. This will also make it easier on her and you to feed the pups and keep them clean. Now, given that she had 12 pups...have her spayed once the litter is weaned.

Example - If she has 8 nipples & 12 pups - do the math.  And FYI, do not use Human milk.  Goat's milk is a reasonable substitute. Mom's food should be increased and likely supplemented, so she can keep production up, and stay healthy. Best place for Mom is indoors in a secluded area, where you can monitor.

If it's the same 2, there's probably something wrong with them, and she knows it.  Either way, I'd have had her whelp in the house, in a whelping box, where I could supervise and take care of any problems that arise. Research is a beautiful thing.  Those pups didn't ask to be brought in this world, you allowed it, and you are responsible for whether they live or die. It's quite a responsibility. That's why research and a mentor are so necessary. How else are you to know how to handle such situations as this? I provided stud service once. I then went and helped with the birth. The dam didn't want those pups. It was obvious as she roughly shoved the first into the corner, and proceeded to try to bury it in the newspaper. She wasn't at all gentle and refused to clean them up. You could see it in her eyes that she was dismayed and trying to hide the mess she thought she was in. Her owner thought perhaps she was trying to keep them warm. Her owner was wrong. The dog didn't want the pups and was refusing to care for them. I had to clean them up. We then had to sit with her for the next few hours lavishing her with praise for a job well done, until finally she was happy to care for them. She did turn out to be a good mother, once she got over her initial upset. You're probably going to need some formula to make sure those pups get the nutrition they need, as it sounds like she is rejecting them.", 9373, "4sjW4Ig5aa", 0],

If she persists then make the outside area where she is taking them draughtproof , warm and comfortable but leave Mum  and pups alone to themselves - she might need help in feeding them  and you might notice that some of them are not gaining weight in which case you might have to hand bottle feed them.    After all this is over get dog spayed - 12  pups is a lot to handle for one dog but if she can cope then let her alone but keep a distant eye on all      Have just read your question  again - Dog House?  where is it and did you prepare it  for the birth.

See...depending on the reason, it makes a huge difference.  1) if she wanted nicer things but she couldn't afford it. If you get her something nice, she will appreciate it.  2) If she thinks that walmart purses look pretty enough and doesn't need to buy brand name purses, just respect her opinion. She is happy. She may be happy the fact that you gave her a nice present and she appreciate the fact that you got her a present. But if you keep telling her that off-brand materials suck, she may find you annoying.  3) I hope you understand that a lot of cheap goods are as good as the expensive goods. Walmart's $5 movie is the same as $20 movie at the blockbuster. $1 hairbrush is the same as $10 hairbrush you see at some fancy store. But also, it is true some of the items depends on the price. $20, 000 cars tend to be better in quality than $1000 car. What about clothes? What about shoes? What about jewelry? What about electronics? That all comes to your ability and opinion to shop and people have different preferences. For instance, you like to buy few quality items that last. Some people rather buy more less quality items. Make sure you know what she wants.  4) if she thinks she is not worthy of nicer stuff, you need to help her realize it is not true or make sure she gets some help.

I've also met guys that have no money and are crude, and just have a snarky attitude towards people that actually do invest in good quality items.

I see your point and it is very dangerous. Young love can do some crazy things. I would talk to the GF and let her know what people will think. I would talk to him even if it will fail.
