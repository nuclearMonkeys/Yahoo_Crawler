It worked well, but it isn't the best when it comes to how often to change it and smell (although it doesn't smell as bad as Aspen, which is better than both Pine and Cedar, by the way!) Carefresh is great, but pretty pricey. You can find other paper beddings that are quite similar to Carefresh, but Carefresh is, perhaps, the best way to go. If you are getting mice, soft Aspen shavings, or paper bedding, are both good. Good luck! P.S. 100,000 mice?! Now that's a scary thought...", 8362, "IoOKEveHaa", 0],

It's good that these things have come out now so you can both deal with them and then put them to rest. Bury them, it's in her past. If she is treating you good and giving you what you need then you should not be holding those things against her. We have all got skeletons in our closet. You should have mercy and allow her to escape her past and find fulfillment in her present being married to a decent guy like you. If you allow your imagination to get the best of you, don't blame her. Hopefully, all that mess is in her past and will rest in peace there. Please stop bringing it up. If you truly love her, forgive her for what she did before you. Love overcomes a multitude of sins and love can restore her. She may turn out to be the best wife ever seeing how much her husband loves her. Forgiveness can do this for you. Forgive her and get those false images out of your mind because she was a girl.

Plus the vaccine has not been around long enough for us to know how long it makes you immune.  Your body will stop making the antibody after a certain length of time.  Again, that vary with every individual.  Some may be protected for months, others only days.", 8367, "AA11622701", -2],
