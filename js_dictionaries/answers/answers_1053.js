The feminist double standard is at full play here where they expect men to bow down to feminist equality where they (the men) had traditional privilege in the past.  But that women keep all their female traditional privileges when it comes to everything else ... such has keeping their higher sexual value to the point where only men can be considered rapists while women are victims of men for any slight against their sexuality.  No equality here folks! .", 8054, "aSm9xSn3aa", 2],

The problem isn't that people didn't take it to court, but that no one in government cares that the court ruled against leaving women out of selective service. Answer:  Because the rest of government has no desire to comply with the ruling. Or in other words, a ruling doesn't have any enforcement power nor does it by itself change a law. In order for women to be forced to sign up for the draft congress needs to change the law and congress is not open to it.  What this shows is that women in the military are more about politics than need. Women in the military are like that kid that complains about being left out until everyone lets him join in.

That example is what \"privilege\" actually means.  It's an exclusive advantage, granted by an authority, and made available to everyone in that one group, while being denied to all others.  And there are many more of those female privileges here in the US as well as most other nations of the first world that exist today.  At the same time, any type of discrimination that would favour men has long ago been made illegal under anti-sexism laws that only protect women, not men.
