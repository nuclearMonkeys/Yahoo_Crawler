Sci fi is at it's best when it uses the fantastic to reflect back on real life or the human condition.  Star Trek indulged in a form of this where it imagined modern society with some major difference - like the Nazis won WW2 or the Roman Empire was still a thing or it was a planet of gangsters.   None of these made sense in the show because Star Trek wasn't exploring parallel universes (like say, Sliders 3 decades later).  But sci fi was less concerned with logical plausibility back then, and more about playing with ideas.  So we tend to forgive it when we wouldn't in modern works.", 3606, "3Cd8Iq5gaa", 4],

	22305 : ["Recently in the current Superman comic book, he announced to the world that he was also Clark Kent.  As it turned out, this did not surprise Jimmy Olsen one bit. As he told Superman 'There were only two people in the world who called me -Jim-, and then I realized that those two people were the same one person.'  By this point, Lois knew, as she was married to Superman.  The aspect that some have missed in this is that Superman not wearing a mask in it's own way suggested to most people that he had no other identity. It's not like he gave interviews where he said that he had one.  So, by that aspect, most people would not stop to think that he had any such disguised human identity, and so, when seeing Clark, would not connect him to Superman in terms of being the same person.  Yeah, small masks like Robin's are not very effective. But, many of the characters wearing them don't have secret identities where their civilian identity is known outside a small group of friends and acquaintances.  There's a great scene from a Justice League Unlimited episode where The Flash, at that time, Wally West, accidentally triggers a super villain device, and it switches his mind with that of Lex Luthor's. So now, they're inhabiting each other's bodies.  So Lex, in Wally body, which is in full Flash costume, figures that all he has to do is take off the mask and look at the face. He does this, and looks in a mirror and then has no idea who the face he is seeing belongs to. Because Wally is in no way famous.", 3608, "BZnWmkofaa", 2],

	22323 : ["Here's the thing. Especially at your age, you should be WIDENING your horizons, including in entertainment.  There are lots of shows that include romantic elements, but come at them from very different directions. And, romance doesn't always have to mean romantic relationship stuff, but the emotions of loving people because they are simply good people.  One of the best overall character role models I've ever seen is The Doctor. As in Doctor Who, a series which ran from 1963 to 1989, came back with a movie in 1995, and back as a well funded series in 2005 and continues to this day.  And, he has all sorts of romantic in the classical sense connections.
