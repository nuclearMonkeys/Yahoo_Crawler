I think back on the ones I did date. They came in all types, colors, shapes. People can become more attractive through their \"mentality\" and people can become less attractive through their \"mentality\". I am definitely more of a personality type of a person. If a person does not have a personality that I can enjoy being around, it DOES NOT MATTER how good looking they are or what type they are - they would be passed over by me for marriage material.  That is not to say I could not be a friend.", 8937, "JZxZ8mKRaa", 2],
	78299 : ["LOL, see my answer to part 1. In addition, being honest about it is just being fair to the other person.  Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth (about anything), but in the long run, \"telling it like it is\" is the best policy.  It avoids misunderstandings and heartburn (and heartache) later. This is not so much a religious view as an opinion based on the experience of a regular guy.", 8937, "FZM15NXtaa", 2],
	78300 : ["It is not necessarily rude to do that. Often HOW one says something is more important than WHAT one says. It is not rude to tell someone in a nice way that you're not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with them. Therefore it cannot be rude to mention qualities that the person does not have. You can preface your answer by saying something like: 'These are MY PERSONAL preferences, which Im sure differs from that of MANY OTHERS..\". By doing this you are in effect suggesting that your view is subjective and should not be viewed as an objective standard of physical attractiveness. The majority of people might not agree with your standards and would thus consider the one asking as being physically attractive. This way you don't 'put down' the person.", 8937, "4kgESJlEaa", 3],
	78301 : ["I think these are all questions you should ask your doctor or nurse practiioner. If you've been informed about inducing at all, it's a synthetic drip of the homone pitosen. Most women have enough of this hormone naturally, which is what initiates the whole process of labor, including softening and dilation of the cervix, etc.  Since it sounds like they need you to deliver ahead of the 40 week schedule, you'll need a little help getting labor started. They will start the IV drip solution and closely monitor your vitals, as well as the baby's.  You'll be taken care of and so will your baby.  Congratulations! :)", 8941, "KeTbhfeOaa", 0],
	78302 : ["I'm only 28 weeks and I've gotten them already. It feels like cramping and releasing. It's hard to explain... but if you ever do get BH, drink A LOT of water, and they should stop.

	78308 : ["Hi, Vot!! Great question.  Well, I think you are not being rude, you are just saying the truth.  Well, when it comes to the physical aspect, I usually am not too demanding.  BUT, in case someone asks me, I will say the truth, even if the person does not have those things.  I prefer to be completely honest, if you want a relationship to work out, you must be honest to start with.  BUT, to not make the person feel bad, I would as well include things that the person has that I like too.  BUT, always be Honest!! I think it has to do with the way I was raised.  I can sometimes come off as too direct, but that is just me being honest!", 8937, "bbHoF5jsaa", 4],

I am living with a large, heavy, blonde that Katy Price would choose from a catalogue. She is breathtakingly clever, though. I learned a long time ago that physical type is almost irrelevant in determining the quality of a relationship.

	78310 : ["I was induced at 36 weeks due to preeclampsia as well.  First I was given a medication called Cervadil to try and soften my cervix.  This was at approx 4pm on a Friday.  The contractions were quite intense throughout the night.  I didn't want any medication but finally got some to relax enough to try and sleep a couple of hours.  Cervadil was removed 12 hours later.  I still had not dilated.  Took a jacuzzi bath (in the birthing suite) and my water broke at 8 am on Saturday.  I got an epidural around 10 am but I never dilated past 6 or 7 cm.  I had to have an emergency c section at 7 pm.  So it was a long experience.  Also, I had to be on a medication called magnesium sulfate because of my blood pressure.  It prevents seizures.  It makes you feel like you are having an out of body experience, not in a good way!  I hope all goes smoothly for you.  You can ask the neonatal nurses to come and speak with you about what to expect for your baby, being early.  Good luck and hope all goes well.", 8941, "q51cevqLaa", 0],

	78319 : ["Sir? When knights are knighted, don't they get a Sir in front of their name? Are you going to have your child knighted? That's strange to me, I've never heard of anyone wanting a Sir in front of their child's name. Compromise: Name him after his father, but explain to the father you do not want the Sir in front of the name. In my opinion, that should be something your son should decide if he wants when he's older. What if he doesn't feel comfortable with it at all when he's a little boy? You don't want him to be stuck with it forever. People might think he's pretentious later on in life, because Sir has that \"better-than-thou\" feel to it.", 8943, "None", 1],

	78322 : ["The time varies for each person. It will most likely take all day. They will use a gel or a little pill to soften your cervix. They insert it up against your cervix. You will walk a lot . You will be on an I.V. and they will give you pitocin (the lab version of the natural oxytocin that causes contractions). Once the contractions are coming regularly and you are dilated to about 4cm they will break your water. This will make the contractions hurt more. If you want pain meds such as an epidural, now would be a good time to say so. Eventually you will dilate to 10cm and deliver. If you don't dilate fast enough after they break your water they may do a c-section for the safety of your baby. Good Luck!", 8941, "MRSFbuMhaa", 0],
	78323 : ["They will get you in the delivery room and hooked up to an IV then they will give you pitocin to start you labor and possibly break your water then you should progress just like regular labor but you will also be constantly hooked to a blood pressure cuff and your vitals should be taken every hour or so to make sure you don't spike.

I've been watching since BB2 and I'm always wrong with my early predictions lol I'll say that Shane and Frank are the biggest physical threats but they will be targets because of that. Ian has an almost photographic memory so he should do very very well in certain competitions. Usually people like Ashley who is sweet and very likeable can fly under the radar until the end but get ousted when it gets down to the final 4 or 5.

Backdooring Frank might be a good game move for Janelle, but as for Shane - I think this could have been the worst move for him. The newbies are gonna be so mad they evict Frank (because as for now it seems like Frank will be leaving), because then it will just be Shane, and the weak players against the coaches.

	78332 : ["I would ask your doctor or just call and ask to talk to one of the nurses to be sure it's fine for you.  I've heard that nursing a baby is the best/fastest trick to losing weight after childbirth but it's not always possible for everyone.  It can burn 600+ calories daily.  I would stick with light walking, and then try hitting some of the major calorie burners like squats and lunges - you could do these in your own home.  Just hold a weight plate across your chest and do squats, or hold a dumbell or anything that has some weight to it next to your sides and do some lunges.  This will work the quads, glutes and hamstrings and burn major calories.", 8938, "fkde36j8aa", 1],

	78339 : ["The Process of Labor      It is most important that you trust your body when you go into labor. Remember, your body was built to carry, nourish, and safely deliver your baby. Some of the factors that affect the course of labor include your health, nutrition, size and shape of your pelvis, size and presentation of the baby, your educational preparation for labor and birth, and the practice of exercises, relaxation and breathing techniques. During labor, the emotional support you receive, along with medical interventions, may also affects the course of labor. How Do I Know When Labor Will Begin? Each labor is unique. No one can predict exactly what your individual labor will be like, or when it may begin. However, prior to the onset of labor, you will notice some signs that are nature's way of telling you that labor is approaching. If you are not sure, call your physician or midwife to discuss your labor signs. In the event you are evaluated at the hospital as being in very early labor and sent home, it is common to feel disappointed, maybe even embarrassed. It is common for first-time mothers to make more than one trip to the hospital. If you are in early labor and sent home, the following may be helpful: walking, showering, resting, drinking fluids, renting a video, listening to music, etc. The most common signs that labor may soon begin include:     * The baby \"drops\" or engages into the pelvis, which is called lightening. Lightening may occur two to four weeks prior to labor in first-time mothers and often not until labor begins if you have previously had children.     *  Your abdomen usually appears lower and more protruding.     * You may experience a greater ease in breathing, relief from heartburn and an ability to eat larger portions.     *  However, the lower position of the baby together with its greater size, can lead to:           o Increased backache and sacroiliac discomfort           o Increased awkwardness in walking           o Increased frequency of urination     * Frequent bowel movements may be experienced within 48 hours of labor, cleansing the lower bowel in preparation for birth.     *  Diarrhea or flu like symptoms without fever. Indigestion, nausea, or vomiting are common a day or so before labor begins.     * Increased vaginal discharge during the last few weeks of pregnancy as the body prepares for the passage of the baby through the birth canal.     *  Increased Braxton-Hicks contractions during the last weeks of pregnancy, which are \"practice\" contractions that prepare the uterus for labor and may cause some effacement and dilation (thinning and opening) of the cervix. These contractions do not ordinarily cause pain but may be sufficiently strong and regular to be confused with true labor. This is referred to as false labor.     *  Possible \"bloody show\" or the release of slightly brown, pink or blood-tinged mucus from effacement and dilation (the thinning and opening) of the cervix, causing the mucus plug to be released from the cervix.     *  Some women notice a sudden burst of energy, sometimes called a \"nesting instinct\" approximately 24-48 hours before the start of labor. You may feel a strong desire to clean the house and prepare for the baby. Try not to tire yourself as nature gives you this extra energy to help you during labor. If you must be active, be careful not to overexert yourself!     *  A loss or leveling off in weight may be noticed in the last few days before labor begins. It is common to lose 1-3 pounds of fluid before labor begins as a result of hormonal shifts.     * Mother just feels \"different,\" not quite herself.     * The bag of water may break. Depending on the location of the break in the amniotic sac, the break can feel like a gush, or an uncontrolled trickle of fluid coming from the vagina. Anxiety and disappointment are very common feelings for mothers as the \"due date\" approaches or passes without labor beginning.
