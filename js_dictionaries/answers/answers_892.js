	49678 : ["You're right.  For you, and specifically you, a DSLR/mirrorless camera is probably a waste of money since you're already happy with what you've got.  If you want to make better images and go well beyond the snapshot, you really do need to get a DSLR or mirrorless.  Why?  Because a point-and-shoot doesn't have the capability to control the focus or the exposure which is what one needs to make a photo as opposed to taking a snapshot. Furthermore, DSLRs and mirrorless cameras have far better sensors and lenses allowing for more control in a larger variety of shooting situations.  There are tons of situations where a point-and-shoot camera simply cannot be used such as indoor sports, night time sports, macro, etc... P&S cameras have significantly smaller sensors which produce inferior image quality when compared to a larger sensor.  Specifically the difference is most noticeable in the amount of noise and dynamic range.  Again, if all you're doing are taking snapshots and only posting to the web, you probably don't need anything better than what you've got. But there are a lot of people who want and/or really do need better image quality, better control and better accessories than what even a high-end P&S can offer. It boils down to your expectations and needs.  If what you've got is meeting your needs and expectations, then you don't need anything better.  For me and a lot of people, I would not use a point-and-shoot for serious photos, even a high-end one like a Sony RX-100.", 6982, "OczpbeMdaa", 3],

SOME BACK STORY ABOUT MINOLTA: I used to work at a camera shop in the 90s and without question the Minolta was the worst SLR.  Minolta Maxxums were awful for two main reasons: their AF system and reliability. In the late 80s and early 90s, all SLRs were designed so that the only way to activate the autofocusing system was to press the shutter button half way.  This was problematic for any scene where the subject was off center.  It was Canon who introduced an SLR where it had a rear AF button.  Today a rear AF button is ubiquitous among DSLRs, but back then it was a major reason for professionals to switch from Nikon to Canon.  Eventually Nikon put that feature on their Lenses and finally on their bodies, but the damage had already been done and the vast majority of pros had made the \"switch.\"  However for some inexplicable reason Minolta didn't, and this really hurt their sales and reputation.  Taking a shot with a Minolta where the subject was off center meant having to press the shutter button half way, recompose and take the shot.  You had to do this each and every time unless you put the camera into manual focus mode.  The Minolta rep, a real nice guy, took me and others out to the zoo to use Minolta gear.  He had their flagship bodies and lenses.  I tried to use a 300mm f/2.8 and a top body to photograph a tiger.  The poorly designed AF system made using a Minolta Maxxum a real pain the @ss.  As bad as the AF system was, the real Achilles heel was found on all the Maxxums with a plastic lens mount.  Minolta designed the way their SLRs would control the aperture by means of a flat metal ring with a tab that would match up with a tab on the rear of the lens.  The body would turn the ring which would move the tabs which would open up the aperture to whatever position it needed.  Problem was that the ring inside the body was held in place by four small, cheap plastic pins.  These pins broke at an alarming rate making it impossible to use the body.  Once in the camera shop we had a guy bringing in a Minolta Maxxum for repairs, one guy picking up a Minolta that had been repaired and another guy buying a replacement Minolta all at the same time and their SLRs were all broken for the same reason: the aperture ring had failed. How there was never a class action law suit against Minolta, I don't know.  I should point out that Minolta Maxxums with a metal lens mount didn't have this problem. So if you want to get a Minolta Maxxum look at their Maxxum 7 or 9.", 6995, "OczpbeMdaa", 2],
