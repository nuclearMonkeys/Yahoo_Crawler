They understand that taxes are the price we pay for living in a civil society.  They care about the Earth and the effects humans and industrialized society are having on her.  They want the playing field to be equal for everybody so that everyone has a chance at the American dream.  They feel that health care should be a right and not a privilege.  They feel war should only be used as a last resort. As for conservatives, I'd rather not answer.  They can speak for themselves.", 9180, "286dda7a5c33446910c5a7bae51636b7aa", 4],

On top of that she wants too pattern it after the Canadian system where people have too wait for months for an appointment and they denie even establish treatment procedures as expiermental leaving people too die without established treatments for Canser and Heart Diesease.

Also make sure to install and run a good firewall. I recommend either comodo or firewall. Both of which are free to install and use.
