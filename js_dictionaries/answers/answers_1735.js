Tell them that you are divorcing because you had a bit of all the above. \"Daddy & I could not resolve our differences & our feelings changed about each other & daddy felt love for another person as well\". No blame, just the facts. Tell them that this kind of thing happens to thousands & millions of children & that everything will work out fine, it'll just be different.

Why couldn't he file for divorce before he got involved with other woman, this I never understand.  Do men not owe their wives that much, after having their kids and giving up so much to do that, do they not owe the respect but instead think with their penis and just cheat. I understand marriages break down but people should separate first before get involved with someone else or else be strong and resist temptation as made a committment.

	92456 : ["Building muscle is a great healthy way to gain weight; try this out for building muscle. Eat regularly, if possible every three hours, when your body realises that it's getting a regular supply of food it increases it's metabolism, burning calories quicker and is much less likely to store calories as fat. When eating try to eat a lot of high protein foods and don't go too hard on the carbs. Try go easy on trans and saturated fats although you are allowed the odd treat. Drink lots of water! At least one gallon per day. Tea, coffee and fizzy drinks are O.K but they don' count towards your overall water intake. Vegetables are also very important they contain vital vitamins and antioxidants so include plenty of these in your diet. As for exercise I do some light weight training four days a week and cardiovascular (I use a rowing machine) two days a week with one days rest. There is a common belief that doing cardiovascular exercise on an empty stomach helps burn calories. This is absolute rubbish do not do it. Weight training is a good idea as muscle tissue burns a lot of energy, even while you sleep. You don't have to become Mr/Mrs universe but any fat tissue which you can convert to muscle tissue will not only make you look better but increase your metabolism. Getting plenty of sleep is also important when trying to build muscle. Good Luck", 9440, "srjrceTlaa", 0],

	92470 : ["I don't think that women are actually saying it's hard to find a man that cheats. Well, not all of them because surely some of them do mean that. But I think that the majority just has a skewed idea on what a good man is. So when women say that a good man is hard to find, I think they mean that the perfect man who will meet all of her standards and expectations, no matter how unrealistic and ridiculous they are, is hard to find. And in that case, it's the truth. Women want a specific type of man - an ideal man. But women won't come to terms with the fact that NO MAN will EVER meet every single desired quality. He'll have something more or lack something.  I think a good man is not afraid of commitment, is goal-oriented and responsible. A good man is stable and consistent and tells the truth even when it's inconvenient. A good man works, takes care of home, handles his business, and protects those that he loves with everything he has. A good man is flawed all the way across the board, but he doesn't make excuses for himself either.  Just because a man doesn't cheat, don't make him good. Azzholes are not good men. Insensitive and slobby men are horrible men. If he gets on your nerves, that's one thing. It happens. It's the warring of the sexes so nerve-wracking-ness is unavoidable. But a good man will definitely do everything in his power NOT to make you cry. A good man hates to see his woman cry and if he sees tears on her face, he's ready to go to war.

	92487 : ["Nothing wrong with going barefoot! Contrary to popular opinion, it's in fact very healthy, even on pavement and in public places that may not be totally clean.  Injuries are unlikely; feet get very tough very quickly. I've been barefoot for well over ten years, I go to all kinds of places with litter and broken glass, yet I get a tiny splinter maybe once a year and I've NEVER had a cut.  Germs aren't any serious concern either, our skin is made to keep pathogens out. Don't lick your feet or put them up on the dinner table and you have nothing to worry about. Nor is the cold a concern as long as you keep the rest of your body warm; cold affects us when our *core* temperature drops, not from bare feet. I used to be sickly all winter long, but all those years I've gone barefoot I've called in sick once (for two days, and it wasn't even in winter time). I really don't believe your mom got plantar fasciitis from going barefoot no matter what the doctor may say; I've never had a problem with that in my shod days or my barefoot days, but several barefooters I mail with had it and it's gotten BETTER from going barefoot and exercises, not insoles. I guess what may cause the idea that 'barefooting' causes pf is that it can be caused by wearing shoes without arch support but in a shoe without arch support your feet are still limited in their movement while not having any of the _benefits_ of being bare. Totally barefoot, your foot has full flexibility, even sidewalks provide stimulation to some extend. People also claim pf is caused by walking on hard surfaces but here's an excerpt from a study among people who've never worn shoes: \"One hundred and eighteen of those interviewed were rickshaw coolies. Because these men spend very long hours each day on cobblestone or other hard roads pulling their passengers at a run it was of particular interest to survey them. If anything, their feet were more perfect than the others. All of them, however, gave a history of much pain and swelling of the foot and ankle during the first few days of work as a rickshaw puller. But after either a rest of two days or a week's more work on their feet, the pain and swelling passed away and never returned again. There is no occupation more strenuous for the feet than trotting a rickshaw on hard pavement for many hours each day yet these men do it without pain or pathology.\" In the US, many people believe there are laws against going barefoot in public, but that is NOT true, regardless of whether food is served. Bare feet aren't any risk to stores or restaurants; germs don't fly off the soles of a bare foot any more than off the soles of a shoe, or off the exposed skin of a bare foot any more than off the exposed skin in a sandal. Some stores claim insurance policies require shoes but barefooters have called many companies and none had any policies requiring footwear for customers, nor has any manager claiming such a thing ever been able to show that clause. Stores can set their own dress codes, but if you shop around a bit you'll find places that don't care. Yes, people will comment about your barefooting, as they do about anything that is unusual, but I hope this answer and the material in the source will help you counter the worst kind of comments, which are usually based on ignorance about the risks rather than fact.", 9441, "dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa", 1],
