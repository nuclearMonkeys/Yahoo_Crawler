	131621 : ["Personally, I severely down play the whole sleep paralysis angel and in your case I don't think it holds at all.  It seems that we all quickly grab on to what seems like a rational explanation over a paranormal one.   Case in point, many \"rationalists\" say the Ouija board works of the ideomotor effect.  Which they claim is subconscious muscle movements (LOL).  This is how they \"rationally\" explain a phenomena due to the fact that their personal prejudices can not accept a paranormal view.  I have personally seen a shadow man like you have described but I was at the computer working and not asleep at all.  So shadow people are NOT a sleep paralysis issue.  They are a paranormal issue.  I believe they are demonic in nature. Check the list below and see how many items you have in common with the list. I start to get concerned with 3. 1) Abusive childhood or a traumatic experience between the ages of 2-15 yrs old.  (may have some amnesia of this trauma) 2) Issues with depression or anxiety  3) Suicidal thoughts. 4) Self harm (cutting, burning, hair pulling, hitting or biting ones self.) 5) Victim of sexual abuse. 6) Seeing ghosts 7) Possess spiritual abilities. (psychic, telekinetic, etc) 8) Frequent Nightmares 9) Sudden shift in emotions ( explosive anger that comes out of no where, tears for no reason, etc) 10) Occult or paranormal proclivities..

	131622 : ["Its called sleep paralysis, and a lot of people experience it  It sounds like your very sensitive to your sleep environment, and sleep times. So traveling around, especially to different time zones will throw off your sleep patterns and cause you to fall into sleep paralysis.  Sleep paralysis is a state in which your body falls asleep, but your mind wakes up. When you sleep you are paralyzed as you are during sleep paralysis. This is the bodies way to prevent you from acting out your dreams (also known as sleep walking or somnambulism). When you are stressed, or changes occur in sleep patterns, certain chemicals which aid in sleep transitions can become depleted, and your mind can wake up, while your body is still in a sleep state since the chemicals to signal waking up the body are depleted.  Good luck. Knowing whats really happening is half the battle when dealing with sleeping disorders. You might want to consider going to a sleep clinic. You will find your not nearly as alone as you think you are. edit: Pinetree - Thank you for pointing out that blindly believing in paranormal claims, superstitions and magical thinking is preferable to rational thought.", 11110, "None", 3],

	131630 : ["A dog that has lost a companion may show signs of emotional distress with a lack of appetite, aloof behavior, or even be demanding of attention and affection. We have to remember that when a living animal relates to another for a long period of time, they do develop relationships; they do create habits, routines, boundaries and even rules around each other. When suddenly one of the ‘partners' is no longer there, the dynamic changes. Good, safe, habits and routines create confidence, trust, certainty and familiarity with the world. Now with the death of a companion, it is like having to overcome an addiction of sorts, an ingrained habit that they find difficulty in losing. With some dogs, it can be extreme because they may have built a strong bond with the deceased partner. They have followed them, been guided by them, exercised with and been entertained by them. The world has revolved around the partner. Even dogs that are leaders can find themselves left with a feeling of loneliness, with no one to lead and no one to share with – they have lost the feeling of being wanted and part of a pack. We have to live for our living dog, and she needs help to see her through these times. In helping her, we do actually help ourselves. A calm, confident and kind hand while still maintaining boundaries and limitations with clear communication is essential.  Our job as a leader never stops. In fact this is what helps a dog through these times. They look for assurance, they look for confidence, they look for leadership to be able to deal with the unknown and they look initially to us to provide it. Your dog should not feel alone--she has you. Engage your dog in activities she enjoys--walks, retrieving, swimming, games. And while the thought may cross your mind, I suggest you do not rush out to replace your deceased dog. Wait a while; give your remaining dog a chance to become familiar with the situation. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that because she--and you--miss her old buddy a new one will be a perfect replacement. Some dogs not only become accustomed to being an only dog, but actually prefer it. So take the time and think it through. The loss of a dog is difficult for both you and your remaining dog or dogs, but you can be a support for one another, helping each other through these times and bringing you even closer.", 11109, "62Evzkqbaa", 3],

	131635 : ["Pro wrestling is a business.  To succeed in business you have to \"play well with others\", and that includes compromising your ideas, principals, and even your ethics at times.  Even \"sharks\" like Vince McMahon have had to do that.  Bullying your way through life only gets you so far; eventually you run into a meaner bully, or somebody so morally strong you can't buffalo him.  \"Nice guy\" promoters who tried to be ethical and fair with everybody got chewed up by the Vince McMahons of the wrestling business. That goes for the wrestlers, too.  I only know of one big-name big-time pro wrestler who did everything HIS way, making it to headliner of shows without playing politics.  He was a loner in the business, did not join cliques, never kissed anybody's butt, and told promoters to \"shove it\" if he didn't like what they wanted him to do.  Bruiser Brody.  Very few wrestlers liked working with Brody; promoters hated dealing with him (because they couldn't bully him or screw him over).  But Brody drew the fans in like few others of his time and the promoters made a lot of money with Brody headlining their shows.  So they hired him and pretty much let him do what he wanted; it was much easier than trying to force Brody to do what they wanted. One other wrestler fits that bill, too, but he wasn't a loner.  Andre The Giant.  Andre was beloved all over the world.  The boys liked him and promoters did, too.  But Andre was special, being 7 feet tall and a MAJOR draw.  He didn't need to kiss @ss and play politics.  Promoters everywhere knew what a valuable performer Andre was and they treated him right. But everybody else, from Dory Funk and Bruno Sammartino, to Dusty Rhodes and Harley Race, to Flair and Hogan, to Shawn Michaels and Sting, to Cena and Bobby Roode, have to play politics to various degrees.  There are only so many spots available at the top and to get those spots, talent and charisma alone isn't enough.  You have to be willing to compromise, to show the promotion you're a \"team player\" willing to take losses and occasionally look bad for the good of the storyline.  You have to get along with the locker room, especially the \"teacher's pets\", the guys with the promoter's ear.  And you have to be willing to do things (for the show) you don't want to do.  You have to show the promoter that you're willing to do ANYTHING to get a top spot.  If you don't, somebody else will, and you probably won't get that top spot. BQ:  No.  If the backstage dynamic changed (meaning no politics, no cliques, no butt kissing) it would change how management view their performers.  The backstage politics, as negative as they're made out to be, shows management that the performers are hungry and want \"promotions\", like in just about any job.  Workers who are hungry will put in more effort to be at their best and always striving to improve.  People who aren't hungry are viewed as complacent, satisfied with their lot in life, and even lazy.  Those people rarely, if ever, get promoted.  A locker room full of that type wouldn't be motivated to out-do each other, and the shows will suffer, becoming lackluster and boring with guys just going through the motions.  We'd have a wrestling business full of guys just going through the motions.", 11105, "1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa", 8],

	131640 : ["Okay I can see your point a bit, but really, it's just fiction.  And most of us, even at a really young age can separate fiction from reality.  Sure, they may wish for that kind of impossible romance or long for the life of the characters, but at the end of the day, it's FICTION and they know it.  They are aware that someone made it up.  Believe me, I am as much astounded by the stupidity and corruptibility of today's youth as you are, but you are reading WAAYYY too much into this (no pun intended).  If you are to say this about this novel, why not all the other novels that are out there?  Why not be preaching against kids reading Crime and Punishment or any other great work of literature for fear that it will influence it's readers in a negative manner?  Why are you singling out Twilight?  Because it's such a widely read (although awful piece of trash) series?  What about Disney movies in which the beautiful princess is always swept off her feet by a prince charming?  Why not just label all works of fiction geared at young women as 'an unrealistic standard' or 'horrible example'?   I find it abhorrent that you think that all young women are so naiive as to take something like that literal when it is OBVIOUSLY meant to entertain, not to instruct.  And hell, even if they do take it too seriously, so what?  They are teenage girls, they fall in love every second of the day with various different unrealistic ideals, but guess what?  They grow out of it.  They develop crushes on celebrities, are heartbroken if a boy they like doesn't stare back at them, and they are flooded with an even more unrealistic standard of beauty that they will spend their entire lives trying to live up to, quite impossibly, which results in eating disorders and a plethora of other self esteem issues, so I would suggest if you were to pick on anything, that it should be the size 00 supermodel that all girls feel pressure to become thus ruining their self images and potentially their mental health, instead of a small, although admittedly, unrealistic fantasy that they may harbor for a few months, or at most a couple of years before they begin to regard it as ridiculous.

	131657 : ["Since Pro Wrestling is scripted and not 100% real, you HAVE to play the politics game to become successful, otherwise you will lose most of your matches and you won't accomplish much. It's not possible for a wrestler to become really really successful without kissing @ss, joining cliques or be a company man aka yes man. Ask wrestlers like Christian, who is an amazing wrestler and great on the mic, but never got to the level that Edge is because he doesn't do politics, he simply wants to earn the respect of everyone with his performances and charisma. If Christian was a butt kisser and a politician backstage, than he would have been a lot more successful than he is right now. Christian is actually a victim of politics backstage. it's no secret that Vince McMahon was mad at Christian because he left WWE for TNA in 2005, so when he came back to WWE, Vince punished him by drafting him to the ECW brand instead of RAW or Smackdown. John cena is the best example of someone who got to the top because he's great with everyone. He's a team player, he's a company guy, a yes man who does everything the boss tells him to do. i heard once that Vince McMahon didn't like Cena very much at first, but Cena was so hungry for success that Vince had no choice but to push him to the top in WWE. Vince originally wanted Randy Orton and Batista to be the top guys in WWE but that didn't go well so Vince pushed Cena to the top and that worked really well. Cena might be a great guy but there's no doubt that he kisses @ss and hangs out with the right people backstage to stay at the top in WWE. BQ: No it can't survive without it because Pro Wrestling is not 100% real. The people backstage decide whether you win or lose your match, so as a wrestler you have to make sure you impress management, you have to make sure you are a champion with people. Only a sport who is 100% real can survive without backstage politics because all you have to have is talent and skills but that's not enough in Pro Wrestling, you need to be able to do whatever to become great there.
