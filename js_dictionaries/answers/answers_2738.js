	142781 : ["Leadership and self-confidence, but especially life in general when it comes to dating. The most frustrating thing about a woman is a man. First we have to struggle to find someone, then we struggle to stay with him, then we struggle to get over him. And if we get married we struggle through that. Everything is a struggle with them. Going back to that part about struggling to find him, just figuring out what men want is enough to make my brain itch.  Along with self-confidence I would like to add self-esteem. Many women have had things happen to them where they cannot function well because their self-esteem has been torn to shreds. They view themselves as having no more worth have a leaf blowing down the street. This has to be corrected first so such women can gain the motivation they need to live their lives in a productive way. Leadership will be good for women, but I think especially minority women who seem to make it to lower to mid management levels, but it is hard for us to get in the board room. Even at the international large company I work for, it is very diversified at every level except for the upper management level where it is all white men and women.  I also think women would benefit by strengthening our conversational speech and writing skills, and to expand our vocabulary. A woman who knows how to express herself in a dignified way in conversation and in writing really stands out as being graceful and elegant.  Honestly, some women today need to be taught how to be ladies. I see women all the time who leave the house looking all kinds of ways with hair that looks equal as bad. And it also wouldn't hurt to educate women about nutrition. Not just the stuff about counting calories, but also about food sensitivities and why recognizing it is crucial to being healthy and weight loss;learning about how prominent MSG is, what it does, and why we shouldn't eat it ever; just how serious is wheat consumption and why it is everywhere; and the details on why fast food is bad for us. All of these things will not only help women to do well in their careers and their personal life, but they will also benefit their families as they get married and have children. \"A capable wife who can find? Her value is far more than that of corals.\" (Proverbs 31:10)", 11555, "G9VOdGRwaa", 1],
