	144037 : ["So I'm going to answer what you told me not to, go to counseling, period. And don't just go to \"counseling\" go to a physiologist, who will prescribe you medicine to maker you feel better.  Here are some steps int he mean time, I know it LONG but its really important you read it, I really hope you get better good luck!        Tell someone you trust about your feelings. This is one of the hardest steps. Chances are, if you've been hiding out for months, or maybe even years, and covering up all of your problems, it is going to be very difficult to suddenly open up. However, confiding in somebody who is trustworthy will be well worth it; they will be able to give you advice, support, help you understand your emotions, and be an alternative outlet rather than cutting. Don't be discouraged if they seem shocked, scared, or maybe even horrified. Of course it will have a massive impact on them. Wait for the person to come to terms with the situation. However, always be sure to confide in someone who you know will help you. Telling someone who will make your situation worse is a bad idea (and seriously, these people exist).           Talk to this person whenever you have the urge to cut. When you feel like cutting yourself, confide in a teacher, school counselor, parent, friend, relative, etc. If they don't know about your current struggle, tell them about it and tell them you need their help to keep yourself from cutting again.         Keep a hotline number with you at all times. When you feel the urge to cut, pick up the phone and call the hotline. Crisis hotline staff are trained to provide support and offer you alternatives to cutting yourself. If you haven't gathered the courage to open up to someone close to you yet, then talking anonymously on an untracked hotline would be a good idea. Whenever you feel like cutting yourself, call the hotline number and tell them how you're feeling. Soon, you will start to learn a lot more about your emotions. The staff will be able to help you view your situation in a more positive way.           Try talking to a professional crisis clinician. It is clear that it is not their job to \"talk you out of\" cutting yourself - you make your own choices and you must take responsibility for either cutting or not cutting. However, talking to your GP or another professional and notifying them of your situation will help. They may be able to tell you if you have the symptoms of a disease or disorder (depression, etc.) that may be contributing/causing you to cut. They may also be able to refer you to a clinic or support group.           Remove cutting tools from your immediate area. If you have time to search for something to cut yourself with, you may just be able to crush the impulse. One minute can determine whether or not you self harm. Don't keep sharp objects on your table, and don't put razors in a close drawer or cupboard. Remove anything which you may use to cut yourself. Put other \"cutting tools\" wrapped up in boxes and high up on hard-to-reach shelves.            Identify the 'trigger' that gives you the urge to cut. The moment you have the urge to cut, stop and think of what has just occurred. Remember it and try to avoid these situations. For example, if you've just had an argument with somebody close to you, and are having the urge to cut, stop and ask yourself what's making you feel this way; \"I feel like cutting myself because I've just had an argument with somebody I love, and it's making me feel really bad.\" Determine what in particular makes this situation trigger off negative emotions-a certain feeling, or maybe an action? Then work on reducing this issue until you have it under control or completely diminished.           If you need to hurt yourself, do it in a controlled and less harmful way. A good idea is to wear a rubber band around your wrist. Every time you want to cut, snap the rubber band against your wrist instead. You can also draw on your wrist with red pen, or rub an ice cube on your wrist. Although all of these cause some immediate pain, it is much milder and much less dangerous.         Express your emotions. For example, when you feel like cutting, try doing one or more of the following:  Drawing or scribbling on paper  Painting, on white paper  Listening to music that relates to your emotions  Writing down your emotions in a diary/journal  Writing songs/poetry  Call a friend  After a day or so, analyse what you have done. Try to determine how you felt, and what you can do to reduce or stop these emotions, or work around them.            Distract yourself. Some people feel that rather than analysing their emotions, they feel better when they get rid of them or forget them completely. When you feel the urge to cut, try distracting yourself by trying out the following:  Drink a glass of water  Watch TV  Do some form of exercise-run, walk, ride your bike, or just dance like crazy  Take your dog for a walk, or spend so", 11619, "None", 1],
	144038 : ["You know doing this is wrong and not the way to make yourself feel better.  Injury to yourself is wrong.  This is hard for people to understand, including yourself.  You need a professional to help you  who is trained with this situation.  You must get yourself healthy, love yourself first and foremost and the rest will come, including new friends who love, care, and understand you.  Do things that make you feel good like get a new haircut, go shopping, read, write, find a talent and a hobby, go walking, take a hot bath etc etc.  But most of all VALUE you.  Obviously you need counseling if you cannot get a grip on the reality of what you are really doing to yourself, sorry but that is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts, but it will set you free.  Pray for guidance and pray to God and tell him you need his loving arms wrapped around you to help you through this difficult time.  Have faith and stop hurting yourself and those who love you.", 11619, "E2IaiCpyaa", 0],
