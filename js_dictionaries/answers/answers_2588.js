Even the American indians descend from people who migrated from Asia, so in what sense are they natives to this land?  In some sense, we are all Afro-Asians.  It's arbitrary and subjective.  I am not discounting the wrongs that were done to the American Indians (\"Indian\" also means native).

And yet his own company is so intimidated by China's government that terms basic to free expression are banned from its search engine. In order to gain an understanding of how globalization has impacted the Chinese government, it is first important to look at China's history. Nearly 50 years ago, China fought for and won its independence with the leadership of Mao Zedong (for more information about the history, click here). He established a new government that was based entirely around the ideas of Communism. Mao announced that a \"people's democratic dictatorship\" would be formed under his direction as chairman of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party).         However, since that time, China has in many ways become progressively democratic, mainly because of the influx of various western ideas such as freedom and market-economies.

Cockers can be black, brown golden etc. just like humans. The most drifted group among living humans are the Australian Aborigines because they have been isolated 40 or 50,000 years before they met Europeans for the first time.

This is why we are hearing all this back and forth about the DHS budget bills and possible shutdowns. Because if you defund DHS, then you defund all the agencies under its grip.  Before DHS, each of the other agencies were either independent or under control by other Federal Departments and had separate budgets and controls.  Think of: \"Too big to fail\", it applies here as well when it comes to the federal government. Plus why exactly does the DHS need its OWN federal agents?  Isnt that what the FBI, US Marshals, BATF-E, DEA, CBP, etc are for? So in my opinion, yes it should be defunded and disbanded and the agencies under it, redistributed.

I think anyone can provided they have the right temperament, personality and dedication to do so. If they were to be taught by someone more experienced in PP training, learned under their guidance and most importantly were WILLING to learn and be taught, then i think anyone could. The problem is finding all those characteristics in most people who do want to train their dogs for PP. How many can you say have them? Hardly any.. and that is what i believe makes the difference. Lets face it, the average person who decides to train their dog to be a guard or 'attack' dog will confine the dog to their property, encourage the dog to bark and display aggressive behaviours towards any approaching person or animal and will generally agitate the dog into such a state that it will be seen as ''very protective'' instead of a nervous wreck. Getting the right dog to be trained for PP is paramount and not something that can be found in the local shelter. I doubt the people who do their own 'protection training' have put much consideration into the background of the dog they purchase. They will go to a shelter or byb'r and pick out/buy the biggest, meanest and toughest dog. I do not believe the average canine will be successful in PP even if training was attempted, i am not talking about sports, but, actual protection when push came to shove. There is a reason why those dogs are so expensive, why breeding selection is done carefully and why people invest so much time and money into them. They are not breeding for pets but for dogs that may potentially save lives one day. Here, where owning a firearm is illegal then i definitely see a use for PP dogs.
