	131470 : ["Ok firstly, I like Emma and Adalynn for girls, and Seth and Dallas for boys. I know you said Dallas as one of your girls names, but I like it better for a boy. Also, for the girls name Emma, have you considered Emmalyn? that way it incorporates your middle name in it, plus it makes it more unique than just Emma. Secondly, I think it is definately a good idea to give them middle names.They are not only traditional, but handy for if you want to honour someone in your family, and can also be used if the child grows up to dislike his/her first name. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to convince your fiance to go with it if you try, good luck! So finally, Emma Raine/Emmalyn Marie and Adalynn Marie are lovely combinations, and Seth Rian and Dallas James are great for boys. I also love the name Lily as you have it for middle names, but I'm afraid it doesn't go with any of the first names I like. Hope this helps, â™¥ Bee", 11102, "ot0TqzSvaa", 0],

Randy Orton:Agree(not in all parts though).He is talented with great in ring skills and major mic skills.I really love how is he walking,talking and play the heel role..He is so arrogant..and that's awesome but as he said..\"It's not Arrogance..It's Destiny!\" I disagree that he could habe better finishing move.RKO is really enjoyable and well executed...He is a little bit 'jackas*' in real life but i am not sure though... J.B.L:Both..cause he is not a wrestling god!He is a good wrestler but if he is a wrestleing god.What Bret Hart is supposed to be??I love his style and as you said how uses and participates in the storylines.Also i think that is the best employer for a boss..He is indeed a future Hall of Famer.. HHH:Disagree!I really like Triple H.He is awesome in the ring and he was a major heel back in the day.He is funny as a face but i prefer him as a heel.OK!Maybe he is a little bit selfish and he wants to descimate all the others on RAW but you can't forget that he was willing to job to Eugene sometimes.. Plus,he is a maineventer from around 2000..Since then,he was only a bodyguard of HBK and he was challenging for the European and IC titles..I agree that he could have a good feud Kennedy and i hope that he will desciate him... *starred*", 11105, "jTc3qyOGaa", 1],
	131477 : ["Responses: Randy Orton - Hes got potential, but still has no identity in the ring, what I mean is that nothing sets him apart from the rest. And now that hes champion he should really freshen up his moveset a bit, he only does stomps and rest holds! Orton really needs to step up now that hes champion, right now I don't see a main eventer in Randy Orton, his mic skills aren't great and almost has no heat. After losing so much matches this year, he doesn't seem like championship material.  JBL - Now this is a guy with a lot of heat and heel charisma, but no wrestling ability. While in APA, he was nothing more than a powerhouse while his partner Farooq(Ron Simmons) carried him all those years. When JBL became a singles wrestler and became the World Champ, he got a lot of heat because many fans believed he didn't deserve it. His mic skills were top notch though and that put him over. Hes very entertaining on commentary but I won't consider him a WRESTLING God, but still a future Hall of Famer. Triple H - I totally agree with you about him being overrated now. Back then, maybe 2001 and back, he was the most hated wrestler on the roster. HHH had so much heat and heel charisma, that it almost came natural to him. He was also a dedicated and hard working wrestler back then, before he married Stephanie McMahon. But now, with his backstage power as the son-in-law of the chairman, HHH was never the same since. After coming back in 2007, he already squashed so much talent, he single handly destoryed the tag team division. HHH's wrestling ability is also stale, after injuring both of his quads he can't wrestle like he use to. Only does 4 moves now (running jawbreaker, high knee, spinebuster, and the Pedigree).

	131478 : ["I think that it is blind abuse. They don't realize that what they are doimg is really stupid. They might chuck the baby around all the time but one day it is bound to go wrong. Also, babies are still growing and forming solid bones, so you should not pick them up by the arms for example because their arms are not strong enough to carry the babys weight yet.One of them will chuck it and the other might not be lookig and will not catch it. It is great to play with a baby but that is too rough. Your friends relationship with her boyfriend will not end well if she is seeing others behind his back. So is the baby his?? And is she still with the boyfriend?? Maybe every now and then just throw of some random comments about looking after a baby so she quietly gets the drift. Or say you saw someone in the street the other day, chucking their baby back and forth and it landed on the ground.    or the person only just caught it and the baby grazed their leg or something.. If that doesn't work then consult a professional about it. Or quietly ask ur friends mum to say something to her daughter", 11107, "xmNveNsFaa", 0],
	131479 : ["You know a lot is revealed about a person by the friends they keep.   As for how dangerous this game is, a lot depends on the specifics, like how far the baby went in mid air with no hands below to catch her, whether or not the baby had a scared look on her face and that sort of thing.  I'd have to see it actually being done to judge the danger level.  I have a son who is now 15 months but when he was 8 or 9 months I'd sometimes throw him up a bit and let him freefall and catch him with my hands always being within about 3-4 inches of him.  He would enjoy it immensely.  An onlooker may have felt it to be a risky thing to do, but I don't think there was any risk at all.  I'm in a stable marriage with 4 happy, healthy kids and anyone from child protective services would see in about 30 seconds that their intervention is not needed at my house.

His finisher is OK, but people need to stop saying it's the best finisher in the world. JBL: Very underrated and disrespected by people, I noticed. Ever since Bradshaw changed his gimmick to match his successes outside of wrestling, people hate him (similar to Booker T). The problem was, with his APA gimmick, JBL was getting nowhere, and his newer gimmick really had us see how well of a heel JBL could be.  Triple H: I can see why you think so, but HHH's character is believably dominant over others.
