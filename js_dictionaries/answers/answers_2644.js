Well, Laura Bush was never investigated for the accident in which she killed her former boyfriend. Who is the elite? EDIT: Seems you are being ludicrous, many have reported on Laura's accident over the years, all have mentioned her running the stop sign. No ticket was issued. You will notice that I did not defend Teddy's actions, just cleared up your misrepresentation as I have now done again.

She had a bonfire in her backyard and a whole bunch of people showed up that nobody even knew.  All I know is that I kept taking jello shots and calling every girl pretty.  I hugged some guy named Brian, because his name was Brian.  I ended up passing out at midnight in her bedroom where my fiance had holed up because the party was too much for him. All I remember is heading toward the stairs then I don't remember anything.  I've never blacked out before and the scary part is I was up for about 15 minutes longer.  I'm glad that is was my fiance I ended up finding.  Anyway, I threw up in my sleep and woke up in a puddle of vomit.  Not exactly cool.

Also, our prisons are full of people who have committed marginal offenses (such as possession of MJ) because \"Conservatives\" believe they can legislate morality. Alcohol causes many more deaths per year than MJ;  if MJ is illegal, alcohol should also be illegal  (you can't have it both ways, Cons !)
