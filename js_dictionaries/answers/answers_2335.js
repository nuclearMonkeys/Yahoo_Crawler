	122589 : ["Well, you should tell us your body type and your facial structure. Either that, or give us a picture. You could go for a chiffon with a cute skirt tucked in for a classy look. Maybe jeans and not tucked in if you want to dress it down. If you don't have a chiffon, maybe a cute tank top with skinny jeans? Maybe something lacy or floral? A lot of people like to wear cute dresses with certain shoes like vans to dress it down. You don't really have to do that if your dress isn't as formal. I think long dresses are so beautiful on tall girls. I wish I was tall ):. Hair makes a big difference and could take a little bit of hair in the very front then braid it down to the side carefully then secure it with a bobby pin. Like that, with less hair and less dramatic, just a normal braid. Like when someone uses bobby pins to place their bangs back. Curling your hair with that style would also be cute! If you don't have a curling iron, then look at this tutorial! Did you know you can curl your hair with socks? If you want it less curly, you can always comb it down. For make up you should just do a thin eyeliner(on the top, maybe a lighter colour on the bottom if you like, too much makes it look heavy), lipstick, blush, a eyebrow pencil(eyebrows can change a person a lot, if you have good enough eyebrows, then you're lucky (;) and some mascara for a cute look, maybe skin products if you have them. If you want to go for the natural look, go with some skin products if you have them(not too much), maybe a lip tint, blush, eyebrow pencil (more looks better to people, but don't overdo it until you look crazy) and subtle mascara. I always like going for the natural look! It shows who you really are while giving a confidence boost ;)! Some people can't even tell you're wearing makeup! You'll feel beautiful! REMEMBER: What I say here isn't absolute. Be creative! Anyone can be beautiful as long as they try and this doesn't just go for make up. It's about cleaning, grooming and dressing yourself up! EDIT: I would say wear a black tee with something white and lacy over and cute jeans(dyed or plain)? If not, you could wear a white shirt that has lacy shoulders and black or pink pastel jeans. Another one is wearing a short navy blue dress with maybe a brown belt and black leggings? You could wear a blue buttoned down shirt with a bright blue bandeau or tee. You could add white jeans with a gold/silver coloured watch or gold/silver coloured jewelry.", 10719, "mxAYwXCtaa", 1],

It is the nickel that they add to the metals to make them harder to wear longer. I now buy nickel free jewelry and have never had another problem. I can where earrings and rings as long as they are nickel free.  They are cheap to buy. So you can have many pairs and when they get old just throw them away. You can buy them pretty much anywhere they sell cheap jewelry like Walmart, K-mart, etc. You can buy a whole card with all different earrings on them in different sizes for about 6 dollars. Try it and see if it works, you don't have anything to loose since they cost so little. Surgical steel does not really work for me either, they still get infected and itch.", 10718, "LYRbk2ILaa", 0],

It's seems cliche, I know, but it's fun and you spend time together. We decided not to do gifts this year but if you want to get your boyfriend something then try cologne, watch, candy (always goes over well), massage oil (my boyfriend loves massages and loves to give them, so that worked out for both of us) or something for you to wear for him. Most guys would love that. I've done all these things for my guy and he loved every one. If there is something special that you know he loves, then do that. My boyfriend is a Red Sox fanatic so that's always a stand by. Just think about what your boyfriend likes and go with that. You could make it fun and agree on a price limit. You each cannot not go over whatever the limit is when buying the gift. My boyfriend and I have done that and it was pretty fun seeing what we could come up with. We agreed that card and wrapping didn't count in the price. You can get very creative with that. *wink*.  Make it fun shopping for a gift for him. The more creative you get with the gift the better it is. Plus if it's something you can have fun with together, it's even better. Good luck!", 10711, "796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa", 0],
