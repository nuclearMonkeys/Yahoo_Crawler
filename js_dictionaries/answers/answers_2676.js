	139636 : ["If you believe the trinity, then God allowed himself to be tempted by Satan. Also, if you believe the trinity, then according to the book of Hebrews God learned obedience from Satan. Why would God have to learn obedience? Who does God have to obey? This is just a couple of reasons I don't believe the trinity. Jesus as God's Spokesman (The Word) had to prove that in all circumstances he would obey God. John 15:10 I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.  Most people don't realize that Jesus could have failed, which would have proved Satan to be correct. Otherwise it would not have been a test, and the scriptures said Jesus was tested in all respects. .", 11434, "47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa", 0],

Jesus was sinless but as He was in this world He was subject to the law of death and so also to temptations, but be careful: He DID NOT sin. Temptations are a way for God to forge your soul in fire and refine your Spirit, Jesus faced for us ALL the darkness of the world and did not sin even onto death and in so doing He restored humans in God's Grace. If Jesus was never tempted His coming would have been useless. If you want to know more about facing satan read The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross.

	139639 : ["Do you think that we should be punished for disobeying laws in our own country?  Why would we ever expect less of God, knowing that He hates sin? According to the Bible every person is a sinner so therefore the price should be paid.  Actions and consequences.  Sure you were born into it, but God knows that very well.  We're responsible for responding to what God has said and that is the most than any person can do about sin!  It's a bit like having the right to an attorney as long as you know you have the right... In the American legal system a state attorney is forced upon you if none can be paid... God doesn't work quite like that, but it's the knowledge of Him that will make all the difference.

	139662 : ["Are you kidding? Numbers 12:3 Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth* (*Moses was drooling with modesty while writing his Bible books!).  The Bible writers say that this Holy and meek “LAW GIVER” stabbed in the back an Egyptian foreman because he was rough on the Jews! Moses had to run away from the Pharaoh's Police to the Kingdom of Midian. 40 Bible years later out of the clear blue sky he returns to Egypt to take over the INSTANTANEOUS leadership of 2,000,000 Jews telling them that his newly found God by the name of Yahweh (aka Jehovah) promised to conquer the Land of Palestine for them if they kill all the Palestinians living there! There is not a trace of historical evidence that any of these stories in the Bible ever took place, or that Moses, or even Harry Porter ever existed, except by “faith” (gullibility!) Moses became a cold bloody murderer. His “Thou shalt not kill” commandment was more of a big finger salute to the foreman that he murdered back in Egypt! KILLING TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT IS OK WITH GOD (Exo 2:12)! The Bible God ordered Moses to slaughter everybody including babies and pregnant women in the Palestine region to make room for Israel! Moses complied with God's orders on the spot! Numbers 25:16-17 (NIV) The Lord said to Moses, “Treat the Midianites as enemies AND KILL THEM…”* (*John 3:16 –“for God so loved the world!” Intense Divine Jealousy drives God to kill people if they worship a different God! The Medianites worshipped a “false” God) The Midianites were not enemies of Israel, because Israel was allegedly born as slaves inside of Egypt so it had no enemies, but the Bible God is telling Moses to TREAT THEM AS ENEMIES and to kill them anyway regardless of how hospitable they were to Moses when he came to Midian running away from the Egyptian law! So much for KARMA in the Bible stories. Zipporah, Moses' first long term loving wife was Midianite! No Christian wishes to talk about the TOTAL HOLOCAUST of millions of Medianites! But relax, there is no hard evidence of any such massacre. It is all a Bible story like any Harry Porter story. Numbers 31:17-18 (NIV) Now kill all the boys* (*Moses loving children were Midianite citizens born and raised in Midian!). And kill every woman* (*including Moses' mother in law and any other female relative... and his own wife?) who has slept with a man* (*ESPECIALLY PREGNANT WOMEN! In all the Bible stories “women who have slept with men” MEANS PREGNANT WOMEN! They are the primary target of the Bible God's killing orders! But spare the Blessed Virgin Mary if anybody spots her! God the Holy Ghost got her pregnant and that is OK! Still all pregnant women and any girl who “slept with a man” must die! Moses and God couldn't care less about any fetus! The fetuses had to be destroyed with the pregnant women!), BUT SAVE FOR YOURSELVES EVERY GIRL* (*not older women, but sweet young virgin girls) WHO HAS NEVER SLEPT WITH A MAN* (*Oh, YES!!! Isn't this repulsive pedophile oriented God so WONDERFUL! In Bible times, sexual predators and abusers had complete, and total freedom and protection under this primitive Bible God!) Christianity is a very primitive and repulsive religion, second only to Islam! Pedophilia and the killing of innocent children and pregnant women was NEVER a “sin” in the Bible, but a Holy routine! In Midian alone the Holy men of God collected 32,000 young virgin girls for their own pleasure (Num. 31:35). EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS TOTALLY MUTE ABOUT THE GROSS IMMORALITY IN THE BIBLE STORIES (because religion is a multi-billion dollar business protected by secular law!) MOSES IS THE ENVY OF ANY SEXUAL PREDATOR IN THE WORLD TODAY! After this episode in the Bible that hardly any Christian is willing to read, it became a routine in Israel to kill everybody even when fighting among themselves, but to always spare the YOUNG VIRGIN GIRLS “that never slept with men” as war trophies for the pleasure of the Fierce Fighting Men of GOD JEHOVAH! A team of avid Levite Priests was always at hand to use their big fat fingers in the inspection of all the little girls to see if they still had their hymen intact. Like in Christian America counting voting ballots… nicked and butterfly hymens didn't count and the little girl had to be slaughtered on the spot! The sadistic sexual stuff in the Bible is no joke! Judges 21:10-11 (NIV) So the assembly* (*Israel leaders) sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead AND PUT TO THE SWORD THOSE LIVING THERE* (*they were Israelites, too, but they disobeyed the Priests!), INCLUDING THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. “This is what you are to do,” they said. “kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.”* (*KILL ALL THE PREGNANT WOMEN…!) The glorious ARMY OF GOD killed all the ISRAELITES residents in the town of Jabesh Gilead, except for 400 young lucky virgin GIRLS (Judges 21:12) that they rounded up so the male Jews from the tribe of Benjamin could replace their wives that were slaughtered by the same ARMY OF GOD. They had a new chance at life with BRAND NEW YOUNG VIRGIN GIRLS! The Priests of the BIBLE GOD were there to make a full inspection of the little girls' tight vagina to certify that each one had their hymen intact. Today, some preachers can only masturbate in their closet fantasizing about the provisions that God had for his chosen people in Bible times!  BTW, not even the Blessed Virgin Mary escaped a “VIRGINITY” test, so she wouldn't be stoned to death according to the Law of God, for being promiscuous! The Early Church Fathers provided ALL the additional Holy documentation necessary to support Christianity, especially on the Virgin Birth issue that is claimed by both Catholics and Protestants as the fundamental base of their faith! THE PROTEVANGELIUM OF SAINT JAMES  19. And the midwife went forth out of the cave, and Salome met her. And she said to her: Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to thee: a virgin has brought forth a thing which her nature admits not of. Then said Salome: As the Lord my God liveth, unless I thrust in my finger, and search the **** parts, I will not believe that a virgin has brought forth.  20. And the midwife went in, and said to Mary: Show thyself* (*spread thy legs, Thou Blessed of the LORD!), for no small controversy has arisen about thee. And Salome put in her finger, and cried out, and said: Woe is me for mine iniquity and mine unbelief, because I have tempted the living God; and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire* (*She must have gotten real excited using her whole hand in search of the hallowed hymen! In her excitement she almost destroys the paramount evidence of Mary's virginity! God the Holy Ghost had to slap her hand. But, relax all ye Christians, she fully recovered!).  Moses' father-in-law Jethro was a HEATHEN priest in Midian, but the Bible writers exempted him from being slaughtered with the rest of the Midianites! Jethro was very helpful to Moses taking Israel out of Egypt! The Midianites gave Moses not only a loving and faithful wife, but also food and shelter. Moses lived 40 years with them and raised his family there. He had a lot of Midianite friends, too, but at the Exodus time God decides to slaughter EVERYBODY IN MIDIAN, except for 32,000 virgin girls in a genocide operation of humongous proportions! AND MOSES DOESN'T OBJECT OR QUESTION GOD AT ALL like he usually does on any trivial issue!!! But in full cold blood Moses orders the killings to proceed as planned! In fact, he was very upset that his orders were not carried out immediately! The Priestly Bible writers were obviously a bunch of perverts writing a smutty story about their own origin in a book that Christians deep throat like a charm. They even want to force all our kids in public schools to read the Bible and pray to this primitive Bible God, like they do in their own private Church schools! MOSES IS HIGHLY HONORED FOR BETRAYING and slaughtering all his Midianite friends and relatives, but God gets real mad at Moses because he struck a piece of rock twice instead of once. So God prevented Moses from setting foot on the PROMISED LAND that he worked so hard to get there killing so many innocent people! The Priestly Bible writers were having an orgy of erotic fun about slaughtering everybody, especially children and pregnant women. Christians claim that the rock that Moses hit twice was Jesus aka the “source of living water,” spiritually speaking, of course. Nobody ought to hit Jesus more than once, because Jesus doesn't turn the other cheek! Later on, the Archangel Saint Michael and the Devil end up tearing Moses' dead body apart in a HOLY fetish of some sort! (Jude 1:9)  Christians must be void of decent moral values to believe that all these obscene stories in the Bible like real history! Can you imagine a revised XXX rated EXODUS movie telling the whole Exodus story, but the ADULT Bible version, not the traditional censured kiddy story that we all know from Sunday School? Christians still love the Bible God the same way the Nazis used to love Hitler…! History repeats itself and Christians that are now so brainwashed with “Jesus” will eventually drop the whole Bible with all its smutty fairy tales the same way the Germans dropped Hitler!", 11435, "None", 0],
