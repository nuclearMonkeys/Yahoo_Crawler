	33577 : ["Passing yards in college are not a very reliable indicator of how well a player will do in the NFL.  Many times a players passing yards are due more to the offensive scheme his team uses rather than individual talent.  Case Keenum is the all-time NCAA leader in passing yards, completions, and touchdowns, yet he's had a very mediocre NFL career...  bouncing from team to team, being used more as a backup than a starter. Number two in NCAA career passing yards is Timmy Chang, who played for Hawaii.  He was not drafted and never played in the NFL.  Number 3 is Landry Jones, who was drafted in the 4th round and spent 3 seasons with the Steelers as a backup QB before being released.  He had brief stints with the Jaguars and Raiders, but was released by both teams.  He played one season for the Dallas Renegades of the XFL, but after that league folded he was out of football. ", 5107, "piZ4xDBqaa", 0],

I'm sure nothing has changed in the industry and that isn't even the worst part. I think that if one person gets singled out... they all should be... and all should meet the same outcome. You can't acquit one and then pile on the other - I mean it DOES happen - but it shouldn't.  I get it.
