And i remembered watching him lose at wrestlemania and i all i could think was oh my god those people in that crowd are so lucky watching HBK fight a match. that's all i ever wanted to see or meet HBK. and i started watching him from when i was born and he was in the beginning of my life so i would have loved to see the end of his career. the end of an era i will not forget and neither will the rest of the wwe universe. <3", 11326, "viDjHVOiaa", 0],

It seems like John is desperate for attention. He has been coming out on Smackdown, twice and bashing Jack for his speech impediment, and thats what brings him popularity? You are mistaken, Dear John.  I really think if he uses super kick, then he will get a lot of Boos, seriously. People have been planning to riot because Mickie has been released.

Shawn Michaels, and John Morrison are different people! I know everyone thinks he is the next \"Shawn Michaels,\" but he botches his own finishing move, so much. I really don't want him botching Sweet Chin Music (my favourite finisher!).

I was impressed with DiBiase on Raw a few weeks ago as well. Both of them were under Randy Orton's shadow for some time and now they're ready to shine. Don't get me wrong Kofi and MVP are great wrestlers as well but I see Kofi as another Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat in the since that he's a character who remain a fan favorite throughout his career and as for MVP he's a great athlete and entertaining to watch but for me he doesn't have the \"it\" factor.
