	62190 : ["The first one by far. The second one seems a bit childlike to me. I hope I didn't insult you, but this is a ring you will hopefully wear for the rest of your life, and I really think you would outgrow the \"cuteness\" of the bypass heart ring in time. The other ring, on the other hand, is very simple and classic--it will look as lovely when you're 50 as it would today. I cannot say the same for the heart ring. Plus, I doubt you'd be able to get a wedding band that would be able to sit right up to the heart ring because of the way the stone is tilted.", 8153, "AA11603468", 2],
	62191 : ["Go for the first one.  The heart one may not look right next to a wedding band... It also looks a little more like a regular ring than an engagement ring.  Go for style and elegance... Number one.", 8153, "wD56H6s7aa", 1],

	62196 : ["Ha!!! Yes! and may the fourth be with you as well good agent... Yes, I remember as a kid seeing the first commercial ad for the original Star Wars, where Luke Skywalker is saving Princess Leia and trying to escape Imperial Storm Troopers by sailing (or swinging) on a rope across some cavernous expanse on the Death Star. I saw that on TV and remember running to mom and yelling,\"we've gotta go see this movie!!!!!!!!!\" Here's another X-file for you: Why haven't we invented space ships, like the ones in star wars? It seems like we're way behind the times. We should be colonizing space and exploring our galaxy by now and things like that, you know? Are the aliens holding us back?", 8156, "None", 0],

	62201 : ["I love it. firstly depends on the fish. If it is fresh ( mean fresh), then also the types of fish, 1.Sushi is a very good way of having it raw. 2. Mackerel and /Sardines good smoked (good omega 3.) 3. Good ole Fish (all sorts) for Fish and Chips fried or battered. 4. Kippers smoked and steamed great !! 5.

	62206 : ["I like the second one; however, I feel that the diamond is really small, and that it should be bigger. I'm not a fan of princess cut diamonds so if you could find the second ring with maybe a bigger diamond, but not like overpowering but a little bigger then I would definitely go with that one.", 8153, "246a7bb9b480d54babb8c05feac42a50aa", 0],
	62207 : ["I'd go for the fist one. The diamond shows better in this traditional setting than in the heart-shaped one. Think about how it will look when you add the wedding band, and consider the possibility of adding an anniversary band to it as well. I think the heart-shaped one will be overpowered once you start adding additional bands.", 8153, "TEX1iYQgaa", 4],

	62220 : ["They are both gorgeous rings but I would go with the first one, the heart shaped ring will become problamatic when trying to find a wedding band that will match, maybe the heart shaped ring could be his gift to you on your wedding day and you could wear it on the opposite hand as your wedding ring if you choose to wear your engagement ring and wedding band together.", 8153, "tbImv6Dhaa", 0],
