	87066 : ["According to my limited understanding Relativity shows that spacetime is a product of the universe and the first \"moment\" of time was the first unit of Planck time (named after Max Planck, Christian scientist/founder of Quantum Theory), which occured a fraction of time \"after\" the Big Bang, so technically the Big Bang also preceded time. It's very difficult. Using the concept of limits from calculus and the definition of time from physics (T=D/S), we know that the \"primordial atom\" from which the universe expanded was not a true point (having no size/dimension, in which case you would say T=0/S) but instead contained mass, so there never really was a point at which T=0. And if S=0 then T=undefined. Of course I'm using standard physics which typically don't apply at the quantum level so I'm probably incredibly wrong, but it's just confusing enough to satisfy my curiosity and allow me to ignore the problem for now. (personally I think Genesis 1 is allegory, as did many ancient theologians such as Philo and Augustine)", 9252, "SNJgLxQzaa", 0],
	87067 : ["Questions the Big Bang Does Not Answer A major challenge to the big bang has come from observers using the corrected optics of the Hubble Space Telescope to measure distances to other galaxies. The new data is giving the theorists fits! Astronomer Wendy Freedman and others recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to a galaxy in the constellation of Virgo, and her measurement suggests that the universe is expanding faster, and therefore is younger, than previously thought. In fact, it “implies a cosmic age as little as eight billion years,” reported Scientific American magazine just last June. While eight billion years sounds like a very long time, it is only about half the currently estimated age of the universe. This creates a special problem, since, as the report goes on to note, “other data indicate that certain stars are at least 14 billion years old.” If Freedman's numbers hold up, those elderly stars would turn out to be older than the big bang itself! Still another problem for the big bang has come from steadily mounting evidence of “bubbles” in the universe that are 100 million light-years in size, with galaxies on the outside and voids inside. Margaret Geller, John Huchra, and others at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics have found what they call a great wall of galaxies some 500 million light-years in length across the northern sky. Another group of astronomers, who became known as the Seven Samurai, have found evidence of a different cosmic conglomeration, which they call the Great Attractor, located near the southern constellations of Hydra and Centaurus. Astronomers Marc Postman and Tod Lauer believe something even bigger must lie beyond the constellation Orion, causing hundreds of galaxies, including ours, to stream in that direction like rafts on a sort of “river in space.” All this structure is baffling. Cosmologists say the blast from the big bang was extremely smooth and uniform, according to the background radiation it allegedly left behind. How could such a smooth start have led to such massive and complex structures? “The latest crop of walls and attractors intensifies the mystery of how so much structure could have formed within the 15-billion-year age of the universe,” admits Scientific American—a problem that only gets worse as Freedman and others roll back the estimated age of the cosmos still more. “We Are Missing Some Fundamental Element” Geller's three-dimensional maps of thousands of clumped, tangled, and bubbled galactic agglomerations have transformed the way scientists picture the universe. She does not pretend to understand what she sees. Gravity alone appears unable to account for her great wall. “I often feel we are missing some fundamental element in our attempts to understand this structure,” she admits. Geller enlarged on her misgivings: “We clearly do not know how to make large structure in the context of the Big Bang.” Interpretations of cosmic structure on the basis of current mapping of the heavens are far from definitive—more like trying to picture the whole world from a survey of Rhode Island, U.S.A. Geller continued: “Someday we may find that we haven't been putting the pieces together in the right way, and when we do, it will seem so obvious that we'll wonder why we hadn't thought of it much sooner.” That leads to the biggest question of all: What is supposed to have caused the big bang itself? No less an authority than Andrei Linde, one of the originators of the very popular inflationary version of the big bang theory, frankly admits that the standard theory does not address this fundamental question. “The first, and main, problem is the very existence of the big bang,” he says. “One may wonder, What came before? If space-time did not exist then, how could everything appear from nothing? . . . Explaining this initial singularity—where and when it all began—still remains the most intractable problem of modern cosmology.” An article in Discover magazine recently concluded that “no reasonable cosmologist would claim that the Big Bang is the ultimate theory.” Let us now go outdoors and contemplate the beauty and the mystery of the starry vault.", 9252, "H9wsUdwiaa", -1],

	87069 : ["The claim that time began at the big bang doesn't imply that the big bang was the beginning of all existence. Scientists aren't talking about the linear perception of time. You need to understand what time actually is to get how there could have been a time (for lack of a better word) when it didn't exist, or at least not in the way it does now. I'm not gonna lie, I don't understand it myself, but I just acknowledge that the linear perception most people have is wrong. That perception works in our daily lives, it's consistent with what we can observe, but what we can observe is only a tiny slice of reality. Outside of what we average people can observe, i.e. outside of the earth's gravity at extremely high speeds, things get really strange and our understanding of time breaks down. In our daily lives, time can be seen as constant, and velocity is dependant on reference frames. At ridiculously high speeds, velocity becomes less dependant on reference frames, and time becomes more dependent on them. At light speed, velocity is not dependent on reference frames at all, light speed is the same wherever you're observing it from. That's what people mean when they say light speed is a constant. At light speed, time is the only thing that changes based on the reference frame. I can't explain it that well but I'm just trying to give an idea of how mind boggling reality is outside of what we can observe. You can't use your limited understanding of reality to make assumptions like \"nothing could have existed before time\". String theory tries to explain what may have caused the big bang. Maybe it's wrong and there was actually nothing before the big bang. I think Lawrence Kraus would say that if there was nothing, then there would have been no reason why the big bang couldn't occur without a cause.

	87083 : ["The big bang theory explains the development of the Universe back to a certain point. This explanation is supported by observations, by experiments in high energy physics laboratories and by calculations.  This point is called the Planck epoch and appears to be, or is probably about 10^-43 seconds after the actual start.   This period for some reason corresponds to the time taken for a light ray to cover the diameter of a proton.  I don't know why, I am not a mathematician.  At this point calculations of the conditions make no sense or alternately the mathematics we currently have is not applicable.   The closer calculations get to the Planck epoch, the less certain is their application to the conditions at the time and the less reliable is the result. But the degree of closeness is measured in billionths of a second.  As the billionths of a second tick by, the better and more reliable the calculations appear to be, to that extent that by the time a second or so has passed, physicists are fairly sure of their ground.   Conditions begin to look like those in high energy experiments and so are known at least in part. Since conditions before that first second or so are not known from experiment and the calculations are increasingly unreliable as time goes back, physics has no scientific explanation for the absolute beginning,  that is, supported by experimental evidence. If they had, it would not be the absolute beginning. Several hypothetical suggestions have been made, these are pretty much purely mathematical.  One of them may be right, we have no way of knowing at present.   You can supply the gaps in knowledge which ever way you please.  Adding a god raises it's own problems since the origin of the god remains unexplained, and saying it was always there is not really an answer.  It is also clear that if there was some creative intelligence, there is no reason to think that it has anything to do with any of the varieties of gods that have ever been supposed to exist.  A quick note on mathematics.  Newtonian physics depends on the invention of a kind of mathematics called calculus, this did not exist until Newton and another European mathematician invented it.  Strange to say, it was independently sort of / almost invented by a mathematician in Japan around the same time.  Likewise, non-Euclidean geometry made Einstein's work possible, though he did not invent it.   Another thing to consider.  Consider a region in which no thing exists.  If no thing exists, there are no events.  If there are no events, how can you say time passes in that region?  If there is no thing in the region, how can you measure distance? So how big is the region?  The instant you put a ruler in you have a thing and an event so the region no longer exists in it's original form.", 9252, "3oJCGVzkaa", 1],

He gave examples too saying anger is just as much a sin as murder and lust just as much as sin as adultery. The Pharisees were noted for their zealous adherence to the Law yet Jesus said if our righteousness doesn't surpass theirs we will not enter the Kingdom of God. The point Jesus was making is how impossible it is not to sin. That's why we need a savior. We are saved by what we believe not by how we behave. There are rewards awaiting believers in Heaven, but they're based on our works, not our thoughts. Here is a great explanation of how to receive these awards:  As far as punishment goes, this has never been God's intent. Since man committed the first sin, God has sought nothing but reconciliation. It's true that in the Old Testament God is often seen as an angry and jealous God who periodically brought judgment upon the disobedient world. God is not arbitrary, nor is He contradictory. Therefore He can't express any of His attributes at the expense of any other. Throughout the Old Testament times, He was constrained in expressing His love for His creation because His needs for justice and righteousness had not been met.  At the cross God made peace with us by becoming the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth and dying for our sins. His needs for justice and righteousness were finally met and He was free to express His love (Colossians 1:19-20). Now He asks us to live at peace with others out of gratitude for what He's done (Romans 12:17-18). But even before the cross people were saved by their belief in the coming Redeemer. Job proclaimed: I know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand on the earth (Job 19:25). Daniel was saved (Daniel 12:13). David apparently received this same assurance (Psalm 23:6). God called Abraham His friend, and He personally buried Moses. Enoch and Elijah were taken live into heaven, and in Matthew 22:32, Jesus quoted His Father as saying, “I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” Jesus said, “He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”", 9255, "ExT0igOcaa", 0],

If I am free, use my freedom to help others and make the most of what I have, etc. People sometimes think their circumstances are everything - but what's important is their relationship to God and the way they live their life regardless of health, wealth or freedom.  God insists on dealing with what is more important. Some people think that since God didn't have a heart attack when Abraham took a second wife that it was okay with God.  God doesn't change his mind and the consequences themselves show us what a disaster it was.  God didn't condone it -- it is just not commented on.  It was obviously not God's will. Slavery is horrible - but if you are ever taken a slave - remember that this life is temporary.  Gain your freedom if you can, but if you can't, go ahead and make your life the best it can be for God with the circumstances you have.
