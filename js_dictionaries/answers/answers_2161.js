The youngest is stuck to his side, but the other two really only want to see him if he can do something for him. It is awful and they should be ashamed of themselves. Last summer was pretty bad and I couldn't keep my mouth shut; so I sat his daughter down, the 13 year old. I finally told her that what she was doing was wrong. If she wants to spend time with her dad, then she should. He'd be tickled pink. But I also told her that she doesn't have the right to just call him \"to take her here and take her there\" or \"can you buy this for me\"? I told her I noticed it with her for awhile now and since I'm a \"witness\" it's more of the truth. You know? She cried and walked out of the room. I wasn't nasty and I didn't yell. I think I got my point across because it has happened in a long time. Sometimes you just have to step up to the plate and say something. They need someone to explain to them that what they're doing is wrong. They don't have to like it, but it's not up to them; they aren't in charge. Your spouse most likely won't say anything about it; if  anything, he'll agree with you.  With things like this, do what you think is right. Just don't be nasty or yell or anything. You may get them to think differently when giving a point of view if you are diplomatic about it.", 10354, "58130bd144cb6f63881002f5d3c398e5aa", 0],
