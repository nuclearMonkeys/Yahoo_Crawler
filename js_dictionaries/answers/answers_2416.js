Its not about pride, but your self respect. You have to heal from all their years of damaging you. Seriously look into other options such as food stamps, rental assistance, and don't live just to work, you don't have to and its not healthy. If you're that depressed, i seriously suggest talking to some kind of social worker and get into a program that accelerates your life, so you don't spend the whole time working a dead end minimum wage job.

	126627 : ["Yes, you're right that you have to have faith that those teaching you are providing accurate information. However, most of the time it's information that is easy to prove on your own. For example, when the teacher tells you that 2+2=4, it's very simple to take two groups of two objects and place them together to count 4 objects.  Same when you learn spelling rules or history or almost any other topic. You can go to another source and confirm the information yourself.  Science is not exempt from this. But as you learn enough about basic scientific principles, it's not difficult to accept certain things as fact because they follow logically. When you study geology, it's not difficult to see how various processes shape rocks when you actually go out and observe the rocks and compare what you see with other places with known geology. Similarly, it's not difficult to see the various ages of fossils in the geologic record as you observe which fossils are embedded in which layers. This provided a very visual confirmation of the idea that simple animals came before increasingly complex animals.  The problem with religion is it doesn't meet the same standard. You are asked to believe something because it is written in the Bible, but most things can not be independently verified apart from the Bible. And virtually anything that isn't directly from the Bible is based on someone else's observations from the Bible. Therefore you have to have faith in the person preaching from the Bible and have faith that the Bible is telling the truth. That requires a different kind of faith than accepting that 2+2=4 or that mammoths lived after dinosaurs.", 10899, "3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa", 3],
	126628 : ["When I think about it, is there any proof that earth is round? Maybe it's flat, as all the Church were pretending for ages and burned everyone who was saying the opposite. I'm not atheist but agnostic, and if I'm sure that every divinity based religion is human-made, I believe in science. I believe because I don't have time nor will to prove everything again what others proved already with logic, but I believe because I know that I myself can prove it myself when I want. And gods that tell they are right and the others are wrong are for me people without any argumentation. Like kids. I don't believe in kids that claim to be almighty, eternal and all this crap. But I believe in my friends and in some people, because they're here and I know them. I don't know God. So, I believe god, or gods, may exist (because there is no proof that they don't exist), but he, or they, never wrote the Bible or the Coran. That, I'm full 100% sure.", 10899, "None", 0],
	126629 : ["I have trust in a teacher if I find them to be a good teacher.  I don't just trust what I read in one book, if I want to know about something I investigate as many sources as I can, and try to see it from as many angles as I can, and look at the steps that lead the writer to come to the conclusion they have reached, and then draw my own conclusions. The point being, a teacher is a real person, being real, it is possible to decide whether to put your trust in them or not, based on the person they are, and their track record.   A book is a real thing, so it's possible to study it, it's origins, find out about it's author and their other work and methods, and therefore decide whether you agree with all, or some or none of it. Something has to be real, before trust or faith can be put in it, because those things, to one extent or another, have to be earned, or at least some indecation of the nature of them has to be apparent:)", 10899, "3cnGPqt3aa", 0],

As a former believer (Roman Catholic)...I saw very little that a child might perceive as a connection to religion.   I 'm old enough to know ( over 50) children need more than a book or movie to turn them from something that has been drummed into them since birth.  If Christians are going to cry wolf at every artistic piece produced...they're in for a busy millenium.  Minds are changing toward all religions and spiritual endeavors.   Our young people have access to information worldwide.  The best thing is to teach true humanistic values that transend culture, country , or race.  Teach compassion and respect for life and liberty. Teach to love and care for your fellow human being.

	126643 : ["Relax. Like other cases, the noise comes from a limited number of people. If you let it bother you, you'll do more damage than if you just respond with some basic information about the Church and useful links for those who really want to find out what we believe and teach. Official \"Mormon\" links:  -- an introduction to the LDS faith.  -- the \"Mormon\" (LDS) view of Jesus Christ.  -- contains many resources for members and those who are interested in the religion, including on-line scriptures, lesson manuals, talks, policies, and aids for LDS members. Non-official link:  -- an LDS apologist site that responds to the claims made about the LDS Church by critics and anti-Mormon groups. A number of years ago, I read an interesting report in our local newspaper. Those who fight against the church do not like this report and have essentially kept it hidden. When I read the report, I was not surprised. A study conducted about forty to fifty years ago by the University of Washington (in Seattle) in comparative religion show that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints followed more of the teachings and practices found in the New Testament than any other Christian denomination included in the study. The Mormons came in at about 96 percent in following the New Testament teachings and practices (which include those taught by Jesus) while the next closest denomination was below 80 percent.

I would be in the same situation as you are if I decided to leave the situation which is very harmful to me.  I feel that I would be able to obtain help from the church nearest to me (even though I am not a member of that church), but I would want to check this out first before I would attempt any movement at all.   By being in a city far away from your family, you have taken the first step (an important one at that) and, if it is possible, can access agencies where you will be able to obtain the help that you need until you  are able to live out on your own and not with the help of others.

I understand the fear from the threats, and the feeling like you'll never be free of those people, but you can get free, and to do that you really do need to get yourself as far away as possible. I would definitely suggest applying for food stamps - without your family knowing about it of course. That way, you will be able to devote your income to paying the rent and bills, without having to worry about how you will eat. You are not \"milking the government\" if you really do need the support, so don't let people dissuade you from getting help!
