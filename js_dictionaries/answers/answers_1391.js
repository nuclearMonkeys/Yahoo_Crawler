	75169 : ["Out of 9 questions she did not answer 6 to most people's satisfaction (meaning thoroughly) and 2 she didn't answer at all but went off on some folksy tangent. I counted 28 folksy statements, 10 \"Nuculars\", I'm sorry but 99% of the world pronounces it as it is spelled Nuclear, ONE \"U\" And just because it is considered \"acceptable\" by SOME folks, those folks tend to be undereducated and backwards people.  And she used the term \"Maverick\" 9 times as well. LEt me tell you people something. Do you KNOW what a \"maverick\" IS? A maverick is a cow (steer) that refuses to remain with the herd. By that definition, McCain is NOT a maverick. Why? Because he is trying to get the herd to follow HIM. A true maverick will RUN from that herd which is following him. Is THAT the sort of president that you want? A maverick is a rebel, a rebel who is so simply for the sake of rebellion. What this nation does NOT need right now is a maverick, what it needs is a LEADER. A leader who will think and carefully consider ALL the options on the table and maybe even seek out a few more and then make a truly informed decision, one that is best for the Nation as awholel, not just for the \"business\"sector, because they \"create jobs\". The economists count job creation as ANY job. MOst jobs that have been created in the last 10 years have NOT been what one would consider a job that offers a way to pull oneself up. A minimum wage job is NOT a job, it is slavery with a \"few\" dollars thrown in to make it have the appearence of NOT being slavery.  Folks have been yelling about our Nation becoming Socialist and yet they are MORE than happy to Socialize the business sector with enormous bail outs. Folks have been screaming about universal healthcare as being \"rationed\" healthcare. So what? HOw is NO healthcare better than rationed healthcare? Oh yes we DO have the BEST healthcare in the world, but it is ONLY if you have the funds available to receive it. No money and you get NO healthcare. People, you are confusing Socialism with Dictatorship. Right NOW America IS a dictatorship, no, not a political one but rather an economic one. The Wealthy have the power to dictate wages, benefits, working conditions, hours, and in some case, even where one lives and what one does during non-work time. Go to   ..... See where ONE person said that entrepeneurs and innovaters do not OWE anyone else a thing, He is totally WRONG on that. They OWE use a fair wage for a fair days work, they OWE us the chance to make a liveable wage, with reasonable benefits and leave us the ability to set aside for our old age. But NOI, there's too much collusion between employers and they all pay about the same, so saying that no one is forcing you to take a job under those conditions is false. Oh there may NOT be collusion as defined by LAWS. BUT, if one employer asks another \"what do you pay your workers?' and just responds to the answer with \"OH, OK.\", to ME, that IS collusion, even though there was never any agreement to set the wages at the same level. (the legal definition of collusion). For that asker is going to return and cut wages to match the rest of the employers in the area. I'm not saying theworkers should make the SAME as the CEO, but there is NO excuse for a CEO to be making 480 times what a typical worker in his organization, either. The gap between the rich and the working poor has expanded exponentially in the last 12 years and there is NO end in sight. It is NOT a matter of \"redistributionof wealth\" it is a matter of fairness and justice. NO business makes it's money from the CEO. Every dime is generated by it's workers. You can have to BEST product and the most inncovativedesign, but if no one will work for you to MAKE that product, then guess what? You aren't making one red cent. There ARE companies out there who DO the right thing and treat their workers with respect and offer a fair wage for a fair days work. You know what? Those companies have NOT gone belly up. Many are prospering and succeeding beyond their wildest expectations. When your employees are happy and not constantly worrying about how they're going to make from paycheck to paycheck, they are happy, they are glad to come to work and are productive. They work harder and have better morale. They appreciate being able to work for someone who cares about them and return that attitude with care of their own. If all companies actually did this, Unions would never have been developed because there would have been no need for them. The workers would have felt safe, would have felt comfotable, would have felt appreciated for their labors. Things would have been fair and JUST. Good employers have NO trouble finding workers who have an excellent \"work ethic\". There are ALWAYS people lining up for every opening in those companies, no matter WAHT the job, from floor sweepers to executive positions. BAD companies get STUCK with those who have no work ethi", 8790, "ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa", 1],

You will notice that the article starts of with the phrase Holiday shopping, not   shopping.

If not for the huge merchandising campaigns I guess we'd have no holiday at all. I'm not a Christian so lower your blood pressure... but when you take God out of your life you also take out morality and responsibility.  Responsibility to yourself and to your fellow man.
