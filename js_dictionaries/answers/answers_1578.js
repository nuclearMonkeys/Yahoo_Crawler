	84573 : ["Again with the race-baiting.  This is terrible stuff.  You don't support Obama and you're automatically a racist.  Too bad, the way this campaign has gone and the way Obama supporters are acting.  Senator Clinton was simply pointing out exit polling which showed clearly which demographics she is running strong in.  One group are whites, and blue collar whites speciifically.  And she is doing much better with this group than Obama.  So that's somehow racist?  What an idiot!  Is it also racist to point out that Obama is carrying about 90% of the black vote?  These are facts, and in no way shape or form could they be construed as racist. Grow up!", 9169, "None", 0],
	84574 : ["When you say a candidate cannot not attract a certain race of people, and the candidate is black and the race of people happens to be white, and it is said with enthusiasm for her own campaign, I would say it certainly sounds racist. I think if you not racist, and you saw that your own campaign was getting a lot of white voters, and that your opposition was black, you might feel a bit saddened at that fact. You wouldn't trump it up and glorify it. Only if you were really insensitive to racist attitudes would you try to take advantage of this as an argument for people to vote for you. I don't think Hilliary is a racist in particular, but as this campaign has shown, she would do anything to win: lie, cry, laugh, get drunk, buddy up to McCain, use her family, switch her positions on NAFTA, cable and financial deregulation, welfare reform, perhaps even her vote on the Iraq war, threaten Iran with annihilation etc..", 9169, "None", 1],
	84575 : ["Like I have said in other answers, that I have given on Yahoo answers: Hillary Clinton to me will do or say anything to win. Hillary will change her mannerism to act more manly, have a drink of whisky and beer at a bar, go to the Nascar Speedway and do other things to act like she more manly. She'll make up lies about being in sniper fire, and then say she made a mistake. When anyone knows you will not forget about running from bullets flying over your head. Now that she sees the end of the road has come for her, she has one more trick up her sleeve, and that is to get the whites to move to her side. She now wants to divide the races and the Democratic Party which is 25% African-American. I'm just glad and thankful that most of us have moved pass that. I have never been so proud of my White brothers and sisters, if it was for many of them, and including the different races,  Barack Obama wouldn't have gotten as far as he has. Even thou Mrs. Clinton is now trying to pull the race card, and trying to turn back the times when there were division among the races, by Barack Obama getting as far ahead as he has, has proven in itself that America is changing for the Good. This is a new America, a new Generation, and we are all Americans, and have the same hopes and dreams, as Barack Obama has stated.  Like I've said, I'm glad we have grown as a Nation of People, and all any of us want right now is a change, I'm tired of the same older politicians who have fed us the same lies, and it continues on like a revolving door, let try someone new who wants change, and give that person a chance to see if they can do better than the Politicians from before. Let's forget what Hillary Clinton and her people are trying to do, trying to divide the races, and continue to stick together, and get the right person in office, for me right now that's Barack Obama!", 9169, "6gOTUyndaa", -1],

	84581 : ["The problem here is that Christianity has become culture-identified, so to question it seems to some people to be an attack on their very identity.  The religious mindset of Jesus's time cannot accurately be comprehended today; the world of that age was a world of incredible barbarity and hardship.  People needed religious ideals to grasp on and hold as a literal life-preserver.  It was inconceivable to not view the world in less than spiritual terms at that time, and this spirituality informed Jesus's message--as spread by his followers. If Jesus and his followers could be transported to the world of today, they would view it as an absolute paradise in comparison with what they knew, with such luxury as to boggle their minds.  They would view the promise of heaven as literally fulfilled, and the religious zeal that carried them through their hard life would more than likely evaporate. The missionary needs his hardship, it seems.", 9174, "KCSC80oKaa", -2],

	84588 : ["Here's why... The \"one-of-a-kind hard to find engine that is a little rusty\" is completely corrupt and denies sick people coverage. It's not \"a little rusty.\" It's rusted all the way through and no longer resembles an engine. It needs to be thrown away. It doesn't work... It rewards corporate greed and it allows healthcare to be a moneymaking venture. The current system allows providers to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Does that seem right to you? Does that need reform? Do you know that the government runs medicare? Is that a bad idea, too? Should we allow medicare to become another moneymaking scam so our seniors can feel the sting of a privatized system? Look, you're in 8th grade and it seems as thought your parent's politics might be shaping your views here. Talk to people who have had their insurance claims denied for ridiculous reasons or who can't afford the cost of health care because they own a small business or home business. (Do you know that the smaller the business, the MORE they have to pay for health insurance? Does that seem right?) Corporate greed has gone out of control with the current health care system where they make more money the more they DENY people coverage, so that's where their incentive lies. So do your homework here.", 9166, "None", 0],

If a person is in debt 75,000 in credit card debt, the last thing you should do is charge up more debt. That is his plan thus far. On ALL fronts.  What are mutiny rules? Since we have Biden, who is a joke, Pelosy who is more of a joke - when can they be removed and what would it take legitimately to do so? They are all obviously incompetent and impotent.

Are you trying to break up their relationship? Just being honest with yourself really helps figure things out and take them into perspective, etc. Of course, my husband wouldn't have me toss out my friends to be with him.

You will have people that will come to you because of both example and the happiness you exude. And they will be the ones that will listen. I think preaching serves to make non-believers more resistant. Preaching on the streets makes a person look  as though there might be mental problems and might even be a danger to vehicle traffic. Skip calling people sinful too, leave that determination to God. Go straight to the real message when someone shows interest. Simply God does exist and Jesus died and arose to take on and forgive the sins of all generations. And don't just pass yourself off as a generic Christian. Better to give your affiliation. Many have been unsatisfied with on denomination, but might fond another to their acceptance.  - Raised Bible Church, turned athiest, attend Episcopal, now a Christian with mostly ancestral Prespetirian leanings.", 9174, "9qKW1exnaa", 2],
	84607 : ["First of all going to church is not the \"Christian word,\" it is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Second, there are some people who seem pushy at times and even over-zealous. But I find it hard to fault people for being excited about something they believe in especially if they are not causing any physical harm to anyone. If the worse any Christian does is annoy you then I think they are hardly worth blaming for pushing you away from God. After all there are far worse things people do in the world than annoy people. The world might be a better place if the worse anyone did was be annoying. Maybe you could visit his congregation just to shut him up. Make a deal with him: \"Neighbor, I appreciate your invitation but I feel like you are pressing us a bit. If we go visit your church once, will you agree not to invite us again?\" That's a good one for you; have you at least visited his church? Would you have the same complaint about a neighbor who pesters you about coming over for a BBQ or watching their kid's ball game? Seeking and following God is your choice not a matter of someone pushing you into it. ADDITONAL COMMENT: From a Christian perspective, this faith is of God and so to reject it is to reject God (according to the Bible). Do not confuse the Southern Baptist denomination for Christianity. That is still your choice as well, no one can push you away from that. Truth is not measured by deeds. I still wonder, if he has a good reputation with your family why should this one thing hinder you? Have you even tried talking to him about his approach? In all fairness, getting people to come to church is not the Christian message, it is salvation in Christ alone. There are not many roads to God, only one. Jesus said He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except they come through Him (John 14:6). I don't think anyone can ever give out enough of that message. Is it ever enough to stop caring about people?", 9174, "k2MI9Dj0aa", 0],
	84608 : ["The bible says when His word has reached all the world then He will return for His children. I agree telling people that they need the Lord in their life often does provoke them but maybe the reason it provokes them is because deep down in their heart they already know it. I know my Grandma kept me in our churches prayers for years. Because she wasn't sure I was a Christian, you know what I wasn't yes it was embarrassing humiliating and everything else you can think of but after all those years guess who came back to God yeah ME! If I could go back and thank her for all those prayers oh goodness I would hug her neck and thank her. There is no telling where I would have been without all those prayers.     WE ALL SIN every Christian sins, I don't know why people expect us to be perfect because we are no more perfect than a non-Christian person the difference is we are covered by the blood of Jesus. (We do strive to be the best we can be though). Because we ask Him to become the Lord of our life. That is the difference If people want to persecute me for loving God I say Go Ahead, I will love you any way and continue to pray for your salvation like it or not you will continue to be a friend in my book.
