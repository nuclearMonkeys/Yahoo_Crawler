	79055 : ["You have not trained the clicker correctly then... Training the Clicker: Sit down with your dog and click the clicker. AS SOON as the clicker makes a noise give him a treat. You need to repeat this until he is in the room doing something else and hears the click and comes running for a treat. In your dog's head click needs to equal treat.  To Teach Sit: With one hand put the treat over his nose. With your other hand push his bottom down. Sat \"sit\". Right when he sits give him the treat and say \"good sit Fido\".", 8971, "GBVLsOeBaa", 0],
	79056 : ["The issue is that dogs are poor generalizers - it's not that the dog is \"sneaky, greedy\" etc, but that they have no intrinsic sense of morality or \"rightness\" and so only think something is \"bad\" if it has bad consequences. If it has never had bad consequences except with a human in the room, then how on earth are they to know that the rules still apply with the human out of the room? You need to train in such a way that corrections and rewards occur when the dog does not think you are present - i.e. hiding around the corner. Read here  I personally owned a Labrador Retriever (read: chow hound) that could be left 6\" from a hot dog in a sit-stay for half an hour and not touch it - the word was \"mine\" and it meant that you don't touch that, even if I am not in the room, even if whatever, you DO NOT touch that. You could leave a plate of food on the floor for hours and not only would she not touch it, she would also keep the other animals (dogs and cats) from touching it.  In all probability, these dogs studied were just not properly trained/proofed before the experiment. With \"proofing\" to set them up and catch them in the act to give", 8971, "z4NbVX3vaa", 0],

	79067 : ["When i trained my 3 dogs \"sit\" I tried the treat method also and they responded just as yours does. Instead of really \"pushing\" his butt down start your hand on the top of his head and pet him firmly all the way down to his rear (don't touch the bottom part!) while saying \"sit\" repeatedly. Once he sits say some thing along the lines off \"good boy!\" \"Good Name!\" and pet him, and maybe every other time give him a treat. Do this as often as you like, but not doing it enough will cause him/her to need to relearn it. He/She probably won't do it on the first day, but after he does start to do it, \"pet\" him less firmly, and eventually you can just say \"sit\" and he/she will sit.", 8971, "XB4a3vjzaa", 0],

Was it hot and as you ordered? 3.  Was the drivers attitude good? 4.  Would you order from the same place again? If the answers are yes, give a good tip.  $5.00 or so.

I had to do that all of 5 times with training, and now my pup gets it dead on every time, on FIRST command.  Whatever you do, don't say \"sit sit sit sit sit sit\", then praise when he finally does it.  This is inadvertently teaching the pup that he doesn't need to sit right away, he can do it after you ask him to the 10th time and he'll still get rewarded!  Only say it once, then gently put him in the position (if he doesn't do it after three seconds), then give him LOTS of praise.  It works.  Trust me.", 8971, "6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa", 0],

Often times, food workers who might get tips are paid less than minimum wage as it is assumed that tips will make up the difference.
