Rose Tyler had that kind of ditsy, slutty demeanor and appearance and came the closest to a love affair with the Doctor in the history of the show.  Martha Jones was, by far, the most intelligent of the newer companions and was about the most useful in the newest series. I really enjoyed her character. Donna Noble was great. She wasn't the most attractive by any means, but she was the funniest and the most fun. Amy Pond, hands down, is the hottest companion ever. She doesn't add much to the show as far as character, but it's early yet. We'll see. In my opinion, I'd have to call a three-way tie. I know it's wishy-washy, but I really can't narrow it down. Donna Noble for being the most 'fun' character. Martha Jones for being the most interesting. Amy Pond for being the fire of my loins.", 9588, "None", 2],

	96572 : ["You want me to choose the \"best\" companion? what an arbitrary notion... Ok I'll do it, the best companion is, Donna Noble.  Here's my reasoning: Rose came into the Doctors life after his regeneration following the fight with the Master in California in 1999 (8th Doctor TV movie). He was alone and Rose saved him from himself. When she got trapped \"Over There\" the Doctor was lost until a bride literally popped in on him. The Doctor was angry at losing Rose and had Donna not been there the Doctor would've died and things would've turned out much different (Runaway Bride, Turn Left), Martha at first a \"Rebound Companion\" for Rose quickly became one of his best companions and after she left him she found her calling protecting Earth (first in UNIT then Torchwood, followed by Freelancing with hubby Mickey Smith) which brings me to  Donna. Donna called the Doctor on himself more than once, her favorite line to use was \"Oy don't go all Spaceman!\" Donna showed the Doctor that even fixed points in time can be changed in little ways (Fires of Pompeii) and that even though she wasn't born traditionally, to love his daughter (The Doctor's Daughter). Donna showed the Doctor and us the viewer that anyone can grow to be a hero, even the \"Best Temp in Chiswick\".", 9588, "33730b2d5d94d1c6ef837d1886ef7750aa", 2],
