I labored all night, at about 5am the anesthesiologist came back in and gave me two different kinds of drugs in my epidural that finally worked.  I started the evening already at 3 centimeters and by 5am when I got the new drugs, I had only progressed from 3 centimeters to 7 centimeters.  As soon as I got the new meds in my system, my whole body relaxed and finally managed to just let everything open up.   I went from 7 centimeters to 10 centimeters within 45 minutes and was ready to push by 5:45 in the morning.  My daughter was born at 6:23am.  I kind of hope I get induced with the next one too.
