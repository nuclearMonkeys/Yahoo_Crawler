	103945 : ["I have done that...Quite a number of years ago now...I was unable to do it myself, I had to have a woodworker friend use a router to route out body of the bass in order to fit the pickups in place (he also had to route out the pickguard). It did not seem to be real difficult for him to do, and it didn't take long, but like I said, he was a friend, so I don't  know how much it would have cost if I had to take it to a luthier. The actual wiring was no different than any other wiring so if you can solder and know how to wire pickups thats no problem at all...Hope this helped. Good luck", 9867, "ucLaXaMRaa", 0],

It is great light and easy to push around, while still having enough room to not feel cramp.

You can get the basic model at Walmart for under $200 or you can get one of the fancier models (walnut stocks, stainless steel, etc.).
