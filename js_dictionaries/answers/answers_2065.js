	109028 : ["The literature on the effects of the pill on an unborn child is mixed.  It is reported that it is unlikely to increase the risk of birth defects, but also that you should stop taking the pill at least three months before trying to become pregnant as it could harm the fetus.  It is also recommended that women who could be pregnant should not take the pill.  Messing with your reproductive hormones is generally not a great thing for a developing fetus, and the companies that make these pills aren't going to publish anything that indicates their medication might be dangerous.  On the other hand, saying that pregnant women shouldn't take the pill basically just means that it hasn't been proven safe, and not necessarily that it was proven dangerous.  I doubt that a clinical trial of birth control pills in pregnant women would ever get approved as the effects on the unborn children are potentially catastrophic, so the most likely thing is that they simply don't know.  So what I would take away from that is that they don't really know exactly what it does to an unborn child, but it's better safe than sorry.  However, the whole point of birth control pills is so you won't get pregnant even if you don't use a condom, so stopping taking birth control because you had sex without a condom doesn't really make much sense.  So long as you have been taking the pill for a while (I don't remember the exact lenght of time, but I think it's two or three months), and haven't missed a dose recently, you shouldn't worry about being pregnant.", 10074, "None", -3],

Despite years of this accident happening, there's very little evidence that exposure to the hormones in birth control pills causes birth defects. Still, the birth control pill is a potent estrogen. Lessons learned from women who took diethylstilbestrol — a synthetic estrogen that was later linked with cancer — to prevent miscarriage in early pregnancy suggest that such exposure should be minimized.
