You will never be satisfied in a platonic-only situation when, deep down, you long for more. And, should either of you suddenly become romantically involved with someone else, it will be a miserable friendship indeed watching your ex and their new love interest from the sidelines.

As this is a long distance relationship, it's hard to tell how you will fare in the future. That being said, I think you need to prioritise yourself in this scenario as morally, you are not doing anything wrong but your parents are afraid due to xenophobia and the possible \"shame\" it will bring. Are you financially stable? If so, good. If not, don't tell your parents about the relationship anymore until you are. Then if worst comes to worst, you can survive.

Long distance relationships generally don't work out, but it's YOU that will hurt from it, not them. They are being over dramatic, and trying to guilt you into doing what they want you to do. I suggest you put a stop to the childish games. You have to tell them that you're not gonna play into their guilt trips anymore. Remind them that you love and appreciate them and you know they care about you, but this is YOUR decision, not theirs. If something as small as their son being in a relationship they don't like is “killing them” and causing stress to that point, what will they do when something actually bad happens? I'm sure they mean well, but they're playing childish games instead of talking to you like an adult and telling you how they really feel.

So I'm gonna share with you the things I did to accept the fact that my crush and I will never be more than friends and that I have to love myself and move on. The first thing I tried was stop texting him. I know it is something you have tried already and it didnt go well in your case, but what I did to avoid blocking was saying something like \"I really dont wanna get used to you anymore. You know i will always be here for you and the best of happiness and sucess is all i wish you\", I asked him to talk just once a week or once a month to know about him, and he dubiously accepted. After that he felt unsured about the agreement but I had to explain that it was something needed for his good and mine. We kept talking once a week for 1 and half year, I met new ppl, I tried to focus on loving myself and he started dating someone. When he told me he was in a relationship, I didnt feel bad at all but happy instead bc I already knew that something like that was gonna happen. I started dating someone too, and that is another thing that made me distracted myself. Another thing I also did was thinking about my crush like an impossible, like that kind of crush you have on a celebrity, you can say they are cute and nice but they dont know about your existance and alos thinking in that way will make you accept you like your crush but you cant have them. This thing leads to the other thing I also did: accept i like my crush. The more you say you dont like your crush, the more you get attached to them.  In few words, it is impossible to get rid of your crush but wishing them the best in this life, be their best friend, learn to live just knowing about then occasionally and give yourself a chance to like other ppl. We dont have only one chance to fall in love but thousand of chances. And never forget to love yourself first to love others.  ", 4556, "urt5xmw6aa", 3],

BS.  You haven't accepted that.  Not even close.  Friend zone!!! 4)  >>  ...I know I can't have her and have accepted that... Friend zone!!!  Accept it.  I've been there.  It took her 20 years from the time I met her to finally get a divorce from a bad marriage, and to add salt to the wound, she didn't want me.  How's that for life? Date other women.  Forget about this one.  She doesn't want you.  You would know it if she did.  You have as much chance with her as I have with Jennifer Aniston.  Forgetaboutit. Get a real girlfriend.  It may take time, but things like this do take time.  Welcome to life.  Get a girlfriend.  Get a friend with benefits.  Get deeper into your hobbies.  Go to Meetup.com and get with a group that interests you.  There will be girls enjoying the same things you enjoy.  Pretend this one does not exist.  Because for you, she doesn't. .", 4556, "5P6m4Gs4aa", 0],
