Try to get the kids over for a sleep over for a movie popcorn baking cookies or making smoothies. These are things that girls should love to do with easy approval from their parents to join.

Nobody made fun of me, but she went missing. I found her hanging from the curtain rod on the bus. It broke my heart to think that people could be so mean. I just laughed it off at the time but it did hurt. But I got over it  ... and I still have her (but don't need her so much these days) I think I would have loved advice like you gave your daughter at the time. Maybe just add that sometime people who are your friends do things that are thoughtless and not very nice because they think they are being funny and don't give it any more thought than that. Being strong enough to deal with issues like thjis even at ten will hold her in good stead for the rest of her life. I think turing the tables on people who are mean by being sensitive to what they are lacking in social skills makes you a better and stronger person. Takes a very well grounded little girl to say to her friends. I love my Barney and Winnie the Pooh is timeless thank you very much. Kids grow up way to fast these days and it is such a shame.

The problem isnt with your wife so much as the human nature aspect of the situation.  People do things and push bounds.  It's only natural.  However, when you break through one of those fences that define a relationship the protection and security slips out that same  hole.  The trust is gone my friend and so if it were me, even though she admitted it to you and came clean, the action was still done and on your wedding day no less.  Of all the days to cheat, that by far has to be the most disrespectful day to do it on.  If you forget it you will need to have a cat scan because something there is wrong.  If you choose to look at it as a last fling, she still cheated and that means that at the peak of your relationship, when all was being finalized and the love was strong she still had the gall to cheat and the remorseless mindset to still marry you.

Perhaps she is starting to be the woman she wants her daughters eyes to see and had to bury this memory. I am not certain it has relieved her guilt maybe momentarily, but she has now invited disrespect, jealous, and doubt into the marriage for one night with an ex?.

She has shown her repentance, but God doesn't have to take the burden off when you are the one that she was supposed to come to in the first place.  She should ASK you for forgiveness (These words!) Most people do not understand the power of forgiveness and the path (and words) to follow to affect this. This would be a wonderful time to show the world the power of real love in marriage and you go to her with your words of forgiveness. It has to be heartfelt and it has to be genuine. Like God, when he forgives us of our sins, they are cast to the bottom of the ocean. You are now in the single, unique position to offer redemptive healing to another person who just happens to be your wife. What an awesome thing! If you do this, like God, you have to cast this to the bottom of the ocean and never, ever bring it up again.

	95914 : ["Lakers- Obviously the lakers have improved drastically. They traded practically nothing for steve nash, and a young developing center for the best center in the league. Should be able to beat OKC and make the nba finals where they can beat Miami or possibly Boston. Enough said. Philly-There will be no carryover from an expected and feel-good run to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. Instead, the Sixers have completely restructured their roster. Now, that roster has a focal point, as long as Bynum decides to stay long-term. With a player that can draw double-teams, the Sixers have a chance to build a much better offense than they've had in the past. And with an athletic seven-footer in the paint, they'll be just fine defensively. But things will take some time, and at this point, all the pieces don't fit quite right. Still, with a young and talented core, the Sixers' ceiling is now higher. And just where they stand in the Eastern Conference over the next few years will be determined by the development of young guards Holiday and Turner. Nets- No they didn't get Dwight, but they did better then Dallas in recovering. The Nets are moving to Brooklyn, and they're taking a pretty good (and very expensive) team with them. Keeping Deron Williams was the most important move, but he probably wouldn't have re-signed if Joe Johnson and Gerald Wallace weren't already on board. Lopez's health and development will be the key on both sides of the ball. Injuring his right foot twice, he played just five games last season. He's only 24 years old, but he's now earning a max contract and could be truly healthy for the first time in over two years. To put additional pressure on him, the Nets don't have a back-up center. Boston- It's hard to get better then getting to a game 7 against the NBA champs. But the celtics are looking likely to do it. Losing Ray Allen looked bad, but replacing him with Jason Terry and Courtney Lee was probably an improvement. With both competent defenders and great scorers, they will fight for game time and courtney lee may be pushed to the 3 for some small ball when Avery Bradley gets back. If Bradley was healthy in the playoffs then maybe the celtics would've made the finals. He only would've helped! His D on wade had been excellent leading up to the shoulder injury and next season he will be back, healthy and ready to help Boston get back to the post-season. So the celtics were one quarter away from the NBA finals, then they add Sullinger, Bradley, Jeff Green, Wilcox, Jason Terry and Courtney Lee, while only losing bench warmers and an injured Ray Allen. They have some tough competition, but they are oh so close to banner #18 T'wolves- The Minnesota Timberwolves have had an extremely busy off-season, adding players left right and center. Minnesota picked up two incredibly risky wing players, both of whom have every possibility of working out, in Andrei Kirilenko and Brandon Roy. The other piece to the puzzle that they added was Kirilenko's Russian national team companion Alexey Shved, a smart 2-guard with point guard skills and some interesting abilities.So long as the injury bug stays away, which might be a big reach with Roy on board, this team should end up in the playoffs. Must mention Miami. It seems hard to get better from what they had last year, but it isn't really considering their bench. But not only did they improve, they REALLY improved, First they picked up Ray Allen, and then they took a chance by signing Rashard Lewis, who had just been released by the New Orleans Hornets. Obviously the big news here is that one of last year's best three-point shooters is now a member of the Heat, and depending on how his body is feeling, he can be a little bit more than just a three-point shooter. The Lewis signing is nothing more than a \"wait and see\" signing. If he can play and produce, terrific. If not, who cares? Also a thumbs up to new orleans. Not sure if they're playoff contenders yet, but they're on the way up and should be able to compete in the next few seasons, as anthony davis and the rest of their young players develop.", 9567, "R3GUSbp1aa", 0],

I would let it go as something that happend in the past, you have been happy sence then, don't tear up your family for a former mistake.  On another issue however, I would wonder what would prompt her to do this, even if it was a long time ago. I'm sorry to tell you this, but to me, sence it was a old boyfriend, it sounds like he was better able to please her. Her knowing that she was getting married, probibly thought like it was her last opportunity to have some Good D*ck.

Washington Wizards - Underrated team going into next year and I feel can make a 6th or 7th seed in the Eastern Conference. They picked up Bradley Beal in the draft who should be a top 10 SG in the league in a couple of years. They also got Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza for practically nothing, which will help them defensively. And Nene and Okafor will be great duo together.

Philadelphia 76ers - They got rid of a bad contract from Elton Brand and was able to trade Andre Iguodala for Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson. Also signed backup Center Kwame Brown. And Spencer Hawes would be a good trading chip with the addition of Bynum. They are underrated going into this year again. (PG- Jrue Holiday SG- Evan Turner SF- Dorrell Wright PF- Thaddeus Young C- Andrew Bynum) 4. Minnesota Timberwolves - Additions of Brandon Roy and AK47 brings veteran experience which the Wolves needed. They also got Chase Budinger and Greg Stiemsma who are two players that are good to have on your bench and brings lots of depth to the Wolves bench. Ricky Rubio should get back healthy and help lead this team to the playoffs. (PG- Ricky Rubio SG- Brandon Roy SF- Andrei Kirilenko PF- Kevin Love C- Nikola Pekovic) 5.
