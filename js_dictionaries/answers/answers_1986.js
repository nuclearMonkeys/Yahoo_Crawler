	105052 : ["Actually seeing Lord Krishna means with eyes anointed with prema - love. Love - devotion -bhakti- is the real qualification not mundane qualifications.  SB 8.6.12 P   The Demigods and Demons Declare a Truce    Only by the practice of bhakti-yoga can one achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and see Him face to face (premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena  h sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti). One cannot see the Lord by other methods, such as karma, jnana or yoga. Under the direction of the spiritual master, one must cultivate bhakti-yoga (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam). Then, even within this material world, although the Lord is not visible, a devotee can see Him. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah) and in Srimad-Bhagavatam (bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah). Thus by devotional service one can achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is not visible or understandable to materialistic persons. TLK Vs 8     Devahuti Desires Transcendental Knowledge    Those who are learned and intelligent look to the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief from the threefold miseries of material existence. Although this material world is nothing but darkness, people are very proud of their eyes. They are always saying, \"Can you show me God?\" The answer to that is: \"Have you the eyes to see God?\" Why is the emphasis placed on seeing? Certainly, God can be seen, as stated in Brahma-samhita (5.38), premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: \"Govinda [Krsna] is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed by the pulp of love.\"    If we are devotees, lovers of God, the ointment of love will clear our eyes. In order to see God, we have to cleanse our eyes by wiping away the cataracts of material contamination. Although we may be eager to see God, we cannot see Him with these material eyes. Not only can we not see Him, but we cannot understand Him, although His name is there. Understanding God means first of all understanding His name. Therefore from the beginning we should chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. God is not different from His name. Krsna's name and Krsna's person are the same. \"Absolute\" means that Krsna's name, form, place, dress, pastimes and everything are nondifferent from Him. Krsna is present in His name, but because we have no love for Him, we cannot see Him. JSD 2.7            Entering the Spiritual World    In his Brahma-samhita, Lord Brahma describes the qualifications we require to see God: premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena  h sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti. Those who have developed love of God can constantly see God before them, twenty-four hours a day. The word sadaiva means \"constantly, twenty-four hours a day.\" If one is actually God-realized, he doesn't say, \"Oh, I saw God yesterday night, but now He's not visible.\" No, He's always visible, because He's everywhere.    Therefore, the conclusion is that we can see Krsna everywhere, but we have to develop the eyes to see Him. We can do that by the process of Krsna consciousness. When we see Krsna, and when we approach Him in His spiritual abode, our life will be successful, our aims will be fulfilled, and we'll be happy and prosperous eternally.   We are worshiping Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person. And this song we were just singing--govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami **--is reaching Him. He's hearing it. You cannot say He's not hearing it. Especially in this scientific age, when radio messages are broadcast thousands and thousands of miles so you can hear them, it is easy to understand how Govinda, Krsna, can hear your sincere prayer. N98:TQE 4   Yoga and Meditation for the Age of Quarrel       books    Similarly, just as you can see a television picture transmitted from thousands and thousands of miles away, you can always see Govinda in your heart if you prepare yourself properly. This is stated in the Brahma-samhita [5.38]: premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena  h sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti [Bs. 5.38]. There is a television within your heart; it is not that you have to purchase the television set--it is there in your heart. And God is also there. You can see Him, you can hear Him, you can talk with Him, provided you repair the machine. And this repairing process is Krsna consciousness.    Now, to repair a television an expert technician is required. Similarly, you require the help of someone expert in the science of Krsna consciousness. Then the machine in your heart will work and you will be able to see Krsna. This is the perfection of yoga", 9908, "UqgCazhGaa", 4],

To decipher it, as per my little knowlegde through reading the Geeta is, what Krishna means to tell Arjun is that even though these activities make one close to God they still are not enough to know  God's true and complete nature.  For that one has to become 'Arjun' having absolute faith and trust in God.  To be an 'Arjuna' is to be only, solely, completely, committed to God through every breathe one takes, each moment one lives, in every morsel one eats... It is then that we can endear ourselves to God and gain the \"patrata\" to be blessed with the \"gyan-chakshu\" so that we can actually see, feel, know and understand the true nature of God and its magnificent Glory.

	105087 : ["The Bhagavad Gita is the divine conversation between a man named Arjuna and God himself in the human form, Lord Krishna. The conversation took place in the middle of the battleground 5137 years ago just before the start of a great war in Kurushastra, India. Spiritual realization and not war is the subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita. It should be understood that it was circumstances that led to the Bhagavad Gita being spoken on the battle ground and the war was not the reason for it's revelation.  The Bhagavad Gita is the word of God, as it was spoken by God himself and not a self declared son of God or prophet. The Bhagavad Gita was spoken by Lord Krishna, 3100 years before Jesus and 3700 years before Muhammad. It is the only known scriptures spoken by God in person. Hinduism is the only religion based on following a God who has been actually seen by millions. All other religions are based on believing in a God who has never been seen. The Bhagavad Gita gives exact information regarding God, the soul, material nature, birth, death and life after death. No other religious scripture provides this information. To protect innocent people from imposters, Arjuna asked Krishna to prove his divinity by exhibiting his universal form, a form that anyone who claims to be God should be prepared to show. Lord Krishna then proves his divinity by revealing his universal form to Arjuna. Arjuna sees the brilliant, glaring unlimited universal manifestations of Lord Krishna. Who reveals in one place, everything that ever was or now is or will be.  What i understand of the verse is that, to see the Lord one does not require the knowledge of vedas or do severe penance. All that is required is true bhakti(devotion). If one's devotion is pure then without the knowledge of the vedas and without doing any penance one may have the divine opportunity of seeing the Lord as Lord himself will come to the devotee and give darshan(show Himself). This is my interpretation hope i am not wrong. ||OM NAMO NARAYANAYA|| Cheers! :)", 9908, "tDHfsMbjaa", 0],
	105088 : ["Okay.  It's called a Ponytail.  Or a Braid.  Or a bun.  If you have long hair, all three of those hairstyles are your best friend when it comes to an amusement park.  I had super long hair for years, and I'd either do a messy bun or a ponytail (since braiding my own hair became difficult.)  Sometimes I'd use a little gel to make it stiff and keep it in place, but that isn't necessary. If I were you, I'd probably stick with a braid since you can go on a lot of rides with your head/hair whipping around, and it won't come out of its style.  (Especially if you put a little gel in to slick it back a little...  keeping it in place.)  You might want to bring a little comb or something to comb out your bangs if they get tangled... Ride it all.  I've never been to this park, but I'd say go for everything.  What do you have to lose? How not to get burned:  SUNSCREEN AND LOTS OF IT!  Get a fairly high SPF and reapply every hour and a half to two hours.  (More often if necessary.)  Make sure you've got a friend that can help you put some on in areas where you can't reach easily. Another way to avoid sunburn is to wear a long sleeve shirt-- not a heavy one, but maybe a light gauze swimsuit cover up (I've seen a few at Old Navy) that covers most of your back/arms and shoulders.  I've done that and avoided sunburns by covering up, at least in the hottest/sunniest part of the day.  (Usually from about 11-2 PM, sometimes later).
