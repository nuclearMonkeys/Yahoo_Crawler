	85967 : ["I would say that a knowledgeable Christian cannot fail to know that homosexuality is sin. I always want the truth, brother, whatever the truth may be and whether or not it squashes some pet doctrine of mine. I studied my bible carefully, studied Greek word meanings, didn't mind the Old Testament, as we all know that many of the laws there, though appropriate for their time, have been superseded by changes in society and advances in civilization. In other words, God was there working with a primitive society and did what He could. Plus some of the laws addressed particular concerns unique to that society and time period. So I ignored what the OT had to say about homosexuality, just in case it was outmoded. I only considered what the NT has to say about homosexuality, and I even used a bible translated by a woman who wanted to be friendly to homosexuals and read her commentary. The upshot of all my study is that homosexuality is still sin.  I would say that the real question is whether a true follower of Christ can excuse sin and pretend it is of no consequence. We are NOT called to judge or condemn the world. That much is clear. If the world engages in sexual and other sins, well, what do we expect? There's a reason sinners are called sinners. But if one called a brother or a sister engages in sin, we are responsible to correct that one gently, always remembering ourselves lest we also fall into sin. In either case, we are NOT free to pretend that something which is clearly designated as sin in the scriptures is, in fact, just fine with God. That would be a lie, and for a Christian to say that homosexuality is not sin is either grossly irresponsible ignorance or it is a lie. That doesn't mean we are responsible to go about condemning homosexuals or even that we should treat this type of sinner differently or with less kindness and respect than we would treat any sinner. We must treat the people of the world like Jesus did, and Jesus was rather a favorite with them. Yet He did not lie to them. He hung out with prostitutes and tax collectors, wine bibbers and gluttons and was severely censured by the religious elite for doing so. He healed their sick and they came into the Kingdom with no illusions that they could bring their luggage packed with sin they didn't want to give up. Yet they came. I wonder if the same result would have come about if He'd instead gone about reaching them by condemning them? Likewise He could not have expected to persuade many of them by condoning them. Instead He did what He always did -- He WAS the truth in their midst, and they followed Him.", 9209, "W098XjGcaa", 0],

They needed us to be afraid so they could \"convince\" us of the necessity to invade Iraq.  Since we were so afraid, they knew we wouldn't be thinking logically and would accept whatever \"intelligence\" they put in front of us. While I am not at all convinced that the administration knew of 9/11 in advance, they have certainly manipulated the event to do what they came into office wanting to do: invade Iraq.  9/11 provided the \"Pearl Harbor\" they needed to get the American people behind a pre-emptive strike in Iraq.

	85990 : ["@tuberroot - That would be pretty much like justifying swearing with a foul tongue and in the book of James it pretty much is clear on having a potty mouth if you know what I mean? ------------------------------------------ I don't believe that a person can get saved only left to remain in their sins other wise it is a question of did they really get saved or are they only choosing to believe some aspects of the bible and not the rest? I do believe that a person can get saved and God will eventually set them free from sin in his perfect timing. People can and will take some scripture and disregard others that are found in the bible. If a person were to take all the sins that are mentioned in the bible and ripped out all sin that is mentioned then there would be nothing left except a bible that has no sin mentioned in it so it wouldn't make any sense to any one who is a Christian believer that reads the bible.  Especially if they are saved and they acknowledge the fact that we are all sinners no matter what that sin is. It would just be like believing in God but with out the changes being made inside the person.  Certainly a person believe in God but if their life hasn't changed as a result of them believing in God then something is not right.  It could mean they have some knowledge that God exists but they aren't putting their complete faith in God that God can and will change their lives.   They may not be saved and just by praying the sinners prayer is all there is to getting saved.  There is much more because we must be transformed into the likeness of Jesus Christ.  Salvation doesn't end once we ask the Lord to come into our lives.  That's just the begging stage because Jesus wants every aspect of our lives and that also means our sexually too. If we are only in the Christian faith because the life style looks good and if we think gee I will find a better mate because that will solve all my problems then think again.  That's not what it's about because Jesus Christ died and thus our lives becomes God's property thus one must surrender all to Jesus Christ and not just some........you give him every thing.  Even when a man and woman get married  you still have to give your sexually over to God! I don't believe God changes his mind when it comes to sins.  God is Jesus Christ come in the flesh so then this scripture would be contradictory and many other scriptures would also sound contradictory if we were to change the whole bible just to suit one's choice in sexually.  If one wants to follow Jesus Christ then they must be aware that we are suppose to lose our own identity and find our identity in him alone. Seek God not our flesh/self Matthew 6:33 But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you. Find out God's will not thy will be done by the power of the flesh. Matthew 7  21Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.  Jesus came to set the captive's free. Luke 4 18The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, 19To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

Here is the record: 2002 October: Diplomat Laurence Foley murdered in Jordan, in an operation planned, directed and financed by Zarqawi in Iraq, perhaps with the complicity of Saddam's government. 2003 May: Suicide bombers killed 10 Americans, and killed and wounded many others, at housing compounds for westerners in Saudi Arabia. October: More bombings of United States housing compounds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia killed 26 and injured 160.  2004 There were no successful attacks inside the United States or against American interests abroad. 2005 There were no successful attacks inside the United States or against American interests abroad. 2006 There were no successful attacks inside the United States or against American interests abroad. 2007 There were no successful attacks inside the United States or against American interests abroad. 2008 So far, there have been no successful attacks inside the United States or against American interests abroad.
