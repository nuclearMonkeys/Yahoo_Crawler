	55826 : ["The worst thing I can come up with is what my dad predicted.  Seriously. Bella decides she doesn't want to be a vampire after all, which, although it seems like a good thing to Edward, totally messes up their relationship, Edward dies, and Bella goes with Jacob.  Not that I have anything against Jacob, it just isn't where the story is going, I don't think. Bella dies would be pretty bad, too...  Although, as it is in first person, I don't exactly see how that would work.  Of course, I was thinking the same thing with Harry Potter.  If the author wants to kill off the main character, they can find a way to do it believably. But I think that the worst one that could happen that I can actually see happening is if Jacob dies.  I do love that kid- he's like an exact replica of my younger brother.  And he deserves his happy ending, too, I just don't think he's going to find it in Bella. But if you want off the wall, really bad not-even-possible scenarios, I would look at any non-canon relationships that you can find in fanfiction.  Like, Emmett or Jasper or even Carlisle decides that they've fallen in love with Bella.  Or Alice ends up with Edward.  I avoid those kinds of stories in general, no offense to those who like them.  I just think they're disturbing.  But even if the ending to the series is disappointing, it won't be that disappointing.", 7885, "GSGSSWP7aa", 6],

So I sat on the edge of the bed, cried for about 20 seconds and ended up sleeping on the couch for the remainder of the night with the TV going.  I have never done that before, LOL.  You can switch doctors at any time during your pregnancy, but some doctors don't take new patients that far along unless you have a medical reason for a switch.

	55848 : ["Well, kind of. There are two number systems in Korea- pure Korean and sino-Korean. They use both of them equally for different things. The number 4 in sino-Korean is 사 (sa), which is also the pronunciation of the Chinese chinese character 死 which means \"death\". So, saying 사층 (sa-cheung), which means '4th floor' can sound like you are saying '死층' which means 'death floor'. For this reason, many buildings in Korea skip the 4th floor and call it the 5th floor instead.  The actual word for 'death' in Korean is 죽다 (jukda), or 사망 (samang). Japanese has a very similar case, with the number 4 and the chinese character 死 both being pronounced 'shi'. Instead of saying 'shi', when we count in Japanese we usually say 'yon' instead to avoid saying 'shi'. EDIT: I'm not a Chinese speaker (neither Mandarin nor Cantonese) but I checked a dictionary real quick. In Mandarin 'four' (四) is pronounced 'sì' (falling tone) while 'death' (死) is pronounced 'sǐ' (falling-rising tone) In Cantonese, death is pronounced 'sei' with a mid to high rising tone (called the 2nd tone) and four is pronounced 'sei' with a mid level flat tone (called the 3rd tone).

The world is FULL of suffering and, although there is momentary happiness, it is just that - momentary. It is like a spark in a vast sea of misery. Witnessing the injustice in the world makes me sick to my stomach. It makes me even sicker to think that I'm helpless, to think that I can't change the order of things - I was born into an upside down world. I've reached the conclusion though that the only thing I CAN do is make small differences. If I can be good to the few people around me in my lifetime, that in itself has lasting effects and implications. What we take to the grave is not our home, car, or other material possessions, but the good deeds we do for others. For me, that's the only thing that makes life worth living.
