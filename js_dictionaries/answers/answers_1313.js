You'll see a Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection option on the game menu once you get to the \"Continue, New Game\" menu. Once you get to that menu, scroll down and select it. Select Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Settings again on the next screen and then click on Connection 1 and then click on Search for an Access Point. It'll locate all available Routers in your area but you'll need to know your own Router as well as the password for it provided it has one. Select your Router from the list, input the password provided it needs one and then test the connection which should automatically prompt once you set up the connection but if not there's a \"Test Connection\" button on the screen. It'll let you know regarding whether the connection was successful or not.

	71235 : ["To be honest, the Nintendo 3DS is absolutely fine for me and I loathe the \"XL\" franchise with the DS line. I mean, back when we had gameboys and we used the \"mirror\" to enlarge, that made sense, it was a smaller screen and before the backlight was installed, so very dark! (But that made it fun). The \"XL\" aspect does nothing to the coding of the cartridge to change the pixel size, it just stretches it out. It's like taking a digital photo that looks crisp and stretching it out to look worse! Auugh, it bothers me haha. If Nintendo had included the second circle pad like many of us screamed for with the new release, THEN I would most likely grin and bear it. Many gamers were disappointed when they did not include this, as it would have been a great opportunity to include it without having to buy the expansion.", 8614, "URzrmK4vaa", -1],

Not only does it have larger screens but the battery life is increased which is a problem with the priginal 3ds. The stylis is on the side of the system again thanks the gods, beacause the back of the regular 3ds is very annoying.  It also come bundled with a new 4gb sd card instead of a 2gb one which is an excellent upgrade since the eshop has many great games out!  The giant screens have an anti-glare rflection coating to make it easier to see in harsh light.  there are many more improvments upon the original 3ds and i cant reccommend it enough. There have been no rumors of a new 3ds, if nintendo did that im sure people would be angry! Good luck in choosing the 3ds is truly an amzing system", 8611, "Jx8dnnTkaa", -1],

	71254 : ["It figures. People here are only recommending Nintendo games, and I bet that's all they've played. I also recommend Ocarina of Time 3D and Super Mario 3D Land, but there are other games to consider as well.  If you want a fighter, Dead or Alive Dimensions is the best one so far. It has \"cool\" 3D, but the fighting combat is awesome. And if you're interested in it, it has both depth 3D and pop-out 3D, though the pop-out effect is the gimmicky part of 3D, but here the effect is minimal. The Mercenaries 3D is fun and addictive. The 3D is good, but it's not the best. The game itself is good. Nano Assault. This one was made by Shin'en. The game is similar to Star Fox 64, but it has different ways to play it. I recommend this over Star Fox 64 3D. The 3D is, as usual, optional, but having it on helps a lot. The way they position the ship in certain areas is so that the attacks come from the front and you have to doge them. Some of them are fast, and the 3D helps you judge how fast and how close they are. It also helps in the other areas where the \"cells\" have holes in them and edges. It's also only $19.99, and the game itself is good.  If you want a racing game other than Mario Kart, then go for Need For Speed The Run. The rest of the racing games lack online and have issues. Need for Speed has online and looks good though the game itself, including the PS3/360 version, is not as good as other NfS games. Shinobi is ok, but if you're looking for a more intense title with 3D, then that game would not be the best, though it is a hard game. Doctor Lautrec and the Forgotten Knights. It's similar to the Professor Layton series. If you're into that, then this is the best option for the 3D right now. There are a lot of gems within third party games, so you should look into them. Some of them even come with club Nintendo points like Nano Assault. It's a new program Nintendo has to promote third party games. You could always try eShop games.  Freakyforms is good, but that is essentially a 2D game. Pushmo is a simple puzzle game that let's you solve 200 in-game puzzles, but you can also create your own puzzles and share them through the Internet using QR codes. Additionally, you can scan other people's QR puzzles to keep on playing long after you beat the game. There are even blogs and forums dedicated to QR puzzle exchange. Mighty Switch Force is coming this Thursday, Dec. 22nd. It's a game by wayforward, and it's one of the most anticipated titles for the eShop.  I hope I help, and give third party games a chance. I have more Nintendo games like Star Fox 3D, but it's not good to just promote Nintendo games. Some people only have one Nintendo game when there are plenty of options to choose from. This will then tun into more games from third parties.", 8614, "RzsvIZTiaa", 4],

	71277 : ["The snake-based Grass Starter, Snivy, evolves into Servine at Level 17 and Serperior at Level 36. Serperior has the worst HP, Attack and Special Attack of the trio's final evolutions, but does have the best Defense, Special Defense and Speed, which is an unusual combination of stats. Serperior likely has the smallest movepool and the least useful typing for getting through the game, so it's not recommended for newcomers to the series. The pig-based Fire Starter, Tepig, evolves into Pignite at Level 17 and then Emboar at Level 36. Emboar has the worst Defense, Special Defense and Speed of the trio's final evolutions, but it does have the best HP, Attack and Special Attack. As the offense-oriented choice, it learns several heavy-hitting moves such as Flare Blitz and Head Smash and likely has the best movepool of the three. Tepig, who has a Chinese-inspired design, becomes a Fire/Fighting-type upon evolution, rather than staying a pure Fire-type. The otter-based Water Starter, Oshawott, evolves into Dewott at Level 17 and then Samurott at Level 36. Oshawott is the middle-of-the-road choice of the Unova Starters, as Samurott is not the best nor the worst of the three in any of the six stats. Samurott is likely the most practical of the three for playing through the game, as it can learn all three of the Water-type HMs, while the others cannot.", 8619, "muCotTpnaa", 0],

	71281 : ["Sehwag is one of a kind , just because he didnt perform upto the mark in first 2 tests doesnt mean he should be sidelined totally ~ He performed quite ok in the last test series against england , as his scores suggest: 117, 25 (ahmedabad) 30, 9 (mumbai) 23, 49 (kolkata) barring the duck at nagpur ofcourse :P Really an experienced batsman who tackles fire with fire on lively pitches would have been a smart gamble  . The indian team may need some \"turbo\" effect in SA conditions, because its difficult to stick around defensively out there as we've seen teams getting out cheaply in many instances in last few years in SA~ As we have a strong middle order ~ pujara, sachin, kohli and to be fair dhoni also , as he is good at stabilizing the Indian inns. in the later part. So I would pick Sehwag for sure. The other opener could have been Vijay , but as per the present scenario Shikhar cant be dropped so i'm not too optimistic of Sehwag's chances anymore. edit: \"He hasn't scored a century away since five years. \" so what ! dhoni has never scored a century away ~", 8610, "5lY0azMYaa", 0],
