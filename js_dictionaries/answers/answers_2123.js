	111945 : ["Jabba has some good info there.  Also, don't do a defrag or ANYTHING with the disk you deleted the files from.  Best to just turn the computer off at the wall (yes, that's right - no shut down from Start because that will write information to the disk that might overwrite your lost files - just \"pull the plug\" on it).  Then \"slave\" the lost-files-disk to one in another computer (or use a spare one that has an operating system on it as the \"master\" disk) and install the recovery software program on the master disk. Here is a place to look for recovery software: and you might like some help at the forums - go to the software section: All the best - hope you find everything.", 10200, "77cc40ae5b94f3cffde9416a132cf66caa", -1],
	111946 : ["When you delete something from your computer it is never really deleted. The explaination is that everything is saved to your hard drive basically as zeros and ones. A file is just a reference to an array of these zeros and ones. If the computer should really delete a file, it should delete all zeros and ones to be only zeros, and then remove the reference. This takes time.  What really happens is that the reference is removed, so that the harddrive can just overwrite the old files zeros and ones, when it needs space. Removing a reference to a very large file takes no time. e.g. a file of 4,7GB would be approx. 37,6 billion zeros and ones. Zeroing these would be a waste of time. This also means that your can just get the file reference back, and viola, your file is there. Windows have built in support for this, which many fine programs utilize. Avira Unerase is one of these programs. And the Avira program is free too.(see source for link) Caution: Don't save files to the disk containing the lost files. They may be overwritten, the reason being what i explained above.", 10200, "LT8DJcpXaa", 0],
