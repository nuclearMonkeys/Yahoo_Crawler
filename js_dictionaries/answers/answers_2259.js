I prefer to do it the honest way and just buy mine way early at a huge discount, but if you don't, that's your business.

I have to say that I don't agree with her flip flopping on issues, and remember that no candidate will get into office without the help of a Congress who will pass the resolutions that the President wants. So they can promise us the moon right now, but it's not up to them.

	118741 : ["The candidate field is rather disappointing this election term. Looking at the other candidates, a woman may vote for Hillary because she looks past her personal life and sees something she agrees with in her policy. Perhaps, in the general election, in a race with Guiliani, she may want to vote for someone who is willing to work through a husband's cheating past rather than divorce. While I am not a Hillary supporter, I can see how she appeals to people. I don't support her healthcare plan, but it would be very appealing to an uninsured american with multiple kids looking for an easy answer. She may vote for her simple because she is female. I don't agree with this practice, but it's a possiblity. She may vote for her because she doesn't not like the other candidates.  Every candidate has something in their past that would make them unappleaing to various demographics. Maybe Hillary's record is the least repugnant.", 10549, "lDEkijsQaa", -1],

	118777 : ["Shaila... Kind of long answer but in detail. A torrent is any kind of file that is shared between people using peer to peer programs like utorrent, bitcomet, azureus, etc. There are websites like Mininova, torrentspy, IsoHunt, PointBlank, etc where people upload \"links\" to their files so other people can download them. This files are NOT store in any server, they are in the uploader computer (seeder) and is downloaded to the downloader computer (leecher) using the torrent programs that I mentioned before. Torrent programs do not take much of the resources of your computer but the downloading action will slow down your internet surfing speed because great deal of your bandwidth will be used. ALL torrent programs are legal BUT if you share copyrighted material (movies, games, applications) there are legal implications but they have been applied in just a few cases. One more thing, ISPs have been applying limits to the amount of information people can download because it reduces their ability to provide for other users (Comcast been one). Hope it helps you to somehow decide if you go for it or not!! Here is a small instructive of how to use utorrent: 1. Download utorrent   download the last version: 1.7.7 2. Install it. Do not change any of the default settings until you know more. 3. Now you have to go to a web site where you can download from the files you want.  4. When you hit \"download\" it will ask you if you want to open it or save it. Click Save put it on your desktop and then right click it and open it with utorrent. When finish downloading most likely you will have to find a program to open the files because most of them are compressed into formats that make them smaller and easier to upload and download. Remember to scan for virus before you open any downloaded file. Best of Lucks!!", 10556, "beQolBQJaa", 0],
