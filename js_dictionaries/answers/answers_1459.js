	78607 : ["Oh dear, kinda sad that u are stuck up with such ******* around. those ppl whom say that u cant do this or that, are just plainly jealous of your abilities. u seem to be a smart gal, and all u need is the right company of frens. this bunch of losers, u will know where they will stand, like maybe 5 to 10years down the road.  u deserve better friends than these ppl, guess u gotta talk more often with slightly older and wiser ppl, they might be able to really give a helping hand for your situation. This is the age, where adolescents will be facing the most trying periods of their teen-hood.  Be focused on your long term goals gal, u sure would be able to turn back, and look at all this stuff and laugh at them in a matter of years down the road. and few pieces of advise for ya..?? 1- the ppl around you whom you claim as friends, are just plainly using you. you are smart and they aren't. try to devise a plan where you'll be able to win their company & also sharing your work with them. 2- its good to aim far ahead, all i can tell you is that, maybe in 10years time, you wont be even considering those careers, which you are currently planning for; so the right thing is to always have realistic goals and not sticking close to one career u always considered.  3- and judging from the way u have put it here, u seem to be the humble one, who brings benefits to others, but doesn't gain anything directly from this ppl. u need to tell off this ppl every here & there, to tell them u're not someone to toy around with. its scary & difficult for someone whose been nice to everyone around them, & suddenly being offending to them, but u gotta do it.. 4- & lastly u may consider 'changing' your best fren..with real patience u can find ppl with much better hearts... All the best in your teen-journey.. i may not have the real solutions for you, but hope there is something worthwhile for you to read & ponder.. =)", 8954, "66d624bab0970886cdb8876172d143e0aa", 0],

	78630 : ["People these days are too PC and soft for a real war.  They don't understand that \"innocent casualties\" happen in war, and when they do it is suddenly Bush's fault.  Look at how many Japanese were killed in our bombing raids there during WW2, and the death toll from conventional bombs was far greater than that of the nukes.  There is little difference between Japan attacking Pearl Harbor, and islamic exremists attacking the USS Cole, and the World Trade Center.  The main difference being that no country will actually claim the cowards, so we have to root them out wherever they are.  And nobody wants to see innocent people get caught in the cross fire, even I don't want to see that.  But when the terrorists hide in urban residential areas and take advantage of these people as human shields it is going to happen.  If anyone should be condemned it should be the terrorist cowards and not the US millitary or gov't.  They started this chain of events, and we answered the call to fight.  They are the ones hiding, using human shields, blowing themseves up and killing innocent civilians trying to start a civil war... not the US military.", 8958, "c57317df04f4a98a5f343bf9bcea353eaa", 2],

	78637 : ["love at first sight is real. Or can be. Because true love is from God. I'm a Christian, I believe in God! And for that reason I believe that there is love at first sight. God sometimes maybe lets people (like me) see right away who He intended them to love and marry.  Love is different with everyone because we are all different! You can't describe true love for anyone! Everyone's experience of loving or being in love is totally unique. Because we area all unique! There are no hard and fast rules in love. Sometimes love at first sight is true. Sometimes it's not. Sometimes you really love someone you've dated for 10 years. Sometimes you ddon't. I am so tired of the people that say smugly, \"i believe in lust at first sight\" because they don't know. I don't have problems with lust, and I have experienced that feeling of \"wow, look, there he is, the guy I was created for\". I just looked at his eyes from the side and I got that feeling. I wasn't looking at his body at all. Please believe me- that even if it hasn't happened to you, or never will, it is POSSIBLE Please do not listen to these other people. Although they mean well, I know personally that there can be real, true, lasting love (not LUST or INFATUATION! Boy am I sick of those dumb words! People just use them to sound grownup and wierd and fancy shmancy! {not to \"dis\" you other folks, but that's what it seems like to me :)} at first meeting- and yes, even at first sight.  As to what it feels like... everyone is totally different. If you think you are in love, and you love someone very much, more than any one else, than you ARE in love- for the time being. You may, who knows, some day, find someone else who you will be able to love even more. Not because you didn't love the first one- you did, as much as you could at the time. But each new person you fall in love with you seem to be able to love more.  Who can say whether we are all in love a dozen times in our life, or if we only \"really\" love one of those people, or if we never \"truly\" loved any of them?  Love is different for every person, at every different time. Sometimes it makes you sad, sometime it makes you happy, sometime insecure, sometimes confident. No one knows. But if you think you're in love, then tell yourself you are and go with your emotions, whether you become mournfully melancholy or exuberantly happy. There is nothing sweeter than feeling something deeply and telling yourself you're in love, whether it's for an hour or a lifetime- or eternity.  I fell in love from first sight with someone I have only met twice in the past two years I still am. For many reasons in a long story, we can't contact each other, nor do we \"date\" so there isn't a questions of all that \"faithfulness\" junk. But I knew at the first second that I was made for him and someday God will see we marry and live happily ever after. Sometime I will type up the whole story and post it on every \"love at first sight\" page and question and blog in the whole wide internet.  Again, I am not saying that love at first sight is the only right kind of love. Maybe you will hate the person you eventually fall in love with! Maybe it will take you years to gradually love them! Who knows? I am not saying that it is the only true kind of love. With some people, it may take a while to fall in love with their soulmate. But love at first sight is so very possible! It's even be possible on the internet. Or on the phone!  Sometimes the good Lord is kind enough to show you right away. Like he showed me.  The moment I saw him standing there, I knew all about him. His character- how kind and sweet he was, how helpful and patient. And don't say I was judging a book by its cover. Later in the day I met up with him again and talked to him for five hours at that wedding reception. And my first impression- that split second thought of \"this is who I was created for and am meant to marry\" was strengthened. And he is in my every thought and dream. I don't give a passing thought or glance to anyone else- it's just out of the question. I've only seen him only 3 times over the years. It's been so long. But I still love him! I do! It's real! I fell in love when I was only 13. But that's how old Juliet was, and it was love at first sight and no one questions her! No one says “Oh, Juliet was so dumb, she didn't REALLY love romeo, she just killed herself because she THOUGHT she did”. Why should people say that about me?  There is love at first sight.  Not lust. Not infatuation. Not a crush. Not a passing attraction.  Real, true, lasting, beautiful, perfect love. Believe!", 8959, "AA11214724", 0],

Out of over 1 billion Muslims. The media only showed the few hundred, not the billion. They WANT you to hate all Muslims. It's our invasion of Iraq and mass murder of hundreds of thousands of its citizens that has made more people hate us than ever before (even more than hated us for being the sole supporter of Israeli terrorism all these decades).
