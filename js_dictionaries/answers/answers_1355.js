In order to calculate what percentage of things we don't know we would have to know how much we don't know which is impossible. If we knew how much we didn't know then, by necessity, we would have to know it which obviously we can't for the very reason that we don't know it. The best we can do is estimate a percentage of information that is unknown to us. You estimate that we know roughly 1% of all the universes' mysteries and claim that \"physics experts\" claim they know 99% of all the knowledge the universe has to offer. Neither can know who is wrong, at least for now. Only time will tell who is wrong and who is right. Until then, we may only give estimates. I will tell you this, though. Physicists claim that 95% of the universe is made up of stuff we can't see called Dark Matter and Dark Energy. If this claim is true, which I for one don't think it to be, but if it was then there is 95% of stuff the universe is made up of which that we completely don't understand.", 8708, "1jxLOSEtaa", 0],
	73353 : ["Clearly there are things about the Universe, about astronomy and cosmology and physics that you do not currently have knowledge of.  It is my personal estimate that scientists easily understand a good 85% of all there is to know about the Universe.  At least in terms of what we can see of it.  Evidence suggest that the Universe is geometrically flat and made up of 5% matter (planets, stars, galaxies, etc.), 25% dark matter (they only have a vague notion of what DM might be), and 70% dark energy, DE, (probably the vacuum energy). Einstein's field equations, General Relativity (about space, time, matter, and gravity) and something called The Friedmann equation (relates energy density to the way the Universe curves and expands) describes the nature of the Universe back to between the first second and the first minute post big bang.  Particle accelerators can accurately describe the origin of the Universe back to maybe 10^-12 sec.  These are just a few of the testable concepts they can use to accurately predict events in the past 13.7 billion years.  There are more, much more ways to verify these ideas.  It is absolutely amazing how rapidly the human mind has unraveled the secrets of the Universe just in the last 100 years.  It was a series of scientific advancements in the early 1900's that led the way; one was General Relativity and the other was Quantum Mechanics, among many other more current but equally important breakthroughs that permitted cosmologists to put it all together into one unifying concept -- the Hot Inflationary Big Bang!

If you prefer on-line play there may be Warhawk and Unreal Tournament three is popping out. Also the Playstation Network has Little Big Planet and Home coming to it. Blu-ray discs imply that extra may also be saved on PS3 video games enabling them to be greater. An Xbox DVD holds approximately 8GB however a unmarried layer Blu-ray disc holds 25GB and a twin layer holds 50GB but a 360 sport bills the identical as a PS3 sport.

The PS3 is an excessively affordable Blu-ray participant whilst you need to purchase a £one hundred twenty/$two hundred upload-directly to play HD-DVD films. The PS3 has been out a 12 months not up to the 360 and it is snap shots are already equalling or improving the ones at the 360. As the builders end up larger at setting up video games for the PS3 the hole will simplest widen. As some distance as video games cross a few of the larger video games for the Xbox are both multi-platform or going to return out for the PC at a few factor like Gears of War and Halo a million & two have already got. The PS3 has Uncharted, Killzone two, Haze, MGS4, Final Fantasy XIII, Ratchet and Clank, and God of War three as good because the multi-platform titles like Call of Duty four. Finally the PS3 has a lot larger hardware than the Xbox which has enormous 30% failure cost. The Xbox's strengths are that it is less expensive (however I do not feel it's ultimately) and Xbox reside is usually larger (however you need to pay). The common Xbox simplest had a lifespan of four years and with the 360's issues it should simplest final one more two-three. The PS2 had a lifespan of 6 years and the PS3 is deliberate to final 7-10 years. All PS3 controllers are rechargeable, you simply attach them to the USB port to cost, however you need to purchase a chargeable battery percent if you do not desire to make use of AA batteries for the 360 pad.

However, it's not very robust and there are distinct video games on Xbox 360 and PS3 that the Wii simply could not manage, like Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty four. Also the Wii is missing different aspects like a difficult force and it does not aid HDTV. It additionally does now not present a lot in the way in which of on-line gaming.
