The only way to be sure as to why he thinks this..is to ask him what he would like for you to do to make him happy. If he is your boyfriend..then he must have liked you in order to want to date you..so you must have been doing something right! He sounds very immature. Dont change who you are for someone, unless its something you wanted to change for yourself anyway. He should love you for who you are. Dont do anything for him that isnt something you believe in. Be true to yourself..and he will love you for the person you are.", 9762, "None", 0],

He's telling his student's about how Beethoven was deaf, but wasn't always deaf. The scene was really sad because music was such a huge part of Mr. Holland's life, and he felt it was something he just could never share with his son because he was always deaf.", 9761, "w32Ji4jpaa", -2],

How can it be accurate when guided by the \"Holy Spirit\" the book of Jude was included which said.... Jude 1:14   And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,  Which is a direct quote from Enoch but these men still felt by the \"Holy Spirit\" that Enoch wasn't inspired. Either Jude was mistakenly included, or Enoch was mistakenly excluded but the fact that one or the other was included or excluded and not both is a lapse in logic which is impossible for God and is therefore proof of mans tampering! This Bible reflects a Roman perspective of Christianity. It's like reading about Islam from unearthed CIA documents and G.W. Bush letters a thousand years from now and thinking that's the way Islam was.", 9764, "None", 0],

	101026 : ["The Book of Enoch that you refer to was written approximately 110 BC.  Since Enoch existed a few years earlier than that, we can very much assume that it wasn't written by him and therefore not inspired by God.   There are 24,633 early copies of the New Testament (5300 in its original Greek) (1) and we can weed out mistakes in transcription leaving only 5% of it in doubt (2), and that doubt changes no major doctrine or truth of the Christian faith.  All the books in the New Testament were put together before the end of the first century (3), therefore the New Testament was not severely or critically edited. In the case of the Old Testament, scribes had laws on what ink to use, what material to write on, spacing between letters, paragraphs, they had the middle letter of each page memorized.  If they committed three of any mistake, including their own rules, the entire manuscript was torched and they would start over.  Therefore, the Old Testament was not severely or critically edited.(4) Also found that I was right in answering another question, the earliest portion we have of the Gospel of John was dated to be 125 AD, only about 30 to 35 years after he wrote it.  Substantiated by Paul Wegner's book.  You say that Jesus Himself quotes from the Book of Enoch, where!?   The book of Jude, before Revelation quotes from the book of Enoch 1:9, but it is much the same situation that if (for example only) I were inspired to write a book of the Bible and I quoted Shakespeare to make a point, it doesn't mean that all of Shakespeare is inspired by God, but only the portion of it that I quoted.   God bless you!", 9764, "None", -1],
	101027 : ["It wasn't God that put the book together ... The Book of Enoch was what the Essenes studied/followed, they were considered heretical.  And yes I agree with your comment 'critically edited by man' Enoch isn't the only book to be left out, there were hundreds & hundreds that could have been included - A guy called Iraneus started picking out which books were authentic & then the council of Nicea took over.

To what level should the government extort from people that assets that were gained by after seeing a need providing a solution to be given to another that isn't even required to do something to earn it? The Taxed Enough Already have valid points.  I think you should read John F. Kennedy's inaugural address & Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech.

	101034 : ["My very sentiments indeed. That, and more than a handful of other scriptures that I've come across so far, was among those books that were expurgated by the early church compilers of the Bible since they didn't suit their needs at the time. But the letters of Saul/Paul did and it dominates the NT. Such writings and books were altogether banned; they were either destroyed, burned or kept in secrecy; and they were labeled as the \"Gnostic Books\", which became an ANATHEMA to the newly developing universal church.  It was only in the 19th and 20th centuries when they began to resurface and became known to the public as the \"lost and forgotten books\" of the Bible. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is a prime example. While most of its passages are similar to the Bible, there are certain teachings that DIFFER from those found in the Bible. And so far, after 60 years since its discovery, the Vatican still remains silent as to why there exists such differences in the teachings... Sad but true. Peace be with you.", 9764, "AA10273334", 1],
	101035 : ["Because of the obvious reason that if God took Enoch then he was not the author of the book bearing his name.   All of the books that were stricken for one reason or another are available so that you can see for yourself why.   Enoch is not part of the Tanakh either so your argument is moot.", 9764, "AA10876578", -1],
	101036 : ["That was man, not God. In fact, God gave a warning in Revelations not to add or take away from his word. I have read the Book of Enoch, though. I don't understand why it was omitted.", 9764, "r2PRVea3aa", 0],
	101037 : ["Disagree.  The last Tea Party I went to had no signs with Hitler on them.  No one even mentioned Hitler.  What we did have signs saying was \"Stop the out of control spending\"  \"Taxed Enough Already\", No Tax dollars for the study of sexual roles of ants\" and \"Health care bill doesn't fix the problem, it creates more problems. What the mainstream media will focus on is a very few people who act out of control.  That's how they want to portray anyone who is against Obama.  Why, because they helped him get elected and can't admit they made a mistake. Go to an actual Tea Party and see all the republicans, democrats and independents who are there with the same goal.  That goal is to get this government that is out of control back on track fiscally. There is a Tea Party April 15th in Grand Prairie Texas.  It will be a good one for anyone in that area to find out what really happens at a tea party.", 9766, "pWhAXJ7xaa", 2],
