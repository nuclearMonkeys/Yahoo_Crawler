	76264 : ["Men don't usually want to admit that someone overpowered them and violated them, and that it was of a homosexual nature, for many reasons, most of which are obvious. I dated two men who were sexually abused, and both broke down in tears from sheer embarrassment. Yes, I realize there is pain as well, but this was... embarrassment. I agree that it is of course no indication of the victim's sexuality, and that the perpetrator being imprisoned is important. But, women who are sexually assaulted are often embarrassed or ashamed as well, or don't want to be judged, or think a bad reputation will be the end result.", 8832, "yE36x9Keaa", 1],
	76265 : ["Chances are they were bi-curious and got into a situation that they could not get out of, Seriously, most of the men I've ever known that were assaulted as adults just didn't read the signs that were right in front of their faces, and after the deed was done and it's not what they thought it would be they are too ashamed to admit what had happened. It's different for most women, they are forced and it's not by any means invited. That's just what I know from personal experience and having counseled several men who were victims of sexual predators. It's also very difficult for men to prove they were raped, either anally or orally. It's the ones that are under age and submissive to what an older man or woman want. And yes there are several women who rape men. It's just too humiliating for a man to admit he was powerless so they let it go and move on. The cases that are most disturbing are the ones that grew up being sodomized and sexually abused. Many of these men think it's a type of love or caring from another person or perpetrator. And just plain and simply don't know any better. Having the courage and a feeling of self worth are what's important, and many people just don't have that. They feel it's better to hide in shame when really they should not. They should take what ever means necessary to put that abuser in jail.", 8832, "XvWuYNBfaa", 0],

We can be blessed both spiritually and temporally from following the commandments.   Not only do we express faith and trust in God by being obedient to him, both many commandments have an added blessing that is temporal in nature. As you work and plan to pay the tithing, you necessarily have to learn to budget and plan your finances.  that planning and budgeting can be the added bonus to obeying the law.", 8827, "dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa", 2],

	76269 : ["The institution of marriage can not stand being stretched to anyone's sexuality forever.  What part of gay rights logic says that two consenting brothers shouldn't be able to marry if that's their sexuality, or multiple wives?  And then once marriage is something that we can just change to whatever people want it to be, people will marry their dog or their car.  It's love right? You can't define love... And so marriage will lose all that makes it special and have meaning to be nothing but words. The line is drawn.

	76272 : ["I really don't think it has anything to do with association with McDojo's etc.. I've always used the word grading and everyone, even from other schools that i've known, use the word grading. I think it has more to do with the language differences over geographic, cultural and age factors. Just to clarify i am from Australia - i've even seen it used in martial arts magazines as well! Anyway both testing and grading can mean the same thing so it is a bit of semantics.  Here is one definition i found online: noun 1. a degree or step in a scale, as of rank, advancement, quality, value, or intensity: the best grade of paper. Obviously the example they used does't do much to prove my point! But one of the options said is step in a scale - as in rank/advancement. I will concede that testing seems to make more sense when you think about it, but as seen in this definition grading can mean the same thing. Edit: silly me for missing this but this is from the same source: 3. \"a step or stage in a course or process.\" Edit: i'm surprised by some of the answers here. People will use their understanding of language to label things. This is especially important here seeing as literal translations are not always easy across Japanese/English languages. Use of English has variations among countries and cultures despite being largely the same everywhere.  If we are being truly English literal than i would say the process is grading - what happens in the grading is testing.", 8833, "LkF5vjjtaa", 2],

So many guys are fooled into thinking all kinds of women, mainly celebrities but some normal girls, are ''beautiful'' when really, they've done their makeup to look natural.And it is decieving, I'm not saying these girls look ugly without makeup, some might, others just look completely different, and it's strange to see how much makeup can change someone's appearance nowadays.", 8830, "wTuBXNdbaa", 7],

Ever seen a woman angry at another woman in public? She goes mental! She doesn't care who sees or how she looks, she just wants to hurt that other woman!

	76287 : ["When I first became a single woman again after 23 years of marriage, my concerns were that I hoped I could meet my own basic needs, pay tithing and still help my daughter with college.  I had to really get in the mindset that the Lord will provide because He said He would.  So, through thick and thin I paid a full tithing no matter what.  This went on for about three years of extreme meager living.  But, through this time of meager living, I would see little miracles show up that kept reminding me that the Lord was there for me and I wasn't forgotten.   My living situation has improved three fold since those first three years and I'm so thankful that I trusted in the blessings of tithing and I have to say it's probably one of the main Gospel principles that has made me feel closer to the Lord and helped me to believe that he is there for me and hears my prayers.", 8827, "n09IHIqmaa", 3],

	76292 : ["I started in 1985 and it was a traditional school. We used the term grading. I have always used test and grading equally. And many other traditional groups in my area (teachers, styles) used the word grading as well. I have never felt anything bad about it.  And let me add that in cases where you have experienced people coming into a dojo and taking a test to be placed within the hierarchy, to be given a rank, the word grading seems quite appropriate. This happens quite often where I am training now. The Hombu dojo for our association here in Japan has many people come and start. They are usually experienced. They can usually skip a rank or two at the beginning. Someone with 10 years of constant training does not need to be a yellow belt again. So, it is both a test and a grading of their current level.  The funny thing is 99% (okay, probably a slight exaggeration, but not by much) of the Japanese people do not know the word \"grading.\" They use the word test. \"Tesuto\" is a common English import into the Japanese language. But if you look up some of the Japanese words (shinsa, shinsakai, etc) in a dictionary, you might be given \"grading\" as a possible translation.", 8833, "3WrASeMTaa", 2],
	76293 : ["I'm familar with the term, \" Grading \" is a term i've noticed is mostly used in some Tae Kwon Do Dojangs and i've noticed mostly in European schools. The idea is the student is graded on their skills as they try to pass to the next belt and the examiner grades the student, often a school might do a system of L grade for low, O for ordinary, A for very good , A + for excellent . If a student makes no grade, then they do not pass for the belt. There is some controversy though when it comes to students who pass with an L grade being promoted, personally i believe they should not. I've noticed that the ITF Taekwondo federation uses the Grading term mostly and the system of L grade, O grade, A and A + grade, other Tkd systems also use a Grading system but i've noticed ones that do are mostly in Europe. Personally i believe a student should only be passed to another rank unless they are skilled enough to do so, looking barely good enough is not acceptable. Grading system is a little too easy in some martial arts schools. I notice its mostly a Tae Kwon Do term, i've not seen it being called a \" Grading \" in any other style i've trained in and studied throughout the years, more of a European term too. Any other style i have studied and trained in uses the term \" Rank testing \" or \" Belt testing \" Regards, John.", 8833, "None", 2],

But without a direct court order noting the increase/decrease, there isn't much you are able to do. I do know that some of the law schools here in Texas offer pro-bono work for things of this nature.

	76305 : ["I commonly hear the term here on Y!A, but, my Aikido school uses this occasionally.  They are far from anyone's definition of McDojo.  There is one other school local to me that uses \"grading\" AND \"testing\".  For them, you get graded; if you make the grade, then, you test.  Grading was less formal; it means that you're close enough to testing.  Since I'm not affiliated with the school, I'll leave my thoughts on this alone, since I don't know much of the details about how it's implemented. As to accusations that TKD started the craze, I can only say that none of the schools I have trained with or am familiar with, ever used or uses the term grading.  They ALL categorically use \"testing\", as does my Aikido school officially.  Now that you ask the question, I have to consider where I hear it at Aikido, as it may indicate a colloquialism, or maybe the person has a background in another style or school that does use it. But then again, there IS an official document put forth by Kukkiwon (and WTF).  In Kukkiwon's defense, the concept really IS grading, since, one must achieve a certain overall grade across various categories (forms, breaking, sparring, essay).  At Kukkiwon, the phrase used on the web site menu is \"promotion test\", and is used consistently throughout, but, article 12 in this link: mentions \"scoring\" - which is unequivocally synonymous with \"grading\". WTF, on the other hand (see:   has a link on it's main site (go to \"About\", then see \"Dan Grading\"). The next lower authority is USA Taekwondo (  and it consistently uses \"Dan Promotion\", like Kukkiwon does. Bottom line, I hear the phrase; I might even use it occasionally, particularly if I'm responding to someone who uses it regardless of the manner in which they use it.  Depending on it's context, I think it's an appropriate term, as used by the local school to me, and by Kukkiwon's concept (even though they use a different phrase). As to history, because of martial arts popularity and huge number of practitioners than ever before, I see this as an evolution in how rank progression occurs.  I think the concept of grading-before-testing is novel, and shows the school is attempting to weed out those who should not be testing.  As to the idea of grading before testing, it sounds to me that because the two are related, it may be mistakenly used interchangeably.  But maybe it also shows the less-than-personal side of martial art schools, where things may be governed more by committees and hierarchies, rather than by an instructor who has a more personal relationship with his or her students.", 8833, "tinXiBOZaa", 0],
