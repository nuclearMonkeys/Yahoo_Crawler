There's a growing number of Americans who are scraping by on less than $9 or $10 an hour.  Someone who makes $9 an hour working the cash register in a convenience store makes $360 per week before taxes, which means that if they never take a day off, and don't take any vacation they'll make around $18,000 per year.  Of course, that's ignoring the fact that $9 an hour is considered a \"good\" rate of pay for that kind of job (most retail jobs only pay the minimum wage) and the majority of retail employees work less than 32 hours a week because those employers generally don't give anyone full time hours until they've been with the company at least two years and moved into a management position.", 8782, "None", -2],

Progressive income taxes are a partial fix for\" Why would I look at localized proportions? Seems to me the next logical step would be to look at Income Tax proportions again -- circular reasoning. Proportions for sales tax and FICA affect the poor more b/c they don't make much and income taxes affect the \"rich\" more b/c they do make more money? OVERALL, the \"rich\" pick up 75+% of the tax bill. When you talk about the Progressive Tax, are you talking about the first Progression (pay by %) or the second Progression (increased % the more you make)? The difference? 1st progression -- call it a flat tax of 10% 1. 10,000 income x. 0.1 = $1,000 Tax 2. 100,000 income x 0.1 = $10,000 Tax -Make more, pay more. The 2nd Progression 1. 10,000 income x 0.1 = $1,000 Tax 2. 100,000 income x 0.36 = ~$30,000 (including the tiered payment structure) -Make more, pay a higher percentage Or maybe you're talking about the additional 5.6% surcharge (tax) for singles earning over 500K or couples making over 1Mil to pay for part of the health care proposal?

It will make your blood boil - the arrogance of this pathetic looser is disgusting! At least George called him on his lies. STEPHANOPOULOS:  ... during the campaign.  Under this mandate, the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you if you don't.  How is that not a tax? OBAMA:  Well, hold on a second, George.  Here -- here's what's happening.  You and I are both paying $900 bucks on average -- our families -- in higher premiums because of uncompensated care.  Now, what I've said is that, if you can't afford health insurance, you certainly shouldn't be punished for that.  That's just piling on. OBAMA:  If, on the other hand, we're giving tax credits -- we've set up an exchange, you are now part of a big pool, we've driven down the costs, we've done everything we can, and you actually can afford health insurance, but you've just decided, \"You know what?  I want to take my chances,\" and then you get hit by a bus, and you and I have to pay for the emergency room care, that's... STEPHANOPOULOS:  That may be, but it's still a tax increase. OBAMA:  No.  That -- that's not true, George.  The -- for us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase. What it's saying is, is that we're not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you any more than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance.  Nobody considers that a tax increase.  People say to themselves, that is a fair way to make sure that, if you hit my car, that I'm not covering all the costs. STEPHANOPOULOS:  But it may be fair, it may be good public policy... OBAMA:  No, but -- but, George, you -- you can't just make up that language and decide that that's called a tax increase.  Any -- if I -- if I say that right now your premiums are going to be going up by 5 percent or 8 percent or 10 percent next year, and you say, \"Well, that's not a tax increase,\" but, on the other hand, if I say that I don't want to have to pay for you not carrying coverage, even after I give you tax credits that make it affordable, then... STEPHANOPOULOS:  I -- I don't think I'm making it up.  Merriam- Webster's dictionary:  Tax, \"a charge, usually of money, imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes.\" OBAMA:  George, the fact that you looked up Merriam's dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you're stretching a little bit right now.  Otherwise, you wouldn't have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition.  I mean, what... STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, but... OBAMA:  ... if what you're saying is... STEPHANOPOULOS:  I wanted to check for myself.  But your critics say it is a tax increase. OBAMA:  My critics say everything is a tax increase.  My critics say that I'm taking over every sector of the economy.  You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we're going to have an individual mandate or not, but...

	74762 : ["I am a Red Cross volunteer, I was in New Orleans to assist those who were affected.  Additionally, we in Charleston, SC had 649 families relocate here.  I worked with FEMA to insure that all the people were contacted by them, called them in to sign the necessary paperwork, assured them that getting rejected for an SBA was a GOOD thing, because that opened the doors to getting grants that did not have to be repaid.  I went to our National headquarters in Washington, DC to work on the long term unmet needs program  (Means to Recovery) to review cases to get more funding for them I can assure you that there are SO MANY programs out there Three is quite a bit of paperwork to fill out and people fail to do so.  Everyone from Habitat for Humanity, to  the Amish are rebuilding houses, but it does take time.  There is a program that all charitable organizations can access to see what the client has received so we don't duplicate services and spread the funds more equitably.  Salvation Army, Goodwill, Luthern Ministries,  Catholic Charities to name just a few, the governor of LA also has a program, the Road Home just to name a few, there are a lot!. In reviewing cases, many people received a rather large some of money, but they misspent their money or didn't save it.  People received rental assistance for up to 18 months , food stamps, other services, furniture, replaced vehicles.  Many people divorced and now need two homes/furniture, etc as opposed to one .  There are also educational benefits available if you can't find a job or have relocated to another area of the country , job service agencies.  New Orleans was NOT built in two years, therefore it cannot be rebuilt in 2 years.  It takes time, I realize that rents have increased as well   Many years after hurricane Andrew, certain parts of Florida still looked ravished, give it some time. I  and other service agencies did uncover  fraud by certain individuals trying to cash in the system, so agencies are being cautious.  There is a certain,  and necessary   amount of paperwork to confirm that people actually live in the affected areas. I would like to add that the people who were affected needed to fill out a \"recovery plan\" to get more funding, many failed to do so.  The governors plan would disburse $50, 000.00 to help rebuild their homes, this is in addition to the FEMA funds and any insurance benefits they may have received,  they could have a FEMA trailer put infront of their previous homes while they rebuild.  The utility companies also would assist the real residents of this area by providing them with copies of their August 2005 utility bill to verify that they lived there, this was to aid them in getting additional funding. I also researched property bills to assist them in their recovery.  People also have the duty to assist themselves in getting the necessary paperwork completed, make a plan, build a future. My personal thoughts, Katrina didn't create as many problems as the breached levees did. New Orleans misspent the funds they had to repair the levees that they knew were at risk to put in another golf course.There had been a practice session with the busses to get people OUT of the city, but NEVER utilized.   This is the first time that poverty hit Americans right in front of everyones eye's, previously, it had been swept under the mat and ignored.   What happened in New Orleans was an atrocity!  It Never should have happened, they had a plan to evacuate the city and never did so, calls were NOT made, service and community agencies were NOT allowed into New Orleans, people were sent back while human beings suffered and died.  It was a horrible, horrible mistake.  I am sorry to all the people whom were affected, I know many, each story is riveting, each story shows our vulnerability as human beings., each story shows the supreme power of over coming vast difficulty, the human strength and spirit is powerful but it is up to the individual to make it happen!!!!.", 8779, "ilvSwOQlaa", 1],

Despite those two reports, I think it is great when folks have jobs. I'm just wondering what, if people are going back to work, obama had to do with it. You see, the fact is that America will prosper. Recessions will end. They'll end sooner if the government gets out there and supports business, but regardless, economy's ALWAYS recover. The question is, do they recover because of or in spite of what the government does. Now, when Bush was president, lowering taxes jump started the economy. Business could use the money normally going to pay the tax on goods and services sold to invest in their company and in hiring new employees. I don't see what, if anything, obama has done that would have a similar affect. If anything, his efforts have depressed business and disincentivized business from hiring. If some businesses are hiring, I challenge you to show me what obama has done to affect this trend.  Still, it is a good thing. you just need to look for the 'cause and affect' if you're going to start having your party yet.  Then, too, let's see what happens when the bill comes due on obama's spending. It will have to be paid.

	74772 : ["The second disaster from Katrina was the poor news reporting after the storm with regard to the recovery programs and the damage that needed to be fixed. None of the levees which were breached were built or operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. They belonged to the Orleans Parish Water and Sewage Board. The Feds got the blame,even though over $500 million had been given to that board over the years to do its job. The Feds took heat for ot sending in troops and supplies with certain Naval units, even though there was no request for that from the Governor or the Mayor of New Orleans.  Now the Feds are taking heat because the money which has already been allocated to the State of Louisiana seems to be moving down some \"mollasses highway\" of bureaucratic incompetence towards the areas which need relief. It's indicative of two things. First, the entire governmental structure from Baton Rouge to the Lower Ninth District of New Orleans is filled with corruption and ineptitude. Secondly, despite FDR passing away over 60 years ago, a lot of people in this country think of the President as some sort of \"Federal Wizard King\".

	74773 : ["I saw a report about Katrina on TV this morning.  It focused on New Orleans and the fact that many people who had no insurance were still living in government trailers waiting for the Federal government to make it all better while those who had insurance have either been paid off by the insurance companies and have moved on or have been paid off and have rebuilt.   I feel sorry for those who weren't wise enough to purchase insurance prior to the disaster but don't think it's fair that they should be bailed out for their lack of responsibility while those who acted responsibly and purchased insurance get nothing. And, don't tell me these poor people didn't have enough money to buy insurance.  I saw a study the other day that said most so-called \"poor\" people have a car, two color TVs, a home they might be paying on, a microwave, furniture and a lot of other things.  Their life style is not lavish but they are not starving and spend at least some of their \"disposable\" income on alcohol, tobacco and entertainment.   I realize there are cases where the poor are exceedingly poor, and there may be such cases among us here.  My income falls well below the poverty line but I make sure I have insurance on my home and my car. And, I do this by scrimping in a few other places.   But, for the most part, the poor in America are pretty well off compared with the poor worldwide and are only considered poor because the government sets the poverty level so high. I don't know why the government is dragging their feet disbursing funds but suspect it may be because many of the people applying for them don't deserve them.  I was stationed at Ft. Polk in Louisiana during the '50s and early '60s while in the army.  I have to tell you that virtually everyone in that state is corrupt and on the take in one way or another. When I say everyone, I really mean it.  It seems they all had some gimmick, some way to tap the public till. I was absolutely thrilled when I got out of and away from that fetid swamp.

	74794 : ["Liberals back him on this ........... that is why they go along with it. I cannot believe that anyone seriously thought Obamacare would be good for anyone except illegals and people who refuse to have insurance. The one good thing is this is that a majority of those who refuse to have insurance will get soaked along with the rest of us.", 8782, "30a4ee65246d549232fafd90921ce359aa", 8],
	74795 : ["I believe President Obama is the very first U.S. president to actually travel to India...but I might be mistaken.  I know President Bush sent Condoleeza Rice to try and BULLY the Indian government into doing what they absolutely INSISTED they would not do---they were highly offended, according to the AP article I read on the issue, but President Bush himself did not travel to India, even though the Republicans did OUTSOURCE many of our American JOBS to the impoverished nation (workers there make on average about $300 a year).   Security is a deep concern, so I feel fine about decisions made based on intelligence information to which I am not privy.  The Secret Service and our CIA are the experts in that regard and I bow to their better judgement.  My guess is that this is a multi-faceted trip that covers a LOT of ground on several important fronts, but we'll probably have to settle for learning the full spectrum after the First Family returns safely.  Trade policies, peace efforts, support in the Middle East, economies, their security, our security...every topic is probably open for indepth discussion between the leaders.  I'm cool with that.", 8784, "mPOhFxubaa", -1],
	74796 : ["Michelle and Barry like to stay intense on the hog together as spending human beings's money. it relatively is even their political platform. yet I assure you they are going to purely bypass away their voters crumbs because of the fact they're real elitists who comprehend that if the voters have something they gained't be tempted by using the Obama's economically destroying grants that could't come to fruition. If the voters who vote for Obama had greater which will propose the voters won't desire what they have taken away, and that they could change to being against authorities theft.", 8784, "None", 0],
	74797 : ["This is not unusual for presidential travel, especially to exotic locations where security may be more difficult to control. The large number of rooms greatly assists the secret service in making sure that the president's precise location would be impossible for a terrorist to determne. This is neither new nor unique to Obama.  All presidents have significant security forces.", 8784, "Co8Kb30faa", 0],

Green jobs, green jobs, green jobs.....doesn't that just go into the pocket of GE??  Wait....doesn't GE own NBC?  Why then aren't libs speaking out about corporate welfare for GE getting backed by the government??  Could Fox do stories that promoted Ratheon??  Libs would throw a fit if the tables were turned.", 8781, "None", 0],

When people are professionals and get laid off, and can not find the kind of job they had been doing for a living, they take anything they can find to pay the mortgage payment and feed the family. (well maybe not the Democrats). This does not mean things are better. Unless you want the job market to be like the school system. Bring it all down to the same level, level with the ground. If we all made minimum wage, we would all be equal. I swear that this is what some of the Demcomms want.", 8781, "None", 7],
	74801 : ["Yes, it is a tax. Yes it is a step towards socialism but it is impossible to say how far he wants to carry it.  Your questions were mostly hyperbole but I can see fattening foods being regulated and overweight people being taxed.
