Allow me to offer these links with a suggestion of a different way to read the bible. A way where one does not have to choose who to believe.

	125920 : ["The four centuries between the Reformation and the New Reformation have been characterized as the time of “the making of the modern mind” by John Herman Randall and others. During the period between Martin Luther's Ninety-Five Theses (1517) and Karl Barth's Commentary on Romans (1919), a growing divergence between the intellectual and theological worlds set a climate of opinion that would enable the emerging scientific method to be used to challenge the authority of the Word of God within the church itself. Critics and supporters alike have come to apply the so-called dialectical method to develop their own doctrines of inspiration and authority of Scripture. However, a correct understanding of the inspiration and authority of Scripture is not properly derived by a dialectical process. The deviations and departures from the historic teaching of the Christian church concerning the nature of Scripture were challenges that caused Christian apologists to respond in defense of the traditional doctrine of Scripture. The first major deviations from the orthodox doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture emerged after the Reformation of the sixteenth century. As one writer puts it, Christians early had inherited from the Jews the belief that the biblical writers were somehow possessed by God, who was thus reckoned as the Bible's proper author. Since God could not conceivably be the agent of falsehood, the Bible must be guaranteed free from error. For centuries the doctrine lay dormant, as doctrine: accepted by all, pondered by few. Not until the sixteenth century did inspiration and its corollary, inerrancy, come up for sustained review. Even then, however, the mainstream of Christian thought continued to adhere to the doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture. Roland H. Bainton suggests that the Reformers dethroned the pope and enthroned the Bible as their ultimate authority; the principle of sola scriptura was basic to all Protestants during the Reformation era. At Worms (1521) Martin Luther (1483-1546) affirmed that nothing as to the faith can be asserted that contradicts or goes beyond Scripture or evident reason. Ulrich Zwingli (1494-1551) took his stand on the same ground at the first Zurich disputation before the city council in 1523. John Calvin (1509-64) wrestled with the identical issue; the Anabaptists were the most scriptural of all parties of the Reformation; and the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England include one article “Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for salvation.” Such a widespread and uniform attitude reflects the general sentiment of the Reformation era that the Bible alone is the complete and sufficient guide in matters of religious faith and practice. Nevertheless, the Reformation period of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was an era of creeds and confessions in which each denominational group or sect sought to articulate and to perpetuate its own doctrinal tradition. Although some of those numerous creed-forms tended to become ends in and of themselves, they were generally based on and drawn from Scripture. These more or less formal statements of faith will be reviewed as they emerged in history. The earliest of these traditions is associated with the Anabaptist and Baptist groups. These noncreedal and nonsacramental bodies tended to use confessions and declarations of faith as descriptions of their doctrinal views rather than as prescriptive formulas to which one gave allegiance through creeds and catechisms. Martin Luther has often been attacked for not holding to the inspiration of Scripture because of his criticism of certain books of the Bible. James Orr clears the air of this accusation when he writes of Luther's view of the Scriptures, “Luther's views, as his ordinary teaching and use of Scripture show, were scarcely less high; but, applying a subjective standard, his judgments on certain books, as the Epistle of James, Revelation, Esther, even the Epistle to the Hebrews, were rash and arbitrary. These judgments affected canonicity rather than inspiration.” And the explination goes on. The conclusion is: During and after the Reformation era, Christianity entered into an age of creed-forms and confessions as individual groups, denominations, and sects sought to articulate, defend, and perpetuate their own doctrinal traditions. Those more or less official and formal expressions proliferated with the spread of Christianity throughout the world in the various movements. As they are surveyed, they reflect a basic commitment to the doctrines of historic Christianity in general and to the traditional doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture in particular. “The Reformers and Counter-Reformers were disputing whether all revealed truth was in the Scripture alone, and whether it could be interpreted by private or by official scrutiny. Despite a radical disagreement on these issues both groups persevered in receiving the Bible as a compendium of inerrant oracles dictated by the Holy spirit.” The Eastern Orthodox maintained the same traditional doctrine. When placed into a larger context this limited view may be challenged by some, but the various official statements, creed-forms, and confessions of the mainstream of Christianity during the period from the Reformation to the close of World War I indicate the continued traditional commitment to the orthodox doctrine of the inspiration and authority of Scripture. That is reflected in the nonsectarianism of Anabaptists as well as the official statements of the more creedalistic communions. Throughout its broad and diverse ranks, Christians of all major persuasions prior to World War I officially adhered to the belief that the Scriptures are the divinely inspired, authoritative, infallible, and inerrant Word of God.", 10868, "DvQLt59Paa", 0],
	125921 : ["Check out 1 cor 13:8 and following. The gifts (supernatural) have ended and wern't meant to go on til the end of time. Proof: In the Bible, only apostles could bestow gifts on people by laying on of hands. Those people could perform gifts, but not in turn bestow them on others. Look and see for yourself. Purpose of miracles was to validate* the revelation of God's will for man because the NT wasn't written yet so they couldn't just look it up. They could not tell it was the word of God by just getting out their New Testament, so verbal revelations/preaching by apostles and some other inspired persons had to be validated through the miraculous. The verses that follow say that signs confirmed the word. Once the NT was completed, it was confirmed for all time. People already recognized it as the word of God since they collected it, compiled it and it has endured ever since as the word of God. Recognition is there, so signs have outlived their purpose and usefulness and will pass away. The Word speaks on its own because it is complete. *Mark 16:20   (notice that signs confirm the word) Heb 2: 2-4 Since the revelation is finished and we have the whole Bible, the need and purpose of miracles has expired. Jn 6:63 His teachings are a guide to life Col 2:22-24 Anyone claiming to do the miraculous is preaching himself.

	125925 : ["Prophets are people through whom divine will and purpose are made known. (Lu 1:70; Ac 3:18-21)       The prophets played a vital role in maintaining true worship. Their activity served as a check on the kings of Israel and Judah, for they boldly reproved erring rulers (2Sa 12:1-12) and declared God's judgments against those who practiced wickedness. (1Ki 14:1-16; 16:1-7, 12) When the priesthood deviated and suffered corruption, the prophets were Jehovah's means for strengthening the faith of a righteous remnant and for pointing the way back to God's favor for those who had strayed. Like Moses, the prophets on many occasions acted as intercessors, praying to God in behalf of king and people. (De 9:18-29; 1Ki 13:6; 2Ki 19:1-4; compare Jer 7:16; 14:11, 12.) They were especially active in times of crisis or great need. They gave hope for the future, as at times their messages foretold the blessings of Messiah's government. In this way they benefited not only those then living but future generations down to our day. (1Pe 1:10-12) Yet, in doing this they endured great reproach, mockings, and even physical mistreatment. (2Ch 36:15, 16; Jer 7:25, 26; Heb 11:32-38) Those receiving them favorably, however, were blessed with spiritual and other benefits.—1Ki 17:8-24; 2Ki 4:8-37; compare Mt 10:41.      Prophets were selected by God and appointed by means of holy spirit (Nu 11:24-29; Eze 1:1-3; Am 7:14, 15), by which means they also knew what to proclaim. (Ac 28:25; 2Pe 1:21)            Jehovah didn't leave them blind sided or without a way to know if they were really true prophets.                 The three essentials for establishing the credentials of a true prophet, as given through Moses, were:                      * The true prophet would speak in Jehovah's name;                      *  the things foretold would come to pass (De 18:20-22);                     * and his prophesying must promote true worship, being in harmony with God's revealed word and commandments (De 13:1-4).                   #The last requirement was probably the most vital and decisive, for an individual might hypocritically use God's name, and by coincidence, his prediction might see fulfillment. But the true prophet was not solely or even primarily a prognosticator, as has been shown. Rather, he was an *advocate of righteousness, and his message dealt primarily with moral standards and their application. He expressed God's mind on matters. (Isa 1:10-20; Mic 6:1-12) Hence, it was not necessary to wait perhaps for years or generations to determine whether the prophet was true or false by fulfillment of a prediction. If his message contradicted God's revealed will and standards, he was false. Thus, a prophet who foretold peace for Israel or Judah, at a time when the people were engaging in disobedience to God's Word and Law, of necessity was false.—Jer 6:13, 14; 14:11-16.

	125926 : ["There is a VERY good reason that the Scriptures say this.  But in order to understand it, you must first understand the ancient Jewish marriage rituals. Jewish tradition requires that the fathers of the prospective bride and groom meet together and agree to the marriage.  A \"bride price\" is paid and a contract is drawn up, outlining the grooms' responsibilities toward his new wife.  This is protection for the bride.  The contract is signed by all parties (and yes, the bride MUST approve of the marriage).  Then, a cup of wine is shared by them all (this is called the \"cup of consecration.\")  From that moment, they are considered married, but they are not permitted to live together.  Beginning immediately, however, the bride's behavior is closely monitored to ensure her chastity.  The bride is expected to live each moment in ancitipation of her groom coming to claim her.  But before he claims her, she participates in regular ritual baths, called \"mikveh,\" to help prepare her spiritually and eliminate defilement. The husband returns to the home of his father and immediately begins to build a place for them to live.  Typically, their new home is attached to (or very nearby) the house of the father. This is a DIRECT picture of Christ and His bride, the Church.  The Father wrote the contract (the New Covenant) which protected the Bride (Jer. 31:33-34) and paid the \"bride price,\" which is the blood of His Son (Eph. 5:25b).  The cup of wine was shared at the Last Supper and as a result, we are currently \"betrothed\" to Yeshua/Jesus (2 Cor. 11:2).  In the meantime, the Church participates in \"mikveh\" (ritual washings) beginning with our baptisms and continuing throughout our lives as we read Scripture and are renewed (Ephesians 5:26, Romans 12:2).  We are also to live in anticipation of the day our Husband comes to claim us (Matthew 24:42, Mark 13:35, Luke 21:36, etc.)  While we wait, Yeshua builds a place for us in the home of the Father (John 14:2-3). But back to the earthly bride and groom:  when the father finds the home to be complete, he instructs the groom to appear at the bride's home unannounced to claim her.  Standing outside the home with several of his closest friends, he calls to her and bids her to come with him.  Some ancient traditions indicate that, as the groom walks away with the bride, her father and mother turn their heads away from the couple, as they recognize that the Bride is now under the headship of her new husband.  (It is possible this is a picture of the unsaved world being unaware of the Rapture as it occurs.) These things also happen when God the Father instructs the Son to claim His Bride.  Yeshua appears unannounced at our home (the earth), accompanied by at least one Archangel.  He doesn't ENTER the home (i.e. touch the ground), but He stands OUTSIDE the home (in the air) and summons His Bride to come to Him.  And THAT'S why the Bride meets Yeshua in the air -- because the Jewish betrothal and wedding traditions are prophetic in nature and are ultimately fulfilled by the marriage and claiming of His Bride!  Under this model, we see that it would not fit the prophetic picture if the Bride was caught up directly to the Father's House (Heaven). EDIT:  @ Abide:  Acts 2:33 says that Yeshua is CURRENTLY seated at the right hand of the Father in Heaven.  Further, Yeshua said that \"in My Father's house are many mansions. ... I go to prepare a place for you.\" (John 14:2)  Paul writes at 2 Cor. 5:3 that we are \"present with the Lord\" after we die.  When considered together, what do these Scriptures tell you?

Of course, many like Catholicism take the bible figuratively. But the point is that the bible was real and taken literally for the people of Canaan and the Hebrews at that time. It was real.

	125944 : ["You're really asking a bunch of different questions, so I'll try to answer them as best I can.  For the Adam and Eve question, you're obviously referencing Genesis.  And the answer to that is, it's actually both, at least, in a sense.  Genesis 1 tells the story of Creation (Day 1 God created Heaven and Earth, etc).  Genesis 2 tells a very different story of Creation in that, man was not created the same way that Heaven, Earth, the oceans, etc were created, but instead \"out of the dust of the Earth\".  Now, with that said, regardless of which Creation story you read, you have to understand that the original language of the Bible was Hebrew (OT) and Greek (NT).  Over the centuries, these two languages alone have undergone many changes (although readers and speakers of modern Hebrew and Greek can, with a bit of a challenge, decipher the ancient forms of these languages).  So it's vague in the sense that human error is involved (first with the translation of Hebrew and Greek text into Latin, and then German, and then English, and now the roughly 90 other languages that it is written in.

But God is not vague in terms of Commandments, how to act, what to do if..., etc.  It's merely the case of the Bible of today being a translation of a translation of a translation and on and on.  That being said, the latest edition of the Bible (which I believe is the New Living Translation) is pretty close to the original text.  Hope this helps...", 10865, "2cAgNxQLaa", 1],

They live their lives like everyone else. The bible was at first taken literally and many sects of Christianity still take the story literally. Of course, many like Catholicism take the bible figuratively. But the point is that the bible was real and taken literally for the people of Canaan and the Hebrews at that time. It was real. So I've always wondered why the importance on a book written thousands of years ago which has been modified and translated into new versions through 9 centuries. That is the problem, why the obedience to a book? Nevertheless, I know that not all Christians hate atheists or think they're evil.

Since then this manmade tradition has self-destructed into thousands of unauthorized denominations, each claiming to be teaching the truth, yet not agreeing with one another on a single doctrinal issue. But within the Church founded by Jesus Christ, Christians are still ONE in belief, ONE in worship, ONE in teaching, just as Jesus Christ intended. ", 10868, "f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa", 1],
