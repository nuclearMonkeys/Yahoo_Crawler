That's the rationale the Bush administration used to justify lying to us about Iraq; \"Well it was a good fight to get into anyway, and the World will be a safer place with a democratic Iraq\". It's the rationale they used when caught ordering illegal wiretaps; \"We'll catch many more terrorists this way\" (zero so far, those who've been caught were by the vigilance of the American People). It's the rationale they've used whenever they've been caught doing anything shady- here's the problem: Not only do the Ends never justify the Means, but the Ends haven't been that great either! To more directly address your question: How could you possibly understand how wrong the Liberals might be, if you don't even understand their rationale?", 11078, "AA12341057", 2],

	130586 : ["You definitely want to do your research when investing in a video game console (especially if you're only going for one and not buying all of them - you want to make sure it'll last a while). Because of this I will list out for you a pros and cons list for each and every one after this statement: Your final decision should be based on your overall \"comfort\" level with the console and its games - find what your priorities are (and financial restraints) and what you want from your console and it will last you at least the next 5 years. If it helps, visit your nearest retailer and \"feel\" out each one of these consoles at the retailer's entertainment centers. Play the game demos that are available for each console, take note of how the controllers feel in your hand, how the games look and the variety you're able to choose from. That said, here are the PROs and CONs: XBOX 360: $199.99+ (depends on the version you get. Available now is the 4G - that's hard drive memory - and 250G - that's lots of memory - both with/out the new motion capture gaming accessory the KINECT.) Buying it with the KINECT will bring the price tag up by roughly $100. Prices:  4G w/out Kinect - $199.99 4G with Kinect - $299.99 250G w/out Kinect - $299.99 250G with Kinect - $399.99 PROs: - Excellent graphics - same as PS3 - Most games from all 3 - Flexible CPU and GPU - allowing for more games to code for it. Resulting in more games. - Competitive online community and stronger online capabilities. (Even though I know you say you don't enjoy online gaming, you could change your mind somewhere down the road. If you do, you've got a good thriving community to play with.) - Easy navigation. Interactive and well weaves different applications with each other. - Plays personal music over game music - not available in other consoles! Personally, I think this is a great option. - Cross-game communication. Talk with friends that are online that are playing other games. COOL. - Exclusive games like Gears of War. In addition to some, the Xbox is gaining some games that were previously exclusive to the PS3, i.e. Final Fantasy IXV - Only for the Xbox: Twitter and Facebook Apps.  - Achievements system! CONs: - Annual Xbox Live fee of $60. Not that bad, but people can put that against the PS3's free online network. - Bigger controller. This is a matter of personal taste. Personally, I'm tiny and sometimes the Xbox controller is clunky. - No Blu-Ray.  - Lots of hardware issues. A good portion of buyers are promised to some kind of hardware issue sometime during the life of their Xbox and repair is not a fun process.  Wii: Cheap. Literally dirt cheap. Pros:  - Good console for casual gamers - CHEEEAAAAP! Everything is way cheaper to replace in case you find yourself without another controller for your buddies or need a new memory card - Fun controllers-ish? Again, personal taste. - Exclusive Nintendo Games including Mario and Zelda. - Smaller - takes up less space and doesn't have too many problems. - A real family console. Cons: - Not as many strong, hardcore games - Not as many capabilities as the other two consoles. Don't expect to be able to do half as many things as you can on the Xbox360 or PS3 - Graphics just a tad better than that on the gamecube I will add more about the Wii and PS3 in a bit. For now I would suggest you visit TechnoBuffalo's website and spend some time watching his Console Wars series.", 11077, "0VsK2zEUaa", 1],

I really should not help you but I will because most others don't even know the solution. Get the modem disconnected from the router and PC. Then use the button on the back and reset the modem. Now connect the router and set it to DHCP and everything will be set. What happened: The moment you connected the PC to the modem the modem locked in to the MAC address of the NIC card on your PC. Since MAC addresses are hard wired and supposed to be unique your router's MAC address did not match and the modem refused to communicate to it.  Clearing the modem with a reset wipes the existing lock so that it will make a new lock to the next NIC card that connects to it..", 11076, "IJ54bxmoaa", 1],

	130601 : ["Xbox just relased the Kinect, plus they have great games like Halo Reach, Fable III and Gears of War. Plus there releasing new games like Gears of War 3. Plus the Xbox live service is fun PS3 has blue-ray, internet browser, and the new Playstation Move, some great games I played on it were Killzone 2, and God of War 3. They also have Little Big Planet and Gran Tursimo 5. Wii is pretty fun also. I like the New Super Mario Bros. Wii and the Mario Galaxy series. I heard they are releasing a new Zelda game next year too. Out of all these consoles, I found Xbox 360 to be the most fun.

	130602 : ["I would strongly recommend Xbox 360, it has the largest selection for games and a majority of the market. It also has many FPS games of good quality PS3 is great to play on, tends to be higher quality, and has many Final Fantasy titles, but isnt as popular as Xbox and doesnt have as many online players. This system does have good FPS's, virtually the same as the xbox, with the exception of better graphics. Wii on the otherhand is indeed fun for the first bit but does lose its novelty. It becomes a hassle in my opinion, you dont always feel like being active for it. It's more of a family console. Overall I would say xbox. Halo is great and many Final Fantasy games are available on it. Now a days anyway, games are produced for all platforms, The difference really comes down to the controller for many gamers. As for me and people i've talked to, the xbox controller beats the playstation controller 2/1. First off the controller feels more natural and fits in the hand better, secondly, there are triggers on xbox controllers which many users find better than the bumpers found on the ps controller. Note: Check out  Kinnect.  If your getting an xbox, really look into the new Kinnect technology and the games associated with it If you have any questions feel free to email me at Neros.Nemesis@yahoo.com", 11077, "S0DCM5dyaa", 1],
