	116982 : ["The Allegory of the Cave, also commonly known as Myth of the Cave, Metaphor of the Cave, The Cave Analogy, Plato's Cave or the Parable of the Cave, is an allegory used by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work The Republic to illustrate \"our nature in its education and want of education\" The allegory of the cave is written as a fictional dialogue between Plato's teacher Socrates and Plato's brother Glaucon, at the beginning of Book VII in Benjamin Jowett's translation and in chapter IX in Robin Waterfield's translation  Plato imagines a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them, and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows. According to Plato, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to seeing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not constitutive of reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners. The Allegory is related to Plato's Theory of Forms,wherein Plato asserts that \"Forms\" (or \"Ideas\"), and not the material world of change known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Only knowledge of the Forms constitutes real knowledge. In addition, the allegory of the cave is an attempt to explain the philosopher's place in society. The Allegory of the Cave is related to Plato's metaphor of the sun  and the analogy of the divided line , which immediately precede it at the end of Book VI. Allegories are summarized in the viewpoint of dialectic at the end of Book VII and VIII . This relates to the idea of forms as people struggle to see the reality beyond illusion.", 10486, "None", -5],

Let x + 20 = boy's age in 20 years Let 4x + 20  =  man's age in 20 years. Now, the man will be twice as old as the boy in 20 years.

	116997 : ["If you find yourself unable to quit on your own (either cold-turkey or through gradual weaning), the best decision you could make would be rehab or other group support. However, if you are in a situation where rehab isn't an option (say, perhaps, you wouldn't your family, boss, etc. to find out about your addiction), I completely sympathize with a sense of reluctance. On the note of sympathy, I would first like to address the ignorant, heartless bastards who posted here before me, providing the kind of sarcastic, reckless, condescending answers that drive the desperate to LOSE control, the recovered to LOSE faith in humanity, and the repentant to LOSE faith in themselves... And why? Because seeing all the LOSS they leave in their filthy footsteps makes them feel like they have won at life and are somehow more righteous or wise. You all know who you are, and you all make me sick. You disillusioned, ignorant, elitist ****** and the sickening attitudes you propagate are the REASON why modern man has become unable to grow from the demons of his past. You turn the curious wonderer into the lost wanderer, making him his own worst enemy. You arrogantly judge and antagonize others for their past decisions, which you publicly label as stupid, evil, or amoral, despite the fact you've never tried taking a single step in their shoes. You live your lives as no more than collectible dolls - never leaving your flimsy little boxes to experience the life you see outside that plastic window. You're so afraid of getting yourselves broken to so much as break the seal on your pretty plastic wrappers. Your views, beliefs, and morals, therefore, are not your own, but merely the muffled echoes of whatever you are told is true. You are nothing but lifeless puppets whose strings are tied to the hands of the greedy and corrupt; the soulless should not speak for men, so shut up and dance, you mindless drones. As for things you can try to stave off the addiction, try getting access to Ritalin (methylphenidate), which is a synthetic psychostimulant that affects the same neurotransmitters and receptors as cocaine does, and it works in a similar way. However, as long as you are substituting ritalin, stay as far away from cocaine as possible. If you so much as taste cocaine while on ritalin, you will possibly relapse into an even more intense cycle of addiction. Don't think you can trust yourself with the methylphenidate, either. Try to find someone who can give you a SMALL dose (just enough to stave off the craving, not enough to get you high) at whichever time intervals are indicated on the bottle. Seriously, make sure you can trust this person. After several weeks of trying Ritalin, try something amphetamine-based like Adderall. Once again, be careful. Adderall is more potent than Ritalin and is closely related in molecular structure to meth. It should fill your need for dopamine-centric psychostimulants for a while. When the urges to do coke finally abate to an acceptable level, wean yourself off of Adderall as well. If the Adderrall gives you withdrawals (You might experience depression), possibly talk to a doctor about getting antidepressants, preferably of the SSRI-type such as Prozac. (Make sure it's not an MAOI antidepressant. If that mixes with adderrall it can be deadly.   Keep in mind, I have limited personal experience with cocaine, so really check into this, preferably with a professional, before you try anything. From what I know about stimulants and their effects on the brain, this should work in theory. It's my best recommendation, judging from the type of help you appeared to expect to find here.

	117003 : ["The puppet masters in the cave are the demigods in charge of material nature. They are agents of Maya, the illusory energy of God, and they conduct the show which fascinates the prisoners. The prisoners in the cave are conditioned souls bound by material desires, lust and anger. Originally these souls sported in the clear daylight outside, but being attracted to the cave and the things of the cave they left the environment of light and plunged into the darkness of the body where they sit shackled by desire. The puppet pantomimes perceived on the wall of the cave represent other living entities and the various objects the soul perceives while in the body. These are but flicks and specks that come and go. They have no substantiality. Each imprisoned soul takes the shadows of these puppets to be the real objects of the universe. Although the prisoners are seated next to one another and although they exchange opinions about the show they are watching, they neither see themselves nor one another, for they are bound by their passions. Indeed, their real bodies are there hidden in darkness, just as the spiritual body is hidden to one who can perceive only through the material senses. It is only by the mercy of one who is unshackled, of a liberated soul, a spiritual master, that a prisoner can be released from his chains. The cave dwellers cannot release themselves nor one another. They are dependent on someone coming from the outside.
