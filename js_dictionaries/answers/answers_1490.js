Revelations 21:8: \"But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.\" A lake of molten brimstone means that its temperature must be above the melting point but below the boiling point.  Brimstone is sulfur of course.  Melting point is 115C or 240F.  Boiling point is 445C or 832F.   Therefore temperature of hell must at any point along this possibility continuum exceed the melting point of ice or snow which is as we all know 0C or 32F.  Furthermore it exceeds the boiling point of water under normal atmospheric conditions which is 100C or 212F.  Hence any snowball for any possible temperature of hell woiuld become steam.", 9015, "Gf5nMPJXaa", 0],

	80159 : ["Jennifer Grey did cry fairly often, but it wasn't because she was looking for sympathy. She's just a sensitive person and she was in alot of pain. And they kept asking her about the pain she was in, so of course she was going to mention it. She didn't really cry all throughout the competition, it was mostly in the beginning. After that whenever she cried it was usually because she was happy about her scores or something. It shouldn't even matter that she had dancing experience-that was near 25 years ago and she isn't the first. Nicole won and she's a dancer right now, not over 2 decades ago like Jennifer. Jennifer did not cry too much and I'm glad she won. She is 50 years old and she worked hard through pain every week. She is an amazing dancer and she earned that mirror ball trophy. Sour Skittles: Let me start by saying I am not an idiot, you can disagree all you want but at least attempt to come up with valid reasons for despising Jennifer so much instead of spouting all that ridiculous crap. Jennifer was not playing the sympathy card. The only reason she mentioned her injuries was because they kept asking her, and she really did feel terrible about Patrick. She wasn't pretending to cry over a dead friend to get votes, how could you accuse her of that? You don't have to like her but don't make up stupid crap like that to make her sound bad. So many of you Bristol fans are complete dumbasses, she couldn't dance worth a damn and anyone with half a brain could see that. She didn't do a decent dance until the final weeks of the competition. Who the **** cares about how 'humble and thankful' she was? She couldn't dance to save her life and that is what the competition is about. They wanted Jennifer to be on the show-you can't blame her because of the dancing experience-they obviously don't care if they're experienced or not. Nicole and a few others would have never been on the show if they did. Jennifer is a sweet woman, not some arrogant ***** you attempted to make her sound like. And even if she was nasty, the show is about dancing-something she did very well. You don't just vote for someone because they're nice-if they have talent they have talent. Jennifer deserved that trophy whether you want to admit it or not.", 9016, "ASz0brOVaa", 1],

	80175 : ["Jennifer should not have won as she was and has been a professional dancer taking dance lessons her whole life. Yes she is older than her competitors  with double the years of experienced dancing behind her.  She also played the heartstrings of America from the first night on -- talking about the beloved Patrick -- PLEASE!! Most everyone in show business knows Patrick could not STAND Jennifer --  in fact during the entire making of Dirty Dancing he never spoke to her except during filming.  WHY -- this woman is a total diva!  This should have been obvious the week she didn't get her way, got pissed off at Derek and walked out of rehersals.  Now who gets mad at Derek?  Max maybe -- Derek - Never!  She played the heartstring of America, giving us the sympathy card each week she reheresed in so much pain. But every dance night showed dancing without a smidgen of any of the so called pain.  As an ex dancer -- who can spot pain in dancers who are dancing \"through it\" -- Jennifer's pain was only in the minds of her fans.  As for the Diva act -- why has Jennifer only done two movies-- ask the casting folks on the West Coast -- even with all of crazy Hollywood - Divas are NOT tolerated -- (Debra Winger too found this out the hard way!)  Regardless -- Jen is from Hollywood royalty -- with a famous dancing Dad -- Mr. Caberet himself and BFF that helps grabs the teen vote -- Jamie Lee beloved of teens from her Horror movies.  Her dancing was good -- but go back and watch each dance slowly -- Derek did most of the work while Jennifer did a few splits and bends and shimmy's.  Derek made her look great.  He did this for Joanna a few seasons back -- but Joanna was not \"liked\" by America -- too much bad past press -- and it didn't work.  \"Baby\" had it from day one -- the judges pick from the start.  Poor Audrina and Brandy -- sacrificed to keep the competition away.  Bristol never stood a chance at that ball -- all that noise --that was all for RATINGS!!  ABC was in their element - bad press and all -- kept the show being Watched.  Brandy was the real champ and though she was Honest in her quest each week she was belittled for that!  Why -- no one is there to dance and have fun -- that is a comment they are told to say each week -- they say the same on Idol.  You don't slave for 3 months for \"fun\" you do it to Win! She was straight about that -- but thrown to the wolves because more ratings were possible to keep America in fear that Bristol could/would win.  Now we have 2 years with pro celebs who are really dancers first winning.  The show needs to be done on a fairer playing field!  Takes all the fun out of watching it like this.

	80188 : ["Is hell exothermic or endothermic? As for souls entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in Hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant.  1. So, if Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.  2. Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, than the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.  This would have to be answered prior to me giving you any kind of snowball's chance in hell...thermodynamically speaking, of course.", 9015, "d45a15ef47ccb3ed90fbff1fb9b09ef6aa", 2],
	80189 : ["I didn't care if Kyle or Jennifer won as long as it wasn't Bristol. Bristol isn't even a star/celebrity.  Her only claim to fame is being the knocked up teenage daughter of a losing vice-presidential candidate.  If it wasn't for that..  who would care that she exists? Getting back to Jennifer though, she did well throughout the whole competition while getting treatment for cancer.  That's an accomplishment for anyone. Jennifer really didn't have an \"advantage\" she was in a dancing moving 20+ years ago, and none of it was ballroom, ballroom dancing is a lot different and more competitive than other forms of dancing.

I agree with your mom about Grey and was frankly tired of the clips of her crying about her degenerative condition..   Why risk your health further over a dance competition?   She and Derek were both professional dancers.   It is what it is. Bristol was not as good as Kyle.  Audrina and Brandy should have been in the finals, but based on the voting this is how it panned out, the strangest final competition ever.   DWTS asked Bristol to appear just to boost ratings, which she did.   I question their judgment on the \"star\" question, not Bristol.    Frankly, I'm sick of the rude comments about her and her mother.   Kyle was the bright spot of this trio.  For that,  he had my vote.", 9016, "Ocyrox5baa", -1],
