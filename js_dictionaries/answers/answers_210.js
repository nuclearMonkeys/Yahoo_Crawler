You can also ask someone at the court. Depending on the trial, it could go on for weeks. Your employer can't expect you to make up all that time. Jury duty is something that should be planned for in their attendance policies. ", 1716, "None", 0],

These were people who got help from a nonprofit organization I was working with to help them get driver's licenses to assist in getting to their new jobs and register to vote, (if they wanted to). Those that didn't register to vote but got their licenses anyway were never summoned. That cannot be a coincidence.  That is why I think it will be hilarious when many of the 'new' Biden voters get called for jury duty and never show up because they don't exist.", 1719, "fp8i8udTaa", 1],

He began 2020 saying the election was rigged when the states were working diligently to safeguard the voting process in the middle of the pandemic.  He planted the idea of the 'stolen election' in the minds of his supporters who still believe he legitimately won the election.  His supporters (including members of his own party and cabinet) also made these false claims.   He incited a riot on January 6th to stop the certification of the election- that's treasonous.   That's why he was impeached a second time.  He should have gone to jail for that.  He is a horrible person.  He deserved to loose the election- he lost because of his ego and the desire to stay in power no matter what.", 1723, "b3f0016028add554085c10b87869f064aa", 0],
