But if you weren't sponsored by another family, an employer after exhausting the H1B visa program or obtained an investors green card it's likely she's the sponsor. You've apparently removed the marital conditions from your green card but if your wife signed the Affidavit of Support she's still responsible for you four 10 years from the date she signed it. This means she would have to reimburse the government for any social benefits you receive. This is separate from alimony and that's an issue that varies greatly depending on state law, the duration of the marriage and a number of other factors. In most cases unless you gave up a career to stay home alimony isn't in play. Go talk to a lawyer. ", 3675, "J3axFJ2Saa", 0],

	22857 : ["The Tesla Model 3 will do roughly 300 miles per charge, and Tesla has refueling stations along all the major highways and in the cities.  So you plan on stopping in to refuel just like you would need to do on long trips with a hybrid.   The car purchase costs about the same as any of your standard hybrids.  But maintenance costs are next to nothing in the Tesla. I own both the Tesla Model S and the Chevy Volt, the hybrid.  I drive the Tesla on my long trips because it's more comfortable and packed with all kinds of safety devices.  I drive the Volt around town on short trips because I can do that strictly on battery (it gets 53 miles per charge) and there's no way I'd park my Tesla in a high crime area like Oakland. Were I you, I'd buy the Model 3 over any hybrid because the maintenance costs are next to nothing and the fuel millage is about the same as a standard gas driven car...300 miles.  If you do get the Tesla, you will need to install a NEMA 50 amp 240 volt plug in your garage to fuel up overnight while you sleeps...which is another cool feature, refueling while you sleep.", 3668, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", -1],

	22867 : ["It depends on what happens to the existing power stations - your question makes it seem the current power production systems will remain and this \"next one\" augments it/them. Since peak power usage normally happens during the day - under hot weather conditions - augmenting the existing power production with a large solar array would be more beneficial. If the \"next power station\" is replacing the existing power production infrastructure, the only way solar makes sense is if a very large power storage project is included to deal with over-night. Though a lot of consideration needs to be made about cloudy days, too. In this case, it may be more beneficial to use a natural gas power generation system as it will provide power regardless of time-of-day or weather conditions.", 3664, "8vF85gInaa", 2],

There is a part in it that talks about working with in your circle of influence. Recognizing what you can and can't control. You can't go in to permanent despair mode because you cannot push a button and automatically fix global warming.  Its a marathon not a sprint. You should contribute how ever you can and write your leaders and make your views known and demand that the businesses you patronize act responsibly. But if you wear your self out by anxiety you won't do anyone any good. Care for your self. You can't help out the planet if you don't help yourself first. If you need medication get it. Other than that - tap into meditation and read that book. I would disagree with the first respondent about how our individual actions mean nothing. The more people that live sustainably, the better off we'll all be. And collectively all the people that are living sustainably are helping. Its just that we can't see all their work together. Also if you add up this persons sustainable living in a years time and see his personal contributions that way - it is also a big difference. Never underestimate your personal power to make change.

	22886 : ["False figures given to show EVs as greener than they are. Gas cars 17- 21%? Maybe old American gas guzzlers but modern petrol engines can achieve 35% efficiency. Diesels can achieve 50%. Oh and there are 5-10% transmission losses from power station to plug as well as considerable energy expended mining and transporting coal to the power station. Therefore, overall, an EV power from a coal fired station is worse than to a gas car in emissions. How EVs benefit the planet depends on the emissions produced by generating the electricity . One last point. The electricity you use is exactly the same as your neighbours regardless of company and whether you pay extra for green electric. It may or may not been generated by countryside wrecking wind factories but it's just as likely to come from coal in sone areas.", 3678, "HdLKZwkyaa", 0],
