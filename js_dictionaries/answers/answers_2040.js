	107767 : ["HTML is a static website language. It is high-quality to learn it first, but you are going to quickly study that there's no real \"programming\" to it. It simplest, (yes most effective) tells the browser what, where, and how to show. CSS is \"Cascading variety Sheets.\" It well-nigh is the equal as the \"form\" section of HTML, however in the case that you want to make many internet sites with the same general form, that you may have the HTML file use the unique CSS file for its formatting. JavaScript is a patron-side dynamic scripting language. In essence, it spits out HTML for the browser to view, but all of the work is completed by way of the browser itself, so it's not cozy. It is very useful for doing matters that require quick animations. Hypertext Preprocessor is a Server-part dynamic scripting language. That suggests the web server off somewhere strategies the script based on different understanding, then sends the browser a raw HTML file. Your browser can on no account see the php script, so it's at ease. Hypertext Preprocessor is famous for its capability to work with MySQL and periods. SQL is a database-aspect scripting language. It really works with a Database-administration-method(DBMS). SQL does no longer do any processing itself. The DBMS does. Examples of DBMSes include MySQL, Microsoft entry, Microsoft SQL Server, and others. There are additionally many different patron side scripting languages, comparable to xHTML, XML, etc. The identical goes for server-aspect scripting languages. JSF (JavaServer Faces) is a very good one. Every other general ones are ASP, ASPX, and JSP. Think free to email me if in case you have any questions.", 10017, "NlscuIymaa", 0],
