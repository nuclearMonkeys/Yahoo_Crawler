	128909 : ["I am 37 years old and in my entire life I have not had the opportunity to vote for anyone but a Clinton or Bush.  I believe it time to give someone else a chance.  If you look around the world at countries that have dynasties, after a while the people no longer matter.  This became even more clear to me, when I noticed how friendly the Clintons and Bushes became over the past years. In addition, I believe we must be able to trust our leaders.  The years during the Clinton White House had significant scandal and fraud.  While the majority of Americans did well financially, our country lost is moral compass because we tolerated leadership that would lie and blame others for the they shortcomings.  When Bill lied to the country about his behavior, which I truly believe was a private matter, until he publicly lied, He and Hillary called it a vast Right wing conspiracy, and later had to knowledge the accusation was true.  We have an ex-president who has lost his law license because he was unable to tell the truth under other.  To this day Hillary will not release the files from her years in the White House so we can truly understand her work during those years. Here are the reason I support Barack: 1. He has more years of legislative experience that all the front-runners except for Mr. McCain 2. He is a listener and uniter. After 7 years of watching Mr. Bush and Cheney behave like cowboys and ignore the will of the people, I believe it's time to have some one who will listen and care about the people. 3. I do believe that the Iraq vote matters. While both candidates are now against the war, I worry about any candidate that is so willing to vote to invaded another country.  We need to work towards peace and use wars as our last resort.  I am not confident that if another conflict arose that Mrs. Clinton won't take us into another unnecessary war. 4. Finally, our country needs healing. We tend to blame everything on George Bush, but the reality is, when Bill Clinton left office the country was very divided. We became even more divided when Gore lost the Supreme Court decision, and we have never been the same country since that day.  A vote for Obama will give us a leader who can heal our country and bring us together. 5. Healthcare, I don't want my wages garnished or force to buy insurance, if I don't want to.

I just fear that if Hillary is elected it will be impossible for Bill not to have an undue amount of influence. I just cannot imagine him being able to sit back and act as a \"first lady\" when visiting foreign leaders he dealt with as president.
