There are still many people on the verge of losing their homes, that haven't already. People are not donating as much to thrift stores. They are holding on to the things they might ordinarily donate with   coming. But this holiday season, won't be much more outgoing than last year. As in general the struggle remains of keeping good healthy food on the table after paying the utilities and keeping ones' roof over their heads. There is a focus even in magazines, of crafty gifts to make at home and give as presents. Also decorations as well. Frugality seems to be the name of the game again this year. They are even going to change the hours for Black Friday I have read. They will be much later than last year. But still before normal store hours. I saw an ad on the internet from Target, wanting to know what items you would be interested in purchasing for  , and there was an incentive for a discount on those items. And they wanted to specifically know what you were interested in. I've never seen a store offer to mark down an item that the customer has on their shopping list. I guess they want to have a better idea of what things people will be shopping for, so they can mark down and get people into their store and away from the competition.        Getting back to the fancy jeans. I would shop at the better thrift stores. And buy a pair of $6.00 to $8.00 jeans, and buy some iron on decals and some things that may dangle that can be sewn on a pocket, or leg. Things that will catch the eye and make them special. Maybe even sew on some key chain loops and hang some things on them up and down the leg.  People tend to copy trends, they see and like. Be the first in your town to add cute little add ons.

	128696 : ["OH YEAH!!!! I guess i have to really. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, 8 years ago and was progressively getting more debilitated by it. Doctors gave me medication to help, one of top neurologists in Australia told me that i would never get any better. The medication was bad, it made me feel sick every time i took it (every second day) but that is what it's meant to do. When i got sick Mum gave me a bible, i started reading and was hooked. I knew that this Jesus could heal me if He healed so many. I wanted to stop taking the medication but was advised that God gave us medicine too, so not to be too hasty. We prayed about it and that night i developed a rash all over me, i rang the hospital and they told me to stop taking the medication as i had become allergic to it. I experienced a miracle healing from Jesus over a period of time which culminated in a final touch from God when my Pastor was laying hands on me during a time of prayer. Not only did God heal the MS he has made me fitter and healthier than ever. Now years later i am completely healed and have been given so much more than just health, i received salvation. There is no medical explanation for my healing, the best thing i heard was the doctors telling me that there was nothing they could do for me, coz now they can't take the credit for God's miracle!!

	128699 : ["The Christian concept of their messiah indeed morphed aspects of Mithras/Tammuz/Dumzi and other incarnate savior kings sacrificed to atone a sinful nature. Those beliefs are ANTITHETICAL to the Torah. It is beyond me why the Rock keeps misinforming with an answer that has been soundly refuted with evidence more than once. If one is born a Jew it is clearly not Kosher in worshipping Jesus as his god. God says outright in the book of Exodus that any of the covenant of Israel who worship a false god separate themselves from God and the covenant of Israel.  An apostate has no legal standing to speak for Jews according to God's words in Torah. This past answer and its reputable reference from one of the world's foremost experts on the topic soundly refute the misinformation given by him.   see the book referenced mentioning the only places a Mosiach ben Yosef is referrred to..and note that the reason why you don't see many other Hebrew Christians ( or any other Christians for that matter) claiming to tie Jesus to Mosiach ben Yosef is because the New Testament depiction of Jesus wasn't written to fit him to that tribe and prophecy and he'd have to claim their New Testament was completely wrong about both genealogies for Jesus and many other things to claim he was that messiah of a different tribe altogether, too.  Funny that now they want Jesus to fit TWO entirely DIFFERENT messiah prophecies and he fit neither. Zoroastrian influence *is* found within some Jewish philosophical aspects, but please don't use Wikipedia for religion ..it often has people maliciously misinforming there, too. Like the many months someone kept reinserting the insulting lie that Jews sniff the socks of our dead at funerals. I won't even go to Wiki. The form of Mithras worship that had its influence upon Christianity was the ROMANIZED adaptation.  The Greeks and Romans assimilated religions from virtually every people they conquered. They'd add a deity to their pantheon and some things might be changed a bit.  There is evidence in the Tanakh that a form of Tammuz worship (that was sometimes combined in Mithras worship in some regions) by apostates led to the destruction of the FIRST Temple.  See   that quotes the portion of Tanakh re: First Temple leading up to a point about the Second Temple. I learned most of what I know about Zoroastraian faith a few years ago from some Iranian Zoroastrian adherents online and their references.  Your Q tied the Jewish and Christian concepts of MESSIAH together when they are antithetical to one another thus revealing perhaps you believe that the only difference between Judaism and Christianity is over WHO the messiah is , not what he is, what God promises that the messiah will accomplish and do, the nature of God, the nature of the relationship between man and God, the unalterable fact that our covenant with God is eternal and that Torah does not change.  New Testament adherents are forced to believe God lied to all Israel who were direct witness to the Divine presence at Sinai if they worship through Jesus as an incarnate manifestation of God. God says in the Torah God does not become a man, and Jews are obligated to believe God didn't lie about either his nature, or our covenant with God.  and the book Judaism and Christianity; a Contrast by Rabbi Stuart Federow will guide you through both religion's scriptures ..Don't take anyone's word here on your own Jews believe Torah is God's word on the matter and it isn't alterable. The New Testament claims to have replaced/invalidated/amended the Tanakh, they retranslated (mistranslated in some areas) rearranged and renamed the Old testament (by Church father Tertullian ) stated specifically because it replaced the former. Jeremiahs renewed covenant is only different from what we now know of the eternal covenant in that when the Davidic messiah lives and accomplishes what God promises, no one will need to teach another about God and the covenant because all will know about it.  No sales pitch could be necessary for anyone in the world to not know when universal brotherhood, world peace, justice for all humanity and universal knowledge and worship of God is taking place.   Polytheistic religions often borrowed from one another, and Empires assimilated “borg like” others in to their own pantheon. they had no limits to numbers of deity. Judaism was unique in strict monotheism.   All links are necessary to understand this answer completely. Shalom", 10996, "vEEeq7kYaa", 1],
	128700 : ["Yes, I do believe in miracles and have been at the receiving end of God's miraculous healing, as well as seeing miracles elsewhere.

	128712 : ["Christianity was riffing off of other Hellenic salvation religions which have parallels with Zoroastrianism, so there are connections. Hard to know at this point which was the source, what were the influences and how direct/indirect they were between any two. We could have a situation where influences between multiple sources were going in both directions. What is more clear, however, is that Judaism wasn't a player in all of that. Judaism doesn't have the dualism so popular in Greek philosophy, Zoroastrianism, Hellenic salvation religions, Gnostic thinking and Christianity. Judaism uses a very different definition of Messiah than Christianity. Christianity is basically attempting to sledgehammer a thoroughly non-Jewish dying/returning incarnate saviour deity into Judaism's mythic narratives and not bothering to notice that it doesn't fit. Because the Jewish G-d doesn't split into parts or incarnate, resurrection makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in a Jewish context.
