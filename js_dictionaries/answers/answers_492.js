	27298 : ["---  Hi, Pedro.  We need to read the paragraphs to answer these questions. You haven't included them here, but I think your exercise is referring to the following article:  • Body language, not facial expressions, broadcasts what's happening to us  ➙    Then:  ► 1ST PARAGRAPH  If you think that you can judge by examining someone's facial expressions if he has just hit the jackpot in the lottery or lost everything in the stock market ― think again. Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at New York University and Princeton University have discovered that ― D̲e̲s̲pi̲t̲e̲ what leading theoretical models and conventional wisdom might indicate ― it just doesn't work that way.  ► 2ND PARAGRAPH  R̲a̲t̲h̲e̲r̲, they found that body language provides a better cue in trying to judge whether an observed subject has undergone strong positive or negative experiences.  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  ► EXERCISE  1. Read the first paragraph and choose the correct item to complete the sentence below.  {Researches have discovered that...}  a) theoretical models and conventional wisdom do not work.  b) you cannot judge people's feelings by examining their facial expressions. ✔  NOTE:  The answer is in the text:  I̲f̲ yo̲u̲ t̲h̲i̲n̲k̲ t̲h̲a̲t̲ yo̲u̲ c̲a̲n̲ ju̲d̲ge̲ b̲y e̲x̲a̲m̲i̲n̲i̲n̲g s̲o̲m̲e̲o̲n̲e̲'s̲ f̲a̲c̲i̲a̲l̲ e̲x̲pr̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲s̲ if he has just hit the jackpot in the lottery or lost everything in the stock market ― think again. R̲e̲s̲e̲a̲r̲c̲h̲e̲r̲s̲ at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at New York University and Princeton University h̲a̲v̲e̲ d̲i̲s̲c̲o̲v̲e̲r̲e̲d̲ t̲h̲a̲t̲ ― Despite what leading theoretical models and conventional wisdom might indicate ― i̲t̲ ju̲s̲t̲ d̲o̲e̲s̲n̲'t̲ w̲o̲r̲k̲ t̲h̲a̲t̲ w̲a̲y.  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  2. What idea is expressed by *despite* in the first paragraph?  a) Comparison.  b) Concession. ✔  c) Conclusion.  d) Consequence.  NOTE:  Discourse markers (also referred to as 'linking words', 'linking phrases' or 'sentence connectors') may express different types of relationships between ideas.  When a word or expression is used to make an unexpected contrast (such as 'although', 'even though', 'despite the fact that...', 'in spite of the fact that...', 'regardless of the fact that...', etc.) it expresses concession.  You may read more here if you want:  • Discourse Markers | CELTE - Academic English Zone  ➙    ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  3. Which expression below can replace *rather* in the second paragraph?  a) On the contrary. ✔  b) For that reason.  c) Without a doubt.  d) As a consequence.  NOTE:  The adverb 'rather' may be used to suggest that the opposite of a previous statement is the case, that is, it may mean 'on the contrary'.  You can see the definition here (3rd meaning):  • rather  3. Used to suggest that the opposite of a previous statement is the case; on the contrary.  Example: There is no shortage of basic skills in the workplace. Rather, the problem is poor management.  Source:  • rather  ➙    Happy New Year. 😊  ----------------------------  .", 4264, "None", 0],
