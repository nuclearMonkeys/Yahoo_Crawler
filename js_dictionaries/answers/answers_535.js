FAFSA allocations is based on whether or not you are dependent and the income of those parents -- of the income of the person who is not a dependent.  When you get married, you no longer can be claimed by your parents for tax purposes.  Marriage changes your status, your parents, and your spouses. Failing to inform the government of these changes ( and filing appropriate tax forms) could put you and your family members in a bad situation where they'd be defrauding the government.   In addition, if you get health insurance through your parents, that could be altered as well.   You change name by filing a legal name change, not in a ceremony.  It requires a legal request at the time of marriage or at a later date and then you have to change your social security, drivers license, etc.  Changing your name doesn't make any difference in terms of your status as a dependent of your parents or a married woman who is now responsible for her own income, taxes, etc.  Eloping simply means you get married privately.  You still have to get a marriage license and then file that with the state to have legal status.   Feel free to contact FAFSA or a tax attorney or accountant if you want more help in this area. I know that sounds extreme (and costly) but getting married is really less about romance and more about the law and taxes.  Sorry.", 4601, "RVK1NrNJaa", 1],

	29748 : ["Taking care of yourself is a good thing - but one of the most important thing is to be a strong person. A strong guy is looking for a strong woman - he's not overly concerned with looks (he knows they fade with age). May I suggest that the first question to ask yourself when considering whether or not to date someone is, “Is this person a strong person?” If they're not, no matter how much you like them, how much they like you, or how “cute” or “hot” they are, - please don't date them. A strong person has good character (honesty, integrity, trustworthiness), displays a positive attitude (cheerful, caring, friendly, forgiving, helpful, and respectful), fulfills their responsibilities (for handling people who are pains in a positive way, for always trying to make a good choice, for taking care of themselves, for serving others), gives their best effort, and demonstrates self-control (of their body, anger, mouth and money). My suggestion is that you put in the effort necessary to become a strong person (if you're not already), forget about this guy unless he's a strong person, and eventually look for this type of guy (otherwise you're setting yourself up for a broken heart). Unfortunately this type of man is difficult to find – but save yourself the heartache and don't settle for less. (Please remember that you eventually want a 50 or 60 year marriage - not a 5 or 10 year marriage.) Hope this helps! PS Here are \"21 tips that could help you to attract a strong person\" from the book True Love Lasts: 1. Take the time and put in the effort to become a strong person yourself (this is the most important tip) 2. Put yourself in as many situations as possible that will allow you to potentially come in contact with other strong people - community service organizations, the library, high school or college clubs, the “Y” or other workout facilities, religious book studies, coffee shops, non-alcoholic parties, bookstores, concerts (wear a good pair of earplugs to protect your ears from permanent hearing loss), co-ed recreational athletic teams, community service projects, mission trips, volunteer service, etc. Try to get to know other people as much as possible without dating 3. Be cheerful, approachable, and friendly - smile regularly to put others at ease (let people see your positive attitude) 4. Take a real interest in getting to know others. Ask people an open-ended question about themselves in order to get them talking. Share things related to what's been said as needed to keep the conversation going. Then ask them another question 5. Be polite and kind to everyone - even to people who you don't like or enjoy being around 6. If you decide to not accept a request for a date, do it in a kind way (being rude isn't a good choice and it doesn't help you - word about it will get out and you'll become less approachable) 7. Be confident about yourself - if you're trying to become a stronger person each day, you already have a lot going for you 8. Be humble - don't act like you're Miss Charming or you're Mr. Wonderful 9. Don't be concerned about whether or not someone likes you 10. Have the attitude that if someone doesn't like you - they don't really know you 11. Take care of yourself by getting enough sleep (at least nine hours for teens, at least seven hours for adults according to the experts), exercising regularly (if approved by your doctor), and eating a healthy diet 12. Develop a good sense of humor - including the ability to laugh at your own mistakes 13. Be known as a hard worker 14. Dress well and dress modestly at the same time (wearing seductive clothing doesn't attract another strong person) 15. Pay attention to your appearance, but don't obsess over it (remember that strong people are attracted to other strong people, they're not too concerned about looks - because they realize that looks fade with age). If you use makeup, make sure it's not excessive. Use perfumes and colognes sparingly - if at all 16. Truly care about other people 17. Stay in close communication with real friends who can help you through the ups and downs of life and hold you accountable 18. Be patient - real friends can help you with this 19. Persevere - please remember that almost nothing worthwhile is quick and easy. Please don't settle for dating a weak person 20. Don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to date you 21. Don't act desperate for a date", 4615, "U4o8Bs4xaa", 0],

In other words, if it is getting to the stage where his liking of these pictures means that he is neglecting your relationship then it is a problem. Furthermore, you also have a right to be angry if he is reaching out and flirting with these women via social media.  With regard to him ignoring you, I would say that he probably needs a little space. My advice would be not to message him. He knows that you exist and will reach out to you when he is ready. If he is giving you the silent treatment then he wants you to feel guilty and message him so you would be playing into his hands anyway. After a few days, reach out and offer to work things out with him. I always believe that every relationship is salvageable. However, I think the first thing you need to do is to be proactive in making things work between you. By that I mean you both need to work on resolving the complications that caused this argument in the first place. In order to do that you will both need to think of solutions and ultimately, you will both need to compromise on certain things.

He obviously has double standards which is not fair on either your or the relationship. Therefore, what I recommend you do is to cut back on the nice things that you do for him. From this point forward, he needs to earn these things by improving his attitude and proving that he can contribute to the relationship in a meaningful. Secondly, I would talk to him and plan fun things for the both of you to do. The logic behind this is to get your boyfriend to contribute the relationship in a meaningful way. I wouldn't worry about him cancelling either because guys are always hesitant to cancel on their partners because they cannot live with the guilt. In saying that, when you do meet up with him place an emphasis on activities that have an interactive theme to them. The purpose of this is to get your boyfriend to be more open with you in the way that you desire and contribute in a way that is positive and emotionally fulfilling. Think about it: the only way that he is going to be more appreciative of you is if he continues to learn more about you. However, be sure to give him praise when he does make an effort.

Although it is little of consolation what I can say is that time heals all wounds. While it may not seem like it, you will move on from this and be stronger for the experience. However, in order to take your mind off things try keeping yourself as busy as possible; if your mind is focused on something else then it cannot drift into thinking about what your boyfriend has done.
