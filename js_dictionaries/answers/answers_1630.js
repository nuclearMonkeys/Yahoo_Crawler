	87162 : ["I don't believe that the Big Bang theory requires a beginning of time.  It asserts that we can extrapolate back in time to when all the matter of the universe was concentrated at one point in space.  It does not assert what comes before that.  It does not assert that matter had a beginning. I don't believe in any theory that suggests that matter is not eternal.  I believe that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it may be possible to convert from matter to energy and back. I don't believe God created the universe ex nihilo, and I don't believe the Big Bang theory supports this conjecture. I think we know very little about this universe, and current theories are like a discussion among fish what it is like to live and breathe on land. We know very little about God outside of what we need to know in our time and on our world.  I could say a very little about how God began, using revelations you are not aware of, but few would believe me.", 9252, "AA11460171", 1],
	87163 : ["To be honest, it is nonsensical to even use \"before\". \"Before\" is an application of time and thus there can't be a \"before time came into effect.\" There are huge issues with a being that lives outside of time and space.  Thoughts take time.  Minds are made up of experiences which also require time to experience.  If God created angels \"before\" he created humans, this would indicate that he was living in a timed (not a timeless) environment but still does not explain how a God's personality could develop devoid of personal experiences from an outside source. The number 4 does not exist, it is a concept or label that we apply.  Even Love and Goodwill are concepts or labels that we apply to other phenomenon You make the assumption that everything has to have a cause but then fall into the realm of Special Pleading when you then go on to imply that everything EXCEPT your God requires a cause.

And for that matter, IF he gave proof, everyone would follow him out of obligation, not of love, and thats pretty sad. Besides, there is a hell of alot of significant proof for god in the bible: Think about this. The first Greek translation of the old testament, in which all the predictions about the messiah were made, was translated and recorded before there was such thing as crucifiction....but jesus showed up and was crucified -anyway-. Even if you dont want to accept jesus, how the hell did they even -know- about crucifiction? Its not a guessing game friend, its \"do you accept me, or do you not\". Go read the bible, go hang out in a christian chat room and learn about it. Its not false. And you know what, if you need a real reason to get started, heres a secular one to think about: Say you become a faithful christian. You are one your whole life. You are happy, you are a good person, and you try to be good because of what you are taught in the bible. (That is, assuming you follow it correctly, like not going beyond the teachings of the bible, taking it literally, or being hateful, stupid **** that isnt in the bible) So thats the case. Now, you die. If you are correct, and God is real and all of this is real, you have lived a good happy life, as a good person, and you are rewarded with Eternity with god in a paradise that is eden and everything more. If you are wrong though? Well, you still live a good life, as a good person, happy, and you had faith that there was someone protecting you your hole life, you were never alone and basically, you had a good run.

Because the teachings of Christ were meant for a certain type of people (Jews) and for period of time. \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel\" [Mathew 15:24] His teachings are not fit for modern day. They were meant for the Jews, because they had grown a hard hearted, with rules like \"an eye for an eye\" , \"a tooth for a tooth\", which were proper at that time for the Jews because they had traveled so long with Moses in the desert and had no time judge people, or sent them to prison. So Jesus came and said the opposite to make them soft hearted. Telling them if someone smacks you in the cheek give them your other, or when someone walks a mile with you, you walk two miles. Although, they are beautiful rules, it just doesn't fit this time period.

All through the Bible God shows grace and forgiveness to people. He teaches us to be forgiving and to be merciful. He loves us so much and He doesn't want us to burn in Hell. He wants us to live with Him in Heaven. That was the whole reason He died on the cross.  Just because someone deserves something, it doesn't mean that they are going to get it and sometimes that's a good thing. This justice thing is up to God alone. He knows what we deserve and He decides where we end up, but He has told us how to go to Heaven. All we have to do is accept Him as our Savior. We will all be judged, but we won't all go to Hell.", 9256, "F62fB6Qqaa", 3],
	87176 : ["Because if God though you were worth the effort to be saved and was willing to send Jesus then the absolute least we can do is tell you how to find the narrow road.  Jesus said to go and save as many as we could and whether you like it or not that includes trying to save you. Faith in God and Jesus is a relationship that changes the heart and it is your choice, a love and faith that is compelled isn't a true love or relationship. But just so you get the idea, Bill Weise was given a vision of hell and told to go tell others so some might be saved, I hear it is a best selling book too. 23 minutes in hell It isn't God's justice we want, it is God's mercy and grace.  Jesus paid for the sins of those that will repent and believe and that forgiveness sets us free from the punishment and enslavement to sin.  It is your choice if you want to remain a slave. John 8 31  So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, \"If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; 32  and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\"  John 8 34  Jesus answered them, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. 35  \"The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever. 36  \"So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.

	87178 : ["For thousands of years, people have said that their god was behind what they didn't understand -- life, lightning, stars, earthquakes, the origin of life, the world or the universe, etc.  Positing a god to supposedly answer a question solves nothing.  It just stops you from asking more questions. There's no reliable evidence for God/Yahweh, Jesus, Allah, Zeus, Thor, or any of the thousands of other gods that people have worshiped.  If any of the major gods existed, there would be reliable evidence.  Since no such evidence exists, these gods do not exist.  There's also extensive evidence that they are all just myths, created to help soothe our fear of death, and perpetuated through religion to subjugate the underclass into obedience. It used to be that science couldn't answer the question about the origin of the Big Bang, but that didn't mean we should make up a god and say that it was the cause. Within the last few decades science has discovered some good answers. There are many well-respected physicists, such as Stephen Hawking, Lawrence Krauss, Sean M. Carroll, Victor Stenger, Michio Kaku, Alan Guth, Alex Vilenkin, Robert A.J. Matthews, and Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek, who have created scientific models where the Big Bang and thus the entire universe could arise from nothing but a quantum vacuum fluctuation -- via natural processes. In relativity, gravity is negative energy, and matter and photons are positive energy.  Because negative and positive energy seem to be equal in absolute total value, our observable universe appears balanced to the sum of zero.  Our universe could thus have come into existence without violating conservation of mass and energy — with the matter of the universe condensing out of the positive energy as the universe cooled, and gravity created from the negative energy.  When energy condenses into matter, equal parts of matter and antimatter are created — which annihilate each other to form energy.  However there is a slight imbalance to the process, which results in matter dominating over antimatter. I know that this doesn't make sense in our Newtonian experience, but it does in the realm of quantum mechanics and relativity.

Since the universe had always existed, they said that there was no need for a Creator. .................Then an expanding universe was discovered!  D'OH! An expanding universe means that the universe once had a beginning.  The Bible has said that since the Bronze Age.  We must be very careful not to give the Bible any credit here.  Just because an expanding universe proves the Bible to be correct, that means nothing.  All it means is that the Bible was right and the atheists were wrong. Sooooooo........... Now atheists are forced to agree with the Bible that the universe DID have a beginning. The Bible says that God created the universe. The atheist don't know how the universe started (as they have admitted in their answers to this question).  All the atheists can agree on one thing- God didn't create the universe.  They don't know how the universe came to exist, but they KNOW that it wasn't God.  This is their reasoning- The Bible is wrong because the Bible is wrong and therefore the Bible is wrong.
