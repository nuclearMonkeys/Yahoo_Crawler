Other forms of renewable energy are reliable in different places. Generally, the grid is more reliable than any one of them. However, Texas set up its own grid to avoid federal regulation.

	23211 : ["I enjoy torturing common frogs. I choose frogs as my victim because they're very easy to catch, are harmless and don't bite, and have spectacular reactions when tortured. Here are my favourite methods: Crucify the frog with thumb tacks and spray with window cleaner. This causes them to writhe and thrash violently. Crucify by just the arms and they'll also start doing little kicks everywhere with their legs Quarter by chopping all limbs off. Forcing the torso to try to escape is extremely funny Crucify, pour igniting liquid on them, then set on fire Cricify then dump salt on them. They don't bubble or anything, but thrash really violently because it burns them Throw into hot water, and they'll start thrashing and trying to escape I'm also obsessed with seeing the 'bouncing' throats of frogs. I'd often catch and restrain just to film this. A particular favourite is pummeling the frog until it lowers its head, then cutting its toes. Usually the frog perks up, sticks its head in the air and widens its eyes in pain after this.Â ", 3709, "None", -5],

Some of the humor/way of speaking is pretty dated, but I think the acting/characters shine through at times and make it worth checking out. There's an early episode, either season 1 or 2, where the main guy Sam Malone, he owns a bar but he's a former alcoholic now sober, and he has a string of bad luck and is sitting there towards the end just staring at a shot and thinking about drinking it, and I thought that episode was really well done. Also I think Diane the main girl is pretty cute and funny so when an episode is about her I enjoy it. But yeah I'd say check it out for yourself and you might enjoy it.Â ", 3717, "byGLIikVaa", 1],
