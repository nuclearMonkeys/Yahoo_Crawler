XD Best ride EVER. ...Seriously, that was really stupid (well, okay, it was smart, but in a mean way) for them to advertise it as a \"roller coaster\" since it's a \"wild mouse coaster\". The trick they did with it was that they just called it a \"coaster\", not a \"roller coaster\". That's where they're getting everyone. I guess my wait wasn't SO bad, but it was long and boring. I wasn't upset however, because the above really did happen. But I was with my family, and not all of them were as fortunate. And DAAAAAMN...were they pi$$ed!!! Worst experience of their lives. Seriously, they'll probably take it down in like (hopefully) 10 years once it's run its course. Seriously, it's such a disappointment to all fans of the series and the park. That was a really stupid move on Six Flags' part...unless you're a parent and your child loved it of course. And if the child was scared of his or her mind, then those 10 years might actually come true. XD Oh well. Here's to hoping that Six Flags gives us a good Free Fall replacement...because that's the end of Batman & Robin. = ", 8275, "RTzJhnBSaa", 1],

Half the wait was in this cold room where I guess we were supposed to watch whatever was on the tv, but nobody was paying attention.  I figured, after all that torture, and the tons of advertising, it would be a good ride.  WRONG.  It was so boring, worse than Skull Mountain - which I ride every time for the nostalgia.  It whips you around a few corners, and there is the smallest drop ever.  Kids might like it cause I guess if you're paying attention it could be slightly Batman-themed, but for the most part, it's terrible.

	64785 : ["Before I went on this ride, I didn't really do any research on it..so I think I was hyped up for something, and didn't realize that it's not a big deal at all...when we finally got on the actual ride I was like \"oh...a wild mouse in the dark...that's it?...\"  :-(   I'm not too fond of wild mouse coasters in the first place, but I'd rather ride this one then any other one just because it's themed and I liked the surprise ending (I think they recently added that). The first time I went on it, there were 2 teen-aged girls sitting behind me...one of the girls was so scared, she was screaming so loud...that was kind of funny (and then we saw our on-ride pictures, and the girls both had their heads down while embracing the lapbar for dear life).. I agree with you that I would never wait 2 hours in line for that coaster - sorry you had to go through that for this ride!  But I probably would go back on it if there is no wait and if it's a really hot day (that's a positive about this ride - at least it keeps you out of the sun for a little bit).
