The p[art about fight for what you want or let it go...I would say that was her way of putting it back on you..like since you didnt track her down then it was your fault not hers.

I finally stopped when I was 28, but I stopped because I knew it was so bad, it was expensive and it was part of a stipulation in my relationship with my G/F. People smoke for many different reasons. Firstly, smoking is very addictive. Secondly, smokers have been influenced by the clever marketing tactics of tobacco companies for many years. There are also many other personal reasons why people smoke. Half of smokers die from smoking related diseases. The tobacco industry needs new customers to replace the 114,000 people who are killed by smoking in the UK each year. Cigarette manufacturers make sure that:  ·	they know exactly why people smoke  ·	they cleverly market products to attract new customers.  In the past cigarette manufacturers have deliberately targeted children and young people. The industry spends a great deal of money on making cigarettes seem glamorous, appealing, fashionable and attractive. Most smokers started when they were young and image conscious. Young smokers often find it difficult to give up in later life. Cigarette advertising is now banned in the UK. So the industry is developing new and subtle tactics to avoid prosecution. And a very good evening   to you Elizabeth hope your feeling much better now my love xoxo May you always have enough happiness to keep you sweet enough trials to keep you strong; enough success to keep you eager; enough faith to give you courage; enough determination to make each day a good day. xxx", 9787, "None", 2],
