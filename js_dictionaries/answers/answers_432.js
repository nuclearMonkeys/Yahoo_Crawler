What's the big hurry?!\" 2) hey, I'm kinda slow, so I need more than a nanosecond to process what you are saying!\"  Do not be rushed into anything! If they don't take a good natured hint, then just say you will have to think about it, and leave - don't listen any further as they try to keep you on the hook..  One other thing I have learned is this - I make a DEAL with myself.. that no matter how great something sounds, I walk away, even if it is just for a few minutes.. because trying to decide on something with them badgering and making you feel pressured, is only going to make you go along with them - they are professionals, and this is what they do.. so, no matter how you feel, make a deal with yourself to walk away.. just say something like \"hey, this all sounds great, but before I sign my name to anything, I am just stepping outside for some fresh air, (or going for a coffee)\".  Do NOT care if they make you feel silly about doing that.. better to look silly, feel embarrassed in front of a stranger, than be pushed into something and regret it forever. ", 3805, "b8wQws7naa", 0],
