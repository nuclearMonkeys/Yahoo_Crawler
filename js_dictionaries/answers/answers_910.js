As someone who has been a \"freelancer\" (I hate that term, personally) contractor and am now employed full time, I will always suggest that if you have to ask that question, then you should either further educate yourself, or get a job doing what you want to \"freelance\" in. Freelancers are, historically, people who have had a successful career, partially or fully retired, and then chose to offer their services on a case-by-case basis. In this weird modern era of know-it-alls who are fresh out of (or just dropped out of) college, or never even went, the path is much less clear. I'm of the latter group.  It took me a lot of time, money, self-educating, hard-learned lessons and more than a decade as an employee in my craft to get to a place where I would now feel comfortable freelancing again after having done so without that employed experience for 7 years in my 20s without great success. Short answer: learn, do, and listen to those who have done what you want to do. Then just do whatever you need to, even if it means ignoring everything and everyone, including me. ;)", 7127, "JBf83nJ7aa", 0],
