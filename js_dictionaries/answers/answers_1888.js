	100176 : ["\"Ok, I heard somewhere that a GeForce 9400 GT (1GB) will steal 1GB of memory from my system's RAM. Is this true\" It's semi-true, the card uses it's own ram BUT it uses a load of address space (all cards use some but these new 1GB cards are particullally bad. That means (assuming you have 3GB or more of ram) that more of your memory will end with at addresses over 4GB. Unfortunately current 32-bit desktop editions of windows only support 4GB of address space so that ram with addresses over 4GB won't be usable. MS claims this was because of driver issues. \"are there ways to make it use its own RAM?\" as I said it will be using it's own ram, what you need to do is to make the memory above 4GB usable somehow. Essentially you have the following options. 1: run a 64-bit edition of windows (probably the best option if your drivers support it). 2: run a 32-bit server edition of windows 3: run an os other than windows 4: in the case of vista and 7 there is a third party hack to remove the limitation but I'm not sure i'd reccomend it see   for details 5: run windows XP with SP1 or lower (no security updates and may have some compatibility issues) 6: run windows 2000", 9728, "3TWjbVq6aa", 3],

Although the card won't directly steal your system RAM for use as video memory like lower-end Turbocache models from Nvidia (or Hypermemory models from ATI) you still lose a big chunk of address space when running a 32-bit operating system.   On PCs, hardware devices like drive controllers, network cards, video cards etc all get mapped into address space in the last megabyte of memory, which does reduce the amount of RAM available to Windows.
