He looked kinda bummed after the race, but he has no easy task taking on HMS and JGR Kyle looked like he was having fun, and he looked cool in his post race interview Aric Almirola did a good job in the 43 car for Richard Petty Motorsports, with a solid 12th place finish I would rather see Junior retire than to suffer another concussion. He may be the kind of guy who meets this critera, just as former driver Ray Evernham was when he quit driving It was fun watching Regan Smith being able to run what should be one of NASCAR's better race cars. Apparently Regan said he may have over-revved the engine. That could be his fault or the technicians fault for not having a properly adjusted rev-limiter, although a rev-limiter is most accurate when the tires are hooked up to the pavement, he could have spun the tires leaving pit road, or on a re-start. I bet he's anxious to give it another try.", 8473, "None", 1],

My Nationwide driver (who runs in some Cup races, like Charlotte) had good lap times after the first bit but could gain track position and my Cup driver was 9th at the end, but a lap down. The small number of cars on the lead lap stood out to me. Regan Smith may have over-revved it, but to make the top-10, even though I'm no fan of his, was pretty good. He did good, then goofed up his engine.", 8473, "pXbphG8Raa", 1],

Today, Senator Barack Obama, with the most liberal voting record in the US Senate, is delivering his political acceptance speech, in an apparent attempt to assume for himself the mantle of Dr. Martin Luther King.  Dr. King did not embrace the type of secularist agenda promoted by Obama and the Democratic Party of today, which includes fostering dependency on welfare that breaks up families, supporting same-sex marriage and partial-birth abortion, and banning God from the public square.  Obama is no MLK! ", 8470, "BpP7JjNFaa", 3],

None of these made a difference. In fact 2 of them were pilloried for it and called uncle Toms.  It is the system of a welfare state, an Indian reservation life style, that keeps the black community enslaved to the Democrat party. The hand out, great society, virtually killed the black family in America.  Obama`s Church teaches avoidance of the middle class and pride in poverty in its black liberation theology. Remain poor because to seek a middle class life is only a trap of the white man. Let select leaders lead and protect you. Rev. Wright and the Obamas would be those leaders. Based on his ability to aid and abet slum lords in his district, I would say nothing will change and the rest of us better watch out.", 8470, "cd4facfabbe9f3181d3eb2aba5693595aa", 0],

Laying back is not racing! Gas is on the right people, use it. Slowing down for laps just to finish is not racing. Mash the Gas!!! JJ laying back is reason enough for me to dislike him and this method of racing. Dale SR and guys like the Silver Fox  never thought to race like this sh*t. True racers wouldn't get caught dead driving like that!  I thought it was a great race with some shortfalls of drivers efforts. Kyle Busch was awesome and closing at the end, he's not a fuel mileage racer. Went all out and had to pit for fuel to finish 5th, a racer that stands not for finishes, but racing til the end!

And I've been behind the scenes at a greyhound track.  The reasons greyhounds have such bad teeth isn't only genetics, it's the garbage they're fed.  And no, they don't look after these \"athletes\" because they're highly expendable.  They breed them in huge numbers. You can look up any racing greyhounds stats and I did when my oldest started having serious problems walking he was in such pain.  I found that he was in 6 collisions during his racing career, 1 of which they termed \"serious\".  Yet each time, he was raced again the following week.  Does that sound like an athlete who was looked after?  I don't think so. Yes, greyhounds love to run and my retired racers love to race for fun or even go lure coursing but whenever money is involved, the animal's welfare is not given any consideration.

And the greyhounds don't have to be healthy or meet breed standards, they just have to run fast. If the dog shows no racing potential, the dog is destroyed or thrown aside. Most are fed a mushy food which destroys their teeth and they're just not treated like family members, they're treated like money-making machines. I bet there are some greyhound racers out there that aren't all that bad. But I think it's safe to say that most don't. Thousands of greyhounds are in need of homes.
