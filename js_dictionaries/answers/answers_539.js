Most of the couples had some prior conversation about the rings before being engaged.  My daughter and her husband looked at rings together online. Discussed prices/budgets . She ended up picking four rings and he picked one ring from those four. I would have chosen a very different ring from the one my husband bought me. ", 4624, "0WASp0bHaa", 2],
	29970 : ["She's the one that's going to wear it, so she should be some what included. You should at least ask her, if she has any idea if she knows what she wants in a ring. If she wants a certain type of setting, or type of stone other then a diamond and you don't get it, she may not like the ring that you picked out. ", 4624, "I1x1vy2laa", 0],
	29971 : ["Everyone is different so it should be a conversation she's part of.  She may want to pick it out with you or she may want to be surprised. I didn't shop with my husband for my ring but the style of ring didn't matter to me (I'm honest that I wanted one though) and he has good taste and he's not cheap so I trusted his judgment.  He did well. A lot of my friends picked out the ring with their fiance/husband but not all of them.", 4624, "5YfuWhLBaa", 0],
	29978 : ["You can obtain a free initial consultation with a divorce attorney, who might be able to advise you on alimony, child support, division of assets, protecting yourself and your child. Do so. I have no basis for comparison as to how you might otherwise be treated in a different country or culture. But I do know that women can be terribly mistreated in some Moslem countries, abused, not permitted to go out unescorted by men, not allowed to take their children  if they are divorced, or leave the country, can have acid thrown in their faces , or be killed if they fall in love with someone the family disapproves of, and more. There are indeed laws , here, designed to protect you. You also need to get a job and to keep a separate bank account. Good luck, good wishes,", 4638, "l3rcYSasaa", 2],

	29980 : ["What peace of mind would you like? Do you expect someone to believe your story and offer you money? I am sure you have been advised to seek a womens shelter for help, which is what many abused women with no assets of their own do. But it appears you haven't done that. If you won't help yourself, how could anyone here help you?  Incidentally, your understanding of divorce laws in MS is not 100% correct. If you want to divorce your husband, you should at least see about getting a free consultation with a lawyer who can advise you in the steps to take. All that said, since you hate Americans so much, why bother with a divorce at all? Just go back to your home country and live your life. The lack of a divorce in the U.S. shouldn't impact you there. And while your family may not be close by, surely they would send you the money you need to get a plane ticket back home and get out of your horrible situation.", 4638, "KESlvKqQaa", 0],

	29983 : ["It should be mandatory. Sex is a big part of marriage for the first few years and practicing beforehand is a good idea. It's not wrong in my book, even if you are a Christian.

It was canceled due to covid19 and rescheduled.

You want those witnessing the ceremony to be focused on the commitment aspects of marriage, not the physical love aspects.  Is the big skirt removable?

If you get married, there's no more “your money” and “his money.” It's “our money.” Who the hell waits till the day before the wedding to buy rings? You really didn't think this through too well did you? I suggest you grow up and  don't marry a guy if you're willing to walk away over a ring. You're BOTH irresponsible.

	30014 : ["My suggestion would be to organize an intervention. Gather friends, family members, anyone willing to support you in this. Sit your husband down and let him know how his excessive pot use is adversely affecting you, his children, as well as other loved ones. Ask that he please give up pot smoking altogether just as he did alcohol; like some addicts, he has simply traded in the abuse of one substance (alcohol) for another (pot). I also suggest that you offer to send him to a rehab facility to aid him in his recovery from addiction. The facility will not only be beneficial as far as ending the use of pot, it will also target the addictive behavior so that your husband does not fall into the abuse of alternative substances (i.e. painkillers, prescribed medication, opioids, etc.)  If the intervention fails to work and if your husband refuses to go to rehab or receive any other sort of help for his addictive behavior, then my last and final suggestion is separation. He needs a wake-up call and this may be the only way he finally sees the light: if he does not do anything to address his addiction issues, he WILL lose his family. Take the kids and go stay with a family member, a friend, a hotel room, or a women's shelter if there are no other options.", 4637, "FJEKaTeDaa", 1],

Bisexual men (if that is what he is) are just as capable of choosing to be faithful as are heterosexual guys.
