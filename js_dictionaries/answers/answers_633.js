	35469 : ["Teo, Shakur, Devin and Ryan are all young fighters I believe can take over from the likes of Loma, Crawford, Charlo in time, I admire their talent and spirit, I know they're hungry. But for Teofimo this is a step too far too soon in my opinion.Â  It's not too soon in the sense that he is a world champion and so should be fighting the best but we know that there's levels in boxing and so we look at what Lopez did before he captured the title and for me his resume just isn't deep enough. I'm looking to see where before he's had to deal with adversity in the ring, when has he had to change tactics/style because plan A wasn't working, when has he had to climb off the canvas and come from behind to take it.Â  When you win the title at that age with so few fights under your belt you still need more time as champion to get these questions answered so to make your first defence against a three-weight world champion with 400 amateur fights and back to back Olympic Golds is something that shows great spirit and self-belief but it's over the top, it's misplaced at this point.Â  Great for us to watch but I got Loma by wide UD or late stoppage but I prefer Loma UD I think.Â  Calzaghe vs Lacy all over again, timing, footwork and the ability to control the action is gonna be too much for the youngster but he will certainly come again. How about you who you got? @RAY - For Loma I wouldn't expect him to ever be ready because as you suggested, Loma at 34 probably doesn't have too long left.Â  He doesn't have to ever be ready for Loma but in time he will be ready for that level of opposition.Â  Loma's gonna show him the difference between very good and elite.", 5346, "psOmJErtaa", 1],

	35471 : ["I think the fight will play a lot like De La Hoya vs Vargas. Teofimo will come out strong in the early rounds and will really possibly even floor Loma during the first 4 rounds.

Killed a man once with his jab.Â  Â  But all of these big guys are not very fast.Â  Wladamir had power and was fast he would probably beat them all.Â  Â  Joe Louis, who was about 200lbs, beat the living shit out of Primo Carnera in a masterclassÂ ", 5347, "xHsQFPsBaa", 0],

His sparring partners have spoken to say that he is training hard etc. so he is definitely still around and apparently working his *** off.

Tyson's character was evil, and he displayed that in his fight with Holyfield.Â  Personally, I never thought Tyson to be such a great boxer, and better boxers lost to him because they did not fight him smartly.", 5340, "391fb23dafd355005ac7c816295c4b03aa", 0],
	35503 : ["Tough question. By the time they fought in 96 Tyson was definitely past his prime, even so he was comprehensively beaten by Holyfield. The thing was, in his prime so many fighters were intimidated by the aura of Tyson but Holyfield absolutely was not. At that level it's about how styles clash and Holyfield knew how to fight Tyson, he counter-punched beautifully in that fight. Having said that, we'll never know what would have happened if they'd met when Tyson was in his prime, say about 88 or 89. And they were due to meet in November 91 but Tyson had to pull out injured. So in answer to your question, I think Tyson was probably more powerful and devastating in his prime but Holyfield was a great fighter himself and knew how to beat him. So ultimately, I would say in the history of heavyweight boxing in the late 80s and 90s they were about even.Â  Antonius; Tyson never had a rematch with Douglas. Also, Holyfield is 4 years older than Tyson.Â ", 5340, "l3Jay0Mbaa", 1],
