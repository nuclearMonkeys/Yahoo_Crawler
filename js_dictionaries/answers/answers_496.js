If your grandparents and parents don't have any issue, you probably won't either.Â  Other things come into play like injuries, diet, over all health and such.Â  Injuries that you have when young, come back and haunt one when old.Â  Especially minor fractures that one may not even have known they had. They suck to be honest.Â  How active has you mom been during her life. On her feet moving most of the day or sitting around eating bon bons?Â  Makes a difference. Can't go by weight though, too many judge on that. If one has been active, then has health issues, it is very very difficult to adjust to a less active life style. Everything has to change from how much and what one eats, to mental health becouse suddenly being limited takes a toll.", 4300, "SnQvsOPwaa", 3],

It's also very cheap for kids--you don't need any special equipment, just a ball and you can improvise a couple goals.  It emphasizes speed and dexterity and brainpower over brawn and muscle and brute force. It's not popular as a professional sport in the US because it doesn't stop dead every couple of minutes to allow for a commercial break.  Hockey has the same problem.", 4293, "55XWsWHsaa", 0],
