I'm trying to admire the positive qualities in them/him, but it's not what I am used to. I guess men who are driven to success are a good thing and with me getting older (I'm 24) that should be my goal, BUT I'd be lying if I said that physically I'm not still into the guy with the tan skin, white teeth, muscles and dresses well. It's funny though, because I used to date those kinds of guys and they were usually bad in relationships. Earlier this year after the guy I dated until January turned out to have a fiancee, I decided to date nerdy men, and since then, every guy I've dated so far has bored me in a way, but then maybe I'm just being rude.

This whole \"all girls shave\" thing is a product of the porn industry, because it makes for more revealing close-ups, and those close-ups sell more magazines and videos. It's all about money - for \"women's beauty\" manufacturers and their advertizers now, just as much as for porn profiteers. People have been watching those, and they're coming to believe that a bald vulva is \"normal\". It isn't... except on a little girl.  Do you really wanna hang with a guy who wants to do little girls?   OK, I've had my little rant, but you may want to shave anyhow for whatever personal reasons you have - and those are none of my business - so I don't think it's fair for me to tell you \"Just Say No\" and expect you to go against your own wishes: it doesn't work with drugs and it can't work any better for anything else people want to do. If you're going to shave, you should do it properly so you'll get the best possible look and feel out of it and minimize the razor, skin and hair problems that can happen.  is a really good and very thorough how-to guide to shaving any and all body hair, and I highly recommend it.

God says: \"So is my word that goes out from my mouth, it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.\" God's words are living and active, sharper than any double edged sword, penetrating even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is the lifeblood of the Christian faith as is the cross of Jesus. When you use your words, they have little credibility, but God's words never die in the heart of anyone that hears them. I hang out here and quote scripture a lot because God uses it to change hearts, even if the reader does not know at the time it is influencing them.

Us men have put women on a pedestal esp in media telling them how beautiful they are all day long and yet we are SHOCKED when they say they rather look at each other than us men.

To illustrate, if I say: \"2 Timothy 3:16 informs us that \"all scripture is inspired of God\", and so God is the Bible's author, even though he had men write his thoughts\" then people on R & S can verify that scripture for themselves from their own Bible.
