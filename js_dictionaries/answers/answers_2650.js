	138333 : ["Frankly, I don't believe that there are serious substantive differences between the two.  I'm not going to vote for either, because they are both too liberal, let me get that out there.  Both want a form of universal healthcare, but Hillary's would likely be more expansive and expensive (and to some, socialist).  I don't care if universal healthcare is socialist, I DO care about the tax burden of it.   Both would likely raise taxes to pay for social programs.  Both are strongly pro-choice.  Both would make efforts to remove troops from Iraq, one assumes.  The differences between the two on issues is not nearly as contrasting as between, say, John McCain and the now-removed Mitt Romney. At the end of the day, I think it's fair to say that the difference between the two, and the factions of the Democratic party fighting for each, are more about character and personality than about substantive differences.  It's quite different than on the Republican side (though McCain is all but nominated now).  Barack's problem is a perceived lack of experience (which I think is silly).  Hillary's problem is she has all the superficial advantages, but much of the country has a built-in bias against her, and she never comes across as genuine.  When she talks compassionately, she sounds disingenuous.  Her past is littered with the half-truths and nuances of her, and her husband's, careers.   One last thing, as someone who is going to vote for McCain, I can't decide who I want to win the Democratic nomination.  I think Hillary is more beatable, but Barack is a good man whom I simply think has political positions which are wasteful ($120 billion healthcare plan) or wrong (pro-choice).  So should I root for Hillary so she can be beat?  Or Barack so that my worst-case scenario for the country isn't so terrifying?", 11387, "snquBUQXaa", 0],

She really has not detailed how she can force citizens in a democracy to do what she wants. She has mentioned garnishing wages, but there is not one Republican in Congress that would allow that.  Obama's policy calls for individual choice, or the citizens could sign up for the government program.  Itis a tiered plan.He is all for mandated health care for all children.   Both of these candidates will have a difficult time pushing their plans through legislative roadblocks and reforms.  I don't expect there will be a health care package in place for two or more years.    Another big difference... he is very likeable;  she is not.

These delegates will be attending their County Conventions on March 15th.  At that time, they are free to support any candidate that they wish, including Senator Edwards.  (The same applies to all other delegates whether pledged to Senator Edwards or Governor Richardson or even Senator Obama or Senator Clinton.  If he wins delegates at the County Convention (which requires that he retain the support of at least 15% of the delegates to the County Convention), those delegates will attend their Congressional District Convention and the State Convention.  Assuming that Edwards gets support from 15% of the delegates in a Congressional District or at the State Convention, he will win delegates to the national convention.  However, at this point, he has not won any national convention delegates in Iowa (neither have Clinton or Obama) just projected delegates based on the results from the precinct caucuses.   Second, there are the delegates from New Hampshire (and from Florida if the current Florida delegation is seated).  Senator Edwards has actually won these delegates and people have been elected from New Hampshire (and Florida) who have promised to support Senator Edwards. Third, there are the delegates from Nevada.  At this point, the delegates won by all campaigns at the precinct level have attended their County Conventions (except for in Clark County -- Las Vegas -- where the convention had to be recessed due to inadequate space for all attendees).  In the counties which have held their conventions, Edwards did not have enough support to get delegates to the State Convention and his delegates had to choose between Clinton and Obama.  Assuming that there is not a surge to Edwards in Clark County, his delegates at that County Convention will probably be in the same situation. Finally, there are the superdelegates.  These delegates are and always have been officially unpledged.  They have spots in the convention by virtue of their election prior to the start of the campaign.  Any endorsement that they give during the campaign is non-binding and they can change their mind at any time.  Some of these delegates have now pledged to support one of the other two candidates. At the present time, the Edwards delegates are no different than the Obama and Clinton delegates.  If they are \"regular\" delegates from a state in which the actual convention delegates have been chosen, they are pledged to vote for Edwards until he releases them from that pledge.  However. that pledge is non-binding (in other words they could switch to Obama or Clinton without waiting to be released, just as Clinton delegates could switch to Obama or Obama delegates could switch to Clinton).  Furthermore, Edwards does not have the authority to re-pledge them to a different candidate.  His only two options are to request that they stick to their pledge (unlikely as he will not have enough delegates to have his name placed in nomination at the convention) or to release them from their pledge.", 11386, "e6V3xf8zaa", 1],

My selection could be Mike Gravel VS Ron Paul. Gravel is the former Senator from Alaska who ended military slavery (called \"the draft\" or \"conscription\") and the Vietnam disaster. he's quite the main fiscally conservative Democrat, as he intends to get rid of the IRS and replace it with the Fairtax. He additionally needs to introduce Direct Democracy so as that the human beings can bypass rules. Paul is a ten-term Congressman from Texas (initially born in Pittsburgh) who has under no circumstances voted for a tax improve, under no circumstances voted against a tax cut back, under no circumstances voted for a pay improve, under no circumstances taken a junket, under no circumstances voted for an unbalanced funds, voted against the Iraq war consistently from day a million, and something of his vote casting checklist is in a matching way sturdy. Dr. Paul (he was once an ob/gyn earlier going to DC) votes consistently for the unique reason of the form (which could be a extensive progression over what we now have) and he needs to get rid of the IRS and the Federal Reserve at present and plans to realize this by potential of reducing government waste and removing unneeded departments.

The real parts, they work and deal with the locals, learn their culture and values, live with them, even inter-marry  (ever notice how many Army Wives are German, Navy and Air Force Wives are Filipino?).   Many liberal elites think that by spending a summer trekking around they get to know an area.  Truth is what they see is tourists traps or spend time with a few \"select\" locals who in no way reflect the typical day to day lives of the rest of the citizens of that country, who usually dubb these \"tourists\" as the true ugly Americans.   Those training tactics that you have put down have also given many teenagers, who could NEVER have afforded schooling to get training that they used to be successful in the civilian world.    I am soo sick of people like you who stereotype veterans as burnt out mental disasters.  Most of us are out in the real world doing very well for ourselves.  For example, ever hear of FEDEX?  Yep, it was started by and continues to be run by a Veteran.  Many of our greatest Presidents, starting with Washington himself, were vets.  A huge majority of police officers, firefighters and other people who make our lives better each day in the public sector are vets.
