The vaccines are normal for when they are done as part of an office visit but my vet does a discounted shot clinic every other Saturday and the shots are cheaper.  So we do our vaccines on that day and save a few bucks.  See if your vet does the same. The biohazard fee is for disposal of needles and should be incorporated into the vaccine or blood test cost. Rabies tag is whatever your jurisdiction charges and will be the same everywhere. The senior blood panel seems a bit high to me.

The cheapest vet around might not always be the best one. If you would like to save some money, most shelters and humane societies have clinics that are open to the public and charge somewhat less.

My oldest has been healthier and my youngest has had tubes.  There is a special bond during breast feeding that I never got even when I used a bottle (breast milk or formula).  I also liked breastfeeding at night, because I didn't have a bottle to hold so I could doze off.  I believe that breast feeding has its benefits, but again that is my belief.  As a teacher, I  honestly cannot tell you who was breast fed or had formula, who wore Pampers or had clothe diapers.  What I can tell is if a child is loved and cherished at home or if the parent has his/her priorities mixed up.  And you are right, you shouldn't have to make up excuses.  As parents we will always face the dilema of are we doing the right thing for our children.  No matter what you do, someone will disagree and you will feel the need to justify.

There's no one particular issue that will make you a 'perfect mother', and breastfeeding is one that applies. My own mother breastfed - but she smoked and drank all through pregnancy, breastfeeding, co-sleeping, etc etc, and now me and my siblings have several health issues including IBS, asthma, chronic depression and more. Was she a perfect mother? Hell no! There really isn't any such thing as the perfect mother, it's a myth. If they (or we, whatever way you look at it) were that perfect, we'd be too busy hand knitting all our baby's clothes with organic cotton, or growing our own fruit and veg to home make all baby's food, to come on here and preach to other people how to be a perfect mother.
