When I met my honey a few years ago I was surprised that she had 2 tattoos.  She is the most classy refined woman I have ever met.  So I guess many judge a book by it's cover and not the content.   A few months ago she said she wanted to get another tattoo and I payed for it.  Now I am in love with her tats and love to see her in clothes that show them off.  However she has them in places that can be covered by clothes because she's had episodes at work where comments were made like are a biker chick, or nice tramp stamp.

	98037 : ["Tattoos, technically are just pretty, colorful, scars...   Seriously, think about it... when you get tattooed, ink is being pushed into a wound, wounds leave scars, tattoos of course are a highly visible scar. I see tattoos as art, as self-expression, as a way of keeping a photo diary of things that have happened throughout your life...things like that. You can get a job with tattoos, some places just prefer them not to be visible.  So, for your first one, the best thing to do is put it somewhere that only you and special people will see it.... job problem solved. I get lectured by my mother weekly about my choice to have tattoos and piercings, and about the fact that I am a piercer and am apprenticing to tattoo... she sees me as being an outcast and even though I have tried for 4 years to change her opionion on that and open her eyes up to the meanings behind a lot of modification, she still doesnt get it.

	98048 : ["Ethanol can not travel via underground pipelines from the refineries solely because it would absorb water and be water contaminated and phase-separated upon arrival. Because it is blended at varied sites (depending on destination location) it can be blended in at the terminal by gas company or professional blending company, or later by a fuel distributor or even a truck driver! This in part explains why the percent of alcohol in each delivery varies widely and rarely is at exactly 10%- Over-blending is common (above 10% legal limit) due to federal ethanol blending tax credits earned (increases profits for blender)- ... More info: Recently we have seen a huge increase of \"double-blending\": The gas company blends in the intial 10% at the terminal/arrival port (ethanol transported mostly by barge and rail) - And then the local distributor or gas station blends in ANOTHER 10% so he too can gain this tax credit!   E10 10% is the legal limit for all conventional engines for many reasons - Ethanol has lower BTU energy and drops mpg considerably + it rapidly attracts and absorbs water, is a very strong solvent that will wear-down (deteriorate, dry-out, crack, swelling, etc.) engine parts rapidly - High levels of ethanol alcohol will even disintegrate stainless steel and fiberglass over time.  (Stations have had to upgrade their equipment to tolerate the strong solvent effect of ethanol on pump equipment - many are now nickel=plated. My professional advice is to purchase non-ethanol gas if still available in your area - Plus, testing gas at the pump for percent alcohol present will help prevent many problems... Also check parts if your engine was manufactured prior to 2000 to make sure part is UL certified to withstand ethanol. Especially rubber hoses and seals will quickly disintegrate.  Numerous fuel pumps can not withstand E10 gas (esp. over-blended E10) and even in recent years (after 2000) many manufacturers have had to re-design parts to withstand E10 now widely sold.   If date past engine warranty period (usually 4 years for most auto parts and 1 yeat for gas-powered equipment such as lawnmowers) despite part being deemed defective (can not withstand current gas type being sold), the manufacturers do NOT issue a recall - Therefore if you've replaced fuel pumps, injectors, hoses, etc prematurely it's probably solely due to your use of E10 or contaminated E10 sold.   More information on ethanol E10 gasoline history, risks, types of damage, necessary precautiions, etc. can be found at fueltestkit dot com.   BTW, Never use new E15 gas type or E85 flex-fuel in a conventional vehicle without doing necessary conversions and parts replacement first.   Read information on E10 octane issues too -Very important - since the main cause of expensive engine damage is usually due to result of E10 octane dropping several points after water contamination...This does not occur with non-ethanol gas -  Among other precautions we recommend (EG. avoid most gas additives with E10 since they also contain strong solvents and alcohol), we also recommend choosing a higher octane gas than listed when your engine type is at high risk for water absorption - therefore if phase separation occurs, you'll still have a safe loctane number in tank - Especially important in marine engines, snowmobiles, and all recreational vehicles, generators, lawn equipment and any engine that will have gas stored for more than 1 month... This winter weather has been brutal this year and many consumers still do not realize that all gas antifreeze products are almost 100% alcohol and unnecessary (contraindicated) for use with E10 gas- 10% alcohol is far more than enough alcohol gas antifreeze to prevent freezing of gas in tank- Do not add more - And the same applies to using gas cleansers or water absorbing products - Almost all contain alcohol and should not be used when you're buying E10 gas (sold almost everywhere now).  - - (Quickly typed by Gail the owner of Fuel-Testers/MLR Solutions- please ignore typos, if any).", 9642, "K9FXa0p9aa", 0],

	98054 : ["Plenty of other people have answered your question directly but I'd like to add something else in defence of Mac prices. Macs are usually very closely matched in price for what you could build an EQUIVALENT PC for. The trouble is, Macs are over-specced.  The lowest price Mac you can buy is a much better computer than the lowest price Dell or similar brand name computer you can buy but it also costs more.  The Mac will have a better graphics card, a better hard drive, a better CD drive, it will probably have DVD burner and the opposition won't, etc.  Even so, you probably don't need the better graphics card or the DVD burner... and that makes the Mac over-specced and hence over-priced. It's really a question of semantics.  Macs are not over-priced for what they are but they are usually more than what the average user needs.", 9644, "HPnmh25Faa", 0],

Yes, it is a form of art, a art that will last. Even with laser remover there is still a scar, you will always have it on you. Like I said, tattoo have different meanings to different people.

He didn't mind sending many US soldiers into a war that should have never been fought. Obama is new, but at least he has the PEOPLE'S interest at heart.  He wants jobs, health care, and dignity for all Americans.  He wants these giant companies to stop running the US as they have in the past.  He wants to give the country back to it's people and not just the rich.  I don't care if he isn't \"experienced\" (whatever that means), he's for ME and that's enough.  I'm tired of this stupid \"global economy\" going unchecked.  It's not a bad thing, but it needs to be put in check.  The Republicans will not do that.

ADM still has some degree of dispersall of it's production facilities as well. If you mean in automobiles, it can, the problem is some of the sealing materials in use since the advent of fuel injection and many carburated engines are damaged or disolved by the presence of excess amounts of ethanol.   The problem GM had for example when the national push for oxygenated fuels initially began was it had no way of knowing which of their vehicles had vulnerable seals.  There are synthetics that are very good in those applications, but were not rleiably used depending on the supplies they had.   Most people will not know what is vulnerable until they start using the ethanol containing fuels.  I know the Carter BBD carburators used by Chrysler in the 70s were prone to tearing accelerator cups when people ran with \"gasahol,\" which was remedied by using a GM pump cup of similar size, but different composition. Bottom line is you do not know if you are going to have a problem or not until you have a problem, unless you purposefuly went through and replaced all seals and hoses over to an ethanol resistant synthetic as needed in advance.
