	82707 : ["Because denying reality is not a sound political strategy.   It's about time.  Giving liberals 100% control over the solution (if conservatives stayed out of the discussion) would probably be more damaging than doing nothing whatsoever. Just look at the Los Angeles plan to fund mass transit as if that effectively wiped out global warming, at a cost that would otherwise be high enough to completely offset everyone's total carbon impact for a year (including their coal-fired electricity).  Yet no measurable net reduction or offset would be achieved from that plan (people aren't going to suddenly hop on buses en masse simply because more buses are operating). There will be dozens upon dozens of pointless \"solutions\" proposed that will only drain our resources, right when we can least afford to waste them.  Traditional conservatives should be there to kill those proposals. Of course the Bush strategies of \"kill and spend\" and completely selling out to corporate interests have proven to be far worse (just look at our the U.S. dollar's dive in value and the resulting increase in gas prices), so hopefully the Republican Party will learn from that failure and get back to basics. Global warming, \"eco\", \"bio\" and \"green\" initiatives are simply politicians' latest marketing tools for pork-barrel spending (ethanol and biodiesel being promoted as ecologically beneficial by the Bush administration are prime examples of this sort of blatant dishonesty).  We need both parties involved to minimize each others' excesses.

Hopefully in the future I will be able to invest into solar power and get off the grid not because of global warming I believe it is the right thing to do.   The problem I have with AGW believers is the idealism.  If a group can scare society enough we can force our social ideals upon them.  I disagree with that, and that does not make me a greedy SOB as  stated by one of your responders.   I am tired of liberal verses conservative and one accusing the other of being evil.

While it's...well pretty damn stupid to see all the emissions from cars, factories and, yes, Hindu cows and think \"gee, global warming is a liberal conspircay\", it's also a less clear cut problem than Dateline NBC would have you believe. Yes, there are areas where glaciers are melting rapidly, but the ice sheets in the center of Antarctica are getting thicker, even while the edges are falling into the ocean. Well, how can we explain this? Basically, as anyone with a meteorology class or two under the belt would tell you, weather is tricky. It's very hard to tease apart which weather phenomena are caused by greenhouse gasses and which are caused by the natural warming and cooling cycles the earth goes through. Any good book on the Black Plague in Europe in 1348 will tell you that the weather leading up to this had been very warm; warmer, in fact, than it even is today. There was more arable land and this caused a boom of human and, you guessed it, rat populations (along with all other varieties of fauna). But before those damnable fleas got to Europe via Mongolian rats, the people living then had it pretty good. So should we take care to rely less on fossil fuels? Of course. Common sense says making noxious fumes just isn't going to be good. Will all the glaciers melt in 50 years? Maybe not. Will glaciers melting be the bane of our existence? I think likely not. Mother Earth has a way of turning lemons into lemonade. Let's go back to Antarctica. The Emperor penguins have had to travel farther inland to raise their young, a part of Antarctica which is much, much colder and this is making it more difficult for their winter-born chicks to survive.
