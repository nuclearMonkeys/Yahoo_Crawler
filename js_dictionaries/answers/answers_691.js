If you are hungry, for example, you need to eat, and knowing that hunger is just a signal the stomach sends to the brain makes no difference. Love makes a person feel good, and scientists like to feel good, just like anybody else. In fact, the reason they became scientists is because they like doing science. It makes them feel good when they can make a living as a scientist.", 5669, "None", 0],

Both are sciences that can and have addressed the feelings we call love. But to a point, even if we didn't study love, that doesn't preclude us from feeling it.  We don't need objective studies of love to feel it.  So yes, scientists can still feel love.", 5669, "74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa", 0],

	38399 : ["CATHOLICISM IS NOT CHRISTIAN, and never was. It never existed until several hundred years after Jesus. . Catholicism and orthodox lead to eternal torment in the lake of fire, since they both teach works for salvation, which leads to hell (Acts 15:1, Galatians 1:6-9). ................................ You need to believe in JESUS without works, to get into heaven (Romans 4:5). . Catholicism and orthodox are deceptions from satan to get you into hell. Catholicism and orthodox are not Christian. Jesus is not in catholicism or orthodox. Reading the Bible proves to us that catholicism and orthodox are full of lies.. Catholicism and orthodox teach works for salvation, which leads to eternal torment in the lake of fire (Galatians 1:6-9). And \"purgatory\" doesn't exist. Every \"pope\" is a false prophet of satan. Catholicism and orthodox didn't even exist for over 300 years after the Bible was complete and compiled. So avoid catholicism and orthodox, get away from them both  Nobody can be good enough to avoid hell.  The truth is that death leads to immediate heaven or hell, depending only on whether the person believed in Jesus for eternal life, or not. The truth is that Jesus loves you and wants to bless your life freely :) Most of all, Jesus wants you with Him forever, and not in hell. The truth is that every belief except one will lead to eternal torment in the lake of fire for every person. Because nothing pays for our sins except the death and blood of Jesus, the sacrifice of Jesus that is already accomplished by Him . Jesus loves you! The truth is that Jesus is God, and Jesus died on the cross to pay for all of our sins in full, and then Jesus resurrected from the dead. Nothing else pays for our sins, not works, not deeds, not religions. So the only way to heaven and to avoid hell, is by believing in Jesus for eternal life (John 6:47), without adding any of your own works (Romans 4:5). Believe in Jesus to take you to heaven, and you will be in heaven, no matter what, guaranteed. That easy, thanks to Jesus! Tell Jesus that you thank Him that you will be with Him in heaven when you die, because you believe in Jesus! It is too late to be saved, after death", 5668, "None", 0],

Logically, marriage is better for tax purposes, relieving stress, satisfying sexual needs, sharing work loads and home/family responsibilities. It also reduces  the time spent looking for a mate or sexually partner, which would certainly take away from time in the lab. There are social, psychological, and longevity benefits as well. With all these benefits it seems unreasonable to think their work or scientific contributions wouldn't improve or increase in some ways ...and for the married scientists, I'm sure the positives outweigh the negatives.", 5682, "JDjoZ9tzaa", 0],
