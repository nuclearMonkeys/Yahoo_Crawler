As long as you're acheiving your artistic vision than the software is good enough for you. Professionals on the PC will use Avid Media Composer.  That is the big boy on the block in Hollywood and in NY film scene.  It was there long before FCP even existed.  The learning curve for it is hard though.  And it is not perfect, its just been around a long time and lots of facilities and editors are familiar with it.  Until recently it was quite costly. Commercials, Wedding Videos, Corporate Videos, and similar level sized projects might use Adobe Premiere Pro.  Not many professional houses use it, but there are some.  But that is because of some bad business decisions by Adobe, not because the software is lacking.  The current version is fully capable.  With a professional video card you can even output to professional broadcast decks.  Also, with the Adobe Production bundles, you could get it bundled with the motion graphics/compositing tool After Effects.  Those two programs a lone would make the Adobe line a strong choice on the PC Prosumer/Consumer level option would be Sony Vegas.  I hear its quite easy to pickup and use.  It is also apparently okay in terms of the feature set.  I don't think its quite as robust as Adobe, Avid, or FCP, but none-the-less a capable option. After that there are the cheap/free options like Windows Movie Maker and AVS.  But I wouldn't expect a lot of robust features with these.  They are quite limited, but I guess good for the budget conscious/home movie crowd.", 8546, "RyvKws7Laa", -1],

Bc one can never tell if that woman is only after that status. However, this rule may be reversed if the woman is above the man in such status unless that woman is of above average beauty as man by nature are attracted to the beauties, whether she is wealthy or not. For a woman proposing for a marriage, i may not be shocked culturally as this is what occurred in the life of our beloved prophet (saw). Khadijah being financially above, she had an in-between for this proposal. But if that proposal is for a one night stand, i really feel uncomfortable even when i had encountered this situation  several times. Maybe bc I am a devout muslim (i hope).Had to make up stories or diplomatic reasons just to deny a woman's initiative esp if she got the looks. I don't know what other guys or girls think about me, as most non muslim guys i met would be happy to jump in.

Artemis comes after that, then there are a bunch that are around the same level of importance: Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Demeter, Dionysus, Hephaestus, and Hermes.
