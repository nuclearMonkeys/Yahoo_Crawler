First, you must supplement all of those vitamins and minerals you are not getting from that meat. Try to get around 4 meals with good fats. All meals should have around 30-50 grams protein. All meals should have around 40-70 grams carbs. Except the one before bed. This increases the chance of some of it turning into fat. Something to this extent: 7:00-Meal-100-200 Calories of Egg Whites/1 Whole Egg, 1 cup Oatmeal, Fruit, Multivitamin, Omega-3 10:00-Meal- 12:00-Meal-Cottage Cheese/Yogurt, Almonds/Pecans/Walnuts, 1 cup veggies 3:00-Meal 6:00-Meal-Almonds/Pecans/Walnuts, 1 cup veggies 8:00-Meal Postworkout-If you want to gain muscle than you have to have around 40 grams of protein directly after your workout with a 50/50 mix of Maltodextin and Dextrose sugars (around 20 grams of each). O, and drink around a gallon of water a day to cleanse and purify the acids in the body. It also clears up you're skin and makes you feel better. You NEED! Fats (Good Ones)-Around 60-80 grams daily Peanut Butter Almonds, Walnuts, and Pecans Olive Oil Carbs-Based on a 150lb person-Around 250+ grams daily Oatmeal/Good Cereals/Whole Grain Breads (not that much though if you want a 6-pack) Fruit (apples and bananas are the best for lean muscle) Veggies(California Mix works great) Protein-Based on a 150lb person-Around 150-200 grams daily Egg Whites/Eggs Skim Milk (Not more than 1-2 cups daily)/Cottage Cheese/Yogurt Kidney Beans Salmon/Tuna (If you can, please atleast try them. Meats and Fish are the basis for a healthy and muscular body. If Lean Red Meats scare you, fish shouldn't.) Supplements to consider: Creatine NO-Xplode or Nothing at all(People are always looking for a special mixing ingredient. Honestly, the missing ingredient is usually will power and the correct workout/meal plan. TRUTH)", 9817, "None", 0],

	102699 : ["Mutual funds are an affordable way for an uninformed investor to diversify their investments to minimize risk.  They are good in the respect that it allows you to probably not lose all your money if one or two companies go bad. On the other hand, they often have many charges incurred along with them for upkeep or maintenance and things like that.  And often, the funds that have the highest amount of charges because they have the most active management often don't show any better performance than a fund with little charges/activity. In the end though, mutual funds often don't even beat the market performance, and returns can be harder to figure out on a daily basis.  If you want to be able to see how you're doing easily and up to the minute, consider an index fund which contains weighted pieces of a number of large stocks (like a NASDAQ or DOW index fund). On the plus side though, you can get money mutual funds from which you can write checks or even make interact payments, so basically operate like a bank account with higher interest.", 9820, "54173120c3bf72dfec623555fc6ab2acaa", 2],

A good teacher/sensei can teach anyone thats willing to learn. There are a couple of people in my dojo who don't want to sit gradings at all. They are just going for the fitness and don't want the tests and belts, and my sensei is fine with that - no pressure or anything.

	102711 : ["First off, you're killing yourself with the high protein diet bit. Studies have show that high protein diets for body builders do not build muscle. Your body can only absorb so much protein a day. The rest goes down the toilet. Second: YES! There are many vegetarian and vegan bodybuilders and athletes. VegNews just profiled a bunch of them. Check out Brendan Brazier.", 9817, "AA10920670", 1],
	102712 : ["Some of the best bodybuilding foods are vegetarian. Egg whites (about 4) - 100 calories, 25g protein, 4g carbs, 0g fat Whey protein powder (1 scoop) - 120 calories, 24g protein, 3g carbs, 1g fat Cottage Cheese (1 cup) - 180 calories, 28g protein, 8 carbs, 5g fat Make sure to get your healthy fats from nuts (almonds, peanuts), seeds (sunflower, pumpkin), and olive oil.  And try to eat at least one serving of veggies and one serving of fruit at each main meal. ::edit:: If you're going vegan (and not vegetarian), then the 3 foods I listed above are off limits.  In that case, you should eat plenty of legumes (especially lentils), nuts, nut butters (peanut butter or almond butter), and seeds for your protein. Max Marie: Not that it's the diet that I follow, but a high protein diet does build muscle.  What does every champion body builder eat (besides massive doses of 'roids)... it's pretty obvious... high protein diets.  Of course not all of the protein will be used for muscle.  Not all carbs will be used for energy.  The point of a high protein diet is not to be instantly turned into bulk (if only it were that easy), but to create a positive nitrogen balance in the body that puts it in an anabolic (muscle building) state and keeps it out of a catabolic (muscle breaking) state.  If you have links to these studies, I would like you to supply them.  Nutrition, and especially nutrition for athletes, is something that interests me greatly. btw, while Brendan Brazier is a great athlete (and filthy rich from selling his overpriced VEGA), he is not by any means someone to look at for serious muscle building.  Mike Mahler (vegan) should be the role model for just about any veg*n looking to get big and strong.", 9817, "8vpRamKOaa", 0],
