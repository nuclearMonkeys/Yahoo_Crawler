Orthodox Christian three hand signs are different than Buddhist mudras. Ecumenism = 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Orthodoxy = the only true faith; Roman Catholics tried one cup - one spoon ritual and got sick with Bubonic plague; if heresy enters Orthodox monastery then monks/nuns will get sick with flu/tuberculosis (for instance); Orthodox churches who closed for COVID or had disposable cups/spoons or dipped spoon into alcohol are no longer brides of Christ (now they serve Satan and honor Satan's new COVID religion). Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good. SSN is written as a barcode/QRcode; then it's put into a chip; chip is put into vaccine; chipped people are influenced (by super computers) to receive grey plastic card World Passport with no name on it (but when they stretch their hands to get it, gov't clerk presses secret button to administer the unforgivable green 666 tattoo by isotope rays). If you reject mark of the beast (by hiding within a 10-15 people group according to saints Gabriel Urgebadze and Seraphim of Sarov), then your direct ancestors go to heaven (according to saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov from Ural). First vaccine shuts off your immune system; second vaccine gives you diseases; third vaccine puts your immune system back and it will start fighting the diseases and will cause death. Saint Paisios from Mount Athos said that the devil wants to deceive the rich with freemasonry, poor with communism, and believers with ecumenism. Elpidios Vagianakis said that there will be seven “mark of the beast” vaccines; reject all of them! Documents are from Satan; burn all the documents that you can find. Electronics will be used to track you. Even old broken unplugged 1970 TV set will show the evil flying antichrist using Tesla's ether. Don't go into UFO to be “healed” by evil demons; demons never do good; always pray the Jesus prayer or to saints who help right away (like saint Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov according to whom if you reject mark of the beast, then your direct ancestors go to heaven); forgive me.", 9809, "None", 0],

After this first congratulations, the 5 players who were on the ice, then skate to the bench to congratulate the players on the bench.  This may mislead you in to thinking that the player is going to the bench to get a rest.  While this may be true, it all depends on how tired the line is and how long they were out on their shift. Hockey players usually have an average on ice shift of anywhere from lowest Average in the NHL right now which is 28 seconds all the way up to Highest average of 66 seconds which is set by Ilya Kovalchuk.  During this time on ice, they are doing combinations of sprinting on skates, turning, checking, and battleing for the puck.  They get very tired, VERY FAST!...even being the professional athletes that they are. So, in conclusion it may seem like they are getting disciplined by the coach by being sent to the bench, but it is actually a reward for the player to have that rest to soak in the goal for a bit and get ready for the next shift so he/she is 100%.
